thank you  mr  chairman   good morn   i   ll be refer to the chart that were circul a short  e ago   on the first page  the top panel graph u s  and euro area three month interbank cash deposit rate as well as rate three month forward and nine month forward   the u s  rate are in red  and those for the euro area are in     the u s  cash three month deposit rate edg lower by a few basi point in the intermeet period   but the three month forward rate fell about    basi point and now trade slight below the current three month cash rate   the three month rate nine month forward fell near   percentag point   all of these rate were influenc by lower equiti price  econom data that came in weaker than the market had hope  and bud expect of lower offici rate at some point  the euro area rate  shown by the   line  exhibit a similar if somewhat less pronounc pattern in recent month   forward rate for the euro area are now at or below cash rate   the market   s fling in earli may with a possibl tighten of polici has evapor  as market particip downgrad their forecast of the econom situat in the euro area and as the euro   s appreci came to be view as do some of the ecb   s work for it   in the bottom panel  japanes short term  rate continu to stay low  and there   s not veri much to say there   u s  treasuri yield move lower in the intermeet period  respond to the same econom and equiti market news that affect u s  forward rate   liquid in the u s  treasuri market has been good  as is the case general in the mortgag back and swap market   but one segment that has fray a bit is the corpor sector  which is cover on page     the top panel on page   show   with the dark bar   week issuanc of invest grade corpor debt for the year to date   march and earli spring were activ  as mani corpor term out commerci paper into longer term liabil  issuanc subsequ turn down and in the most recent week has slow to a t l   perhap there are season effect  though that is onli part of the stori   as depict by the red line  issuanc held up dure this period in      with the except of the juli   week  which is alway a week when there   s littl or no activ   on the demand side  investor who have taken loss in their portfolio in recent month have been reluct to expand the amount of credit risk in their hold   and on the suppli side  compani appear to be a bit more restrain about rais fund in the current atmospher   the middl panel depict the spread over treasuri of invest grade debt sinc april     this is a lehman brother index  which indic a spread that was hover most between     and     basi point for much of the spring   that was an alreadi elev spread  but perhap understand given the account and corpor govern issu that investor have had to factor into their price   from  late june until earli august  spread widen anoth    basi point  to more than    materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix           basi point   liquid in the corpor sector decreas dure this period  with dealer widen out spread and reduc the amount for which a quot would be good down to about    million in mani case   this has made it veri difficult for investor to transfer larger posit   while telecom name have been problemat for some  e  new sector have becom taint   energi trade and power compani are one exampl   and in the past few week  the bond of the auto compani have also been repric downward  repres of that  i   ve shown in the bottom left panel the spread over treasuri of ford motor credit and gmac bond sinc juli      the spread for both have widen sharpli in the two week  particular for ford  which was hit by rumor of a possibl downgrad   the    percent bond of      widen from     to     basi point  and other ford bond rose to as high as     basi point over treasuri in the past few trade day   the bottom right hand panel depict the bid ask spread  express in basi point  for the same two bond shown at left   this spread in a normal environ might be   or   basi point   by late juli it had alreadi widen out to   basi point for gmac and    basi point for ford motor credit   the spread then balloon to    and    basi point  respect  in the first seven or eight trade session in august   as the equiti market declin and fix incom market turn volatil  the price of insur express by impli volatil rose   the top panel on page   graph the impli volatil on the s p     equiti index  which had been rise steadili sinc late may but spike higher in juli and peak at about    percent in late juli and again in earli august   this is slight higher than the peak reach in      and higher than the peak in septemb      after the terrorist attack   the middl panel show the volatil index for short and intermedi swaption   these are impli volatil on option that give the holder the right but not the oblig to exercis and roll into an interest rate swap   these instrument are use extens in hedg oper  especi by mortgag investor   both index have hit veri high level recent   the short term swaption index has near doubl to almost    percent   by way of comparison  that index peak at about    percent in      and at    percent in the aftermath of septemb      the intermedi term index is also at elev level and is current near level observ in octob        in contrast  impli volatil on currenc option rose in late june but quick began to trend lower again   none of the three major currenc pair is now near the peak level observ in either      or        part of the reason currenc volatil have been restrain is perhap that specul posit appear to be relat small  henc there is less demand by that segment for hedg purpos   it may also reflect the market   s lack of convict about the futur cours of volatil in exchang rate  as the major economi are expect to move broad in sync   turn to page    the top panel graph the dollar   s exchang rate against the euro  the yen  the swiss franc  the canadian dollar  and the australian dollar re index to april     the dollar had been fall against all major currenc through mid june  and it continu to depreci against the euro  the yen  and the swiss   ranc   but the u s  dollar actual began to appreci against the australian and canadian dollar  as investor came to view a slowdown in the unit state as advers for major commod currenc   more recent  the reassess of growth prospect in europ has result at least in a paus in the dollar   s trend to the downsid against other currenc   the reduc growth prospect oversea can also be seen in equiti market   the middl panel depict chang in the s p     and major global equiti index sinc april     all major index are lower  though those for franc and germani  with heavi represent of telecom and media firm  have perform wors than the other   final  in the bottom panel is the spread on ten year minus two year govern yield for the unit state  canada  japan  the unit kingdom  and germani   as growth expect have come down  the curv have steepen  primarili by virtu of the two year note declin fa  than the ten year note in each of these countri   the except  of cours  is japan  where yield at the short end can   t go ani lower than they are now   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper for the system account in this period  and i will need a vote to ratifi our domest oper   i would be happi to take ani question  thank you
refresh my memori   what was it that occur on august   that abrupt open the bid ask spread on ford motor credit compani and gmac debt   obvious  as shown in the graph  the spread was flat prior to that  e  and then it sudden bounc
i don   t know that there was ani singl event   there were rumor at about that  e that ford motor might be downgrad   sinc then those rumor have taken on even more steam
but general motor did not have the same problem  as i recal
yes  i agre with that   again  what seem to be involv was a liquid shift and not realli a singl event   now  corpor govern and account stori were circul  but these compani were not tie to those   i think that   s one of the more interest aspect about these bond   the issuer are not in industri that have been taint by those problem  which   point to some interest question    hairman  span   what would happen if you were to choos a number of other similar situat so call    untaint    compani   well  today nobodi is untaint  unfortun   would you get the same sort of pattern   what is veri interest about this is that the widen in the spread start on the first of the month   while i vagu recal that that   s not the same period in which bbb and high yield bond realli began to take off against treasuri  it   s not that far off  is it
this is a veri short period  it   s onli about two week   again  these spread had alreadi begun to rise earlier   they were then stabl for a few day and subsequ began rise again   if i could approach your question in a slight differ way   i think if we look at a number of compani  the pattern in their spread might depend in part not onli on perceiv creditworthi but on how much debt they have outstand   ford motor credit is  i believ  the largest issuer in the bond market   it   s a veri  veri larg issuer  and of cours  gmac is as well   a year or two ago investor want to hold these jumbo issu   they were consid desir becaus investor perceiv them as have a lot of liquid   now  we know what has happen to some of the jumbo issu like those of worldcom   sudden  investor don   t want to have these big posit on their book   they actual prefer to have debt of issuer that don   t come to market that much  which will help to diversifi their portfolio   so to some degre a firm   s have lot of paper out there was perceiv to be an advantag from the investor   s perspect two year ago  and it is not view as advantag today
so it   s not the corpor  it   s the investor   it   s the demand not the suppli  so to speak
well  it   s a mix   to some extent it may be that investor have some question about the auto compani specif   they   re sell a lot of car   auto sale have   een strong   and yet they don   t seem to be make ani money   so there may be a repric of their creditworthi as well
they need the debt  but the debt servic capabl is not there
what   ge capit look like in that regard
i don   t have the exact number in mind  but if i rememb correct  they haven   t had quit this kind of deleteri perform
mr  chairman  one way to look at it would be the credit default swap spread for ge capit   this is for five year protect against default   which is    basi point versus     for gmac and     for ford motor credit   it did rise  howev  about    basi point over the intermeet period   but in comparison  the ford motor credit spread rose     basi point over that period
yes   what i find interest about the profitless sale argument is that the market knew that juli was go to be a realli big month for auto sale  inde  they caught on to it veri earli  and the es  in the marketplac didn   t chang much throughout the month   yet there is no evid of this move until the end of that month   so  the system  sn   t squar in a number of respect
mr  chairman  one other aspect that was talk about at that  e was the financi strength of the parent   there were a number of stori about gm particular and the unfund pension liabil associ with the declin in equiti price   so it   s also possibl that that could have affect investor sen ent toward those compani  independ of what they sell    hairman  span   that   s true  a pension fund problem would clear be reflect in these type of number   vice chair
mr  chairman  i think anoth factor that increas has crept into the market  and for some reason it seem to have increas a lot on or about august    is the risk avers on the part of marketmak   one can see it in the bid ask spread and investor    willing to hold in portfolio amount that would have been consid quit manag a year ago   one can see it in the intern market and the domest market   market particip are just run scare  and when they   re run scare  they tend to manag much lower posit  and we get much greater volatil in market
yes  i think that   s clear what the data show   but that   s like take somebodi   s temperatur and then say it   s high   it  sn   t tell us whi it   s high
well  i think one is look for a ration explan of fear  and fear is not entir ration
well  that   s a good point   but some   regrett  it tend to be
i think they have reason to be frighten  but they   re a littl more frighten than one would wish they were
incident  i   ve been impress with the tight of the australian and canadian dollar for the obvious reason of the natur of their intern posit   but that relationship look peculiar tight over the intermeet period   has it  alway been that tight go back
broad  they do tend to move togeth  but we can have period when the correl is fair low   it seem that at  e   such as now  when the percept about the   utlook for the economi is chang   they tend to move togeth   at other  e  they   ll move on local factor and not as much on intern one
the composit of their intern trade good is realli quit similar   they are veri heavi in wheat  miner  and metal
i think the answer to your question is    yes  often      but at  e the correl will break down
further question for dino
i have a question   can you comment just a littl on what you see happen in the commerci paper market at this  e
well  the amount of outstand commerci paper have come down   i would note two develop in particular in that market   one is that commerci paper for a long  e was a veri low cost way of rais money   but have seen the commerci paper market shut down to so mani issuer  other corpor now are think twice about how to structur their liabil   they   re be a littl more cautious about how much they want to reli on commerci paper   there is also an interest effect between commerci paper backup line and credit default swap   that is  a firm want to issu commerci paper and need to have backup line of credit   the firm get these cheap backup line  and the peopl who provid the backup line then run out and hedg through the credit default swap   we then have this effect that vinc mention that the credit default swap rate go up and that make it appear as if the market has less confid in the creditworthi of those specif issuer   it has this unintend consequ for the issuer   and i think peopl are final begin to figur that out   to some degre i think issuer are have some second thought about how much paper   hey want to issu  given that there   s this avenu through which other peopl might view them as be less creditworthi
also  governor bie  juli was the first month in which commerci paper outstand increas this year   one import reason was that there have been larg inflow to money market mutual fund and the fund manag had to invest those dollar somewher   so probabl on the margin that made commerci paper a littl more attract
but didn   t the turnaround occur in nonfinanci commerci paper
yes  juli was the first month increas in nonfinanci commerci paper this year
i move approv of the domest oper
without object   thank you  veri much   we   ll now go to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   i suspect that the typic reader of the recent busi press would find the outlook describ in the august  book surpris bright   after all  the drumbeat of negat news dure the last few week has been near unrel  with news of corpor account scandal  somber warn about futur earn  stock price that have been head more south than north  negat result on hire and especi hour in juli  sour report from various associ of purchas manag around the countri  a dishearten read on consum sen ent  and the spectacl of the nation   s top ceo and cfos have to swear that they are tell the truth in the document they submit to the secur and exchang commiss   one of the few upbeat counterpoint has been the persist strength of consum spend  most strike for new motor vehicl but also  accord to this morn   s advanc report  for other good as well   but the  brisk pace of traffic in auto showroom hasn   t dissuad mani observ from focus on the possibl of a second bout of contract   in that context  how do we explain a project featur     percent growth in real gdp on averag this quarter and next  with the unemploy rate edg up onli a littl and privat  sector payrol start to show some life   unfortun  of cours  it is all too possibl that the pundit have it right   but i want to begin by outlin a few of the reason whi  base on the inform current in hand  we think the more like path forward involv continu recoveri  even if at a sluggish pace by histor standard   first  by far the bulk of the earlier   nventori problem now seem to have been work off   there are still a few entri on the    watch    list   most notabl communic equip   but for most good  inventori hold are in much better align with sale  and if anyth  even a bit lean   while the  e of the lift from inventori invest is high uncertain  we are reason confid that the lift will come and probabl not too long from now  second  monetari polici remain accommod   measur in real term  the fund rate is in the neighborhood of zero  a veri low level by histor standard   if you prefer to measur the stanc of polici in term of the deviat of r from r   you could take comfort in the fact that the actual real fund rate still appear to be well below the equilibrium rate  even if by a somewhat smaller margin accord to our latest es    and one import lesson of the recent experi is that the polici channel are work fine   low prevail market rate allow the automak to offer the cut rate financ deal that attract so mani custom  and histor low mortgag rate have help sustain residenti invest in the face of steepli declin wealth and uncertain prospect for the labor market   on the fiscal polici side  the margin rate cut implement at the begin of this year still should be feed through into household spend   and we continu to believ that busi will be encourag by the temporari partial expens provis to boost their spend on new equip and softwar   part of the impetus from the feder level will be offset on the state and local side  but the govern sector as a whole should be a net plus for the growth of gdp   at the margin  the downturn in the dollar dure the last few month will also be a plus   especi in comparison with the run up dure the preced two year   taken togeth  these factor are enough to support sustain growth in gdp in our baselin project   we had project that consum would not flag in their actual spend   even if they continu to share their apprehens with the univers of michigan and the confer board   and this morn   s retail sale report provid reassur evid on that point   and in the busi sector  while we have becom much gloomier about the outlook for nonresidenti structur  we still see spend on equip and softwar as be on a slow but steadi path to recoveri   we also updat our view about a number of import paramet on the suppli side of the economi   first  the annual revis to the nation incom and product account told us that the averag pace of growth dure the last few year was sever tenth lower than previous es    from this inform  we infer that the pace of structur product growth probabl had been slower   and like would remain slower   than we had previous es   so we revis down our es  of the rate of growth of potenti gdp   but with the slower rate of growth of structur product  we were left with an incipi puzzl   the favor inflat perform of the last few year stood essenti as befor  but now it appear that structur product growth was a less power explan   to fill the gap  we mark down our assumpt for the nairu  from    percent to   percent  therebi   ener enough addit labor market slack to make the inflat pictur fit togeth   over the intermeet period  the volatil in the stock market left major index down substanti on net   two item in this regard are worth note   first  if the long term earn growth project of the equiti analyst are to be given ani credenc   and that is a mighti big    if      then a real possibl has emerg that stock are current undervalu   this point to one of the upsid risk that we highlight in the altern simul section of the  book   second  perhap on cue from our altern simul section  stock price have rebound some  sinc we put the  book to bed last week   if we had had the foresight to anticip that mini recoveri  we wouldn   t have alter our project for the remaind of this year materi but would have shown anoth tenth or two of growth next year   all in all  we see the incom inform as tell us that the economi is move along a growth track that is slower than previous project but move forward nonetheless and with a slight wider gap in resourc util   in that context  the prospect for futur inflat remain extrem favor   in the near term  the greater margin of slack and it implic of even less inflationari pressur are essenti offset by the reduc contribut from structur product growth and by the acceler we anticip in import price   although the net effect of these factor is essenti nil in       if we had shown you a project this  e around for       as we will in the next  book  you would have seen core pce inflat edg down anoth tenth or two from it alreadi veri low level   have highlight the upsid risk from the possibl undervalu of the stock  market  let me close by underscor the possibl of a shortfal in aggreg demand   as you know from read the  book  one of the downsid risk we featur was a further disappoint in busi spend for equip and softwar   in particular  we simul the effect for the rest of the economi of assum that outlay for e s are flat for the remaind of this year and increas onli half as fast next year as in our baselin project   accord to our model  the probabl of an invest surpris of this magnitud is in the neighborhood of    to    percent   in the simul we report in the  book  the fund rate was assum to be held fix in nomin term  and in that case  the output gap was es  to widen by near   percentag point relat to the baselin   howev  a policymak follow an aggress version of the taylor rule could limit the increas in the gdp gap to a littl more than    percentag point by move the fund rate down by about   percentag point by the fourth quarter of next year   a second downsid possibl we examin is that household adopt the same  type of caution that seem to have character recent busi behavior and so push up the person save rate   percentag point higher than in our baselin   the model suggest that the probabl of such a larg ongo shift in the person save rate  quarter after quarter  is veri remot   but one can altern view this shock as a   tand in for the full rang of shock on the demand side of the model  and under that interpret  a shortfal of this magnitud has about a    percent probabl of occur  accord to our model   in the result that we show in the  book  the gdp gap finish      about    percentag point wider than in the baselin  howev  a policymak whose behavior is describ by an aggress taylor rule onc again can limit the damag  in this case hold the increas in the gdp gap to about   percentag point by drop the fund rate about   percentag point by the first half of next year      son will now continu our present
as we tri to convey in the  book  the staff outlook for the global economi over the remaind of this year and next is a bit weaker than last  e and less certain   the factor behind this chang in tone with respect to global prospect can be group into three categori      recent develop that are broad global in natur  in particular global financi market develop      consequ for key foreign economi of the downward revis to our forecast for u s  real growth  and     develop that essenti are extern to the u s  economi and are be driven by econom and polit shock abroad   the sharp declin and heighten volatil in equiti price over the intermeet period was a common featur across most global stock market   european equiti price were particular hard hit   as in the unit state  the effect of the result loss of wealth on total spend are partial offset by the declin that have occur in mani long term interest rate   but long rate in the other major industri countri general move down less than did those in u s  market   although foreign stock market seem to take their cue primarili from movement in u s  market  issu of corpor govern and account accuraci have also arisen with respect to some larg foreign firm   and a general reduct in the willing on the part of investor to bear risk seem to be widespread   certain sector  such as european insur firm  have been particular penal in the current market environ   we expect that these less favor financi condit will weigh on confid and spend abroad   inde  we have some earli read on confid that indic such a reaction   negat wealth effect are to be expect particular in the unit kingdom and canada  where our research tell us that consum are quit sensit to wealth chang   the contractionari effect of these financi market develop should be cushion  howev  by the absenc of monetari tighten on the part of most major foreign central bank in the near term   although in june we had incorpor such tighten into the forecast  we share the view current reflect in short term interest rate futur that monetari polici will remain general accommod into next year in the major foreign industri countri   as we note in the  book  sever of the region that evidenc strength in the first half of the year  in some case more than we were expect  depend for that strength on their export sector   this was the case in japan  in emerg asia  and to some extent in europ   for japan and emerg asia  a signific part of the rebound in export was in the high tech sector   continu recoveri in that sector   epend broad on global develop   but a key risk to ongo expans in these export depend economi is a negat surpris in u s  output growth   the downward revis made to the outlook for the u s  economi fed direct into our less op ist outlook for canada and mexico   canada has been someth of an outlier among the industri countri dure the first half of this year  record rapid output growth in both quarter and strength in final domest demand   in respons  the bank of canada has rais it polici rate a total of    basi point sinc april   we expect canadian growth to slow to a more sustain rate  and we have edg project growth down a bit more to reflect the somewhat weaker path for u s  real gdp this  e than in the june  book   similar  we are look for recoveri to becom establish in mexico  the one bright spot in our outlook for latin america   howev  we have shade our project for mexico in light of the less favor u s  project   final  a seri of develop in the past sever week in a few foreign countri  import sever in south america  have cast signific gloom over the foreign outlook   to some degre  problem in these countri have interact to reinforc the negat effect be felt in each and to rais the risk of a serious collaps in econom activ and stabil in the region   becaus of the size of it economi and the extent of it particip in global financi market  brazil is arguabl the most import of the potenti crise brew in south america   the proxim caus of brazil   s current financi distress is concern on the part of investor  both domest and foreign  about the futur cours of econom polici in brazil as a result of the elect to be held in octob   the current govern has general follow polici sinc the januari      crisi that have met with market approv   but there is noth that this govern can do to ensur the continu of such polici   and statement alon by the candid have not been reassur to market  especi in light of the long stand differ in polit posit and sourc of support of the three princip candid   spread on brazilian dollar denomin debt rose from       basi point to around       basi point over less than two week  as polit news sway market   report circul that  intern bank were withdraw trade credit and similar short term line   after the  book was final  the imf announc an extens and enlarg of brazil   s exist imf program that will total about     billion   one import featur of this new program is that onli    billion is to be disburs this year  with the remaind slate for       after the new govern is in place   thus the program should creat strong incent for the new govern  regardless of who win  to follow polici consist with the program in order to obtain those fund   market particip now understand that those incent are in place and that  becaus of the imf commit  the brazilian govern could have suffici resourc to manag it sovereign debt in          o be success the program has to result in lower spread and improv exchang rate stabil for brazil follow the elect and perhap much sooner   to help in that regard  the program give brazilian offici more scope to use their exist reserv to provid liquid to bond market and to interven in the foreign exchang market   although the program is larg and design to reassur market  it is someth of a gambl   enough capit need to remain in brazil for the privat economi to function reason between now and the elect   after the elect  market compat polici need to be follow   either becaus of the incent creat by the imf program or becaus  onc elect  the new presid will have to weigh elect rhetor against the cold light of realiti in make his choic  follow the announc  spread first narrow sharpli and the real appreci   howev  investor enthusiasm for the loan packag is alreadi wane   the real has subsequ more than revers it post announc gain  despit intervent support for the currenc  and spread have back up to more than       basi point   the  book baselin forecast is for brazil to weather this storm   output is expect to stagnat dure the rest of this year  as turbul financi condit an   heighten uncertainti disrupt econom activ   but low growth is project to resum next year as financi condit improv   howev  the risk that financi condit will instead deterior further and forc some kind of debt standstil and or capit control befor the elect even take place is certain present   in that situat  the incent for the new govern  onc elect  to follow market compat polici would be great reduc   if that is the cours follow by brazil  the pressur on other south american countri and their financi system will intensifi and prospect for even low growth of econom activ in the region will be sharpli reduc   that conclud our report   we   d be happi to take ani question
i   ve been mean to ask you this recent   i notic that the export data on high tech equip from singapor  taiwan  and other east asian countri tend to be quit current   i alway have the impress that i somehow seem to be get insight into the american high tech order pattern in advanc from those data   is that an illus  or is there someth systemat in that relationship
well  first of all  they are industri data   there is a good apparatus for monitor develop that is general industri base
especi in singapor    s   son   yes   in those economi  high tech export are such a larg part of what is go on that it is a focus   so i think in some sens  yes  it might be an earli reflect of the order of their princip purchas  the unit state
what i   m tri to get at is that we order  for exampl  from  singapor   but it seem to me that befor data are avail on our order  export come out of singapor are report   i don   t know whether that   s factual accur though
i think it is close
actual we now get fair  e data that we purchas from the semiconductor industri on global product  which i think are probabl as  e as the export data   but there   s a veri high degre of correl becaus of the global integr of this industri across all these data sourc   i think in some sens we   ve seen that show up fair reliabl in the export data and on the import side as well  and in the global product data that we   re use to construct industri product
i had a question for   on the veri larg drop in the workweek in juli   in the  book you said that you expect that to be revers   we look at the histor data and over the last fifteen year there has onli been one  e that we   ve seen a drop this signific where it wasn   t associ with a strike or bad weather or someth of that sort   so i   m just wonder if you had ani further insight on that from your deep background contact at  bls   or was it just a question of probabl that you   re expect this revers
it   s a risk   we brought the workweek back from      to      hour in our assumpt for august and septemb part on the judgment that this year juli   fell on a thursday so it was particular easi for employ to grant a four day weekend   that   s relev   or those employ who are on a biweek report basi becaus that period would be includ in the  e frame of the report that they submit to the bls   in addit  we saw the week claim data come down over the month   so our guess was  part on the basi of statist consider and what we read as the trajectori of the labor market over the month  that the survey result were not repres of the month as a whole
the bls peopl didn   t have ani further insight into this
i think they concur in the judgment regard juli    and i don   t believ they offer an opinion on the remaind of our logic
in the  book forecast the growth rate has been revis down a full percentag point  rough  for the second half and about     percentag point for next year  it seem to me in look at the  book that a veri larg portion of that chang was a result of the annual revis and the effect of those revis on product and potenti   not much of the chang appear to be due to what i guess was refer to in ye day   s board brief as the    headwind    and some of the negat you   ve been talk about that have affect the economi veri recent   would you agre with that assess  or do i have those  proport differ pars
i have a differ take on it   we took potenti gdp growth down     this year and     next year  and our model simul suggest that that should feed through essenti one for one into the growth of aggreg demand   so the way i   d pars it out is that i   d say about     of the rough   percentag point revis for the second half reflect the adjust to our trend rate of growth of potenti gdp   for next year  i   d attribut a larger   raction of our revis  perhap     of our total revis of      to the adjust to the growth of potenti gdp   in growth rate term  the negat news from the stock market is veri import for this year as are the advers signal that we think we   re get about product in the near term from the labor market report and from the negat purchas manag    survey  we also gave a nod to the advers result from consum sen ent survey  as modul by strong auto sale   so the larger fraction of the revis this year is due to other indic that we think tell us that the gap is go to be widen
mr  chairman  i   d like to compliment   on what i thought was an extrem sensit and unfortun high accur pictur of the danger in brazil   her report was veri well done   aggrav the brazilian situat is the fact that the major intern bank deal there are  as i mention earlier  part of the    run scare    group   the two big spanish bank are veri activ in brazil   they   ve taken sever loss in argentina and are veri concern about what could happen to them in brazil   the major american bank are see their name in the paper in a rather unflatt way and are also quit risk avers   so  unfortun  what seem to have happen in the last few day is that the intern bank communiti is take advantag of the imf packag to reduc their exposur   that in ani long term sens is veri much against their interest and is not veri smart  but that seem to be what they   re do  anoth effect of their conduct  if it continu   which i sincer hope it will not   is  that it will almost certain bring about a much higher likelihood that ani futur imf program will have as a condit preced a quit formal agreement between the countri and it   nternat creditor   the reason that the imf didn   t do so in the case of brazil  i think wise  is that the situat was suffici precari that  if they sat around negoti some sort of    stand still    agreement with brazil   s creditor  the countri certain would have tank   so it was a risk that the fund had to take   but if the intern bank communiti continu to behav as it has in the last few day  i think it will be veri difficult in the futur for the fund to organ a major packag like this and take the risk of the same thing happen   so  in addit to the veri accur pictur that   gave  there is this potenti aggrav factor   thank you
further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to begin the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   on balanc  the general tone of the report on busi condit in the seventh district continu mix   most of our contact are still wait to see the light at the end of the tunnel   howev  for the first  e in a long while  i start to receiv some upbeat report from sever of my regular contact who are director  ceo  or other senior leader of busi with larg nation oper   it   s still too earli to tell whether these reflect a turn point  but i was encourag by the unexpect good news  report on consum spend remain mix both within the district and at the nation level   discount chain still appear to be do all right   howev  a larg develop and oper of retail mall said that traffic slow in june and weaken further in juli and earli august  air travel had been trend back toward pre septemb    level but has flatten out sinc june   for manufactur  our region purchas manag    index in chicago  detroit  and milwauke present a pictur of anem growth in the district   but the motor vehicl sector is relat strong   the return of zero percent financ program has boost sale  and we   ve   eard that light vehicl product plan for the third and fourth quarter are like to be rais again   heavi duti truck product and shipment will be strong through octob but are expect to drop off mark after that  as the new epa regul on engin take effect  some of the posit news that i heard was from our contact in the railroad and packag industri who indic that ship volum were up in june and juli   truck contact also were upbeat  but this may reflect the shakeout of excess truck capac dure the last year instead of a pickup in overal demand  turn to capit spend  we still are not hear ani report of plan to increas outlay   we ask our director and our beig book contact whether the recent special tax depreci allow had affect capit spend decis  and onli a veri few indic that they had move up the  e of some invest   of cours  it   s still earli  and there was a sens that spend might pick up closer to the  e when the provis are set to expir  the vast major of our contact continu to say that they have littl price power  there were  howev  a few report of price increas   for exampl  in steel  plastic resin  and tuition cost   within the district  employ remain reluct to take on new perman hire  at the nation level  manpow   s latest survey  which will be public releas on august     show hire plan for the fourth quarter remain at the improv third quarter level   our manpow contact also said that he did not think that the declin in temporari employ in the juli payrol number was indic of condit in the help suppli industri  which he continu to view as be better than in previous recoveri   our kelli servic contact was less op ist  turn to the nation outlook  we appear to have hit quit a rough patch in the recoveri  the incom data have been disappoint though not uniform so   we must make a judgment   n whether the economi is current experienc a temporari slowdown in activ  a prolong period of subpar growth that is be generat by special circumst in this expans  or the begin of anoth downturn   in do so we must think about the consequ of the latest shock to the financi sector  the recent revel suggest that failur in corpor govern extend beyond a hand of black sheep firm   these revel have ad a great deal of skittish to an alreadi uncertain busi climat   they also have broaden the percept that dure the late     s market had been overes  the return and underes  the risk associ with mani invest project   so  what is the fallout of this on econom activ   one impact may be the recent disappoint read on order  inde  when i combin all of this with what i   m hear from my contact i   m concern that we may be in for further weak in busi spend  there are negat for the household sector as well   confid is down  and the drop in equiti price sinc our may meet has made a substanti dent in household    balanc sheet   howev  the strong respons to the latest set of auto incent remind us not to give up on the consum   furthermor  even after the nipa revis  the under trend in product still appear to be posit   this suggest that some of the recent disappoint news regard real activ reflect transitori movement in volatil data as oppos to a more persist weaken in activ   and we have to remind ourselv that  given the typic lag  we are now enter the period when last fall   s rate cut should have their strongest effect  so balanc these factor we  too  have mark down our forecast for growth  but our  best guess is that the soft we   re current see will not cascad further either into an actual doubl dip or a prolong period of growth well below potenti   similar to the  book  we now are think that real gdp growth will averag closer to   percent in      and     percent   n       down from the project rate of    percent for both year in our previous forecast   this outlook is condit on our prolong a period of accommod monetari polici   so  i think maintain our current stanc is appropri   but it will be import for us to acknowledg in our statement the current rough patch in the expans

provid incom at level to support some growth in consum  spend despit the adjust take place there   and it   s hard to see ani big kick from govern spend over the period ahead  as grow pressur on revenu and spend at  the state and local level are offset some of the feder spend that we   re get  all thing consid  i share the  book   s view that the most like path over the near term is slow  unexcept  growth that onli gradual move back toward potenti next   ear   while it is easi to get impati  as mani peopl are now do  it   s import as we move into the polici discuss later to remind

econom growth appear to be slow right now  whether we look at it region  nation  or intern   the latest data from the eleventh district point to widespread weak across the region and across industri   a modest recoveri appear to be under way  but it lack the econom driver   energi  high tech  and trade   that usual provid boost to econom activ in our region   sluggish growth and continu product gain place the district in pretti much the same posit as the unit state  with a jobless recoveri similar to the one follow the         recess  after lose hour wage and salari job near everi month from april to decemb       texa seem to turn the corner in januari with a solid gain in employ   howev  the advanc of earli this year have slowli evapor  and privat employ level for the second quarter of      have fallen back to those of the fourth quarter of        the three month rate of job loss has been greatest in mine  manufactur  transport  communic  and trade  all of which saw job loss acceler in june   some offset came in govern employ and in servic to consum and busi but not enough to stop the overal declin  whether we look along the border  in the oil patch  at the farm belt  at the high tech electron base economi of austin and dalla  or in the district   s largest economi  houston    e see few encourag sign of strength   our lead indic index for texa has been flat sinc januari and continu to point toward sluggish growth ahead   there is littl reason to expect ani of the key driver of region growth in the     s to return soon   we still have a substanti overhang of region high tech capac  and mexico is yet to pull decis out of recess   and travel reduct and war rumor plus the slow pace of industri recoveri have kept oil and gas reserv relat high   in sum  district econom activ is still weak and is expect to remain so for some  e   we like won   t be help to lead the nation economi into expans   we   ll probabl be follow this  e  as we   ve becom more reliant on the nation for good news  turn to the nation  i find it difficult to be sure that a solid recoveri has taken hold when so much of the growth we thought we had achiev vanish with the gdp revis  moreov  as in the eleventh district economi  the driver for growth in the nation economi appear to have weaken as well   the recent recess was mark by two distinct element  a dramat declin in invest with a hard hit high tech sector yet consum who kept on spend   recent data suggest that invest has hit bottom and has begun to rebound   but this rebound can   t continu apart from consum uptak of the product firm are offer   in the last expans  my sens is that firm got a littl ahead of consum in term of their vision for the futur   firm were abl to offer ton of new and better product  from fa  comput to videophon  at a rate beyond what consum could absorb   so they inevit had to pull back  and investor    cash got burn   with such a recent experi  i don   t expect invest to return to anywher near the level of the late     s   nor should it   consum spend is not as strong as it was in the mid to late     s  and it is not like to return to that pace in view of a more cautious consum   stock market declin  extrem volatil financi market  recent   ccount scandal  and corpor ethic problem plus continu concern over war and terror have made consum more retic  and that is like to continu for some  e  i   d also feel better about the nation economi if i saw a brighter intern one   but i don   t   across europ the pace of recoveri seem to have slow in recent month   argentina is stuck in a crisi   brazil may be head for a doubl dip recess or wors   and the strength of mexico   s recoveri is in question as is the condit of most latin american economi   the economi of japan and taiwan have stabil but remain sluggish   about the onli robust economi intern are those of china and korea  overal  come back to my open statement  growth appear to be slow now and for the forese futur almost no matter where we look   the current slow expans need someth new to drive it forward   and the risk have clear shift downward toward econom weak

cool off in   oreign market and economi  the data have been downbeat on the state of the real economi  but the     pound gorilla is clear the volatil and negat direct of u s  capit and equiti market   reflect the data and the overhang of market sen ent  the  book author have written down their forecast  and we have  too  in boston   sinc we both use mani of the same framework  it   s not surpris that our forecast for      and      look veri similar  with below potenti growth for much of the period   but we show somewhat lower inflat and higher unemploy in      than   the  book  more import than a particular forecast  howev  is where the risk are and whether we are adequ pois to address them   it   s hard to see how the consum can continu to be the mainstay of econom growth without better news on the job front   and without that  i think the confid indic are tell us that spend on residenti invest will slow   busi seem so preoccupi with market volatil and cost cut in order to maintain some profit margin that new hire and new invest seem further off in  e   and as we   ve seen  if the u s  economi   not bounc back  foreign economi won   t either   real econom data no longer seem at varianc with the market   togeth they both paint a darker pictur of the futur   so i see the risk larg on the downsid to a forecast that  given usual post recess pattern  is pretti downbeat alreadi   is monetari polici pois to address a slowli grow economi with downsid risk   i wonder   until recent i thought the current histor low level of the feder fund rate was more than accommod and not consist with price stabil over  e   i thought that our next move had to be up as condit in labor and other resourc market began to tighten   now  howev  the financi market headwind of equiti downturn and widen credit market spread combin with the sens that the real economi has stall call into question how accommod polici is   the bluebook assess of   quilibrium rate seem to indic that current real rate are less accommod than earlier  the perfect foresight model indic that further reduct in rate would be consist with maintain and even lower inflat over the next coupl of year   now  model need to be taken with a grain of salt   but the direct of this analysi and what we   re see in the economi and the market seem to me to point to the possibl that further polici support  a bit of insur perhap  might spur growth without inflat risk   when and how to eas polici further and what to say about it   even if we don   t do it right away   without caus further market uncertainti are obvious question
thank you   presid santomero
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data point to continu moder recoveri in econom activ in the third district  but the pace has slow from  earlier this year   retail sale in the region were main flat in juli but were up from year ago level in most product line   local auto dealer report that the new round of incent  support increas sale in juli   mani of the area retail we contact did express some concern that the recent turmoil in financi market and lower consum confid could lead to a pullback in consum spend   as a result  retail have becom a bit more cautious in place order for good   region real estat market are consist with nation trend  residenti market remain strong while commerci market remain weak   residenti construct contract  hous permit  and home sale have all been increas this year compar with the same period last year   hous market have shown somewhat more strength in our region than in the nation as a whole   in the first quarter  hous price appreci was abov the nation averag in new jersey and about at the nation averag in pennsylvania and delawar   in contrast  commerci real estat market remain soft   offic vacanc rate are   round    or    percent in the citi of philadelphia and even higher in the suburban market where construct of some new offic space has been complet   new build come on line in the first quarter were onli half leas  labor market in the district remain stabl   employ in our region increas slight in june for the first  e in eighteen month   the unemploy rate in delawar  new jersey  and pennsylvania remain below that of the nation   the tri state unemploy rate stood at     percent in the second quarter compar with     percent for the nation   activ in the region   s manufactur sector is mix   in juli our busi outlook survey index of general activ post it seventh posit read in a row   although manufactur activ in the region expand in juli  it did so at a slower pace than earlier this year   base on our august survey  which will be releas this thursday  that trend continu in august   the new data suggest some contract in region manufactur this month  the august number is minus       to me this is not good news   howev  i caution you that it is onli a singl month and that recoveri are not alway linear  inflat remain modest in the region   wage and hous price are rise at a somewhat fa  pace in the philadelphia region than in the nation  but industri price are most hold steadi   the sluggish of the recoveri has taken it toll on the budget of the three state in our district   all three cut spend to below plan dure the fiscal year end june           pennsylvania and new jersey have also use their raini day fund to replac a larg portion of the revenu shortfal   the increas in new jersey   s fiscal year      budget over it      budget is base upon veri op ist assumpt about incom and sale tax revenu   becaus state revenu growth general lag the end of a recess  state fiscal problem are expect to continu at least through fiscal year         evertheless  the incom data suggest that the third district has continu to experi a gradual recoveri   it is more gradual than i would like  but perhap i should be content   in the past our district has felt recess more deepli than the nation and has lag the nation in it recoveri   this  e we have kept pace  turn to the nation outlook  incom data on the nation economi have been weaker than expect   this is undeni   and the stock market retreat is like to further damp both busi invest and consum expenditur   as a result  my outlook for the economi has been temper from my earlier view  which was not over op ist   nevertheless  in my view the data taken as a whole continu to tell us that a moder recoveri is under way  albeit a more gradual one than we would like   consequ  monetari polici will probabl have to remain accommod for longer than we had previous thought   howev  we should keep in mind that the weak second quarter gdp growth reflect a surpris surg in import rather than unexpect weak domest demand   inventori decumul slow substanti in the first quarter  and inventori were essenti unchang in the second quarter   in addit  we saw a moder increas in busi invest in equip and softwar in the second quarter  labor market have stabil  although they have not yet bounc back   all this is consist with a recoveri  go forward  the recent declin in the stock market  if sustain  will temper consum spend and busi invest   but it is still too soon to know by how much and  for that matter  the market   s futur cours   in my opinion the sluggish in labor market is potenti a larger downsid risk to consum spend than the stock market declin   could the recoveri derail   yes   but by and larg the weaker econom data we have seen pertain to a singl month   we should rememb that recoveri usual proceed in fit and start and that our   ata are subject to revis   for exampl  the data avail to the committe in octob      show that econom growth was weaken   gdp growth had come in at     percent in the first quarter and     percent in the second   employ report had fallen in three of the four previous month for a cumul loss of        job   but subsequ data revis show that gdp growth was     percent for the first half of      and that employ  in fact  grew by         job for the four month period between june and septemb of that year  in short  i don   t think we have suffici evid today to make a case that the recoveri has stall   respond at this point would appear to be an overreact   such fine tune is danger in my opinion   we are just as like to generat instabl as we are to improv econom outcom   at a  e like this  when there is increas uncertainti in the market  it is tempt to respond   howev  we must keep in mind that the monetari polici we alreadi have in place is quit accommod   it seem prudent to stay the cours and keep watch the data  should the data suggest that the econom recoveri is falter  then we should take decis action   nevertheless  i would have to say that  in my view  the risk have tilt toward weaker  econom activ in the short term and a key question is whether we should say so   i think some recognit of the weak of econom condit is probabl in order  but that is not necessarili the same as shift the bias   we all know that such a shift in the statement at this  e is like to be interpret as a signal that we plan to or think it is like that we will cut rate at our next meet in septemb   at this point i   m not convinc that such action will be need in septemb   so  to avoid send the wrong signal  i have a slight prefer for leav the statement unchang at this meet   thank you
presid broaddus    r  broaddus   thank you  mr  chairman   first on the region  our district economi clear lost momentum in recent week   both factori shipment and auto sale were flat in juli after rise signific earlier this year   more broad  our busi contact from the furnitur industri and other princip region industri tell us that demand is weak and henc factori are reduc output and hire   all of this  not surpris  is affect capit spend plan   i probabl had twenti or more peopl in various manufactur compani tell me that whatev littl capit spend is go on now is aim almost entir at increas product rather than enlarg capac   so the manufactur sector  which of cours is a big part of our district economi  clear is show sign of weak  at least for the moment  not all of the news in the region is gloomi  though   hous activ in our district  as elsewher  is still strong pretti much across the board   but busi expect overal in our area are clear more downbeat and pessimist than they were at the  e of the last fomc meet   these expect were sum up rather well  i think  by a comment i heard recent from a guy in the furnitur industri   he said the good news was that a recent survey  they had done show that    percent of american household had definit plan to buy furnitur   the bad news was that they didn   t know when    laughter  turn to the nation economi  the period sinc our june meet was a remark unsettl and  in my view  unsettl period   financi market were obvious nervous and pessimist  and much of the latest econom data   such as the    point drop in the new order compon of the ism index and the declin in week hour in juli   rather dramat confirm the reluct of both busi and household to make futur spend commit   take all of the quantifi negat into account  the staff has revis it forecast for the second half down a full percentag point  to     percent   i think that   s reason   nder the circumst   but the soften in the economi in the project is expect onli to delay the recoveri not to derail it   the problem  of cours   and i know the staff is well awar of this   is that there are current an unusu larg number of signific downsid risk in the outlook that are veri difficult to quantifi and to incorpor in a forecast   those risk includ  for exampl  the possibl of a renew and perhap sharper drop in stock price than we   ve alreadi seen  a war in the middl east  financi collaps in brazil  or anoth terrorist attack in the unit state   there are posit in the pictur   structur product growth still appear to be run abov   percent   the fed has now achiev price stabil  and we have in place  i would argu  a high s ul monetari polici as index by the zero real fund rate   but these posit may be insuffici to shield the recoveri if one of the downsid possibl were actual to materi  broad  the challeng for polici in this situat is that the tentat charact of the current recoveri   and    tentat    is the word i would use to describ it   make it veri vulner to negat shock  especi with the nomin fund rate near the zero bound   sinc we   ve achiev credibl price stabil  i think it   s reason and natur for us to ask whether we might eas polici today to speed the economi up just a bit and reduc that vulner to an unanticip negat shock  last novemb i strong favor a preemptiv polici eas in the situat we face at the  e   but i would not favor such a move today   i think there are signific differ in  the two situat   back in novemb we were still respond to the immedi fallout from septemb      we had seen the fastest increas in the unemploy rate sinc the         recess and a substanti widen in the output gap that threaten a big acceler in  disinfl and  with the proxim to the zero bound  actual pose the risk of deflat   we   aven   t experienc anoth shock like septemb    at this point  and both the unemploy rate and the output gap  at least for now  are relat stabl   again  the real fund rate is alreadi at or near the zero level   our experi with go stop monetari polici in the past   and this goe to a point that toni made a minut ago   teach us that the fed isn   t like to be abl to speed up the recoveri by make the real fund rate negat without sow the seed of futur inflat   we haven   t talk about that much late  but that can happen   too much monetari s ulus could sow the seed of inflat that over  e could destabil the economi   mayb not in the near futur but at some point down the road  i can think of circumst where we might want to eas   if inflat drift down  we obvious should reduc the nomin fund rate to prevent the real fund rate from rise   if the disinfl were sharp enough  i think we should consid reduc the real fund rate below zero temporarili to preempt deflat   and if we experi anoth substanti negat shock that disrupt financi market  then too we should consid make the real rate negat to preempt the widen of the output gap that again would pose a risk of deflat   but we   re not face with ani of these condit yet  as i see it   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m use to speak at these meet after a jolt of caffein for me and for you   the economi certain has been work through a difficult adjust to previous overbuild and overvalu of the capit stock   this type of cycl is high unusu in post world war ii econom experi  and the committe has been uncertain as to how it would play out   i certain saw this uncertainti at recent meet as a bit one side   that is  my suspicion was that the rebound in aggreg demand could be a bit weaker than the modal forecast and consider weaker than the market seem to expect   this   uspicion was balanc against a belief that the current stanc of polici was unsustain accommod over the long run   and that view about short run shortfal and long run accommod produc a balanc risk assess in our statement  in my opinion there were alreadi hint befor the last meet that the process of recoveri might be encount impedi   those indic were larg in financi market where equiti price had declin   risk spread were start to open up  import under the influenc of the uncertainti heighten effect of account irregular   the econom data were better  but there was a question as to whether the uncertainti and doubt manifest in financi market would also show up in spend   the inform becom avail sinc the last meet suggest that in fact they have   that demand is not strengthen as much as expect   busi probabl were alway go to be respond cautious to the good fundament  given their experi with overbuild   but the recent data suggest that they are be even more cautious than we anticip   we can see this in the hire and new order data  which didn   t pick up to the degre expect at the end of the second quarter and the begin of the third   judg from earn forecast  busi have reduc their expect about sale   and i think everi feder reserv bank presid around the tabl today has note that busi peopl in their district are less op ist and are revis down their expect  recent declin in commod price tend to confirm an eas in demand in the industri sector   and as a number of you have point out  financi market condit have tighten in some respect  which could damp the growth of demand go forward   market are reflect this less op ist outlook for sale and are carri the ad burden of work through the uncertainti of how firm will be affect as financi result are restat   this is   ffect not onli saver but also  as dino note  intermediari   they are shi away from make market and take posit   the result rise in risk premium has lower price of share and lower bond rate   market are much more volatil and brittl  reflect uncertainti and the lack of marketmak   inde  the corpor bond market has virtual dri up in the last month or so  bank also are tighten term  and account concern have prompt them to be much more cautious  demand more inform  and enforc coven more close   as a consequ  although the market respons to weaker data has been to take out a good deal of the expect polici tighten  this mark down of intermedi  and longer term rate has not flow through to mani busi borrow   now  household are see lower rate in mortgag  and that is bol  hous price and facilit the unlock of hous equiti  but household wealth level have fallen in recent month  and the greater risk avers is reflect in shift from longer term secur into money   undoubt  skittish market are reinforc busi tendenc toward caution in spend and hire  not onli owe to the advers financ condit but also to concern about conserv cash in case their particular firm is affect by futur volatil in market  this disappoint perform is not onli a u s  phenomenon   foreign industri economi now seem to be on a slower growth track  price in their equiti market have been  mark down  and the percept that they   re face a weaker outlook has kept the dollar from fall   all this impli that the unit state will receiv littl help from the foreign sector in term of boost demand   and    son and bill   have point to the downsid risk in south america    want to emphas that these recent weaker indic do not in my mind undermin the basic expect that the expans will proceed at least at a moder clip   the growth in household and govern spend will bol  increas in demand and incom   by and larg  excess stock of capit inventori have been work down   weak in invest spend has abat  and invest fundament do look good   the earlier pickup in sale has activ the acceler   cash flow is improv  as gain in product and soft in labor market hold down labor cost   and price of high tech capit equip continu to plummet  give an induc to purchas them   but i do have greater concern that it could be some  e befor the rate of expans is fast enough to begin to reduc margin of underutil resourc  inde  such margin could widen befor they begin to narrow   as a consequ  inflat could fall further befor it stabil   a limit shortfal or delay in the econom pickup wouldn   t be much of a concern if we weren   t alreadi at     percent inflat    percent unemploy  and a    percent fund rate   but my thought on the implic for the committe   s postur polici go forward should wait for the next round of our discuss if i   m to practic   at least in my first meet as a governor   what i   ve been preach to the committe over the last fifteen year about separ the two discuss    laughter
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   most  but not all  of the anecdot and read on the district economi have been posit   retail sale and consum spend continu to advanc   that   s true of auto  but it   s also true outsid the auto sector as well  accord to the report we get   spring and summer tourism has been pretti good in most part of the district   the agricultur situat actual has improv   to the extent that there were drought condit in our district  for the most part that has been reliev   the energi sector in   e n north dakota and ea n montana is oper at a relat high rate   the employ situat is mix  with no chang in white collar employ but some improv in hire of product and temporari worker   and while there certain are no broad base sign of inflat  some materi price are report move up  nonresidenti construct activ is slow  and vacanc rate  especi for class b and lower rate build  are high and rise   residenti construct activ and all that surround it  includ sale and permit and so forth  remain veri favor   report  for exampl  home price in the twin citi are up    percent over the past year   meanwhil  though  apart vacanc rate have increas  and i think rent are stabil and perhap even weaken a bit   and at some point the relat price shift will feed back into relat chang in activ   but i think that   s probabl some  e off  let me offer a few thought about the nation economi and outlook   we   ve alreadi talk a lot about that   obvious  i don   t want to dismiss the disappoint natur of the incom aggreg data we   ve seen  the revis  and the weak in equiti valu   but i don   t want to exagger it or overreact to it either   i haven   t chang my forecast of the economi over the next six quarter or so   my forecast was a littl lower than the  book   s as of the last meet  and now we   re closer togeth   we realli don   t know whether the economi is go to grow at a rate of     percent or     percent  just to throw out a coupl of number  over the second half of this year   but it seem to me that the outlook remain basic  satisfactori   as mani peopl have comment alreadi  polici  both fiscal and monetari  seem to be expansionari   i do think that we will see some materi improv in spend on equip and softwar next year  and i believ consum spend will continu to advanc  and as i   ve note befor  when we see the activ we   re see in hous and homebuild   nd peopl   s willing to make fifteen  to thirti year commit  which is inher in most purchas  it seem to me that consum remain relat posit about their circumst and about the outlook   final  histori is on our side in the sens that the economi has proven to be resili in the past and i think it   s prove to be resili again   after all  we   ve had three consecut quarter of growth  albeit modest growth  follow septemb      and if you had told me back in septemb or octob that that was the perform we were go to get  i certain would have been pleasant surpris
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have alreadi note  dure the intermeet period we   ve seen a number of indic  all of which have been a littl weaker than expect   labor market indic  consum confid  manufactur activ  and busi invest all have led forecast to shade down their outlook to one degre or anoth   that has been true of those who have done our  book  and i have no basic quibbl with their baselin forecast   have said that  i think at this meet the most import issu about the economi in some sens is not the forecast per se but rather the risk to the forecast  while the usual etiquett is to leav the answer to that question about the balanc of risk until the end of one   s open statement  i will actual be more transpar and tell you up front that i think the risk to the forecast have shift notabl downward  i say that for two or three reason   first  the incom data as weak as they have been  while not signal a so call doubl dip  obvious do put into question   more so than i at least am comfort with   the basic baselin forecast   second  the market   which should be and most peopl think are more forward look   also suggest that the outlook is less certain now than just a few month ago   investor appear to have serious concern about the continu   eterior in busi condit and subsequ  or consequ  credit condit   this is doubli worrisom becaus obvious a general declin in equiti wealth such as the one we   ve experienc even in the intermeet period will continu to weigh on household and put into question to some degre the ongo strength of consum spend   it is also worrisom becaus the capit requir to financ busi invest depend on hospit financi market   howev  equiti issuanc has been extrem light   the data i have show that in juli  in fact  the net equiti issuanc was negat   in addit  we   ve seen with respect to bond issuanc and bank loan as well that condit are far less accommod than they were even a short  e ago   so the basic build block for invest strike me as much less certain than they were a littl while ago  consequ  on the side of our mission that deal with sustain growth  i think the odd of a larg shortfal have increas   this is summar in the chang level of output gap that at least the board   s staff has es    at the  e of the june  book  the staff thought that an output gap of   percent of potenti gdp growth in      would come down to     percent in      and to     percent in        now the staff es  that the output gap start at     percent in       a slight improv  but unfortun stay stubborn high at     in      and     in        so in term of the sustain growth side of our mission  i would say that the risk are clear that we are move further and further away from achiev sustain growth  the other side of the mission obvious look to the question of inflat   i   d say that the risk of inflat  if anyth  have reced dure the intermeet period   that   s due in part to the limit of price power that a number of you have alreadi refer to plus still strong increas in product growth as well as slack in labor market and capac util  which   ook as though they will linger on longer than we had thought origin   with those develop plus sluggish growth abroad and the associ risk that   has alreadi indic as well as tame commod price  it is hard to see that inflat pressur are like to emerg dure the forecast period   by almost ani measur  inflat expect appear relat unchang  taken togeth  it seem to me that the balanc of risk has move from what i describ at the last meet as uncomfort balanc to at this stage be much more negat   now  this is the part where i will do what governor kohn has plead with us not to do    laughter  from the question of the outlook i   ll touch on what might be thought of as polici   but sinc i believ that the balanc of risk statement has veri littl to do with polici and has everyth to do with the outlook  i will move forth  presid santomero has put on the tabl some concern about have the committe signal that we think that the risk have chang distinct to the downsid   i   d like to recogn in all honest that there are three concern that one might have in make that shift in languag but  if you will let me do this  i will go through them and reject each one of those concern  the first is a concern that we might surpris the market   but inde all the incom survey data that i have seen  includ some from this morn  suggest that almost all govern secur dealer think that we will probabl chang the languag that we use and describ the risk as be tilt toward weak   so i don   t think we would surpris the market if we were to make that chang  the second concern that i think presid santomero rais quit explicit relat to the implic of this chang in languag for real polici  which is the set of the fund rate   a  topic i will not discuss at this point   i would say that i  as do mani of you  get copi of some of   hese veri expens fed watch materi   the one i found most interest was one i read this morn that said  and i quot     inde  the fed has emphas that the econom risk statement should not be interpret as a signal of what will happen at the next meet but rather is more an assess of how it see the futur      if we in fact have emphas that and we believ it to be true  then i wouldn   t let a concern about a misinterpret filter in sinc inde the real mean of that languag is becom much better understood by the public  the third issu is one that presid   allud to alreadi to some degre   and that is  if we should deem it necessari   follow  let   s say  the perfect foresight model in the bluebook or one version of the forward look taylor rule   to reduc rate over  e  then by definit have suggest that there   s some weak in the economi would provid some  explan of whi such a move is need  so i see veri few downsid  but i do see a coupl of upsid to be clearer about our outlook   one of the upsid is that it would reinforc our view of transpar  which i think is obvious help   second  i think it would allow the market to focus more fulli on incom data and not perceiv that we are hamstrung in one way or the other with respect to the futur  so  mr  chairman  i do believ that the risk are main to the downsid   and i think the committe ought to have the courag of it convict and indic that that is the case   thank you
in prepar for the meet today  i survey a number of banker  and in mani respect my find basic are consist with what we   ve heard around the tabl today   consum lend has remain strong   the growth is start to level in nonmortgag consum product  but loan qualiti remain strong   home equiti line continu to grow and   erform well   mortgag lend both for refinanc and purchas are not simpli strong but in some case will continu to set record   on the commerci lend side  the medium and region size bank are report flat loan growth   in fact  almost no loan growth   but steadi loan perform  which suggest that loan qualiti is still good   the most notabl observ came from two ceo of larg commerci bank lender who both report a signific chang in what one might call the tempera of their largest borrow   the result combin of risk avers on the bank   s side and hesit on the borrow   s side is quit consist with what we   ve seen in the commerci paper market and the commerci bond market  with respect to agricultur  there was an acknowledg of the drought around the countri  although some of the area where the drought is the worst are also area where the irrig system are the best   so the farm economi is expect to be fair strong  on balanc  in part becaus yield are high   and the lender say with some chagrin that the agricultur bill also will add price improv on top of the high yield   so the farm sector will be in relat good shape  the other point i want to mention is the fiscal disciplin issu that the congress will face when it come back after labor day   this congress  as we   ve discuss befor  will adjourn without have pass a budget resolut   for onli the second  e in histori and for the first  e sinc        on the hous side they   ve pass a budget  and that is their focal point now as they go through the appropri process   in the senat  the lack of a budget resolut mean that there is no spend disciplin in the senat becaus with a budget resolut there is a requir of sixti vote in order to exceed the budget   so the prospect for legisl of the type that presid hoenig mention is veri much aliv   moreov  the expect is that this congress will adjourn have pass perhap onli half of the thirteen appropri bill requir   nd that the govern will be fund on a continu resolut basi from septemb until probabl februari  all in all  the report still suggest under strength on the consum side of the economi  a veri strong wari with respect to busi invest  and a lack of fiscal disciplin on the part of the congress   that certain reinforc the view that there is some  uncertainti in the marketplac   incident  the presid   s econom forum in texa today is expect to focus signific on the fiscal issu  anticip what is go to happen in the fall  coffe
thank you   i suggest we take a ten minut break for  coffe break
governor bernank  would you start us off
thank you  mr  chairman   as we search for the signal of an incipi recoveri  we have heavi nois come from two side   the first sourc of nois is the financi market   our financi market usual exhibit control hy ia  but late we probabl could drop the adject    control      the stock market in particular seem to be search for a consensus valuat without too much luck so far   the other sourc of nois is the data   of cours  revis in the data show that the recess was wors than we thought  we were alway pessimist about forecast  and now backcast seem to be a problem as well   i have a modest propos  which is that if the bea can restat gdp figur and firm can  restat their earn  the fed should have the option to go back and restat interest rate from last  e    laughter    ow should we respond to these noisi condit   first  regard financi market  i think the best thing to do is to keep our head while all about us are lose their   monetari polici should be direct at the under economi and should respond to financi market onli insofar as they contain inform about or affect the under economi   i think on net the effect of financi market on the current economi are not veri larg   the direct effect of the stock market are be part offset by strong hous price  lower interest rate  and a fall dollar   it   s true that the volatil that we   re current observ at record level is feed anxieti and caution  but volatil by it natur tend to be temporari   so on net the current market volatil in my view is an argument for wait to see where thing settl down befor take action  second  regard the other sourc of nois  the data revis  we can no longer blame the shallow recess for the weak recoveri    laughter   the economi is not boom obvious  but look again beyond the financi market  it seem to be reason sound   in particular  the revis has larg left intact the growth in product  which i believ in some  sens is the most crucial element of the recoveri and bode well for both profit and econom growth   i note the comment that governor kohn made about financi condit  but overal i think the financi headwind are not veri strong   bank are healthi  consum and firm balanc sheet are reason strong for this stage of the cycl  and a lot of what is happen in the market with respect to risk spread and the like has more to do with volatil and financi market uncertainti than with fundament condit  third  the polici stanc  both monetari and fiscal  remain expansionari   it   s true that there are some uncertainti as we look forward   consum and the govern are do their   art  but firm in particular seem relat hesit both on the invest side and on the hire side  i think it   s worth note that there   s an aw lot of heterogen among industri in term of growth potenti   certain industri   telecommun  aircraft  commerci real estat  and other   are do veri poor   they are suffer from overhang  and it   s question whether small chang in interest rate  for exampl  would substanti affect their activ   on the other hand  residenti hous  auto  and consum good look veri strong  and other area like equip and softwar seem to be improv  my bottom line here is that there   s a lot of uncertainti and that ani of the three respons suggest in the bluebook would not be unreason   but given the uncertainti that we have now  my inclin is to wait and see and to get more inform   at the same  e  i don   t think we want to appear tone deaf to legi  concern among the public about the state of the economi   and i think we ought to set the stage to respond in case condit worsen   so i would indic my prefer to communic either in the statement or in the balanc of risk sentenc that the fed is vigil and is will and abl to cut rate in the futur if condit worsen   thank you
as mani of us have alreadi note  the economi is continu to expand but at a slower pace than earlier in the year   as we have note in our prior meet  we have been revis downward our forecast sinc spring   at this stage it is hard to identifi major risk of inflat over the intermedi term   thus the focus now should be on the strength of econom activ   while real gdp growth is now report to have slow from   percent in the first quarter to     percent in the second  the  book forecast is for growth to move toward it   ong term potenti growth rate in        the unusu growth of import in the second quarter signific reduc real gdp growth while the conclus of inventori liquid should provid the basi for continu expans of industri product as final sale advanc  survey measur of consum confid have fallen  with recent report of corpor fraud and the fall in equiti valu   but real consum activ  not the survey  continu to be resili in this cycl   both hous and auto sale remain near record high   this is due part to thirti two year low on mortgag rate and incent by auto manufactur that make car more afford today than they have been in thirti four year   consum do not usual make  such major purchas if their outlook for the futur is realli dim   rather  the persist growth of real dispos incom and slow new claim for unemploy insur serv to provid a foundat for continu  though perhap uneven  increas in consum spend   and today   s retail sale number support that view  to me the real focus should be on the pessim of corpor ceo   the drop in busi invest led this recess  and the lack of convict about futur revenu growth has continu to slow the recoveri of new invest commit   we did see growth in equip and softwar sale in the last quarter for the first  e in six quarter  and industri product has grown everi month this year   but the juli drop in the ism index and the declin in hour work rais question about the strength of the recoveri   and becaus of my concern about the pace of busi invest  i am becom more concern about the overal outlook for the pace of econom growth
thank you  mr  chairman   the economi seem pretti clear to have suffer a relaps sinc our last meet   equiti price have drop sharpli  and various   pend  employ  and confid measur have been weaker than expect   even the gdp revis have lower the recent growth number   there are some bright spot  notabl auto and hous   but even these bright spot could be taint if they impli lower futur spend   the staff  for exampl  has auto product drop in the fourth quarter after a robust third quarter   hous is less like to follow this pattern  but there are uncertainti about hous   sinc homeown are both consum of hous servic and wealth holder  there has alway been a question of whi increas in hous wealth should s ul other type of spend   the answer to this puzzl seem to be cash out refinanc   but this cash out refinanc may not last if either mortgag rate or hous price stabil  and in ani case it   s a veri weak reed to support the whole recoveri  one way to measur this weaken sen ent is to follow the chang made by the blue chip forecast   as i   ve said befor  the blue chip forecast as forecast do not particular impress me   what they seem to do is to react to the recent econom data and give an aggreg measur of what these data are say   last fall these observ drop the consensus forecast for      veri sharpli as the economi weaken   this spring they brought the consensus forecast for      up fair sharpli as they found sign of strength   but now they are lower it again   in the august poll their consensus forecast for      was reduc a full    percentag point  a huge chang for peopl forecast a year that is almost over   clear  these forecast observ are see plenti of negat sign  anoth relev indic is the perfect foresight simul exercis in the bluebook  as the bluebook explain  this is not realli a perfect foresight simul becaus the model is use as it stand now   but again  it   aggreg all the latest inform on equat variabl and residu to show the path of monetari polici consist with nairu and with   arious suggest inflat target   this perfect foresight simul suggest that the economi could use addit dose of monetari expans even if our long run inflat target were as low as   percent  turn to polici  i   m sit between roger and don  so let me go about halfway between them in term of what i say about polici   at our last meet the sign of weak were still incipi   the blue chip forecast  for exampl  had not written down their forecast at all   and it was argu that if the fed recogn these sign of weak by chang the stanc of monetari polici  it would in effect enshrin those sign and spook market  appar the sign of weak are so pervas now that they are alreadi enshrin   now the argument is that if the fed   not recogn those sign  it will look as though the fomc is out to lunch and that will spook market   what a differ a month make    laughter   but whether all this market talk make ani sens at all   and i don   t know if it     in the last month we probabl have cross an import recognit threshold   therefor  it probabl   make sens in develop our polici stanc to show at least some cogniz of the spread sign of weak   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   develop in the second district   s economi have been mix sinc the last report  though hous has continu to be robust   on the price side  despit continu escal in nonwag benefit cost  price of finish good and servic have remain remark stabl   retail sale  which were weak in april and may  seem to have improv and gone up with the temperatur gaug in june and juli  consum confid slip in june and juli  but labor market  although sluggish  were quit stabl   hous market and home construct activ were robust in the second quarter    ffice market weaken a littl more   survey of manufactur and purchas manag in the district suggest some rebound in activ in the last few week  follow a paus in juli  and our banker report some soften in consum loan demand but improv commerci lend   they also note tighter lend standard  which are appropri  and steadi delinqu rate  i would like to talk a bit more about what i see as the fragil in the financi sector both in the unit state and in other industri countri   i think that fragil is a result of both real develop and  perhap even more  a high degre of risk avers  especi in the commerci bank sector   the bank have been quit profit   their capit ratio are good  and therefor  in my view their degre of risk avers is consider overdon   if we look at  europ  their insur compani are veri heavi investor in equiti both in europ and the  unit state   and mani of those compani would be of question posit net worth if they were mark to market   bank in europ are veri heavili involv in the telecom sector  much more than those in the unit state  and their risk take abil is quit sever affect as a result   as for japan  the japanes bank institut situat has not improv ani   an indic of where some of the big bank in the unit state stand is that the spread between treasuri and credit of citigroup  the hold compani  is consider wider than that of it much lower rate custom  gillett   and even though i hope lot of us are shave with mach iii  one would think that citigroup is a littl better credit  the syndic loan market is veri  veri quiet   now to a larg degre  that   s becaus of lack of demand   but when we have more demand for credit in the economi  i think the avail of the syndic loan market is go to be quit question   the reason is that there are three strong manag of syndic loan   citigroup  j p  morgan chase  and bank of   merica   all of them have lost a great deal  of credibl with the bank that make up their syndic  much more than would be the case with proper bank   the syndic leader had done the due dilig  and most of the member of the syndic took the word of the syndic leader on that score   there has been a question in recent  e on whether the syndic leader was quit as loyal to the syndic as it was to it own sharehold and in addit on whether the due dilig of the lead bank had been what it should have been   therefor  i think it will be difficult for syndic credit to be put togeth for quit some period of  e until that faith is restor  we  like all the other peopl who have comment here today  believ that the economi is clear weaker than we thought it was at the last meet   and i think it   s import that the central bank of the unit state show that it live in the real world by reflect that in our statement   on the other hand  given the vast import of this institut to the stabil of the unit state and the world  it is imper that we act with prudenc   when we have to eas monetari polici  if we do   and i certain believ the  e is not today   i think we should do so with some degre of bold in order to show the leadership that will be requir of us   in the mean   it seem to me crucial that we remain prudent and appear to be prudent   not even st  jude himself  the patron saint of lost caus  would hope that this entir group would remain silent   but in our public statement i think it would be unwis and even danger if we share some of the discuss of the downsid risk that we have trade among ourselv today   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i had absolut no desir to speak last this morn   in fact i thought i had indic the desir to speak earli  but it seem that my   resenc at the tabl has alreadi begun to fade    laughter   had i spoken earlier about the region  right after      my remark not surpris would have sound veri similar to his   so at least on that score mayb it was good that i wasn   t next to speak   as for the rest of what i heard this morn  to a remark degre common theme ran through the commentari  main  as far as i could tell by listen to all of you and base on the note i made for myself  the go around has realli been a way for everyon to express some of the same concern and idea somewhat differ  the contrast between what i   ve been hear in the district versus read about the nation economi suggest that our region is continu to do somewhat better than the rest of the countri   certain  the rather panicki tone of wall street letter is not mirror in the comment that i hear in the region   an articl in the wall street journal a few week ago regard the effect of the declin in the dollar on manufactur mention a coupl of small ohio compani   that prompt our research analyst to get a list of over     compani and their phone number to call   most firm report no increas in export order   but the reason turn out to be that over half of all the export come from ohio alon are to canada  and anoth signific chunk goe to mexico   and  of cours  the canadian dollar was onli briefli higher than the u s  dollar  and the mexican peso has been fair steadi   for those compani that did see a pickup in order  it reflect export to asia and not at all to latin america or to europ   a few contact  howev  said that  though their order for export have been steadi  the profit of their export busi has been improv  we did a roundup regard capit spend by compani locat in the district  and that produc mix result  of cours   those increas spend suppli main the auto  hous  and health care sector   onli one compani cite the new tax incent for invest   s the reason for undertak some capit invest that they had not previous plan to do  we ask them whi they did it now rather than wait sinc the incent will be in effect for a while   our contact said he was quit sure that the congress was go to remov that tax incent after the novemb elect  anoth topic of discuss in the district this summer has been the effect of weather  the farm region tell us that  even if normal rain were to resum now  the corn crop are wipe out   we don   t have irrig of our corn crop in our district   and the yield of soybean would be cut in half even if normal amount of rainfal were to resum   that  of cours  mean that the ag sector lender have big credit qualiti problem and are voic a lot of concern   we   ve heard concern regist not onli about the smaller bank compani but also about the farm credit bank   it   s still too earli to know who realli hold the worst of these problem loan   the flip side of the effect of the dri weather is that both highway construct and theme park destin have lost fewer day due to bad weather   revenu at these park so far this year have consider exceed expect   we also were told that roadsid restaur and motel are oper at veri high capac level  while central citi hotel  especi in larg metro area  have veri high vacanc rate   some of that has noth to do with recent develop in the economi   in cincinnati  for exampl  a lot of convent have been cancel  but that has noth to do with anyth go on elsewher   electr power generat compani  not surpris  are also oper at flat out capac   so demand for coal has been strong  and the price of coal has been high  report from the residenti hous market continu to indic a veri tight market at the lower and moder price rang  while upper end hous are stay on the market for ever longer period of  e   the incom generat from build hous is be spent   peopl are   uye vehicl to park in front of their hous  and the hous relat sector  such as furnitur and applianc and other item that homeown put insid their hous  are all do quit well  all are generat incom  and that incom is be spent   meanwhil the telecom sector continu to contract   metal compani produc more tonnag with fewer peopl   and the commerci and industri construct sector continu to declin   nevertheless  in spite of what we also are hear   as tom hoenig and other report   regard state and local financ problem  public sector construct for school and that sort of thing is veri strong  base on bond financ  one larg employ in the region said that turnov in employ is declin becaus of what he describ as    the fear of join the alreadi unemploy      he said this is reduc employe    resist to the shift of some of the sharp increas in health care cost to them  not a veri nice thing to do   at a recent small busi advisori council meet i learn that those manufactur compani that are get strong order are not onli use temp but also mandatori over  rather than add perman worker   this  of cours  is contrari to the month report indic reduc hour   union contract negoti have been report to be settl for pay increas in the     to   percent rang  regard the nation economi  as alway it   s a contest between the strength of forc generat by the inher resili of market mechan versus the frequenc and the strength of various advers impuls   when ask what is caus so much caution in the busi sector as well as the declar nervous of household   an attitud not necessarili reflect in their spend   peopl point to three major uncertainti   and here    uncertainti    is the right word  not    risk      somebodi els mention   i think it may have been cathi   the word    fear      i heard the word    fear    much more than the word    risk    dure this recent period   there are   ncertainti about where  when  and how bad the next terror attack will be  about the startl loss of confid in the qualiti of balanc sheet and incom statement of busi  and about when and how the violenc of the middl east can be brought to an end   none of these sourc of uncertainti has a clear  easi  or near term solut   there will not be a vt day   victori over terror day   that we will mark on our calendar to celebr in the futur   the credibl of financi statement will be restor onli veri gradual   it may be compar to when a central bank lose the credibl of it commit to price stabil  it take a long  e to get that credibl back   and i think the busi sector is go to have to wait a veri long period of  e befor it deserv the public   s faith in the credibl of compani    report   our ul  occup of the middl east will last decad   peopl not yet born will serv in our arm forc in the middl east  it   s signific that neither busi contact nor economist identifi monetari or fiscal polici as among the negat impuls   if there is a second downward leg of this cycl  it will be caus by new or strengthen negat impuls that are alreadi present   the staff produc what i consid to be veri use altern simul of various type of risk  but these are not the thing that peopl talk about when they are ask about their concern and sourc of uncertainti   i look forward to the staff   s forecast everi septemb when they add that extra year and look further out into the futur   of cours i don   t know what that project is go to say  but i   ll forecast what it   s go to say   it   s go to say that on averag over the subsequ eight quarter period the economi will have growth of about   percent   that   s becaus for the last half centuri  the last  e i look at the data  it has experienc about   percent growth  the last  e i did look at the figur   and this was befor the most recent revis of the data   some    percent of the quarter to quarter chang in real gdp growth  almost three    uarter of the observ  were below   percent or abov   percent   my guess is that six out the next eight quarter of the staff forecast will not show growth below   percent or abov   percent  but i bet they will averag close to   percent
a splendid way to end   with a veri larg question mark  i think we can now move on to vinc reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   talk about the dog day of summer   over the intermeet period  share price rode a roller coa  that left equiti investor    percent less wealthi  key emerg financi market flare  rumor of fund difficulti at sever larg intermediari surfac  and incom indic suggest that employ and spend growth had soften   it is beyond my abil to explain whi financi market were so volatil over the intermeet period   howev  i believ that three thread of the complet stori bear upon your polici deliber today   first  as   relat at the begin and virtual everi other speaker around the tabl reinforc  the econom news  especi of recent vintag  prove disappoint   but  second  those econom data were more of a surpris to market particip than they were to us   at the  e of your first meet in       market forecast of aggreg demand and it implicit balanc with aggreg suppli were such that the feder fund rate was expect to be   percent by now and to move up to     percent by the end of next year   in the  e sinc  the structur of expect polici rate up to the end of next year has shift down as much as    percentag point   one question is whether  in the process of adjust their outsiz forecast of econom activ and the attend polici respons  market particip have undershot the mark as much as they overshot it in januari   what was a surpris to us   and to virtual all other observ   was the amplitud of the swing in financi market   on six out of ten day dure the intermeet period  the dow jone industri averag move more than     point  at their nadir  broad share index were    percent below their june    level but now have roll back almost two third of those loss in a coupl of week   this lead to my third observ   to some extent  market dynam feed upon themselv   one mechan in that process is the unfortun tendenc for larg swing in price to expos weak on some balanc sheet   in the         episod of a substanti runup in long term yield  a few mortgag back hedg fund and a counti treasuri of note were found to have feet of clay   in       the loss came from a hedg fund that was even more noteworthi   this  e around  a less recept capit market show that some firm in the energi trade and telecom industri were not much more than potemkin villag  hide hollow balanc sheet behind the glitz   histori suggest that there is a natur cycl of recoil  recrimin  regulatori respons with a lag  and relaps over the long run   with   nvestor appar still in the recoil stage  the staff project in the  book consider lower equiti wealth over the next year and a half than in the last forecast   the disappoint econom data  the loss in equiti wealth  and a tighten of credit market impli that the expans has lost some traction in the second half of  this year   but as these effect on the level of demand dissip  the economi should recov to a growth rate just a bit abov that of potenti output   as a result  the staff is forecast that more resourc go unus for some  e but that the extra slack help to hold inflat around it current level   compar with the forecast in the june  book  these outcom are like to be less appeal to you in further the feder reserv   s dual mandat   but you might still elect to keep the feder fund rate at    percent even if you thought the staff outlook was the most like to materi   in particular  your percept of the lag of monetari polici may be such that action at this meet would not materi influenc econom growth over the balanc of this year   that is  today   s set of the polici rate would most shape econom perform in      and beyond   and while there is a weaker demand compon to the staff   s revis to next year   s outlook  a signific portion reflect a reassess of the growth of aggreg suppli that you might view as outsid the scope of your influenc   moreov  you might have reason to believ spend will reviv more forc than in the staff forecast   household have proven remark resili over the past two year and may do so again  a notion support by continu strong auto sale  with a real feder fund rate close to zero  polici has provid forward thrust to the real estat sector and has facilit the ongo extract of owner    equiti  evidenc in part by anoth wave of refinanc that seem not yet to have crest  the hesit of firm to hire and to invest may be due  in part  to elev uncertainti in financi market   but if the deadlin for execut to certifi their corpor report pass without ani major firework  perhap that sens of uncertainti will ebb and the advanc of employ and capit spend will regain vigor   inde  the near of that date when uncertainti might be consider reduc may further recommend a polici of watch wait to the committe for it meet today   the case for polici eas at this meet would seem to rest on the sens either that the staff   s outlook has it about right but the slow pace at which slack is whittl down is unaccept  given inflat hold steadi  or that there are signific prospect that outcom could lean toward weaker aggreg demand and lower inflat than in the  book   as to the former  the perfect foresight simul report in the bluebook accept the staff   s assess of near term develop and the frb us model   s specif of behavior with complet convict   within that framework  policymak desir of smooth employ and output gap would eas polici soon   even if the inflat goal were as low as   percent   in that exercis  a littl more than   percentag point eas would trim a few tenth off the unemploy   ate while still put inflat on a cours that drift lower   an inflat goal of      percent could accommod more substanti eas now while move the unemploy rate down to    percent in the transit to it long run equilibrium  these exercis  of cours  convey a fals precis about our understand of the work of the economi or your abil to use polici to shape outcom   but the general messag is also convey by the declin in most measur of the equilibrium  real feder fund rate report in the bluebook   also argu for eas polici at this meet  the committe might believ that the staff was too tentat in reassess the forc determin inflat   the sens of heighten uncertainti  lessen earn prospect  and withdraw from risk take evid in the substanti declin in equiti price could also surfac as unusu restraint on the spend decis of household and busi in come quarter   as   note  the ongo travail of key emerg market also have the potenti for reduc demand for u s  good   and the revis to the path of product now seem to accord a greater role to a reduc natur rate of unemploy in explain the good perform of inflat   if the natur rate of unemploy is  in fact  south of the staff   s new es  of   percent  even more disinfl may be in store than along the  book baselin   such further disinfl would erod the inflat cushion the committe has to put real interest rate suffici into negat territori at some later date if event warrant  as gaug by money market futur rate  the feder fund rate is now expect to drop below     percent later this year   thus  view from financi market  the question is not if the committe will eas but when   and the answer from those market appar is not now but soon  in that recent survey indic that the modal outcom for this meet is that you   ll keep the fund rate at    percent   so as long as you do not disabus market particip of your willing to eas polici if the situat warrant in come month  the economi will benefit from the expect of immin eas   that is  from lower capit market yield   if event over the come intermeet period call for an eas move  the committe can confirm  those polici expect at the next meet   or some  sooner if necessari   to preserv prevail financi condit   if the current run of subdu econom report give way to a pattern more consist with sustain econom expans and market settl down  investor will roll back that putat eas in come week of their own accord   from this perspect  if you keep the feder fund rate unchang  your decis on the balanc of risk depend on whether you share the assess of risk appar in the market   the retent of balanc risk to the committe   s dual object would work to send the messag that it believ that market particip had swung too much from their over op ist mood of the spring   recent survey and the configur of futur rate is consist with signific probabl weight mass on a more accommod messag  so short  and long term rate would back up some if that prove not to be the case   if so  equiti price would soften     f the committe   s assess is that the tail of advers outcom has fatten suffici  switch to a balanc of risk weight toward econom weak would both more accur convey that sens and like encourag asset market to continu to support econom growth   short  and long term interest rate would probabl edg lower  and a bounc up in equiti price would probabl be in store  while there is a risk that market particip would interpret the switch to unbalanc risk as evid of the committe   s doubt about econom growth go forward  that could be mitig by emphas in the press releas that the economi is expect to continu to expand
question for vinc
i have a question   in the bluebook  the taylor rule recommend and the recommend of the perfect foresight simul are quit differ  which of those two approach would best realli model or character past polici
well  the taylor rule is suppos to be in part descript of polici decis   that is  the paramet were fit to explain a good part of the     s   so in that sens the taylor rule is consist with what the committe has done in the past   the import piec of inform that the taylor rule  sn   t have but the perfect foresight simul do have is the intercept   that is  r    this particular pictur has a real interest rate of     percent   well  if you turn to chart   in the bluebook  you see that just about all the model base es  of the equilibrium fund rate are below that   so it wouldn   t take much shift down of that intercept in the taylor rule to make them consist
okay  thank you
ani further question   if not  let me get start   all of you have direct or indirect emphas the issu of the overvalu of the stock market and the irregular of corpor govern that have led to a veri signific contract in stock price and a major widen of spread in a number of financi market   we were made particular awar after a congression hear a week or so ago how sensit interest rate   pread and inde stock price have becom to the corpor govern issu   both citicorp and j p  morgan chase were accus of what three or four year ago would scarc have rais an eyebrow  name their effort to structur various form of credit in way that would be use to their custom without signific undercut the safeti and sound of their bank institut   but that kind of activ has turn into a major concern  and inde it revel has result in a veri larg drop in the stock price of both bank firm and has widen spread on their debt issu quit consider  that  of cours  is not the onli exampl of such a develop   we see it throughout the financi market   we are now look at equiti premium that have risen in the latest period abov their      averag  after have declin to virtual record low   this suggest  as     indic  that stock price by some measur may be undervalu or below their    fair    valu  as some peopl like to say   the troubl with that assess  unfortun  is that stock price histor have alway move abov and below fair valu in the sens that they never seem to stop at fair valu   this rais an obvious question   what in the world   fair valu mean   in ani event  the veri signific contract on balanc in stock market price  over recent week has rais the possibl that such price may final be reach some form of bottom   i trust that when i reread these remark when they are releas to the public five year from now they will not look anyth less than thought  the problem is one that we have not had to confront in this way befor   one interest aspect of the problem relat to the risk spread in the stock market and the weak in capit expenditur   but anoth veri interest aspect is that  despit the extraordinari weak in capit spend  profit margin rose signific in the fourth quarter of last year and essenti stay at the higher level in the first and second quarter of this year   this has   ccur in the context of quit small increas in unit labor cost  at least as judg by the deceler in the implicit price deflat for nonfinanci corpor  that in turn reflect veri strong growth in output per manhour   as i recal  the es  four quarter averag growth in product for nonfinanci corpor show an increas of     percent   the staff es  that the second quarter number by itself is     percent  most interest in this veri odd pattern of data is the fact that the evid signific flight to qualiti  which is implicit in the number of widen credit spread  has been accompani by a veri mark declin in the ten year treasuri yield   at the last read it was about     percent   that declin  of cours  has had a major impact on thirti year fix mortgag rate   inde  those rate have fallen below     percent  and i believ they are now close to    percent   at that level we are see veri signific churn in the mortgag market  and as i have indic previous  the increas in home equiti is cumul over a period of year becaus the price of home veri rare turn negat   what we are observ at this point is a veri high rate of hous turnov   exist home sale are veri high  and i   d say parenthet that the drop in juli in the season adjust data come from the nation associ of realtor appear to involv a defici season adjust factor   there is no evid of ani contract of ani moment in exist home sale except  as a coupl of member mention previous  in sale of high price home  which have been pretti soggi   the hous market has been tight across much of the countri  and it has been tight in part becaus of the strong influenc that immigr is have on the demand for hous  the turnov of home of necess engend realiz capit gain  and those gain tend to be the element in the hous market that extract the most home equiti   inde  what we alway observ is that the mortgag loan taken out by the buyer is signific larger than the   ortgag cancel by the seller   and the spread between the two  which is the net increas in mortgag debt on that exist home  is veri close in general to the realiz capit gain   to be sure  a veri signific amount of equiti extract occur without realiz gain  and it occur larg becaus of the cash out from refinanc   those cash out are becom quit larg  an intern es  by freddi mac for last year indic that it was a littl over      billion  the total is down somewhat this year becaus the refinanc are not as larg  and i believ the ratio of cash out to refinanc usual come down a bit when refinanc to total origin go up  all in all  there have been veri larg extract from home equiti   they do not seem to be impair or enhanc by fluctuat in stock price   the result has been a veri major addit to person consumpt expenditur and to home modern outlay  which  of cours  are part of gdp   what we have observ here is a major offset to the quit extens declin in wealth from equiti   and what is also interest is that we are look at two differ segment of household incom   a veri substanti part of the wealth creation and destruct through equiti stock price occur in the upper incom quintil  while a veri substanti part of the home equiti extract occur in the lower four quintil   and the evid is that on averag the impact on person consumpt expenditur from chang in equiti wealth accord to the frb us model is about the same overal as the extract of equiti from hous   in my view  howev  the avail evid suggest that that may be in error in the sens that we may find after the fact that the margin propens to consum out of capit gain in home  especi those that are realiz  is veri signific abov the margin propens to consum out of either realiz or unreal gain in equiti   onli in recent year   ave unreal gain in equiti becom a veri promin factor in both person consumpt expenditur and home modern outlay  this process seem to be continu   we are find that the wealth effect is probabl neglig for the non equiti  nonhous type of wealth   consum durabl stock constitut a big portion of household wealth  and there is no evid that the level of such wealth has ani effect whatsoev on consum spend   but the point i want to emphas here is that there is veri littl evid of which i   m awar that the continu rise in home price and the relat expans of home equiti is go to ceas   the basic reason is that home equiti has almost alway increas   in fact  the averag valu of home deflat by a gdp deflat has been go up about     percent per year for a veri long period  the explan as best i can judg relat in part to the fact that the growth of product in home construct is neglig   peopl essenti buy custom hous  which   not lend itself to improv in homebuild product   inde  the manufactur compon of home construct  even though it is rise  is held back to a remark extent by the idiosyncrat desir of homeown not to have a hous that look like the next door neighbor   s   the result is veri low product in construct   in fact  the publish figur on gross product origin in construct show declin product on a per hour basi in the last twenti or thirti year   in itself  that is not credibl   but if we assum that averag hour  compens equat across all segment of the economi  we would expect that the differenti in unit labor cost between the home construct sector and the economi overal would reflect the differenti product chang   and inde  if we take nonfarm busi product and  subtract home construct product  which is essenti zero  what we get is the long term     percent increas in price   so in effect what we get in equilibrium is a constant net increment   o purchas power from capit gain in home over and abov the increas in person incom  when we factor these capit gain into the regular model  we do not get ani revers in this increment at ani  e  there clear is concern at this stage about a hous valu bubbl that is go to burst  but i think that most of those who look at this in some detail question whether that   s a valid notion   and while the second quarter increas in home valu is now signific below the big rise of last year  i believ a   percent annual rate is the current es  that   s be use for exist home sale   so overal the notion that we   re go to lose the home equiti part of the current support for consum expenditur   not seem reason at this stage   this   not mean  of cours  that we could not get a declin in home price   it   s the notion that there is an equival between equiti bubbl and hous bubbl that i think is an illus   moreov  as i think i   ve indic sever  e in the past  it strike me that with transact cost as high as they are in home sale and the necess to move if the home is sold  the incent to sell a hous is nowher near what it is to sell a stock to take advantag of a capit gain   as i indic earlier  the impact of immigr superimpos upon the difficulti of find viabl land for homebuild is keep signific upsid pressur on home price over and abov the construct product issu   so the likelihood of ani realli import contract in the hous area would in my view requir a veri major contract in the economi overal  have said all of that  the general outlook still strike me as be solid in an under sens  but without question there has been substanti deterior and it   s not go to be easi to read the signific of the corpor govern problem   they are turn out to have a much greater impact on the economi than i would have envisag when the enron issu first surfac and even when worldcom show up   there is no evid at this stage that the   roblem has stabil   conceiv  it may stabil after tomorrow when most of the reaffirm of the qualiti of the corpor financi report come in to the sec   i doubt it  but i think it is too soon to say where it will go  i have no doubt that everyth will look just fine in retrospect if we look back in octob and novemb of this year and we see that the growth rate was near the     or   percent now expect for the current quarter   if that   s inde what is happen  we can   t be experienc all the negat develop that are fo  the current gloomi sen ent  but we can   t know that at this point   in fact  most of the concern that we have discuss are  larg base  i think  on factor that we cannot captur in the  book or in ani of the model with which we are work  i  like all other  think it is most prematur to consid lower interest rate in this context   if we lower rate from their current level  we will have a greater distanc to go to restor some reason level of noninflationari  non accommod short term money market rate   but i must say even in that context that i agre with the vice chairman  who state that  if we have to eas  he would not favor eas in    basi point increment becaus that would send the wrong signal   if we have to move  my inclin would be to move from      to      percent  but i don   t think we   re go to end up have to eas   i would recommend that we stay where we are with respect to rate today   but i do agre with those who have argu  and i believ with some justif  that it is essenti that we at least recogn what is go on   clear  the risk are not balanc   they have turn from reason balanc  even though what you call it the last  e was
uncomfort    hairman  span   to uncomfort balanc   i would have said back then that they were reason balanc   clear  that is no longer the case  and i think we need to acknowledg that   in summari  i would hope for a resolut that hold rate unchang but   shift the balanc of risk statement toward weak   vice chair
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman
wow    laughter   i certain agre with leav the rate unchang  uncertainti about financi statement has creat more headwind than i had expect  and now i have a feel that they   re go to last longer than a lot of peopl may be think   so if that mean the balanc of risk is toward weak  i can live with that
mr  chairman  as i said earlier  i don   t favor eas polici further today   i would not favor move the tilt either at this stage   to me the key factor   and mani peopl have made this point   is that polici is alreadi veri accommod   the real fund rate is alreadi veri close to zero if not at zero   sinc we haven   t experienc anoth realli big negat shock that threaten the stabil of financi market to the extent that the septemb    shock did and sinc we   re not face signific further disinfl or a real threat of deflat yet  i would ask what we expect to accomplish by signal an increas probabl of further eas at some point fair soon   i   ve thought about this  and the onli thing that come to mind is that we want to show the public that we feel it pain or share it fear and that we   re not insensit to the downsid risk in the outlook   i can certain understand that   but i don   t think that   s a persuas argument in the current circumst  given how accommod our   olici alreadi is   moreov  and this is the key point i would make  i think there   s a cost   i believ that chang the tilt today could caus some confus   in my view  mani peopl when they think about the economi are focus on whether or not it is go to move back into a recess   i think that   s more or less the issu that they see us deal with here   and if we move the tilt  that is go to suggest to a lot of peopl that we are put higher odd now on the economi drop back into recess than we  probabl as a group realli are  even though i know we   re less op ist than we were   i worri that by tri to use the tilt to sort of creat the appear that we   re do someth actual might reduc confid rather than bol  confid   so that would be my take on it
well  i have almost the opposit take   i think i would have been   if i were vote today   one among perhap not mani at this tabl who could have vote for an eas in polici   but i am perfect will to go along with your recommend   i do think that thing have chang signific enough to bring into question whether or not monetari polici is suffici accommod at this point   there are strong headwind  and not to recogn them in our statement   whether by a chang in the tilt or some languag in the statement   would be to ignor what is out there and seem to be a littl behind the curv   so i agre with your statement  and i agre with what you want to do with regard to the tilt
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   although i am somewhat concern about the potenti for subpar output growth go forward  i think the  sign of that are relat recent and deriv from noisi high frequenc data and from develop in the financi market  which could turn around  particular after we get through   he middl of this month   so in my view it   s far too earli to eas polici at this point   there   s a lot of uncertainti  as governor bernank mention  and that in itself is perhap enough to slow the committe down even if we thought the economi was go to be sluggish go forward   i do favor the shift in the balanc of risk becaus i believ the risk have  in fact  shift   i think the inflat concern that might have been inher in our stanc of polici have been push much further out into the futur  in my mind beyond the forese futur perhap   and that   s part becaus we do have some more downsid risk   we   ve revis down the forecast   near everybodi around the tabl has said they   ve revis down their forecast for the next few quarter   and there are downsid risk to those forecast   so  i see more downsid risk on the output side and less upsid risk or certain more distant upsid risk on the inflat side  moreov  i think financi market would welcom a shift in the balanc of risk statement   it would reassur them that we understand that the landscap has chang   but it should be coupl with a restat of our expect that expans will continu   this isn   t about doubl dip   econom weak in our statement refer to growth below potenti not to doubl dip  and we should reinforc that view   it would liber market to build in more eas if appropri   unlik presid broaddus  i don   t see a zero real rate as a natur bound for monetari polici   if the economi is weak go forward  if output gap appear to be increas  if unemploy gap look as if they might be increas  even without a recess i would be in favor of eas polici   and i believ that   s particular import becaus of a point that presid broaddus has made befor  the start point for the economi   we alreadi have veri low inflat and a veri low fund rate   wait to eas until the economi turn down or until a major shock hit us would risk run into a situat that would be hard to deal with   so i think we ought to move quick if it becom necessari   it   s not necessari right now   and we   ught to make sure that the market can behav in a stabil fashion  particular in the current situat   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i endors both part of your recommend   i obvious alreadi spoke on the balanc of risk issu   with respect to the question of move polici go forward  i think i   m somewher between cathi   and don kohn   on the one hand  the incom data have been much weaker than one would have anticip  but i also recogn that the weaker perform realli involv just high frequenc  data so it   s appropri to wait and see   but if we get evid of persist weak  then we obvious should do the right thing   at this stage  though  i think chang the languag is suffici
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support your recommend   as vinc remind us  earlier in the year market particip had price in a signific and relat earli tighten of polici   as it turn out  i think we were well advis not to act on that   now they are price in some eas of polici soon if not immedi  and person i think we are wise today not to react to that either   i would offer one caution about chang the bias in the risk statement  although i can certain go along with it   it   s one thing if we want to whipsaw ourselv a littl by chang the forecast as the number come in   but i think we should be care about have that feed into the financi market and potenti the real economi   now  obvious what we   re talk about do here is not like to have a profound impact  nevertheless  i think there is a potenti for tri to overanalyz the incom data and to exagger the possibl that somehow a new trend has been establish    hairman  span   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend to keep the feder fund rate where it is  but i   d like to associ myself with the posit that al broaddus spell out for the balanc of risk statement   mr  chairman  i interpret your commentari as say that from what we know now and base on our best guess about the futur  the feder fund rate will probabl stay about where it is in the near term   i think that a balanc of risk sentenc bias toward weak will be read by the market as an indic of a rate cut to come   that   s my predict as to how the market is go to forecast  it seem to me as a first step that the press statement could indic that the evid suggest that the economi has downshift to a lower growth path   i think that the outlook for growth is still posit but it   s lower than in the previous forecast   i   d also like to point out that there is ampl room for long bond rate to fall   there is still an unusu larg spread between  the feder fund rate and  let   s say  a ten year treasuri bond as a benchmark   it seem to me that we could accomplish what we want to accomplish by tri to convey that our present view is that the polici target for the fund rate is like to remain in it current neighborhood for a longer period than we had previous thought  that should at least help to reflect   i think accur   what our posit is   and if the market read it that way  it should help to bring down longer term rate   but i am concern that the balanc of risk toward weak will be read by the market as a forecast of a cut in the fund rate at the next meet or the one after that
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend with regard to the fund rate   at the  e of the last meet  the risk for the economi and inflat were fair well balanc   but it seem to me that there was some sens in the room that it would take quit a   it to induc a further eas of polici and that the bar would be lower for shift polici into a tighten mode   this  e around i think we face a more even balanc set of risk  therefor  i have a prefer for retain a balanc statement of risk  and i believ that we could communic our current concern through the word of the press statement without chang the actual balanc of risk sentenc
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i think where my perspect may differ from presid pool   s is that i don   t realli want to tie our hand right now   i am concern about weak   i don   t believ we should respond to what is go on in the market but rather to the implic that has in term of consum and busi behavior  and if  with the new initi that the congress has pass  we don   t veri quick get aggress action against individu who   ve commit some of these fraud  i am concern that this problem could linger on and on   furthermor  if we don   t restor confid in the market  i think there will be some longer term impact on busi financ and consum invest   so i would prefer to shift the balanc of risk to weak now becaus we don   t know how peopl are go to react in these veri unusu  e   and i   d like to signal that  given the uncertainti  the risk we see in the outlook today are more to the downsid
i support both part of the recommend   i do think   and this relat to someth that governor   rais   that we have two role here today   one is the monetari polici role   but we also have a de facto role at this  e as one of the few bastion of credibl left in the countri and particular in washington  d c   so i would suggest that the   anner in which we describ our posit today is particular import   i think it has to be as much analyt as explanatori for that purpos
mr  chairman  i support both part of the recommend   i think it would be prematur to lower rate  though i have some sympathi for those who have some  affin for that posit   on the balanc of risk  i   ve been mull this over for the last week or so and chang my view everi few minut   but in the final analysi i think i   ll just describ my posit by use a veri home statement   the bias toward weak   reflect our discuss and in my view is an honest assess of what we think  so in the end we probabl ought to go with that  let me also say one word about hous   i   ll tri to be quick about it   i agre that there is no bubbl   i agre that there is no product chang in hous construct   so the relat price of hous is rise compar with incom and other price for what we   ll call real reason  but i am still puzzl by whi  sinc peopl are both wealth holder and have to buy hous servic  those whose home have risen in relat valu should spend more on other good becaus of that   the onli answer   the one that you   ve suggest and the one that seem to  work   is the convers of unreal capit gain to realiz gain   but it make me uncomfort to base so much on this convers  of just switch the gain to money   i realiz the empir studi go against me   but i am just uncomfort that the refinanc of hous should be the sourc of so much of the support for our recoveri   in ani case  i do think it is a weak reed   so  i   m not go to quarrel with anyth you said  but i   m just puzzl by it and uneasi with it
you sound like a true conserv    r      either that or a true idiot    laughter
ned  i think there are differ interpret  and some  be call a conserv is a compliment    laughter   and i would not say you   re a true idiot
ben was say earlier that he had read the transcript of some recent meet and there was a lot of laughter but he didn   t hear much laughter today   i said it come later in the meet
i can support your recommend for no chang in the fed fund rate at this meet and a chang in the balanc of risk statement   i have a slight prefer for leav the balanc of risk statement as is   as i note earlier  howev  i do believ that the risk have shift toward econom weak  so i can   t argu about the chang in the tilt   i do worri a littl about give the public and the market the wrong signal  name that we plan to chang rate   i know it should not be view in that way  but it often is   that   s the realiti  i think   but i don   t want to make too much of this   a shift in the balanc of risk mirror realiti  so i   m quit happi to go along with the recommend
may i just say parenthet that i don   t deni that a balanc of risk switch will have that effect   but if we get a few good number on order or sale or in gdp or profit  i submit that the market will be way ahead of us
i support your recommend on leav the rate unchang   i  too  have a slight prefer for maintain the balanc of risk statement as it is   howev  i acknowledg that the risk have shift   nevertheless  i still think  as we look at our project   nd the stanc of both monetari and fiscal polici  that a lot of  s ulus remain and that will carri the economi forward   but like other  i wouldn   t fall on the sword on this issu becaus of all the uncertainti in the economi   on balanc  though  i   d wait to see a littl more evid befor chang that balanc of risk statement becaus it is go to chang expect about futur rate move   although i agre that some good number would chang expect onc again for everyon   i   d just make that comment
mr  chairman  i concur with both part of your recommend   in particular  the weaken of the economi is quit evid to the public  and i think it   s import that we show that the feder reserv recogn that and is prepar to respond to it   i   d like to add that i also agre with you that if thing take a turn for the wors  we should be prepar to act veri aggress   i   m not one who worri about zero bound  for exampl   in fact  one might interpret the expect declin in the futur feder fund rate as be not a certainti of a small declin but a small probabl of a larger declin   so to summar  i do concur with your propos
i support both part of your recommend   nevertheless  i do believ that the bias statement is not serv us well and that we would be better off not have it   but we do have it  so we have to tell the truth about it   and the balanc of risk has clear shift downward  so we have no choic but to acknowledg that
mr  chairman  i can be comfort with what you suggest  but i would want to associ myself with the posit that presid broaddus first express and a number   f peopl agre with   i think we   re still learn how to use both the bias and the press statement that we consid at the end of each meet   i was look forward more than usual to the distribut of the draft press statement  hope that the word wizard had found some languag short of a chang in the bias that might convey the same messag   i share the concern express by some other peopl that mani observ  probabl most  will read a chang in the bias   at least until we get a string of good data   as suggest that we   re go to eas  iron  i think that   s an ad uncertainti that we realli don   t intend to convey today   but i accept the argument on the other side  and were i vote  i certain would not dissent today over the chang in the balanc of risk statement   thank you
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend not to move rate at this  e   the accommod stanc of monetari polici that we have in place is intend in part to protect us against the hope short term slowdown that we   ve seen over the last month or six week   so with that insur built in  i think the current level of the fund rate should hold us in good stead go forward   i agre veri strong with your point that if we do move  we should make a move of    basi point  not    basi point  becaus the catalyst would be some signific weak in the economi  some sudden shock  or some risk of a deflationari environ  on the tilt  i think it   s a veri close call   good argument have been made on both side  on balanc  i have a slight prefer for convey the messag in the languag of the press releas rather than by shift the tilt  but i certain can live with the approach that you recommend   i do think that the market will view this as at least a short term increas in the probabl that we will move the fed fund rate down at the next meet   but as you said  with   ther data come in they could clear move in the other direct as well   so as i indic  i have a slight prefer for the other approach  but i can live with your recommend
thank you   will you read the direct languag that has no chang in rate but shift the balanc of risk to weak
this is from page    in the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent      and for the statement in the press releas      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
