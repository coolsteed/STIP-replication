good morn  everyon   would someon like to move approv of the minut of the octob  rd meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to a packag of color chart that should be in front of you     on the first page i have depict all on one panel the forward deposit rate for the dollar  the euro  and the yen from may      through novemb   th   to give some perspect on chang in these rate  i have also shown the sequenc of rate move that this committe and the european central bank  ecb  have made over the last year and a half    the orang and red line at the top of the page are the dollar forward rate  with the lighter color show the   month forward rate   as you can see  the   month forward   month deposit rate has fallen by almost     basi point sinc it peak in may of this year  at the  e of this committe s last rate action  unwind almost half of it total increas from may of       the   month forward   month rate is now trade below the   month forward   month rate  which itself is trade below the current   month deposit rate   still  the   month forward   month rate  laughter
run that by me one more  e
that   s the chairman   s languag   at ani rate  the dollar   s   month forward   month rate is about     basi point abov it euro counterpart   the ecb has rais their polici rate     basi point sinc may of this year  but their   month forward   month rate has not chang   it s essenti trade at the same level as it was in may   take a step back  the market has price in a fair amount of eas by this committe over the come month but has been reluct to price in much of the tighten that the ecb has put in place over the summer and into the fall   the   line at the bottom of the page  which look like inchworm crawl along there  are the japanes forward rate   they have bunch up    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix      a bit  as have the dollar and the euro rate  but on their rather suppress scale   turn to the second page  i have includ two chart depict exchang rate   in the top panel  go back to may of      again  are chang in the foreign currenc valu of our four major trade partner  movement in the japanes yen  the mexican peso  the canadian dollar  and the euro against the dollar   in the bottom panel are compar chang in the currenc of five smaller countri   look at the top panel  you can see that the yen strengthen quit a bit against the dollar last year but is realli veri littl chang this year   the peso and the canadian dollar are down slight over this period  but rather margin so   and the euro has lost    percent of it valu against the dollar  most this year   of the five currenc shown in the bottom panel  all but the korean won  which is certain someth of an except  have declin quit a bit against the dollar  princip this year   those currenc includ the new zealand dollar  the rand  the australian dollar  and the thai baht   now  howev we may feel about the dollar s movement and whatev our analyt framework  i think we should recogn that the movement of the euro and sever currenc of smaller countri against the dollar are view by peopl elsewher in the world as extrem or extraordinari   and they are seen by our counterpart in other countri as reflect a draw in of capit into the unit state and safe haven flow that persist on the order of those experienc in      and        we may not see it that way   we think there is a distinct between what has been go on this year and what occur in those prior year   but they see it as a continu of those safe haven and capit flow into the unit state   so  while one can point to signific differenti in the pressur on differ countri  for exampl  the argentin peso is under pressur but the hong kong dollar is not  the dollar s strength is not seen by the rest of the world as a consequ of the fundament   rather  the dollar   s strength is seen as a caus of their problem and the stress that beset their economi  that view is held much more firm now  i think  than in      and      when other nation tend to understand the natur of the safe haven flow  this continu of capit movement into the unit state now seem more my i to our counterpart in other countri   on page    i have provid four snapshot of three differ yield curv   those snapshot are for the follow date   may  rd of       befor the committe s recent tighten cycl began  januari   th of this year    which was just prior to the treasuri   s buyback announc and when the yield curv began to invert  may   th  the last occas the committe chang rate  and novemb   th  this past monday   each red diamond reflect a treasuri issu   the gap for the period between    and    year reflect the fact that for this exercis the callabl have been locat on their call date and not their matur date   so we ve shift all those matur down   i d make four observ from look at these comparison   in the chart for novemb   th  while the slope of the a   industri corpor index is rough the same now as it was in may of       it is clear that the yield curv has shift     basi point higher   so over that  e horizon we see a certain tighten of financi condit  at least for this credit grade  second  howev  the short end of the corpor curv is consider lower now than it was in may or in januari of this year   so  over that  e horizon  for this credit grade you would see a certain eas of financi condit   third  the widen of the corpor spread to treasuri of this index actual occur between januari and may  between the date depict at the upper right and the lower left   and there s realli onli a modest uptick in the widen of their spread to treasuri from may to now for this higher grade   we know that lower grade credit have deterior over this period  but i found it quit signific to realiz that the widen relat to this higher credit grade occur in the first half of the year   final  the most noteworthi movement on these panel is the collaps of the short end of the treasuri curv  which occur between may and novemb  with the hump out to two year complet invert and come down   clear  this reflect the anticip of eas  which has increas been price into the market over the summer and into the fall  reflect the market    read of the data   you pay me in part to worri   i must say that i do have a small worri that we will never know what part of this collaps of the hump was caus by our chang with respect to our outright oper  about     billion of the     billion of outright we purchas this year have been in matur of five year and under   now  we   ll never know the counterfactu   but i believ had we continu to purchas even across the curv  that we might have had a more profound effect on the long end  where condit were get thinner and where the treasuri was buy back issu   so there was no free lunch here for us   i want to be clear that i think the predomin movement in the short end should be attribut to the market    price in the eas base on the fundament   but it s not without some anxieti that i note our own oper could have play a small part   turn to the next page  let me just go over the current status of our oper   in the top portion of this tabl we show the chang in our forecast look forward to the year end   there has been relat littl   chang in our forecast of reserv need from late septemb to now   thing seem to be come in pretti much as expect   i   ll actual come back to these in a minut  i have a better pictur of our project on the next page   in the middl of page   you can see detail on our outright purchas  we had purchas a littl more than     billion through earli octob and we have purchas anoth    billion sinc then   and you can see how much has been in the short end  follow the guidelin we adopt in juli   in the bottom panel you can see that the averag level of our short term rps in the current novemb  shown in the right column  is run about    billion   we   ve start to increas the longer term book a littl  anticip a year end averag of almost     billion   in the bottom part of the tabl on rps you can see that the mix of collater we are take now is still predomin treasuri debt  at    percent   the rest is divid between agenc debt and mortgag back secur   turn to the last page  i   ve tri to give you a sens of how we plan to manag reserv around year end   in the top panel we ve depict factor drain reserv from the system   the orang line show the impact of chang in autonom factor  princip currenc   the   line show the addit drain occur as a consequ of our cumul redempt  here all base on chang from octob  rd   as you can see  we are expect a drain of about     billion as we get into the year end period   the bottom panel give you a sens of how we   ve been manag this reserv need and how we plan to manag it   the dot repres actual oper and the solid line give a sens of our forecast  work up from the bottom of that page  we plan to buy anoth    billion outright between now and the year end  meet part of the reserv need that way   we expect to increas our    day book of repo to a peak of     billion at year end and then begin unwind that   and on our current forecast we will have about    billion outstand of temporari short term rps at year end   i don t yet have ani precis forecast  and i wouldn t pretend to  of how we will manag that on the other side of the year end   but the    day book will start to unwind and we   ll see where we are  we   d then begin accumul outright  but i think i ll wait to see how thing evolv befor make a forecast for that   i   ve mention to the committe that the treasuri was plan to announc a chang in the bid rule for our foreign account   they made that announc ye day   i think it went rather well   we   ve work with the japanes author and i think their comfort level with respect to this chang is now much higher   we are in a posit to help manag their particip in competit auction next year by work veri close with   them on this   veri few other countri are realli affect by the rule chang  but we have been talk to those countri that are affect   so  i want you to be awar that that announc was made ye day   there are no foreign oper to report  mr  chairman   i ll need the committe s vote to ratifi our domest oper   i d be happi to answer ani question
i m not forecast this  but suppos we had an unanticip need for signific eas   is the structur in the market out there thick enough for us to be abl to do it without creat some problem
i believ so   i can   t think of ani problem that would
are we anywher near the point where you re get concern about the suppli   theoret  as you know  we can get to a point where we could have signific disrupt effect in the market if we stay with our current procedur and had to introduc a dramat amount of eas into the marketplac   but is it your judgment that we   re nowher near that area for the  e be
i can t think of a variabl over the next six or eight month that would realli press us in that way   if we had to add a lot of reserv  we could affect some spread   but i don t think there would be a capac limit
no  i   m not refer to spread   i   m refer to the extent to which we creat distort in the marketplac that have advers secondari effect
our current level of oper is not trivial in size as we look to the year end   i don   t think we   re disturb spread relat now as we anticip increas the book to about     billion  i   m sure there are extrem scenario under which we would have a temporari effect on spread over the next six month if we had to inject a realli larg amount of reserv  which i assum we would do through aggress repo oper   but i think our  methodolog of price our three tier of collater separ and tri to reflect what   s in the  market will mitig  though obvious not elimin  the impact that a signific increas in our oper would have on spread
i would onli add  mr  chairman  that if the committe want to eas interest rate quit consider  i think the extra reserv we would have to add would be veri  veri small  given the veri low level of requir reserv and the inelast demand for reserv  actual  we would have to buy veri few extra secur in order to effect an eas
that   s an import part of the answer
it   s just not that much
that lead me to a relat question on an issu you didn   t mention  the fair signific open up of spread between a   industri corpor and swap rate between may and now   are we see strict credit risk there
i worri that we don   t know enough to answer that with ani certainti  had i plot the fanni mae or freddi mac yield on these four panel  on this scale they would have smother the swap rate and not come through on the page
i   m sorri  what do you mean by smother
you wouldn   t have been abl to see the distinct on the chart   they would have been so close togeth that there would be no gap between them
between fanni and freddi yield and the swap
yes  those agenc yield would have been right on top of the swap rate   the impress i have from talk to peopl at those agenc and in the market is that the agenc use the swap market veri activ to manag their interest rate exposur   and i have a fair amount of concern about which is the tail and which is the dog with respect to the  swap market   fanni mae and freddi mac debt has perform well sinc their joint  announc relat to the issu rais by congressman baker   the spread have come down and the swap rate have come down   i am increas uncomfort about whether i know enough to interpret the spread relat to the swap rate movement
it   s as if fanni and freddi are co opt the swap market
that   s a concern i have   i want to be clear that i can   t put a finger on it   but look at financi condit  i   m suspici of the notion that the financi sector  whose credit stand behind the swap rate  is somehow improv so much more in these circumst than a   industri corpor   that seem to me to be someth about which we don   t have ani real evid   so you caught me unprepar   i intent did not address the widen of the swap to a   spread becaus i didn   t have enough inform to explain it   i worri that it   s in part the agenc role and in part that swap rate tend to be drawn down perhap more by treasuri as a parallel in how peopl trade them and use them
what happen to the benchmark debat under these condit
that   s a concern i   ve had for some  e  whether agenc or swap are the right benchmark   if the two are move in tandem  then neither one of them is go to be a veri good benchmark under certain condit of stress
we also have a sens  mr  chairman  that the spread on margin invest grade yield have widen  even asid from the special effect   i agre with    i think he probabl put his finger on what   s go on between the swap and the agenc  that margin invest grade yield probabl have risen relat to risk free rate  adjust for  everyth   so  the concern about risk extend beyond the junk bond market into the lower end   of the invest grade market   and that might be affect these spread
final  with respect to the notion that the strong dollar is creat real problem for our trade partner  are they recommend that we lower interest rate or interven or what   i   m just ask  becaus i haven   t heard this   in other word  who is do the draw in  if i may put it that way   my understand is that it is their citizen who are run from their financi market to our   and the problem is
i agre with you complet  mr  chairman   i was tri to give member of the committe a flavor of the angst among some of our colleagu
they should be rais serious question with their citizen
i don   t disagre with you  mr  chairman
so  they   re not talk about block the inflow of capit into this countri by put up barrier or impos tariff
no   i think you hear these voic as clear as i do  and perhap more so   but i thought the committe should understand the level of anxieti about this in the central bank around the world
you understand my question is pure rhetor
i   m make sure it   s fulli reflect in the transcript
further question for
mr  chairman  i have a question  but first i have an observ on that point   i don   t think it matter which way the exchang rate is move   from the perspect of  the rest of the world  it   s alway our fault if somebodi els is have problem   that   s my   read of the histori of that  on the yield curv on page    the most recent observ in the lower right corner is obvious veri  veri unusu  and i   d like to offer anoth observ about that   what strike me is this pervas sens develop in the market that there   s go to be a polici eas ahead   at the same  e  the expect is that it will happen but not yet    i ask a member of my staff to print out a chart of both the five year and two year treasuri yield in term of their differenti in relat to the three month ahead fed fund futur market   what you see on the chart is that there are two instanc when that spread had becom as larg as it is now   one was in the fall of        i think it   s clear that the issu then was the flight to qualiti in the two year to five year area  that involv more of a liquid flight to qualiti than an expect issu   the other case was back in the spring of        so  what we have is the sens that there   s go to be a polici eas  but not yet   it   s off into the futur quit a bit   and that  i think  is quit odd  base on our experi of the last    to    year anyway  or sinc we have had the fed fund futur market   i just offer that observ
i think it   s a good one   further question   if not  would somebodi like to make a motion
move approv of the domest oper  speaker      second
we move to dave   and vinc reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   we have receiv a consider slug of data sinc we publish the  book last week   for the most part  those read have had littl effect on our outlook   we still es  that real gdp rose about       percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and will rise about       percent in the current quarter      retail sale  releas ye day  rose     percent in octob  held down by weak sale of motor vehicl   exclud auto dealer and build materi suppli store  sale rose a relat modest     percent last month after jump     percent in septemb  both about in line with our expect   as you know  auto sale fell about a million unit at an annual rate in octob  to a      million unit pace   there has been some real weaken here  and the carmak have been hold up sale onli with relat generous incent   taken togeth  these few fragment of data leav us comfort with our project increas in real pce of       percent in q    in a bit of ancient histori  data on retail inventori for septemb were releas this morn   retail stock exclud those at auto dealer were about unchang for the month  close to the assumpt made by the bea  for the most part  stock to sale ratio remain low at retail   howev  inventori overhang have crop up in some area of late  most notabl in the motor vehicl sector   assembl have been trim consider in order to limit ani further rise in day   s suppli  and these cutback are take about     percentag point off gdp growth in the second half of this year   in addit  inventori problem in steel  construct materi  paper  and textil appear to be prompt some product adjust   inde  we have seen a percept slow in factori output in recent month   total industri product  which we publish this morn  is es  to have been unchang in octob   outsid of motor vehicl  factori output rose     percent last month   although high tech product pick up a bit in octob  activ in this sector has cool sinc the y k relat surg earlier this year   invest spend for high tech equip  on net  has also slow some of late   while outlay for comput and softwar have remain veri strong  there has been a drop off in spend for communic equip  order backlog  though  continu to build  suggest that the outright declin regist by communic equip for the third quarter is like to be short live   the data we now have in hand for the tech sector are more consist with a moder than a slump   elsewher  growth of e s spend has slow  but onli modest and along with the growth of final sale   in contrast to equip spend  nonresidenti construct activ appear to have pick up recent   low vacanc rate and rise rent appear to be provid support to this sector     despit some zig and zag  activ in hous market has basic move sideway or down from the level seen earlier in the year   onli sale of new home  which soar in septemb  are signal ani serious rebound   but in the spirit of the  e  i refus to conced defeat here  and i shall await the result of a recount  which will come in the form of revis sale figur later this month    laughter   sum up the near term  growth of real gdp appear to have slow consider in the second half of the year  but onli by a bit more than we had expect at the  e of the last meet   look further ahead  these incom data alon would not have warrant ani more than a small adjust to the outlook for      and        howev  financi condit have tighten notic over the intermeet period  and we expect this to persist and perhap to intensifi a bit over the project interv   interest rate have risen especi sharpli for below invest grade borrow   but even those at the lower end of the invest grade spectrum have seen widen spread and a less recept market for new bond issu   in equiti market  compani    stock price have been hammer for fail to meet earn expect  with the tech sector especi hard hit  in respons  we have knock almost   percent off the level of stock price go forward in this  book   moreov  bank have further tighten term and standard on loan to busi custom   taken togeth  these develop have led us to mark down our forecast for the growth of real gdp by a bit more than     percentag point in each of the next two year   while we have trim a bit from our consumpt forecast  reflect the hit to wealth  the most signific downward adjust was to our forecast of equip spend  especi communic equip   both capit market and bank appear to have becom more concern about this sector   s abil to generat the previous expect return   but the tighten of financi condit in recent week has extend beyond the communic sector  and we have lower our project for more tradit capit equip as well   i should emphas that these adjust are as much judgment as scienc   as you probabl know  standard econometr model have difficulti identifi signific interest rate effect on invest spend  let alon differenti effect by the qualiti of the borrow   that said  we are bow in the direct of econom principl and are forecast that capit spend will be squeez by higher interest rate and tighter lend standard in the period ahead        the revis we have made to our outlook for invest also have implic for the suppli side of our forecast   becaus invest spend has been lower  so too has the pace of capit deepen   this  in turn  reduc the growth of structur labor product and potenti output  consequ  even though we have mark down our forecast for the growth of real gdp  we are show onli a slight higher unemploy rate and virtual no chang in our inflat outlook   obvious  we see our forecast as the most like outcom for the next two year   but i think it is fair to say that the downsid risk to the project were easier for us to envis than the upsid risk   in particular  the cyclic weaken in corpor earn that we are project to occur over the next two year could prompt a more negat reaction in financi market than we have allow for in this forecast   if that is the case  there could be a more pronounc retrench of invest outlay and  through the wealth effect  consum spend   we examin in the  book a coupl of variant of a tech led weaken of invest spend   one of the messag of those simul was that  although the growth of real output was weaker and the unemploy rate higher  inflat would be littl chang to a bit abov that in our baselin forecast   the reason  of cours  is that slower growth of invest lead to less rapid gain in structur product and more pressur on unit labor cost   in essenc  we experi the mirror imag of the past few year  when fa  product growth was accompani by lower unemploy without acceler price   i won   t repeat ani further the detail of the simul present in the  book   instead  i thought i might take up the somewhat more challeng assign of argu the upsid risk to the project   let me start with fiscal polici   a more even divid congress could result in gridlock  call into question even the modest s ulus in fiscal year      that we have built into the project   but it seem everi bit as like that the larg on budget surplus that we have project could serv as a power lubric to overcom the partisan friction that otherwis could prevent movement   this autumn   s scrambl to spend might well be a precursor to more aggress fiscal eas next year  and it demonstr how rapid the surplus could be dissip by mani small action   a second risk is that we may be overreact to the recent tighten of financi condit   the economi weather what seem to be a bigger threat in        to be sure  our polici action provid consider        reassur  but the uncertainti about the global economi were undoubt much greater then than now   at that  e  we also saw a weaken in our industri sector   but on the whole  the expans bare skip a beat   moreov  in the present circumst  the upsid risk to inflat that would accompani a reacceler of activ are probabl greater than a coupl of year ago   most broad measur of inflat  headlin and core  bottom out in      or      and have move up sinc then   while the uncertainti remain veri larg  we have seen littl in the recent wage and price data to contradict our view that the economi is oper beyond it potenti   of cours  if a reacceler of activ were to occur  our abil to absorb it without ad inflat pressur would be influenc import by product develop   and that bring me to a final upsid risk to our project of activ   i recogn that some of you view our outlook for product and potenti output as near the outsid edg of plausibl   but we view the risk here as two side   a further sharp acceler of product  such as we have experienc  could provid consider support for corpor earn and stock price   this would like be accompani by an eas of the credit qualiti concern that now appear to be weigh so heavili on lender and investor   the fa  product growth could help to limit or even revers  at least for a  e  ani further upward movement in inflat   while it   s not our best guess  one would not need to stare too long at our forecast error in recent year to recogn that this scenario is not without plausibl   with that  i   ll turn the floor over to vinc reinhart
the outlook for foreign economi in the  book should seem familiar   after all  it share key properti with the past few project prepar for the committe this year   for one  the staff anticip that econom growth in most major industri economi and in the develop world will be solid over the next two year  albeit somewhat slower than the rapid pace record in the first half of        this step down in the rate of gdp growth owe both to the age of the expans as pent up demand are increas satisfi and to monetari polici firm around the world as resourc util rise   in europ      percentag point of polici tighten by the european central bank within the next year will work to offset the s ulus to net export eman from the earlier depreci of the euro  hold growth to around             percent over the forecast period   in the develop countri  output ul  settl at around a   percent pace   for anoth  japan onc again is an outlier   our read of incom data lead us to believ japanes real gdp will be virtual flat in the second half of        the recent announc fiscal packag mere keep the level of the deficit about unchang  impli no net impetus to growth from fiscal polici   with huge ongo fiscal deficit and rapid mount debt  policymak in japan will be look for ani opportun to begin to scale back govern spend and rais tax   inde  the mount challeng to the current prime minist appear to hing import on call to scale back public work spend  which is increas seen in japan as ineffect   meanwhil  household appear reluct to spend   in that environ  we see the japanes economi as tread water for the next coupl year  expand   percent and       percent in      and       respect   we think that slight pickup in growth  by the way  will provid the bank of japan enough rational to tighten polici by a small amount toward the end of the forecast period   take our cue from oil futur market  we again expect oil price to declin go forward  essenti revers almost one half of the run up wit sinc the end of        those futur price align with our assess of fundament   we anticip that current pressur will lift as lean inventori are restock in the near term and global capac expand to fill the increas in demand associ with steadi world econom growth in the intermedi run   those lean inventori  of cours  impli that there is current less of a cushion to absorb unexpect fluctuat in suppli or demand  place a wide uncertainti band around our point forecast  particular in the near term   and  we are stick with our outlook that the dollar will depreci go forward   the specif assumpt in the novemb  book is that the broad real foreign exchang valu of the dollar will shed about       percent next year and the year after   again  this owe to our view that the step down in econom growth and profit in the unit state and accumul current account deficit will tax foreign investor    willing to continu to add u s  oblig to their portfolio on net   while the basic structur of our project   not differ much from those in the past few  book  we tri to convey a sens of a chang tone  in that the risk to the foreign outlook now seem better balanc   as you recal  for much of this year we   ve been in the posit of catch up to surpris good incom read in most foreign economi   and our project for econom growth have accord edg higher meet       after meet   this  e  backward look read on activ have unfold in the past six week about as we had expect   and forward look indic of spend in europ and japan  includ survey of household and busi confid  have been a bit softer on balanc  lead us to notch lower our second half project of real gdp growth   in addit  the fund difficulti in argentina over the past few week serv as a remind that old style financi crise remain possibl in a new world economi  further underscor the notion of downsid risk  with a fiscal deficit of around   percent of gdp and extern debt amount to about    percent of gdp  argentina is over reliant on the confid of foreign investor   while offici there have done much to extend debt matur and line up conting fund  roll over the bulg in debt matur in the next two year look to be a close run thing   the news out of bueno air and washington over the weekend  includ the promis of govern effort to trim the social secur system and rein in the civil servic compens and provinci spend in return for fund from the imf and the multilater develop bank  was general favor  howev  report of late suggest that it may be difficult to get the provinci governor on board a reform bandwagon   our work assumpt remain  as in the  book  that argentina will squeak through these fund problem and keep it currenc board arrang intact   in ani case  i would note that the altern simul in part i of the  book suggest that as long as ani crisi

thank you   question for our colleagu
dave  over the past year the core cpi is up about       percent and the core pce is up about     percent   part ii of the  book suggest that the differ between these two indic is almost exclus due to the imput price for non price servic like bank servic   given that  which index do you think is provid the best indic of core inflat
i don   t know whether that   s a lead question or not    laughter  actual  as we have said in the past  i believ it would be a mistak to reli on ani singl index  so  what we have tri to do in our analys is to present some of the pros and con of the various index for you  as policymak  to consid in order to reach some kind of a judgment  my judgment would be that there has been a pickup in under core inflat   but the core pce has probabl underst that pickup becaus of these imput price  which are more statist construct than actual measur   it   s quit conceiv that the cpi has overst that acceler in part becaus  as we have note  we have some doubt about the weight structur of the cpi   anoth sourc of discrep between the pce and the cpi over the last year has been that the cpi is show a much sharper acceler in medic servic price than the pce  which use a ppi measur rather than the measur use in the consum price index   i think there are some question about the qualiti of the medic care price as measur in the cpi   so if i can weav my way to an answer  i   d say that a rate somewher in between those two measur probabl captur the right sens of what has been go on
on medic care  of cours  busi tell us that they have seen huge    increas over the last    month in term of their cost   i   m not say which one look as though it   s
but you   re talk about cost  not price   what   s happen is that the physic volum of medic care is go up veri dramat
the usag has risen   but there   s no doubt that when we budget for premium increas that we charg our employe  the increas are huge across the board
but a good part of that is improv medic care becaus the technolog is move at a veri rapid pace   and it   s pretti obvious that the actual health insur premium reflect far more than price
inde  there   s a veri serious question among a number of analyst in this area as to whether medic price actual have been go down  not up   but there   s no question that the dollar amount are veri larg and veri bothersom
and there is no doubt that  in some sens in our forecast  the increas cost associ with higher medic care insur premium be paid by employ do feed back through on the cost side of the equat into price   whether or not it   s price or quantiti
yes  through compens
i had a question for you about product   we all know    that labor market are veri tight now by histor standard and that product is increas at veri high rate by histor standard   we   re in this slow growth period now and anticip some further slow go forward   i wonder if you   ve given ani thought to  or done ani analysi on  whether the cyclic slowdown in product will be ani differ this  e  given that we   re start at such a low unemploy rate   also  have you thought about whether this is go to affect the way we can separ out the structur product from cyclic product
i   d say we   ve given more thought than hard core analysi to this question   obvious  one could imagin that we would see a greater cyclic weaken in product in tight labor market  as firm perhap would be veri reluct to shed worker given how hard it was to get these peopl on their payrol   so that would be one argument for an even sharper deceler of cyclic product  perhap  than we are show in this forecast   that could  then  have consequ as well for corpor profit   on the other hand  we don   t know veri much about how the cyclic behavior of the labor market might have chang in recent year as a result of structur chang in the labor forc   anoth factor is the abil of firm  in essenc  not to pay the high fix cost of worker by use more temporari worker to provid a cushion  make it easier for them to implement hour adjust in respons to a slowdown than they have in the past   it could veri well be this  e around that firm would just be call up the temporari help agenc and say  in effect     don   t send us as mani worker this week as you gave us last week      in that case  there would be less of a cyclic respons   now  what make this so difficult to es  at ani aggreg level is that the      last  e we had a cyclic occurr was    year ago   and the previous cyclic occurr    was    year prior to that   in essenc we have two observ sinc      on this issu  a period in which there has been a lot of structur chang   so we have veri littl confid that we realli have a good handl on this   we   re just tri to feel our way through as we watch what is happen   so  i think there   s a wide band of uncertainti  but you   re hit on an import element in the forecast go forward from here
we talk to the peopl at manpow on a regular basi  and a comment our contact made to me this  e is that their forecast for job open  which i   ll mention later  has set anoth record   there are a lot of open that haven   t been fill  they are just sort of sit there   this is specul on his part  but he know the data veri well  and he   s say that compani at the lower end may not be fill these open becaus they are not tri that hard to fill them   the open are there  and at the right wage these firm would fill them   but they are not rais wage enough to fill them   in fact  manpow is not see ani larg increas in compens   if that   s accur  it probabl would support the second part of what you   re say here
yes  inde
i have two question   around st  loui we have some automobil plant that are shut down on temporari layoff   and i think we might want to be sure that we understand the shutdown this week becaus this is the week of the employ survey   and if we have a substanti number of peopl on temporari layoff  that will show up in the      employ survey number that is report at the begin of next month   i think we should be    awar of that   do you have ani idea what that number is like to be  my second comment is on an entir differ subject   i think the discrep between your fed fund assumpt and the assumpt in the market is the largest i   ve seen in the two and a half year i   ve been here   perhap you could comment on the signific of that
in term of our forecast for novemb payrol  we   re look for privat payrol employ gain of about         and no gain at all in the manufactur sector   now  we think the spike we saw last week in initi claim for unemploy insur was probabl in substanti part a reflect of these temporari layoff in the automot sector  so we   re expect that to show through  in term of the discrep between our forecast assumpt for the fed fund rate and the market    forecast  obvious they   re look for some combin of either greater econom weak than we are expect go forward or a more rapid respons by the committe   in essenc  we are not tri to forecast what the committe will do   we just tri to lay out a use baselin for your discuss   by our assess  we need to hold the real feder fund rate at about it current level in order to cap inflat at rough       percent for core pce   obvious  there   s a huge amount of guesswork involv in make an assess like that   but in our forecast we still see consider support for overal activ go forward  in part becaus we have an upbeat view as to what is go on with product   moreov  i think we have made an import assumpt that  as i indic in my remark  is certain open to some question   and that assumpt is that through a period in which there are like to be some disappoint in term of corpor earn  invest is go to be relat well      maintain   we think peopl are go to be look further down the road  view this more    as a cyclic slow in earn rather than a reflect of a more negat longer term outlook for overal product and corpor earn   and by our judgment we   ll have basic a stronger under economi   the risk that i tri to point to is that there could  in fact  be less patienc in that regard  or more concern as the earn growth slow about the under health of the economi  which could have feedback effect through financi market   and that would depress activ more than we are current forecast
i have two technic comment about the simul occas by the last discuss   i   ve had troubl sinc i   ve been here with the baselin assumpt on the feder fund rate   it   s not quit a flat fund rate  though that simul is present   it   s not quit anyth  and it is hard to know just exact what it   mean   one thing dave just said  which i probabl should have thought of befor now but hadn   t  is that this assumpt may essenti be a flat real fund rate   it may not be far off from that   so one thing that might help us understand this could be an explanatori footnot  i   m not necessarili go to ask for anoth simul becaus there are a lot alreadi  on how the baselin fund rate assumpt compar with a flat real fund rate   that might be help in just understand what the monetari assumpt is  my second comment is that i don   t know if you   ve ever actual done a fund rate assumpt that featur the market   s assess   have you   i don   t know
we haven   t   that would be relat straightforward to do     obvious  what that would show  take off from our baselin forecast  is a lot more growth and more inflat
but again  mayb if you have an easier polici simul  or someth like that  there could be a footnot on just how this set of assumpt correspond with the fund rate path from the futur market
when we think about tri to do those sort of thing  we also have the problem of what to assum about other asset market price   if we adopt the path from the futur market curv  then what do we assum for stock price or what should we do for the exchang valu of the dollar
but  of cours  it   s the same market that is generat the futur market and the stock market   in a way that kind of problem make it more difficult to interpret the present baselin
but we don   t have as clear a road map for  say  the exchang valu of the dollar or equiti price as we do in the money market futur curv
there   s also a further conceptu problem as to whether the implicit model that   s in the market is the same as the one we have
in some sens clear it is not
yes  it   s like mix appl and orang here   you   re take one forecast and anoth rate assumpt that   s base on a differ model and a differ forecast   i think the comparison that is alway worthwhil to make is to ask how your baselin feder fund      rate forecast relat to what   s in the futur market   but i don   t find particular instruct a    forecast that use the futur market interest rate and otherwis the staff assumpt
go back to       s question  i was interest in your discuss of risk   on the up side there   s a risk that i don   t think you mention   you mention that product could grow at a greater rate than you expect   if there   s a cyclic downturn in product or if our es  of structur product is higher than it actual is  isn   t there a potenti  anyway  for some upsid inflat risk   isn   t it possibl to see stabl or declin rate of unemploy  more pressur on labor market  and more pressur on inflat with a lower level of potenti and some kind of reason solid demand   so  there is that risk on the up side  which you didn   t realli talk much about   and then on the down side  is there ani way of weight the risk in term of financi condit   i   m told that not onli have risk spread increas  but also there have been more downgrad    so  there   s a greater number of compani in lower invest grade than  let   s say  a year or two ago  and it strike me as reason that that   s actual go on   is there a way of come to ani assess of the overal pressur that develop is put on fund in general
the answer to that is yes  and my colleagu   olin has undertaken such a calcul in term of tri to weight where the various financ is take place by the qualiti of the borrow
did you come up with some assess of relat financi tight
we have some rough es    i wouldn   t character them as    anyth more than that   what we actual did was to look at the movement in bond yield for invest grade borrow and for specul grade borrow  look at the whole group in each case   then we tri to take a weight averag of those two that reflect the share of invest spend that borrow in each group did relat to one anoth   the invest grade group is by far the larg major   it   s on the order of rough    percent  which tend to suggest that we should be put more weight on what is happen in the invest grade part of the market where condit don   t look near as advers as in the specul grade part  nonetheless  there is a nontrivi weight on what is happen in that lower end of the market that should be taken into account
and there   s also some widen of the spread within the invest grade  too
there is  which is taken account of in this calcul that i just mention   so if we take a weight averag of how bond yield have move sinc the begin of the year  they   re up about    basi point  and from the  e of the last fomc meet  they   re up about    basi point   there   s wide variat around those increas  depend on whether you look at the specul grade firm  where spread have risen dramat  or the higher grade firm in the invest grade categori  where they haven   t risen much
can you look back to  let   s say       and compar that kind of weight averag with the weight averag that appli then
i can compar the weight averag that appli then versus where it    stand now and it   s up about     basi point from        i   m not sure what you
i   m tri to figur out the relat tight in some analyt way as oppos to an anecdot way   we hear plenti of anecdot  but can we in some analyt way figur out whether the market are as tight as they were dure the credit crunch  or whatev we call it  after the crise of        or are they by some measur less tight than they were then
that   s a veri hard question to answer   for the lower grade borrow  the spread now are as high and perhap a littl higher than they were in the fall of
but my sens is that the market are not as disrupt now as they were in the fall of
right  that   s what we hear anecdot  too   i just wonder if there   s a way to come to grip with that on an analyt basi
i haven   t  but
but as you know  in the econom literatur on how these various credit channel affect spend  it   s still pretti murki even after the earlier      episod and the one in        there is consider debat as to how much credit suppli condit actual imping on spend   we think they do  and we have tri to make some allow for that  but as i   ve indic  it realli is more a seat of the pant type of judgment than one might normal feel comfort do
i realiz that  and you talk about the essenc of the downsid risk    in a way that i complet agre with   it certain is one thing that has increas sinc the last meet
i want to go back to the point that ned   was make   it   s true that with a differ fed fund trajectori there would be issu about what to do with asset price  but  of cours  we have the same problem today becaus we have the market with this trajectori of expect that are determin current asset price  the takeoff point for the outlook   so i think it is a real conundrum   it   s a veri  veri difficult problem  and i understand that   but the polici signific for us is that we have perhap an unusu larg discrep between the view in the market and the view of our expert on this outlook   and that   s clear someth that we   re go to have to grappl with in think about where we go from here
ani further question   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   let me spend a littl  e on develop in our district   growth across the tenth district continu to moder and some of the slow appear to be the result of labor suppli constraint   but there is also evid that the pace of demand is slow   moreov  in talk with busi leader throughout our district at least  i ve notic a shift in sen ent about futur activ   there is increas concern about the possibl of a more signific slowdown come   have said that  privat employ growth remain close to the nation averag in most district state   colorado   s privat employ growth  while still the highest in the district  has fallen consider  from      about a       percent rate in mid      to       percent now  and growth there clear exceed    that in the rest of the district  manufactur activ was flat in octob in our district  although capac util remain relat high   look forward  district manufactur have been lower their expect   a manufactur survey reveal the second consecut downward revis in capit spend plan   this obvious rais some question as to whether product gain will be sustain in that environ   it may also help to explain the shift in sen ent i mention a littl earlier  residenti construct activ continu to cool in the district   exclud colorado  singl famili hous permit have fallen for four consecut quarter  leav the level down about    percent sinc the fourth quarter of        indic of the slowdown  our busi contact in kansa citi report that start  e on hous have now declin from about    day to around    day   in contrast  though  singl famili permit in colorado are up about    percent and median price in that area are up about    percent year over year   nonresidenti construct activ has fallen even more sharpli in most of our district   for exampl  in the third quarter the valu of nonresidenti construct was down about a third everywher in the district but in colorado  where it was down about    percent  energi activ  in contrast  continu of cours to benefit from the higher energi price   district count of activ oil and gas rig have increas for about eight month in a row and are now the highest sinc decemb        drill contractor have accumul a sizabl backlog of job commit  but growth is constrain by a lack of skill worker in that      industri   mani have left the oil industri and it is hard to get them to come back at the wage    level that are now prevail  labor market overal have remain tight  but with veri littl chang in wage pressur that we   ve notic   the district s unemploy rate was about     percent in septemb  below the nation averag   intel  for exampl  attribut a delay of sever month in open a new comput chip fabric plant in colorado spring  origin schedul for novemb  to difficulti in hire  especi construct worker  manufactur are see higher input price but they are not abl to pass those cost through in price   and our farm economi continu to see littl chang   cotton crop product was veri strong and  therefor  we continu to see obvious downward pressur on price  let me turn to the nation economi   the incom data confirm  as dave alreadi note in his brief  an ongo process of moder in the econom expans   the lower rate of gdp growth in the third quarter help to confirm that slow   i realiz the key question is  of cours  whether the third quarter result repres a respit or a new trend   to be sure  the third quarter growth in consumpt expenditur at an annual rate of better than   percent is unlik to be sustain  but earli indic for the fourth quarter suggest that consum are follow the rest of the economi toward a more moder pace   and i think that s signific  nevertheless  i remain satisfi with the outlook for econom activ   i expect the economi to grow near it sustain rate  along the line describ by the staff in it project  despit a pickup in compens cost and the acceler in overal inflat this year  the under inflat rate remain relat modest in my opinion   on balanc  the unwind of      the effect of higher energi price in conjunct with the       percent fed fund rate should    place some downward pressur on under inflat over the forecast horizon  let me note quick  though  the risk in the outlook   while inflat risk are still real  they have moder to some degre for the reason i   ve just describ   in contrast  and i think this is consist with what the staff said in it brief today  my view is that the downsid risk to econom activ have increas somewhat   i believ that growth slow to trend is the most like outcom   but i also believ there are greater downsid risk stem from recent develop  and i   d like to tick off some that i would highlight   first  financi condit have tighten and the downturn in econom activ has soften corpor balanc sheet  also  we have the higher interest rate spread that we ve talk about today  tighter lend term and standard  lower equiti price  an increas in the cost of capit to some degre  and increas avers to the risk of more specul invest   junk bond default rate are up  rate downgrad are more preval  and profit are lower   debt as a share of net worth has been rise more quick in       after level off in prior year  and debt servic cost are increas  these are factor that are on the horizon and they are affect the balanc of risk with which we need to deal   and while none of these develop mean that growth will deceler beyond our expect  i think we are in a more riski period in term of our econom project and the outlook   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth in our southeast region continu to be veri healthi  although sinc our last meet we have seen further evid of      moder   retail sale did actual strengthen somewhat in octob and we   ve been told that    they now appear to be on plan to reach last season s level   at the same  e  most retail remain nervous about holiday sale  a concern that is reflect in more frequent and earlier discount and a cautious approach to inventori  as in the nation  residenti real estat activ in our area clear has slow   it is now below year ago level   until veri recent that slowdown had not reach florida  especi the boom southwest florida coast   but that has now chang as well   a nashvill director report that     home are now list for sale for          or more in that market compar with onli    at this  e last year   the nonresidenti real estat market  especi for offic structur  where vacanc rate have been low and declin  has been stronger than the residenti market   also  our import tourism industri is now anticip a slight slower season than a year ago due to the impact of the slow pace of econom growth  higher gasolin price  and the strong dollar  area of notabl strength in our region includ  not unexpect  the oil and gas sector but also some old economi manufactur industri like auto and shipbuild   the auto industri and it supplier continu to move south  and the backlog of order for our shipbuild includ high speed passeng ferri  larg multi deck  doubl hold barg  missil cruiser  destroy  and even a cruis ship  dave   alreadi comment on this at the nation level  but i ve been particular struck by the report from our field staff of bank examin sinc our last meet  they see a measur slowdown in loan demand across most type of busi loan and a further tighten in credit standard   some bank tell us that commerci loan deal are      evapor earli in the underwrit process and that the loan pipelin is almost dri beyond       day   there is reduc lend to problemat sector  includ textil  health care  communic  and theater  and higher price and a more select grant of credit for real estat and to nonprim borrow   i take this inform as evid that market are work  on the price front  the pressur point remain the same  although we are hear an occasion comment about the slightest  and i underscor both    occasion    and    slightest     relief in some labor market   the avail and qualiti of labor remain a major constraint  labor cost  especi with the renew pressur from rise health care expens  are still wide perceiv as a major threat to profit   we continu to get report of new fuel and petroleum relat surcharg but we do not detect  as other have also said  ani fundament chang in the abil of busi to pass on most input cost increas   profit are often the shock absorb  turn to the nation economi  i think the  book has done a good job of lay out my own view of the like path of the economi in the period ahead and of pinpoint the area where we should get some moder   it   seem more like now that the moder will persist  but our past experi remind us that the expect pullback in invest and the constraint on govern spend could easili be revers   although one could take some comfort in the recent inflat experi and the inflat outlook by focus onli on core measur  i do not think this is the  e to let down our guard   in my view it is like that unit labor cost will come under pressur as tight labor market and rise health care cost intersect with product gain that may well fall off to at least more moder level as output growth slow   until we have evid in hand of the expect retreat in energi price  i think we have      to watch for still more pass through of direct and indirect energi cost as busi feel the    profit squeez  sum up  mani of our own staff forecast  as well as those of most commerci forecast  suggest that inflat risk remain on the up side   clear  the path of oil price and what happen to product will be critic   i now believ the risk to real gdp growth have shift toward the down side  but there is consider uncertainti about that   sever of us have suggest at recent meet that our next key polici decis may be about when to eas or when to signal a more balanc view of the risk  but i don   t think we are yet at that point   i do sens  howev  that we might soon be face a situat where a polici shift may be call for at just the  e when short term indic of inflat may be on an uptrend and real growth is slow   explain a polici shift at such a  e will be our challeng   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   news from the seventh district is similar to what i report last  e   we   re continu to get report of slower activ from a larg number of industri  although the list of industri report a slow in activ has not chang much sinc our earli octob meet  econom activ in the seventh district is still at high level  tight labor market have not led to much pickup in wage gain  although rise health care cost remain a big concern and competit still prevent firm from pass along higher energi and higher labor cost  retail have been report moder sale gain for sever month  and that may be one reason mani are apprehens about the critic holiday shop season ahead   our latest survey of michigan retail  for exampl  show that most merchant expect sale to be higher this season but both the number of retail project sale gain and their expect sale growth were the lowest sinc we start this survey six year ago   other report indic that promot activ will be heavier and will start earlier in the holiday season than last year       light vehicl sale did slow in octob  particular for light truck   and our auto    industri contact indic that earli novemb sale were relat soft as well   big three contact note a desir to pull back somewhat on cost incent program  although they are still be use  particular on those model where inventori are excess   recent this mean that incent were be offer on light truck  which for some model was unpreced  high inventori were also a factor in automak    decis to cut product schedul by temporarili close plant  cut third shift  and or reduc over   unemploy insur claim have risen late in the midwest  in part due to the temporari layoff in the auto industri we discuss earlier as well as to claim be made by worker on indefinit layoff from the fireston plant in decatur  illinoi   despit rise claim and report that truck driver are now easier to find  our labor market are still veri tight   this anecdot from iowa  where the unemploy rate is     percent  is one exampl   circuit citi  the retail  decid to stop sell applianc   so amana  one of their supplier  announc the layoff of     worker   by the end of the day that announc was made  howev  their human resourc peopl had found new job at other nearbi firm for all     worker at the same wage rate   elsewher  retail in the chicago area were offer up to     an hour for holiday season help this year   and as i mention earlier  the manpow survey to be releas next monday will onc again show record high demand for labor throughout the nation   that s confidenti until it is releas  turn to the nation outlook  the recent data have been consist with our expect of moder real growth   we see real gdp growth for next year that is slight higher than that in the  book forecast   moreov  while we  like everyon els  have      increas our es  of potenti output growth over the last few year  our current es  is    not quit as op ist as that in the  book   consequ  our outlook is for output growth to be onli slight below that of potenti over the forecast horizon   thus  we expect that labor market will remain tight and that the cyclic slow in product growth will like put pressur on unit labor cost   those pressur  along with continu uncertainti over oil price and the likelihood of a weaken dollar  impli that the risk remain tilt somewhat more heavili toward inflat   inde  higher inflat is alreadi more than a risk  as the  book note  both core cpi and core pce inflat are run     point abov their low for the cycl  of cours  with the economi move more definit to a growth rate in the vicin of potenti  downsid risk also necessarili becom more pronounc   so we must be alert to the possibl that the slow in the interest sensit sector could becom excess   for now  howev  i believ that risk remain less than that of further increas in inflat

thank you  mr  chairman   overal busi condit in the ninth district are general consist with what we ve seen for sever year now  although there are a few chang on the margin   first  employ gain continu and labor market remain veri tight   that s a familiar stori   i think it s fair to say that the natur resourc industri  includ agricultur  had a better year than was anticip   in agricultur  that s due main to veri larg crop and favor weather condit and so forth   but a coupl of the taconit mine in northern minnesota  although they have been oper at capac  have announc prospect cutback in output and employ and  of cours  have attribut that to foreign competit in the steel industri       construct activ probabl has level off  but lot of major project are under    way   i don t think we will see ani chang in resourc util in that sector for some  e becaus of the larg number of project in the pipelin   and as i comment last  e  it   appear that consum spend has slow across a wide rang of product and retail  and that trend has continu as well   we   ve pick up a lot of anecdot about a slowdown in consum spend  certain relat to expect and relat to the perform earlier in the year  on a much more posit note  anecdot from a varieti of busi contact have been veri posit about prospect product gain   of cours  this is not a scientif sampl  but the peopl we ve talk to recent seem veri op ist about their abil to extract further larg gain in product through the applic of a wide rang of technolog   so  we may continu to see veri favor news on that front if that turn out to be an accur assess  as far as the nation economi is concern  we re look for real growth over the next coupl of year of about       percent   that will be accompani  in our view at least  by continu tight labor market   i agre with those who have indic that the incom data at the nation level have clear point to a slow in the rate of econom growth   presum  all that involv is an economi adjust from growth in excess of   percent over the first half of this year and someth better than   percent in the three previous year to this more moder pace  on the inflat side  as other have comment  there has been an uptick in both headlin and core inflat   if energi price cooper  presum headlin inflat will be more favor next year  but i m not as op ist that core inflat will be   thank you
like that for the nation  the economi in the eleventh district has begun to show sign of slower growth dure the past coupl of month   both the energi and high tech sector have been posit factor recent but growth in the comput  electron  and communic equip industri has taper off in recent month   labor shortag continu to restrain growth in mani sector   for exampl  in octob the oil and gas rig count in texa was      up    percent sinc the begin of the year  but employ in that sector is up less than   percent over the same period   for month now  energi industri contact have report difficulti in hire worker who have plenti of opportun in other safer and more stabl industri   to cite an anecdot that may be indic of hire pressur in the industri  more than    rig were shut down in the midland odessa area in recent raid by the immigr and natur servic   if the in polici of benign neglect were to end  employ growth in texa and mani other region could slow or revers signific  especi in construct  hotel  and restaur  all sector of the economi that are sensit to interest rate  oil and gas price  and tech stock are show sign of slow   moreov  we have notic a fair sharp mood shift to the down side   the mood has deterior much more than the econom data   that shift in mood was notic between our septemb and octob board meet and then again between our octob and novemb meet   sever director mention that retail are expect a weak holiday season and thus have been hold back on inventori accumul   it seem like under these circumst that weak decemb sale could becom a self fulfil propheci       sign of slow at the nation level are becom more widespread   pipelin    inflat has cool in recent month   the price of gold has fallen to the mid    s  the price of mani key commod have fallen   the dollar remain strong   and the ppi for crude and intermedi good remain well below the ppi for finish good   tighter credit standard by bank and tighter condit in the capit market are reinforc the alreadi slower growth of demand   in these circumst  the risk have shift signific and are at least as larg  if not larger  on the down side as on the up side   it s get to the  e when we as a committe need to recogn and prepar ourselv as well as the market for the possibl that the downsid risk in the economi have escal and may need to be address in the near futur   i say that for a lot of the reason that tom hoenig put on his list    so  i favor move to balanc in the risk statement of the press releas   and for the record  my guess is that our next move will be an eas move
on balanc  mr  chairman  our district economi is grow at a slower pace current than at the  e of our last meet  although activ is still at a veri high level   and labor market in our region  as appear to be the case elsewher in the countri  are still veri tight   accord to retail we survey each month by mail  sale were strong  veri strong  actual  through earli octob but have weaken fair mark sinc then   car dealer in particular have seen their sale drop off and custom traffic has diminish   that was in octob  howev  i should point out that in septemb their activ was veri strong  furnitur dealer and home improv store also report somewhat slower sale   look ahead to the holiday season  most retail tell us they expect a reason decent season  but      they certain aren t look for anyth like the strong perform they had last year  and a    number of them are pretti nervous  elsewher  manufactur activ in the  ina  where it is concentr in our district  has deceler late   both factori shipment and order were notabl softer in octob than earlier in the year   in contrast to the soften in manufactur  though  general demand in the servic sector is still hold fair steadi and in some case is even stronger  accord to a major of the servic firm that we have talk to over the last sever week  as far as labor market are concern  basic the stori is the same as it has been   qualifi worker still are veri hard to come by throughout our region   we are told that some retail have actual had to cut back on the hour they are open becaus they can t find peopl to staff their store   also  a board member who run a hospit in charlottesvill  virginia  told us that they actual are delay some non emerg surgeri becaus of the shortag of nurs   we don t see ani broad breakout in wage yet  but my sens is that wage are creep upward on balanc throughout our region and that the pattern is pretti pervas across a broad array of industri and compani  on the nation scene  the data that have come in sinc our octob meet indic a nation pictur similar to the region one i just summar  and we   ve heard that assess around the tabl today   overal spend  hous activ  and busi invest are all grow more slowli than in the first half of the year   and i think the percept of softer demand  as we   ve heard here this morn  has broaden and deepen   the octob labor market report   provid some evid that the slow is continu into the fourth quarter  job grew in octob at about the trend rate of growth of the labor forc  but the index of      aggreg hour work chang littl from the third quarter averag  indic for now at least    that aggreg demand may be grow somewhat more slowli than potenti output   so i would agre with other around the tabl who have said that for the first  e in a coupl of year there is now some signific downsid risk as well as upsid risk in the outlook for the real economi  and i would underlin    real economi     now  focus more on price and wage  the moder in demand might seem to suggest that the inflat threat is now abat   but i don t think it   s clear yet that that is the case  especi when one look at labor cost and wage and benefit figur   wage growth in octob jump to an annual rate of about   percent  well abov the     percent averag rate for the year to date   and with the persist tight in labor market  the eci was up     percent over the last four quarter   i believ that   s the biggest four quarter increas in ten year  it compar to onli     percent in the previous four quarter   also  product growth in the nonfarm busi sector did slow to     percent at an annual rate in the third quarter   i agre with bob parri that it could have been wors  but it was a drop from     percent in the second quarter and about   percent on averag over the last year or so   as a result  unit labor cost rose at a       percent annual rate in the third quarter after remain rough flat for an extend period  in fact  over the four previous quarter   i think that   s worrisom  and in my view unit labor cost could increas further   the continu labor market tight could easili caus compens growth to rise more and product growth might slow further   in that regard  i think it   s notabl that for the first  e in a long  e  dave  you have revis downward your structur product project  not by a lot  but it s a chang in direct   and i think we      could see a slow in cyclic product growth along the line suggest by michael      s question  so  while aggreg demand appear to be grow more slowli  and i think that s clear construct from the standpoint of the longer run health of the economi  the bottom line for me is that i believ we are still a long way from a soft land   and i don t think we should take one for grant   oil price are high and core measur of inflat have risen     percentag point   i was struck  dave  by your comment about your sens of the under direct of core inflat   again  the labor market is still except tight   in this situat  i think an actual or anticip further rise in the growth of unit labor cost could readili provok an increas in inflat expect   like mani other around the tabl  and i thought jack guynn said it especi well  i think the risk are clear still on the up side   and i believ we need to be posit to deal with those upsid risk go forward   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   new england remain on a relat steadi cours of moder expans overal  but question continu as to whether this moder is a function of demand or suppli factor   on the demand side some weaken is appar in consum buy  particular of big ticket item such as auto and high end hous  suppli constraint  howev  continu to domin most convers with region busi  labor market remain veri tight and anecdot abound about the length to which local busi are go to attract and retain worker   ski area in vermont are import season worker from unlik place like jamaica  australia  and new zealand and  in fact  are build hous for them becaus hous is anoth item that   s in quit short suppli       one compani sell fire alarm and build secur system said it sale growth    was below expect becaus it custom lack the labor to complet construct project  one                                                          from new hampshir actual bemoan the fact that cisco had chosen to locat a new plant employ       worker in the southern part of the state  he note that exist employ believ the plant could be staf onli by steal worker from them   and  if new worker in fact were import  there wouldn t be enough hous to go around either   the recent increas in the h  b visa cap was welcom in the region  but concern remain about the lack of skill labor across mani specif occup  beyond labor constraint  contact also mention  actual for the first  e  other suppli factor   sever cite insuffici supplier product capac in paper  chemic  and electr steel as a constrain factor   other mention shortag of raw materi such as beryllium  copper  and plastic resin   not surpris  in the face of both labor and raw materi constraint  more compani mention upward price pressur or actual price increas than at other point dure this year   labor cost are rise  as are benefit cost  and unplan or acceler pay increas reflect attempt to keep employe happi and retain them in the face of market pressur  there are factor at work to restrain cost as well   for one  the recent upheav among the dot com has begun to make a few more high tech worker avail or at least to moder their salari demand   beyond that  mani new england manufactur are small busi that are in the suppli chain for larg retail custom   they report incred downward pressur on sell price by the big retail chain  as these custom continu to demand better and better deal       final  we are see some aspect of what might be term the destruct side of    creativ destruct   one firm said that textbook sale have weaken and note that they were like lose market share in the colleg market to onlin educ materi   a maker of wood product use in home construct has been ad capac to produc vinyl product becaus of the ongo switch from wood to vinyl in construct   in fact  one of the few price reduct we have heard of this year has been in lumber price  report becaus of the grow substitut of altern construct materi   anoth area of restraint is like come from financi market volatil   decreas financi wealth is like to have a signific effect on spend by high incom worker in the region   moreov  while small bank are as profit and healthi as ever  larger one are see some deterior in syndic and other credit grant in the flush day of      and        credit standard are be tighten and  along with the rise spread in bond market  should act to restrain growth in the region and elsewher look forward  turn to the nation  the basic outlin of the  book   s gdp forecast for the next coupl of year or so is not terribl differ from our own  at least as far as the compon of demand are concern   we see some near term slow  just as the  book    but we continu to be somewhat less op ist about structur product  a view other have note as well   that also make us a bit less op ist about where the potenti growth rate is   we also have a littl less feedback from product chang to demand in our forecast   so  we see some risk of fall unemploy and rise inflat  somewhat more than the staff might have mention as an upsid risk   in fact  in our simul unemploy in q       is a full percentag point below that in the  book becaus the  book s goe up and our goe      down a bit   we have fair similar gdp growth but inflat is a full    percentag point higher    in our project  abstract from the model  there   seem to be some reason to believ that under demand remain rather strong and that suppli factor could be affect growth elsewher than in new england   labor market remain tight  import growth is solid  and real consum expenditur bounc back in the third quarter   growth in the latter may be moder in the fourth quarter but that moder would be from veri high level in the earlier part of the year   and real spend on comput and softwar has been strong even in the face of smaller declin in the price of comput power and an actual acceler in softwar price  add some caution on the product side to this pictur and one can see the potenti for upsid risk  the downsid risk have increas as well sinc our last meet   financi market are more volatil and fund is harder to come by  whether in the form of debt or equiti  ventur capit remain plenti but as one of our director recent caution  there is a need for concern about too much money chase too few bankabl deal   the extern pictur also seem less op ist  with the possibl of financi instabl rise in latin america and japan and with non japan asia experienc a varieti of problem  in sum  sinc our last meet i think the risk have increas both on the inflat front and on the down side   moreov  even in a much slower growth environ  cost pressur left from labor tight  rise benefit cost  oil price increas  and the possibl of a declin dollar have the potenti to nudg inflat up even if growth slow more than we expect   the  book forecast may be the best bet right now  but in my view it s found more      than ever on a great deal of uncertainti   there is still a good slug of upsid risk but some    increas downsid risk as well
there has been littl chang in my view of the state of the economi sinc our meet six week ago   we have more complet data sinc that  e and those data ratifi earlier indic that econom growth has slow from it veri robust pace at the begin of the year and that core inflat is acceler  on the district level  condit in our region show a similar path   econom activ continu to grow but at a slower pace than earlier in the year   slow is especi evid in the interest sensit sector  as one would expect given the committe   s earlier action of tighten monetari polici   manufactur  auto sale  hous  and bank lend have eas off somewhat  but the declin are from relat high level of activ   for the first  e this year octob   s busi outlook survey of manufactur in our district show declin in the general level of activ and in new order and shipment   that was revers somewhat in novemb  but the latest read indic weaker activ than earlier in the year   hous permit remain on a downtrend in the three state in our district as they are elsewher in the nation  the third district   s retail pictur is also similar to the nation one   dealer in our region report that auto sale fell in octob from septemb   s level but remain abov the figur post in these month last year   retail sale are come in below what firm expect earlier in the year but are up modest from septemb to octob compar to last year       retail report that consum confid remain high  although there is some concern about oil    price and stock market volatil  reflect the soften of the hous sector  our bank report fewer residenti real estat loan in octob   consum lend has slow somewhat while busi lend has remain fair strong   although the bank report no general sign of deterior in the credit qualiti of local custom  they did see some potenti problem in larger share credit  i would still character the labor market in our district as tight despit the fact that employ actual fell in the third quarter in all three state in our district   some of that drop was due to the verizon strike and reduct in census employ   the unemploy rate has remain at     percent for the last two quarter  which is the lowest in    year in our area  we believ part of the labor market tight reflect a problem of skill gap as well as cyclic activ  it s import to keep in mind the distinct between level and growth rate in this situat   even though growth is slow  it is slow from a relat high level   our busi contact give us the first indic of a chang and they are talk about a chang in the tone of the economi   but we would be wise not to over emphas this anecdot evid while ignor the level of econom activ   busi still see profit rise but not at the same robust pace as last year and earlier this year   within this context the news that inflat is still move up is troublesom  we conduct three survey of the busi communiti in our area  the busi outlook survey of manufactur  the pennsylvania retail survey of area retail  and the south jersey busi survey  which includ busi in both the manufactur and the servic      sector   all three of the survey had continu report of rise input price  with more increas    than declin   while manufactur have not found it easi to pass these higher cost on to their custom  other type of busi report that they have been abl to rais their own price  labor cost in our region continu to rise  although they don t appear to be acceler   in the northeast the employ cost index rose     percent for the    month end in septemb  the same    month rate as that report in june   our pennsylvania retail survey show wage and benefit cost rise in the third quarter but at a somewhat lower pace than in the second quarter   similar  in south jersey we re see record wage and benefit increas and they are move to high level   anecdot  firm indic to us that they are see boost in wage and salari by larger amount this year than in previous year   firm are also report sharper increas in health insur cost  as other around the tabl have report for their district  perhap more troubl is that respond to our busi outlook survey continu to expect their cost and price to increas over the next six month  on the nation level we are see pretti much what everyon is talk about here  growth definit has slow in the third quarter  to a report     percent pace  which is below es  of potenti  and there is an indic that this number might be revis downward  busi fix invest  an import driver of the robust expans  grew at half the second quarter pace and well below the pace in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of        residenti invest show a signific declin in the third quarter   still  this slowdown in econom growth is from a high level   recal that growth in real gdp in the second half of      and the first half of      averag a bit over   percent  signific abov what mani would consid potenti noninflationari growth   and even in the third quarter  the      consum  anoth import driver of the expans  continu to spend at a good pace   while i    expect that the level off of the stock market will mean less impetus in consumpt spend  past increas in perman incom will support spend  and i don t see a major drag on the consum side   labor market remain tight nation as they do in our own region   incom is expect to grow   thus  while growth has slow from it extraordinari pace at the begin of the year  my feel is that the economi is still robust  for next year  we look at our survey of profession forecast  which will be releas on monday  novemb   th  and i can share the view here   the current outlook for real gdp and unemploy is about the same as it was three month ago   the forecast expect real gdp to grow at an annual rate of     percent for the fourth quarter  which is the same as they report last quarter   for next year they see the growth rate at     percent and unemploy move to     percent on averag   and the median probabl that gdp will declin in ani quarter over their forecast horizon is less than    percent   they are put a slight increas on the probabl of a declin  but it is still a relat small number   one factor affect their project is oil price   forecast were ask to predict these price  and they assum that oil price will fall somewhat next year to about     a barrel rather than the     a barrel in the  book   while they believ the run up in oil price in      affect the economi   s growth rate  they argu that it was not substanti   in our forecast    view the increas in oil price in      cut onli     percent from the real gdp growth rate in       and they forecast that the effect for next year will be onli     percent  i continu to be concern about inflat   measur of inflat continu to acceler  and not all of the increas is due to oil price  sinc the core measur also have been      move up   core cpi  the cleveland fed   s median cpi  and even core pce inflat have    move up   this consist across measur is troubl   and these measur are like to continu to acceler in the short run  as the rise in oil price pass through to other price and the expect depreci of the dollar put pressur on other price in the index   long term inflat has remain steadi in our forecast    view  but i still believ that the real concern is one of inflat rather than soft in the economi   so  as for the tilt we were talk about earlier  i tend to think that s where the tilt ought to be   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   with one except region econom condit in the fourth district have chang littl sinc our beigebook report   growth rate in sever industri  particular manufactur  appear to be moder toward growth rate that are more typic of the averag growth rate we have been see throughout this expans  the one except to our beigebook report is retail sale  where the outlook has becom notabl more bearish   retail sale figur for earli novemb have been disappoint   retail tell us that sale of menswear are a lead indic for retail sale in general  and they are concern that a recent weak sell pace in this categori foreshadow a soften in consum demand dure the critic upcom holiday season  now  accord to the beigebook nation summari  econom activ in the fourth district is slow a bit fa  than in the nation as a whole   and there is littl doubt that some firm in our district are do poor   howev  the reason for the poor perform seem to be more peculiar to the industri and the firm rather than an economi wide busi slow  for exampl  the heavi truck manufactur industri has experienc a reduct in output of         percent from last year s record high level   but it is not a lessen in demand for truck    servic that has caus the drop  in fact  truck freight tonnag has grown to an all  e high  rather  condit peculiar to the truck manufactur industri are respons for the slowdown  first of all  the oil price shock has hit the truck firm    capit spend budget especi hard   second  truck compani are have a more difficult  e get loan   in fact  our contact at bank singl out loan to truck firm as their most danger one becaus of past fix price contract that were made befor diesel price skyrocket   final  becaus anticip trade in valu have drop  it s harder for trucker to justifi buy new truck   so while truck product has declin substanti  truck ship has not  as a district that   s character by a larger concentr of manufactur activ than the nation as a whole  we tend to hear from that group somewhat disproportion   and manufactur continu to tell us that they cannot rais their price no matter how hard they tri  and you ve heard that from sever other this morn  and they are becom increas concern about the competit environ   in fact  they cite the veri same intensifi cost pressur that the  book note  higher energi price  higher health care cost  and higher labor cost becaus of the tight labor market  especi for skill labor  the steel industri provid a veri power exampl of what is go on   inventori in steel are quit high and the industri is character by excess capac around the world  steel import have been flood into the unit state   condit have becom so bad for the integr produc that plant shutdown and or layoff within a year are like and a coupl of our director point out that outright bankruptci are not out of the question if condit don t chang   competit has prevent price of manufactur from rise even in a situat      where price of raw materi are increas   chemic firm  for exampl  report that even    though higher oil price have great increas their cost  they   ve been unabl to rais their sell price  now  i take the report from manufactur serious  but i also want to put them in perspect   on an ex food and energi basi  good price as measur by the cpi have been increas at an annual rate of onli     percent in each of the past three year   so it s no surpris that manufactur do not see inflat lurk around the corner   yet the overal core cpi continu to acceler   the culprit is the servic sector  which may be less suscept to import competit  less prone to product increas and  of cours  has a larger compon of labor input than the good produc industri  this bring me to the nation situat   the  book say that the economi is essenti in balanc  in the sens that the level of econom activ is rough in line with that of potenti   and i think the  book   a good job of express the caution that has crept into the mind of businesspeopl   but i am also mind of the economi s extraordinari abil to grow fa  than the  book expect   in the baselin project  to the extent that ani polici adjust is thought prudent  onli a    basi point increas in the fed fund rate in the next two year is call for   given all the uncertainti surround forecast and polici prescript  we could almost regard that as no chang in polici at all   i say    almost    becaus the staff still maintain in it baselin project that the economi is at risk for more inflat rather than less over the forecast horizon  i share that concern  but perhap for some reason that are differ from those under the  book project   i m concern that we will confus peopl about our      definit of price stabil and our willing to pursu it   this year will mark the fifth    consecut year that the core pce will have increas at a rate of less than   percent   last year s rate was       percent and that result led mani peopl to say that we had achiev price stabil   but core inflat measur will be up this year from last year and if the  book is correct  we ll see them creep up further in each of the next two year   a statist test that we have run on the median cpi  a core measur that we develop at our bank  indic that the inflat trend has not chang at all dure the expans   similar analys that we   ve run on the core pce lead us to the same conclus   onc we   ve ad in the  book project for pce  there will have been no improv in the inflat trend dure the entir expans period   so  i find it difficult to contempl look at a project for core pce that entail revert to the inflat level that we had in      and      without at least express some concern that the balanc of risk is toward more inflat than is realli accept   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s economi has continu to expand at a moder pace sinc the last report   price pressur persist though they have becom somewhat less pronounc recent   privat sector job growth acceler slight in the third quarter to a     percent annual rate while unemploy rate remain unchang   retail sale were report to be on or close to plan but that s larg becaus steep price markdown help clear out excess inventori and also pull overal retail price down slight       on the nation level  we think the economi could slow a bit more than project in    our own and the  book s forecast   that seem to be a definit possibl base on pure domest consider   but i will admit that that assess is base more on anecdot report than on pure analysi  what   concern me consider on the weak side is what i feel is go on intern and what might go on intern  i think the forecast that vinc reinhart present for the intern economi is probabl the right forecast   but i feel veri much as i did in the summer of       befor august  that there is a sort of eeri calm wait for an accid to happen   and there are some place where i think an accid could easili happen  just look at the industri world  japan has a horrend bad structur economi with much too much emphasi on a continu push from fiscal polici   the busi sector is invest somewhat strong and realli is the onli push behind the small amount of growth that one see in japan   the consum  howev  is veri  veri wari   i think  have final decid that it is  e to show their hand   the present leadership of the countri is veri much in the hand of the old economi  the construct industri  farmer  and heavi manufactur   the age of the popul involv a fiscal problem that is dramat even by italian standard   what the reform are see is that they are simpli go to have to take polit power and chang rather radic the macroeconom polici of the countri   but even if they are success at take over  the forc against chang are so great that i think their chanc of success are not veri high   and yet what      could happen becaus of this possibl or even like polit chang is that an alreadi fragil    situat could becom more so with consider effect on the rest of asia  in southeast asia there are a few area of strength  includ singapor  hong kong  and taiwan   but the serious problem countri  such as indonesia and thailand  continu to be veri weak and are veri much depend on strong export   moreov  the structur chang that they veri bad need as of         by and larg has not taken place   the same is essenti true of korea   even though there still is a great reluct to allow econom realiti to be manifest   instead  effort are direct at tri to patch thing togeth   that   not leav a situat in which ani rippl effect come from someplac els would be easili manag  as for our friend in europ  when we talk to them about the weak of the euro  they understand that the main reason the euro is weak is becaus they have experienc substanti outflow of capit   that reflect the fact that their own citizen seem to think  correct  that invest in the unit state is better than invest at home  and they know the reason is that there   s a veri signific product gap   just as the product gap against the unit state led to the long trend of the weaken dollar in the     s  it has been the main driver behind the strengthen trend of the dollar in the latter part of the     s   add in the short term effect of higher growth expect in the unit state than in europ  and those two factor add up  i think  to a reason good explan of whi the euro is where it is  now  when we talk to the european in those sort of analyt term  they nod their head sage and find the analysi accept   but they are desper concern about the polit reaction within their countri to the weak of the currenc   they are particular      concern that the reaction is go to be more obvious in      when the deutschemark and the    french franc disappear and the euro take their place   at that  e i believ the under and grow anti american  which is veri clear in europ  is go to becom more manifest  and that is precis the  e when the industri world should probabl be work in cooper   i think that will becom increas difficult  we have a veri serious problem in argentina in my view   argentina is a countri in which a brilliant politician  presid menem  decid to put in a foreign exchang regim  not becaus of it                               but becaus that countri has seem incap of impos enough so he tie it currenc on a one to one basi to the u s  dollar and decid that he was go to import disciplin   twice  after the tequila crisi of      and the brazilian devalu more recent  there was a veri difficult macroeconom adjust for the real economi   now  with a much weaker polit leadership and a much more difficult econom situat  there s a veri real question of whether that exchang rate regim  which continu to be vital for the polit stabil of the countri  can be maintain   essenti  what the imf is tri to do  and what the rest of us will eventu be call on to do  is to tri to see what can be done to help maintain stabil there   can a countri with a structur overvalu exchang rate  which they don t want to chang for polit reason  and with an econom growth of mayb   or   percent per year  which they also need to keep the nation togeth polit  make it   it s a veri  veri tough call as to whether it is go to work   the contagion effect on what i have describ as the other problem spot in the world could be a lot greater than the size of the argentin economi in the world would seem to suggest   it may well be that we will continu to muddl      along and the world econom situat will be more or less as we   ve describ it  which    probabl is the right forecast   but i think we have to pray a lot and hope that god is veri good for that to actual work out  as for our own situat  it seem to me that that danger outsid our countri call for us to be even more prudent than usual in our own respons for the manag of the u s  economi   i do think that we are move more toward a balanc of risk between inflat and insuffici growth   my own feel is that we are head in the direct of balanc  but i don t think we are quit there yet   thank you
within the eighth district i think we have  as bob   put it for his district  a fair pervas chang in mood   the view is not that thing are go down the drain but there is a pervas sens of slower growth   in a meet we had with st  loui area invest profession  that was the unanim view express around the tabl   also  one of our director report a signific declin in industri sale of electr  which probabl relat to the weak in the manufactur industri becaus that industri is a big user of electr in the st  loui area  i talk to both my up and fedex contact last week  and i will start with what they had to say about the intern economi   my up contact had just return from a trip to asia  an area in which he see tremend growth in airfreight   he believ that japan is start to rebound and that korea is pick up further   the airlin are all build a network in china and the expect is that growth within china will explod in come year   so they are veri  veri upbeat about asia   he mention strong growth of his airfreight traffic between europ      and asia and within europ but report that traffic between europ and the unit state was a    bit weak  my fedex contact had similar view on the intern economi   import into the unit state from europ and asia are run at a    plus percent growth rate year over year and that  of cours  would be consist with what we are see in the macro data   fedex report that volum within europ and asia remain strong   they also see continu strong growth in latin america and are build a new hub in miami to servic that growth  on the domest economi  my fedex contact had an interest observ   just recent  in octob  he note a clear sign of slower growth in the unit state   he said that the express packag they are ship are of a lower averag weight and that there is also more use of ground ship and less resort to airfreight  suggest a signific slow   i think fedex   a lot of busi ship automobil part  so that would be consist with what we see in the auto industri   but they are expect continu strong growth in both their ground and overnight express busi   they are anticip a lower season peak this year  a littl less pressur in the novemb decemb period  my up contact had some interest thing to say on the cost side   their expert have calcul  i thought it was interest how specif their calcul is  that  so they obvious are look veri care at that   they are expect the compens term of that settlement to spread across the industri  though i suppos other continu issu are involv that are not all wrap up in the      i think that is probabl the major inform i   ve been abl to gather    from poke around in our district  on the overal nation pictur  i believ the risk on the inflat front remain larg unchang   we seem to have a continu upcreep in inflat  not a breakout but continu upward pressur  with the same risk that we   ve seen   i do think  though  that there is a much higher risk than we saw   week ago or    week ago of growth come in slower than we would like   so if we do move to a balanc risk statement  in my view it would not be becaus there is ani reduct in the inflat risk  but rather becaus we have an increas risk on the output and employ side  i would also like to emphas that there are lag in the inflat process that are much  much longer than in the employ and output process   so we should not be all that surpris if next year we were simultan to see increas in both report inflat and unemploy
thank you  mr  chairman   there are  e when it is relat easi to be a central banker and  e when it is relat hard   it is easi when there are posit suppli shock and we have the luxuri of choos between lower inflat and lower unemploy   it can also be easi when all the world know what should be done and all we have to do is to follow through   unfortun  we seem to be approach a  e when neither condit is fill   first  as wage catch up with product  this sourc of posit suppli shock could soon start to wane   to that is ad the signific negat suppli shock of the rise in oil price   and while the dollar is high now  almost everi logic consider and everi      other forecast has it go down   this mean that while the earlier posit product shock    are   out  the economi is forc to digest higher oil price and could get hit with anoth negat suppli shock in the form of a drop dollar   that in turn lead to a set of unfavor  or certain less favor  polici choic combin with consider uncertainti about the under risk  on the one side  we are by no mean out of the wood on inflat risk   the economi is still digest the sharp rise in oil price   and some combin of that  the wage respons to product shock  and tight labor market is give faint signal that inflat is worsen  the current method core cpi has risen notic in the last year and the core pce has pick up slight   while some pickup in these indic might be expect sinc the rise in oil price cannot be entir purg  these develop are still worrisom  on the wage side  hour compens from the eci has pick up and averag hour earn have risen slight   some increas might be expect here as well becaus our more product worker will at some point get paid more   but these develop are worrisom too   thank  long term measur of inflat expect have not worsen  but short term measur have to some degre   we might summar all of this in medic term by say that with labor market this tight there is a continu chronic risk of higher inflat  but on the other side  the economi is slow quit notic   the staff has cut it forecast growth of demand from last meet  particular invest demand  which has been a veri import factor in the expans   it is possibl that the invest boom could soon be over   consumpt is hold up but the stock market has been flat or down for a while now  the person save rate is negat  and it would not take much for consumpt to begin soften       moreov  stock price could declin further  as earn level continu to fall short of    expect  intern  argentina is a loom troubl spot  and japan seem onc again unabl to escap it prolong recess   as bill   point out  there are a lot of downsid risk there as well  on the monetari side there has been a sharp rise in borrow cost for low rate borrow  and the survey of senior loan offic report a widen of credit spread   the real feder fund rate continu at a high level  these downsid risk are of a differ charact than the inflat risk   most like there is some probabl that rise unemploy will becom a problem  but there is a small chanc that it will becom a serious problem   it is my impress that most past recess have arisen rather sudden   we might summar all of this in medic term by say that the small probabl of an acut problem has increas  this set up the kind of quandari we do not like and should not like   how should we balanc the risk of a chronic problem against a slight increas but small risk of an acut problem   how do we stay ahead of the curv when we can   t even see it basic direct   i   ve been chang my mind a lot on this in recent day   i don   t alway feel this way  but this  e around i am veri happi that there are    other around to help make the decis   laughter   in the end  our best answer may be to expand our statement to say just what we are worri about
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start by reassur all of you    that i am alway happi there are    other here    laughter   ned and i join the board at about the same  e and obvious we have alway enjoy the input of our colleagu  on a more serious note  i find myself veri much in sympathi with exact what my colleagu ned   just had to say   we start out in june      tri to put in motion a seri of effort to slow the economi s growth to someth that s more sustain  and i think the incom evid suggest that in fact we have done that   and while the economi has evolv in a general predict and i think appropri manner  a number of risk have emerg with greater clariti sinc the last meet   it seem to me  as other have suggest  that the substanc of this meet is primarili about how we should respond to all that and acknowledg these new risk  on the one hand  as mani of you have alreadi said  we do continu to have high oil price and continu tight labor market   given that opec at it most recent meet decid not to increas product and that the middl east continu to be volatil  i think the near term risk with respect to oil  in term of both the suppli not be disrupt and it price  continu to be primarili on the up side   after the most recent opec announc  the spot price for west texa intermedi went from about     a barrel to about     a barrel  and that   s where it is today  i believ
it   s slight higher
slight higher  okay   so  i think the risk relat to uncertainti in the oil market is show through in the price   i would also say  as i understand the configur of output with respect to oil plus inventori plus refineri capac  that it s realli      quit possibl that onc we get through the heat oil season in this countri we could actual    see a sharp break in oil price toward the down side  as other have alreadi note  labor market obvious remain tight   as all of you know  unemploy tend to be a lag indic  so i think we can expect labor market to continu to be tight  perhap for the labor hoard reason that dave   suggest   also  i agre with other who have said that the most recent data on compens are at least somewhat troubl   averag hour earn for the    month end in octob increas about     percent  which is near the upper end of the rang that measur has shown for some  e   and al broaddus mention the most recent unit labor cost figur  which were certain far from reassur  even though they may have been driven by some special factor   if product growth is start to top out  we can expect unit labor cost  if anyth  to continu to rise   and  obvious  the question with respect to benefit cost are not comfort either  the measur of inflat themselv also are in mani way quit disturb  as other have mention   moreov  it seem as though we are face a gradual ongo rise in inflat and inflationari pressur in most of these measur  with the baselin number alreadi relat high  the new develop sinc our last meet do involv most the downsid risk  the slowdown in profit growth  which was just show through a littl at the  e of our last meet  primarili in the telecom sector  has becom much more widespread in the s p      with interest expens rise and compens per hour also like to rise  a continu slowdown in profit growth should not be unexpect   the current slow and the expect of a futur slow have led creditor to adopt a more cautious stanc   as   olin said in      respons to a question  the averag corpor bond rate  use a weight averag as      describ  has in fact gone up   that question manag to steal about three sentenc of what i was go to say   similar  as other have point out  the senior loan offic survey suggest that there is ongo tighten   and for those who want to look at financi condit overal  a declin stock market and continu depreci of the dollar have  if anyth  contribut at the margin some extra tighten  this focus on financi and credit condit is import becaus invest  as you know  has been a pillar of our recent growth   and recent invest has been heavili financ by extern sourc   intern financ now account for onli    percent of overal financ for invest  and that is i think the largest financ gap we have had in a decad   as i look at the data on net fund be rais  we are see some gradual drop off  not onli from quarter one to quarter two to quarter three of this year  but month over month as well   so busi clear appear less op ist   they clear are find fewer reason to rais fund   and bank and other lender are be much tighter with respect to provid credit to busi   so  i do sens that invest spend is on a bit more of a knife edg now than it has been for some  e  final  the other pillar of our expans has been consumpt  and that is also on a trajectori for slower growth   again  perhap the downsid risk is great but it   s not as great as that for invest   consum remain op ist  but the gap between the growth in real dispos incom and person consumpt expenditur seem to be wide by histor standard just on the basi of the fact that the support come from the stock market is wane  given the high debt burden of most household  ani negat reassess of futur prospect      by the american consum can potenti lead to an outsiz contract in consum spend     so i sens that there are some real downsid risk in that area  to sum up  i would describ the current pictur as benign but i believ the futur is as hazi as it has been in the period i   ve been here anyway   there are clear good reason to continu to focus on the upsid risk with respect to inflat   but i too sens  as ned   and other have indic  that the balanc of risk has shift quit notic sinc the last meet   our biggest challeng  i think  is how to communic that we have an eye on the upsid risk but also recogn that some downsid risk have emerg which are much more notic than they were at our last meet
thank you  mr  chairman   it is now pretti well beyond question that the economi is in a slowdown  and this leav us clear face new  quit differ question than those we have been grappl with over recent year   the fact that these new question are precis the one we would have anticip earlier this year when we thought ahead about deal with an emerg slow economi   not make them ani easier to answer now that they are at hand   the two fundament question i see as oper today are first  how deep and long last will this slowdown prove to be   and second  will inflat flatten in tight correl with a slow economi or will it continu to drift up  driven by the momentum of earlier condit and or perhap by an economi that   not slow enough for long enough  concern the slowdown  there is evid of it all around us   we have been examin it all morn and it is quit possibl that weak will fo  further weak  governor   and presid   and hoenig list factor that could caus that   but i      believ it may be a bit earli to get over concern about the downsid potenti   there is still    substanti strength out there  let me cite a few factor   for open  in my view the  book forecast can hard be consid weak   consum confid remain veri high and is perhap rise again   and consum spend in the weaker third quarter was consider stronger than in the more robust second quarter   in general it seem to be hold up well   job creation continu  slower but hard anem  and incom continu to rise   the stock market has stall  but except for the more egregi overvalu stock of a few month ago  it is still quit elev by histor standard and hold up well so far despit have plenti of excus to crater   busi invest is like slow from it earlier unsustain pace but show no sign of collaps  fiscal polici is like to becom more s ul under the new presid  regardless of who he may be   the economi of our trade partner as a group are project to continu to grow  at around   percent  which should cushion an incipi declin here   certain the potenti exist for the situat to weaken quick and perhap even precipit  but i m not sure that that s the most like scenario as of today  concern inflat  what i see happen is that from a low base it is now sluggish but clear move up   perhap in today s high product environ this might be more easili revers than in prior era   but i feel that the longer this uptrend goe on  the harder it will be to stop   and should the economi reacceler soon  inflat may well acceler with it  the interrelationship of compens cost and product will continu to be key  as will energi price   we will watch close  of cours   fortun we have  e to watch and to evalu   between the eas of upsid risk on the one hand and ongo substanti      momentum in the economi on the other  there would seem to be no urgent need to chang either    rate or rhetor at this  e
there is in my view relat littl chang in the outlook compar to the assess at our last meet   the data and develop we   ve seen sinc that meet  howev  do reinforc the expect that we have transit into a period of below trend growth   in addit they justifi a small downward revis to the forecast of real gdp growth  at least over the next few quarter  in line with the adjust in the  book forecast   the two most import develop were highlight in the staff present on the outlook this morn   first  there has been a deterior in financi condit  includ the wider qualiti spread  especi for below invest grade bond and tighter lend standard by bank and  second  a heighten anxieti about the financi condit of some emerg market economi  especi argentina  the deterior in financi condit in the unit state reflect a respons to the slowdown that is under way and reinforc the prospect of continu below trend growth   both develop add an element of downsid risk to the forecast   the qualit stori nevertheless remain unchang   we appear to be head  in my view  to a period of below trend growth and at the same  e rise core inflat   if oil price declin as project in the  book  overal inflat is like to diminish and the rise in core inflat is like to be signific damp over the forecast period  the focus in our discuss this morn is clear on assess or reassess the balanc of risk in the forecast   in assess the balanc of risk  we have to look at both the      risk in the baselin forecast and the risk relat to the baselin forecast   the risk  for    exampl  are balanc in the baselin  book forecast between below trend growth and a rise unemploy rate on the one hand and rise core inflat on the other hand   this is an uncomfort mix but one that may be inevit follow the long period of abov trend growth and the declin in the unemploy rate to it current except low level   it is this balanc that i presum encourag the staff to maintain a constant nomin fund rate through the next year in the  book forecast  relat to the  book baselin forecast  i m slight more concern about weaker growth  especi next year   and if growth turn out to be in line with the  book project  i m slight more concern that inflat might turn out to be higher than project in the  book   my assess of the risk reflect my view that both the temporari demand and disinflationari effect of the product acceler may now be dissip  while the risk in and relat to the baselin forecast may now be more balanc  and i think that is the case  there are nevertheless a number of reason for this committe to delay a move from a statement that the risk are unbalanc toward higher inflat to one of balanc risk   first  we   ve had onli a singl quarter of below trend growth after       year of persist abov trend growth   we might want to be more confid that growth will remain below trend befor we take such a step   second  the unemploy rate today is at it cyclic low and signific below the staff s es  of the short run nairu   we might not want to remov the disproportion focus on inflat risk until we see labor market tight unwind at least a littl   and third  the benign inflat forecast depend import on the assum      declin in the price of oil   we might want to wait until we see at least some confirm of that    trend  my greatest concern today is that a move to a balanc risk assess would reinforc expect of a near term eas   i would have less of a problem if financi market expect a balanc risk assess and incorpor expect of a stabl fund rate go forward   perhap the issu is how to communic our assess that the risk have becom more balanc without appear to downgrad our concern about the risk of higher core inflat and without reinforc expect of a near term polici eas  final  with core inflat at or abov my long run target and with a further increas in core inflat over the forecast horizon and beyond in the  book and my own forecast  i would prefer that we be veri cautious about remov an assess that the risk are weight main toward higher inflat   true  growth is also expect to be below trend  and we have to be alert to the downsid risk   but below trend growth when output is abov potenti  as i believ is the case  is desir  that   s exact what we need to mitig the risk of rise core inflat   there is noth  on the other hand  desir about the project rise in core inflat  maintain the statement of unbalanc risk would effect reinforc the point that  given the prevail tight in the labor market and inflat alreadi abov our long run object  there is a higher than normal threshold befor the fed would consid eas   i believ that would be the right messag to send
befor we break  dave   want to make a comment
yes  mr  chairman   it was an oversight on my part  in respond    to presid pool   s question about the differ between the polici outlook of the staff and the market  not to have note that it s quit conceiv that the market are view   percent unemploy as sustain   if we were to take that assumpt on board in our forecast  we would have unemploy rise abov the natur rate and inflat move down over the forecast project   and both those factor would clear push in the direct of lower nomin feder fund rate than we   re show in our forecast
shall we break for coffe   coffe break
mr  kohn
thank you  mr  chairman  the inform on hand sinc your last meet indic that growth has slow more definit to a pace below that of the economi   s potenti   and tighter financi condit along with greater uncertainti about the profit of new invest go forward should provid greater assur that the pace of econom expans will not surg again ani  e soon   at the same  e  howev  labor market remain tight  and incom data continu to point to some upward pressur on cost and under price inflat   as dave detail  the staff has respond by mark down it forecast of growth in aggreg demand by a littl more than potenti suppli  while retain the project upcreep in core inflat over the next two year   on balanc  the new inform would not appear to be suffici at odd with your expect or your desir to caus you to alter the stanc of polici at this meet   instead  the question for the committe would seem to be whether that inform and chang in the outlook provid a basi for shift from an assess that the balanc of risk go forward is weight toward increas inflat pressur to one that risk are now balanc   the judgment that risk are balanc   not have to wait until the point where you are no longer concern about inflat pressur    rather  the balanc of risk statement envis weigh the risk to econom perform relat to both of the committe   s long term goal  price stabil and sustain econom growth  the latter be a translat into growth rate of the legisl object of maximum employ   becaus the statement is concern with the            possibl of develop that might move the economi away from those goal  it is formul in first differ  intensifi inflat pressur and econom weak   in this context  econom weak refer to output growth below that of the economi   s potenti  in other word  declin resourc util   in the circumst in which the economi find itself at this  e  you can readili experi both intensifi inflat pressur and econom weak  and be concern about their extent in the futur  in effect balanc the relat strength of these two advers outcom   such a configur of econom develop is typic associ with an advers suppli shock  like the increas in the price of oil  which rais price and depress demand  rise inflat and weak growth also would be characterist of a situat like that embodi in the staff forecast in which the economi had overshot the level of it long run potenti so that price were acceler  but polici alreadi had becom suffici restrict to return resourc util to it sustain level   in both case  crosscurr are play on the appropri stanc of polici   the rise in the inflat rate by itself would tend to suggest that the feder fund rate might need to increas over  e   but the shortfal in growth relat to the economi   s potenti would tend to call for the feder fund rate to decreas as resourc util fell   for exampl  a polici that was restrain an economi oper with excess demand should becom less restrict as the level of the economi   s long run potenti is reach   a balanc of risk statement requir your judgment about whether one of these tendenc is like to overrid the other in determin econom perform and affect polici in the futur   if the two tendenc were thought most like to have rough offset effect on polici  the risk still might not be balanc if you saw the possibl outcom around the modal forecast as skew   in make these determin  you need to be think not onli about possibl outcom for price and econom activ  but also about how much weight in your polici strategi you would place on each type of deviat from your object   in the current situat  the state of the labor market would seem to support a judgment that consider risk of rise inflat persist   the unemploy rate has stay at a level that at best you may consid to be around the lower end of the rang of plausibl valu for a sustain rate in the near term   most of the recent compens and price data have been broad consist with a mild acceler trend  like the one anticip by a staff forecast that emb a nairu abov the current unemploy rate   moreov  if product growth is level out as in the staff forecast  the economi is enter a period when unit labor cost will begin to come under ad upward pressur as worker catch up          to previous increas in producit   and the longer energi price remain elev  the more they threaten to boost inflat expect and fo  ad wage demand to offset the associ eros of real incom gain  the question then is whether these inflat risk have now becom balanc by risk to sustain econom growth   sever of you note at the committe   s last meet that you found the choic between unbalanc and balanc risk a close call  and the evid sinc that  e would suggest that the risk of econom weak have increas  actual growth has come in a bit below staff expect  with the shortfal occur in final demand  not inventori accumul  moreov  the declin in stock price  firm in exchang rate  ratchet up of term and standard on bank credit to busi  and rise in bond yield on margin credit indic an appreci tighten of financi condit at the exist feder fund rate  which will have restrain effect on demand   the staff respons to these develop has been to reduc the assum tighten and to postpon it until       perhap beyond the    forese futur    of the committe   s statement  over the next year  the gradual uptrend in both inflat and unemploy rate in the staff forecast would seem to have about offset effect on the desir fund rate  suggest balanc risk over this period  unless you were place much greater weight on contain inflat than on damp variabl in output   moreov  develop in recent month might also be read as suggest that the risk of a shortfal in econom growth from the staff forecast have increas   one sourc of asymmetr risk might be financi market  where investor skittish and concern about credit qualiti and earn seem more like to intensifi than to eas  especi if the staff outlook for earn turn out to be on target   inde  bank have alreadi told us that they intend to firm loan term and standard in the futur   grow financi market caution  by make credit less avail and more expens  would increas the odd on other downsid possibl identifi in the  book  a shortfal in invest spend and problem abroad   we may again be in a period in which the standard linear relationship in our model do not captur the like market develop and their feedback to econom activ   to the extent weak alreadi evid in stock and bond market reflect expect of lower profit or percept of increas risk for invest project  the equilibrium real interest rate would be reduc  that would provid anoth reason whi the current feder fund rate might be more restrain than it appear to be onli a few month ago   if the actual fund rate is abov the equilibrium rate  condit are in place to contain inflat befor long  even if the economi is now produc beyond the level of it potenti  and the case for balanc risk would be         stronger if the committe saw better odd than the staff that an unemploy rate close to recent level is sustain  impli a smaller probabl of an updrift in inflat than in the staff forecast   final  given the skittish of financi market with possibl restrain effect on the economi  the committe might be more comfort be posit at balanc risk go forward   in the event of a major identifi downward shock  like a bond or equiti market collaps  you could eas from ani posit  includ a posit of unbalanc risk toward rise inflat  and market would not feel they had been misl   but eas from a posit of unbalanc risk in respons to more increment chang in the outlook  say  a further firm of credit condit  could be t ier   and the issu may not be eas per se  but move to unbalanc risk toward econom weak  which also might be more readili accomplish if the committe alreadi were at balanc risk   in short  the committe might see a postur of balanc risk as provid a calm influenc on market and open up a wider array of possibl action or announc in decemb  in the event of further soften in demand or advers market develop   nonetheless  the committe may still have suffici doubt about the extent and persist of the downshift in aggreg demand to justifi a judgment that inflat risk continu to be the domin threat to econom perform   to date  job growth has slow onli to the pace that would keep labor market tight  not reliev pressur appreci  strong consum confid and continu high long term return on busi capit invest should support solid growth go forward  although the real feder fund rate is elev  so too is trend product growth and the equilibrium real rate   the staff forecast see real short term interest rate now at level that would tend to cap inflat and return the economi to potenti  but this process is gradual  take sever year  suggest that real rate may be onli mild restrict  and  in that forecast  nomin rate need to rise to maintain the level of real rate as inflat itself pick up   so  as you know  the  book anticip that your next action  admit a long way off  is more like to be a firm than an eas of polici  just to hold core inflat at a rate somewhat abov recent experi   moreov  after it uptick of recent year  the rate of core inflat might alreadi be high enough that you would want to continu to put consider more polici weight on possibl increas in inflat than on potenti shortfal in econom growth  final  concern about the effect on financi market of move to balanc risk might also weigh in favor of stay with your current assess  at least for a while   market particip are like to take a chang in this assess as indic that the committe was no longer        keep the door close to near term polici eas    the size of the result ralli in financi market is hard to predict   it might not be larg  the committe would be announc balanc risk  not a domin concern about econom weak  so the committe would still be lag the market   s assess of it like behavior go forward   and an increas number of observ  albeit still a minor  expect you to announc balanc risk after this meet   nonetheless  there is a chanc that the reaction would be strong  and that against the background of the committe   s shift  the market would seiz on weaker element in inher noisi data over the come intermeet period to build in consider higher odd on near term action than the committe would find comfort   by themselv  such reaction might turn a situat of bare balanc risk into one that return to an imbal toward heighten inflat pressur   and you might worri whether possibl be perceiv as get readi onc again to cushion a downdraft in financi market wouldn   t reduc incent to reassess credit and earn risk  truncat an ul  healthi process befor it had run it cours and build in futur over confid    hold the current assess at this meet would allow you to get addit evid to judg whether  after take account of ani market reaction  the growth of demand was like to be enough below the growth of the economi   s potenti over  e to reliev pressur on resourc market and counterbal inflat risk   thank you  mr  chairman
question for don   governor
don  i have a question about the analyt framework you use in the earlier part of your discuss   i may have misunderstood you but it seem to me that you were say that maximum sustain growth is the translat of the object of maximum employ  sort of ident to that in some sens   my reaction is that that s not the way i ever thought about it   it seem to me that maximum employ is a util rate concept   and we have the problem here that this slowdown in growth may in fact be push the output level to our target  not away from our target  but to our target  and that s good
but inflat  given that we are perhap alreadi abov where we   d like to be  is clear push it away
the sustain growth is intend  i think  to be consist with chang in resourc util   i agre that we can start  as perhap we are now  with over util resourc   but suppos you alreadi have in effect a restrain polici to bring resourc util down   if you start from a posit where you have adjust to that situat  you have alreadi tighten polici to bring resourc util back down to it potenti level  as resourc util get to that potenti you d better be eas that feder fund rate  other thing equal  or you will overshoot the potenti
that   s absolut fair   the question is how far along we are and whether that s a situat that would realli be use in      or      or whether it   s relev in the next sever month
if you think of the    forese futur    as about a year  and you crank this through the staff forecast  i think you will find that inflat is creep up and so is the unemploy rate   it depend on the weight you put on those two measur  but if you put rough equal weight on them  take account of the real fund rate  i think you d find that they approxim offset go forward over the next year   i was tri to explain the situat where you had alreadi tighten   let   s say you were alreadi somewhat restrict in order to get resourc util down to where it need to be  and growth below the rate of growth of potenti would be do that  that slower growth just by itself  ignor inflat  should be move you to lower interest rate   now  inflat concern may get you to rais the fund rate and unemploy to lower inflat  and then you would
i take it that   s from a framework similar to the  book and mayb that s my problem   but begin with an unemploy rate of     percent  where the long run nairu might be closer to       percent  it just seem a bit prematur to be worri about that   if we were at a differ start point  then i would agre that that could be relev
don  my question is similar to governor     s   it strike me that how you view the risk statement depend on how you view monetari polici right now   and this is what i think you were just say   suppos you view monetari polici right now as tight  that is  the fund rate is abov the natur rate  whatev term you want to use  and the economi is slow   if we still have the risk of inflat but we have a tight polici  which is address that  and now we see a slow  that mean the downsid risk are increas   we might then want a balanc risk statement becaus we have a tight polici to address the one concern and the economi is head in this other direct   so  how one view the appropri of the risk statement depend on how one judg the tight of current monetari polici
suppos you start from the premis that the committe had alreadi act over the past year and a half to tighten monetari polici  consist with an outlook that the economi is oper beyond it potenti and inflat is like to go up  if that were the case  you might judg that the committe had alreadi put monetari polici in a restrict stanc   if you thought that the committe had not tighten enough  i agre that eas in respons to recent develop might not be appropri  and you would be more comfort with further tighten as resourc util rose       but i was start from the premis that you probabl thought you had done just about    enough  mayb you had a littl doubt  or you would have done more   so i was take your action as be indic of a view that you weren t that far from where you thought you want to be   the real rate must be somewher in the neighborhood of the natur rate  if not a littl higher  or we wouldn t have a rise unemploy rate in the staff forecast   so you might judg that it s alreadi restrict   the other point in my brief was this   that even if you had the view last  e that polici might not be restrict enough  certain you would hold that view less strong today  given what has happen over the intermeet period  whether you want to move to a balanc risk statement or not
further question for don   let me start then  the forc that in my view have been most promin sinc the last meet are the still high level of oil and energi price and the evid weaken of profit margin   in combin  those forc have interact and exert a signific effect on the capit good market where a lot of the recent weak in the economi is come from  i think the way to look at the capit good market is  first  to tri to get a judgment as to whether in fact expect of longer term profit in those market have chang in ani materi way   the answer appar is    no      if we take the i b e s data  which are realli the best we have on profit expect  real or crazi  those number have not chang   inde  includ the data for octob  long term expect earn per share in the high tech sector are still at a veri high level   even for the so call    old economi     the thousand plus secur analyst in the i b e s survey still      expect earn to be quit strong   now  as i have said befor  one can argu whether    these forecast are realist and whether they are bias  but the truth of the matter is that they have not deterior   and sinc they have not  one has to conclud that view with respect to potenti product increas  not necessarili in term of the structur number that we use but as reflect in under view regard invest opportun  continu quit strong  it s one thing  howev  to make an argument that we may be  for exampl  onli halfway up the s curv in a long term technolog expans and conclud that capit invest is go to continu veri strong   but  if we get  as inde we are begin to get  an oversuppli in some of the high tech area  we are go to see some weaken in the growth of capit good expenditur   i think the po  child here is fiber optic   the rate of return on all type of invest relat to fiber optic have been extraordinarili high  and the demand has been go up at an unbeliev pace  the problem is one of emerg oversuppli  those who got into the busi earli on are do extraordinarili well   howev  as in commerci real estat ventur where develop who are first to get in when vacanc rate are low make out like gangbust  those who wait to get in may still see low vacanc rate  but if they do not take account of all the new build under construct  they may come off veri poor   that s what has happen in the bandwidth market  the amount of fiber optic capac has gone up astronom   in one sens  as someon mention  demand is tripl but suppli is go up sevenfold   and what that mean  of cours  is that prospect long term rate of return must start to fall          we are begin to see the same thing happen  obvious  with regard to the outlook for short term profit  and we are begin to observ a pullback in this particular type of invest  it   s not that five year from now the level of both demand and capac won   t be veri signific higher than they are today   what we have is a short term glut  and there s some veri consider evid that that is inde the case in a lot of the high tech area   clear  that is not a long term concern  but the market don t know about long term concern   the stock price level in a lot of the high tech industri have been undercut by veri weak output price  and those industri are begin to experi a squeez on their profit margin  anoth factor  for which board staff has provid some numer es   is the question of how larg the increas in energi cost has been in the nonfinanci corpor sector   the staff es  that total energi cost of nonfinanci  nonenergi corpor have gone up rough      billion sinc earli       when we think of that in term of pre tax profit  it is a veri larg number  and it s veri difficult to get around the conclus that a signific part of the eros in overal profit is the result of the inabl of busi firm to pass through these increas in energi cost  rememb  the rise in energi cost involv not onli petroleum   the increas in natur gas price and it spillov to electr power account for a larg portion of the higher energi cost   even coal price are up somewhat   so we are look at a veri major set of cost increas that are begin to have an impact on profit  profit decreas are also a factor moder the growth of the capit good market in the high tech area   that growth is deceler from    percent to    percent  which is not altogeth a disast   but the high tech area has constitut such a      larg proport of gdp growth that even a littl deceler trigger multipli effect    that are begin to affect the consum market  we are inde see some soften in consum expenditur  the octob retail sale figur were consist with the  book forecast of a       percent annual rate of growth in pce for the fourth quarter   but novemb sale are a littl softer   we obvious don t have veri much inform about motor vehicl sale this month  but we are get the same impress you are  presid    name  that the sale of most of the major auto compani are run under their forecast  which season adjust alreadi had been set a shade below octob level   now  that is not necessarili meaning at this point becaus a veri big portion of their forecast is realiz in the last ten day of the month   we all rememb the  e when they were provid us ten day data   now they say they don t have ten day data  they have daili data  but they don t have a mechan to add them up    laughter   at ani rate  the tone in the motor vehicl market is a littl weaker   we are begin to see that soften spill over into auto part  and that is a fair big portion of the industri   it s the reason whi busi condit in the cleveland and chicago district  as i listen to the comment from those district  are describ as somewhat softer  the big jump in initi claim a week ago  while larg stem from the motor vehicl industri  is not someth that we can immedi dismiss   the number that are come out tomorrow on initi claim are down a bit  but they are still well abov their recent low   insur unemploy clear has move up in contrast to the household survey number and the relat unemploy rate   this dichotomi cannot go on for veri much longer   in other word  we ll either get a fair signific      downward spike in initi claim after we ve pass through some of these layoff  which    would then return the claim data to consist with a   percent unemploy rate  or  in the altern  we could see weaker household data and an unemploy rate that start to move up   the outcom is not yet clear  and i don t think we are go to know what it is for a number of week  whether the general slow of the expans is be reinforc by develop on the credit side is a veri import issu   as governor   point out  our es  of overal nonfarm busi credit are down quit signific for the month of octob   the tighten that is be report anecdot is realli quit impress  even though it s easi to exagger it   to be sure  this is not       when for a few day it was imposs to get a bid on an invest grade bond   current  it is just cost that are be affect  but it s fair obvious that this economi is not about to acceler rather quick  on the inflat front  we have some veri funni number   inflat expect  even grant the signific rise in energi cost  have not move   the tip impli inflat rate on    year issu is about where it was two or three month ago  and if anyth it is lower   the univers of michigan survey result  after a slight increas last month  have come back down   the current data are somewhat difficult to read   for exampl  leav asid the issu of the pce versus the cpi  if we es  price for the nonfarm busi sector the way bea calcul them  we find that the inflat rate in the nonfinanci corpor area is realli quit benign and that the entir pickup that we are get end up in the noncorpor busi residu  it is conceiv that the noncorpor busi sector has experienc someth close to a   percent      price increas in the last year  but i doubt it   i think what we have here is the same    problem we have had all along  name that there are bias in these data and it is veri difficult to es  the trend  that the core rate of inflat is rise is in my view unambigu  no matter what price seri we deal with   but es  of the current level of the core inflat rate are  i think  open to quit serious question   the unit labor cost data in the corpor area are slight negat over the past four quarter   in the total nonfarm busi area  they are up  i believ      percent   the big third quarter number is mere the nois that that seri creat and if we look at it in term of a move averag  there is veri littl evid of ani signific acceler in labor cost   there is deterior in the inflat rate stem from interest cost and energi cost  and those are not trivial sourc of deterior   at the end of the day it  sn t have to be labor cost that are caus the overal inflat deterior  the crucial issu  as larri   said  is where we put the nairu     neigh ru      of cours  he like to say the nairu     nigh ru        laughter   how that is go to end up in the transcript  i don t know   if you believ the nairu is at       percent  then we have a serious problem   if the number is   percent  as     say the market is presum  then we don t have a problem   when this transcript is publish five year from now  we will know the answer to that question  but at this point we do not  all in all  i think that we have  as all of you have said  a combin of the potenti persist of signific inflationari pressur and an unquest increas in overal sign of weak   in other word  my judgment  and i guess i agre with almost      everybodi els  is that it would be prematur to move to a balanc risk statement   i say    that for a coupl of reason   as don kohn has suggest  even if we believ that the risk are truli balanc as of today  the market  sn t believ that is our view   as a consequ  were we to go to balanc today we would almost sure end up tomorrow with financi condit that would be too easi in term of the current outlook   in other word  we cannot act without affect the balanc of risk itself   it is necessari for us to incorpor in our judgment of what we should do how the market are go to behav becaus a veri crucial polici issu is the degre of financi tight   if i were ask to identifi what has chang the most signific in the last sever month  i would say it was the quit remark tighten not onli of the junk bond market but of all the invest grade market  and veri particular the bank market   we are get some serious restraint in the latter area  and it seem quit unlik to me that we can get acceler in econom activ from the current level  at the end of the day i would like to stay where we are  includ retent of our statement that the balanc of risk is toward higher inflat   at the same  e  i would like to tri to captur in the languag of the announc our recognit of the presenc of weaken forc in the economi   i would not want to be in the posit of adopt a hard asymmetr statement of the balanc of risk toward rise inflat and then see the economi weaken from under us   that would make us look realli unimagin    laughter   accord  i d like to suggest that we stay with the balanc of risk toward inflat statement  but i want to read to you a draft statement that would accompani it   in present circumst  i don t think you can readili vote appropri without have the full statement up front  becaus i think the statement is realli what we      are argu about at this point   i don t believ there is a realli serious differ of    opinion about where polici ought to be current   but what we say in this case   matter   let me read just the oper part of a propos press releas  the util of the pool of avail worker remain at an unusu high level  and the increas in energi price  though have limit effect on core measur of price to date  still harbor the possibl of rais inflat expect   the committe accord continu to see a risk of heighten inflat pressur   howev  soften in busi and household demand  and tighten condit in financi market over recent month  suggest that the economi could expand for a  e at a pace below the product enhanc rate of growth of it potenti to produc   nonetheless  to date the eas of demand pressur has not been suffici to warrant a chang in the committe s judgment that against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth  and of the inform current avail  the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat heighten inflat pressur in the forese futur   accord  i would like to put on the tabl for your reaction the balanc of risk toward inflat languag and the associ draft press releas that i have just read  vice chair
mr  chairman  i find myself exact where you are   i believ that we have to stay with the balanc of risk on the side of inflat but we also have to express our view that the real world has chang somewhat  the propos verbiag certain sound like someth a central bank would produc   laughter   sinc we are a central bank  i think it say just the right thing and i believ that the languag set the right tone   so  i agre fulli with your propos
mr  chairman  first of all i agre that we should hold steadi on the feder fund rate   but i would prefer a balanc risk statement  and let me give you the logic of my argument  it seem to me that the way monetari polici work today is that we maintain a firm medium run and long run commit to low and stabl inflat  so what we do has to be consist with that   at the same  e  a tremend amount of short run stabil depend on the market chang interest rate in respons to short run develop   that be the case  it seem to me that we want the market to feel free to move rate in respons to current develop in the direct that those develop demand   what i am concern about is that we not set up an expect in the market  which exist today  that there is no near term eas in prospect   that s the expect that s built into the feder fund rate futur   i would like to see a statement that   s more neutral with respect to that possibl so that the market could move more readili in either direct  i think we have to be care about read too much into the tip spread   in my view the tip spread is a measur of our credibl  which is extrem import   i don t think it necessarili mean that we have polici tune right   i could cite a contrari case  name       when polici had chang dramat but the market didn t believ that the fed was go to stay with it   so inflat expect were veri slow to come down and it took a long  e for the expect to catch up with the realiti of where polici was   and the same thing could happen today   i don   t think we want to assum that the tip spread show that we ve got polici just right          i would prefer that in the statement we make it clear that the risk are now balanc  but not becaus the inflat risk has gone away   inde i think  if anyth  the near term inflat risk has gone up somewhat  which we could say   rather  the risk are now balanc becaus the outlook on the output and employ side has chang   i agre that the critic issu is the combin of the statement itself and the balanc of risk claus in the statement   but i would not like to leav the market with the messag that we don t see ani reason prospect of a polici eas in the next few meet  which i think is go to be the tenor of the way the market will interpret that messag
mr  chairman  i too would prefer a balanc risk statement  and my reason are perhap similar to bill pool   s   i think we do have upsid risk for inflat  which we are address   that s whi we have a fed fund rate at the level it is now  which i believ indic a fair tight polici   and i think by hold that posit we have introduc new risk that bring the posit more in balanc in term of the outlook   in my view what is happen with your addit statement is that we ve come full circl   we re now find way to compromis on the risk statement  we are neuter it role and put more emphasi on the rest of the press releas   that may in fact be the option we end up with  which better describ the view of this committe in term of the risk that have now been introduc and the polici action that might be taken in the futur   but by have these two differ statement  i think we are introduc a new potenti for confus in the marketplac as well   so i would go for a balanc statement now in the press releas  but we   ll see how this work
i m sorri you got to me so quick    laughter
do you want to pass
no  i don   t want to pass   the reason i said that is that i   m actual veri sympathet to the point that presid hoenig and pool just made   i think we ve work too hard to be as honest and transpar with the market as possibl  so if we realli think that the risk are balanc  we should say the risk are balanc  on the other hand  i have to say that i also am sympathet to the notion that we don t want the market to build in more of an expect of a near term eas than they current have  and they do have some in there   so if i can put it this way  on balanc  laughter   in think through all of this  which obvious i did a bit befor we came to the meet  the statement that you have introduc strike me as a veri fair descript of where we are   in some sens it s not quit where i am  but i believ it is a fair descript of where we are as a committe and i think it get the messag across without creat some uncertain risk   so  i m support of the statement even though i understand some of the concern that other have rais
mr  chairman  i certain support your recommend for an unchang fund rate  and i also think it s import to retain the statement of prior meet that the balanc of risk is toward higher inflat   i believ it is import as well to explain this in term of develop that have occur sinc our last meet  and in my view the statement that you read to us accomplish that veri well
i would strong prefer a statement of balanc risk  not becaus i think the inflat risk has diminish  but becaus the risk on the down side has increas substanti   and as bill pool said  that assess could be communic in the press releas so as not to give the market the wrong idea   i happen to believ that rapid growth in product and output has been hold inflat down in recent year   if i m right about that  the unfortun corollari is that less strength in those suppli side factor could lead to higher inflat even as demand weaken   a more extrem version of that use to be call stagflat   we need to be in a posit to move in either direct and not be caught lean in one direct and sudden have to move in anoth  we have an oil price problem  which may be with us longer than we expect  given that  along with the declin and volatil in the stock market  the increas strain in financi market  the declin in profit growth  and the volatil in the middl east and florida  laughter   i think a move to a balanc risk statement would reassur market that we are live in the real world   otherwis  i think we re go to appear to be out of touch with what s go on
thank you  mr  chairman   i strong support your recommend   i fear that if we went to neutral languag  it would be read by the market as the first step in an eas cycl   mani in the market expect that and i think they would see a chang of that sort as confirm their belief   and i believ that could prove to be veri serious and import mislead   the  book and at least some of us here see a further tighten as the most like next move   obvious that could be wrong   it could even be wrong quit soon   but i do not see ani need to make a chang      now   mayb we ll want to do that at the next meet  mayb we won t   at ani rate  i    see no need to be preemptiv base on the evid that   s befor us today
mr  chairman  i m comfort with the proposit you   ve put on the tabl  subject to whatev edit of the press statement we decid to do   i   ve scribbl a whole page of note in support of no chang in the bias  think that we were go to have that level of discuss   but i   ll spare myself and everyon els the argument  my conclud thought  though  was go to be that i believ the long term consequ of a further deterior in inflat would be a far more serious and more damag econom outcom than ani short term loss of output   and in respons to your comment  i hypothes that inflat expect haven   t move becaus  accord to survey  peopl are expect us and count on us to cap inflat at the level we   ve had or even move them lower   i would like to reserv the right to come back and make my longer argument if  dure the cours of the next few minut  the weight of opinion shift toward the side of a balanc statement   i m veri comfort with where you are and with the propos you ve put on the tabl
i m sorri  did you say you want to make a differ
if it turn out in the cours of the go around
oh  i see what you mean
i d like to come back and give you the rest of my argument in favor of retain the bias  if in fact it come to that
in other word  you want a vote recount   laughter
i think we just won the argument    laughter
machin or hand count
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend  for some  e i   ve believ that our polici is posit about where it should be   that continu to be my view   we obvious haven t had to take ani action in the last sever month  and that s fine  i would have troubl chang the balanc of risk statement becaus in my view not enough has chang in the past sever week   i think we would have a real problem explain and justifi the basi for such a chang   some of our discuss has been couch in term of futur growth of the economi below potenti  put asid what we realli know about potenti with ani confid  obvious our abil to forecast the economi reason accur is limit   one thing we do know is that the economi has tend to the veri  veri resili in recent year   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre complet with your recommend both on keep the balanc of risk toward higher inflat and the languag that you read   i agre with presid   that it is central bankish type of languag  and mayb i ve been here too long  but i thought it was veri well state   laughter  let me make just a coupl of comment   i think your point that we can t act on the tilt without influenc the financi market at this  e is a veri import one       those in the market obvious read our statement care  we   ve all seen how they    interpret our last few statement   we chang the verb  i think  in one sentenc a littl  and they read it veri  veri care  and they saw that as a gradual move   just a bit of a counter to presid pool   s point  i think the market will read this propos statement as a move toward eas  although obvious not as much as our remov the tilt entir  also  i want to associ myself with those around the tabl who earlier express concern about further fiscal s ulus from increas govern spend as a result of gridlock   what has happen this fall is a clear indic to me that we could be go down that road  and that would lead to further fiscal s ulus  and final  i just want to say that if there is go to be a recount  i would like to speak first becaus those of us in chicago know how to handl recount    laughter
i   ve heard that if you rig the number in the begin  you won t have to do a recount
we have mani differ way of accomplish
i don t want to hear ani more    laughter  presid santomero
i support the propos statement   i  too  came prepar with a long list of argument on whi we should remain where we were in term of the tilt   i ll forgo those and forgo ani request to come back and discuss them further  i find myself in complet agreement with both the word and the logic behind it   i recogn that we may not have seen ani long term or major chang in inflat expect  but the fed must remain vigil against that possibl and focus the market on our continu concern over inflat   given the tool at the fed   s      dispos  the best way for us to ensur maximum sustain growth is to stay focus on    our goal of price stabil   with due regard given to the current econom vulner  it is essenti that the fed maintain it credibl  and i believ the propos statement   that   thank you
first vice presid pianalto
i also agre with your recommend   like other  i was prepar to make a longer statement in case the recommend was to chang the tilt  and my reason for that is that i am concern about our object of achiev price stabil   but like other  i will also spare you from the statement
thank you  mr  chairman   i also agre with both the direct of your polici recommend  i e   no chang in the fund rate  and with the tilt recommend   i think gari  n sum up my thought about these issu quit complet   we shouldn t overreact to the fact that the expans is slow   we want it to slow   we don   t know where potenti is   the financi market happen to be the mean by which it is slow   it s import to recogn that in our statement  but it   s also import to keep our focus on the still remain inflationari risk and the fact that we need the economi to slow to address that risk
thank you  mr  chairman   the last thing i want to do is to inspir a bunch of lectur from the other side of the tabl   laughter  so i will support the statement   it is inde a close call for me          at the same  e  let me make two point   i think we are get veri close to the point where the risk are near balanc if not perfect balanc   and i think there is an occam   s razor principl with respect to these press statement   they get so thorough pars by everybodi that in my view there is a lot to be said for the simpler the better   you have come up with a nice approach that i ll call the downsid upsid approach  and i think it will work   but i think we have to be pretti care about this and at some point i d like to go back to a strategi that if the risk realli are balanc  we ought to say so   i have four friend in this argument   bill  pool   tom  hoenig   roger      and bob      and i would join that list  though support your statement  my other point is on the market   i m not sure we understand veri well what the market reaction to all this will be   it is certain possibl that this would spark a ralli and i don t think anybodi want to see that   but as don said  there are a coupl of scenario that go the other way   one is that this could all be factor in  in which case a move to a balanc risk statement won t do too much to the market   anoth possibl is that market may think that we see someth that they don t  and market could actual go down   i have no idea which of these scenario is the most like   so i think we have to be a littl care about be lock in iron  if you will  by the market reaction   at some point we just have to do what we think is the right thing to do and tri to explain it  and i think the market will come around
mr  chairman  i strong favor the polici posit you   re recommend  the asymmetri   and i would just underlin what gari  n said   i      thought he made an interest observ  name that it would be veri difficult at this    point to explain whi we would chang to a balanc statement   and i think that would just further encourag market to expect that we are begin a cycl of eas  which in my view would increas the upsid risk  also  i would go back to someth that governor   said in the econom discuss  and i thought he put it quit well   it   s just too earli to get over concern about downsid risk   we have had mani quarter in which there was a general consensus that aggreg demand was grow more rapid than potenti   we now have one quarter when it may be grow somewhat more slowli than potenti   frank  i think that s healthi   and if i could follow on ned     s medic analog  i wouldn t want to do anyth at this point to undercut the therapi  as far as the statement is concern  i think this one realli get it exact right  i believ the nuanc are exact right   so  i   m a    yes    on both count
mr  chairman  i support your recommend in all respect  specif  i think we should retain the statement of unbalanc risk   and i thought the statement that you read was excel
e to vote
thank you   it   s  e to vote  inde   would you read the appropri languag
