curv  as shown in the bottom left panel  has also invert   to fill out the pictur  the bottom right panel graph ten   thirti   and fifti year break even rate  but given the distort  it   s not clear how much should be read into these number   such movement in u k  real yield have caught the attent of u s  portfolio manag  with continu talk about the prospect for chang to pension fund rule here  there are those who believ that the unit state will gravit toward the u k  approach of requir the match of durat for asset and liabil   if so  then the prospect of a steadi bid for long date asset may both damp yield volatil at the long end and lower yield from what they might have been   that would truli make the curv veri suspect as an indic of futur econom perform   if the shape of the u s

the fed fund target in blue  the high and low for each day in gray  and the daili effect rate in red   you   ll note that  although the effect rate was general close to the target in the mainten period that cover the year end  there was a bit more variabl of rate  usual late in the day  with some tendenc for rate to soften   part of this was relat to normal year end nois   note also the drift higher in the effect rate ahead of the decemb fomc meet   this reflect the market   s anticip of the new target rate and the tendenc to move the fund rate from the old to the new target rate day befor the meet   the middl panel look at this phenomenon more close   it graph the differ between the market  effect  rate and the target fed fund rate in the day befor an fomc meet   to make a cleaner comparison  the sampl includ onli those period in which the fomc meet fell on the first tuesday of the two week reserv mainten period and period in which there were no high payment day through the meet date that might have influenc market condit   it should be note that  in all these mainten period  the market had come to fulli expect a    basi point tighten move by the start of the period   the blue line show  for the      sampl date  the drift higher in the fund rate as the fomc meet date get closer  on averag  the fund rate was about   basi point firm on the thursday preced the meet and rose to be    basi point firm to the old target on the tuesday meet date itself   in our      sampl  the anticip effect was even more pronounc in the day ahead of the meet  with the fund rate    basi point firm on the thursday and the expect move almost fulli price in on the day befor the meet   the bottom panel underscor the difficulti that the desk face when it tri to lean against expect that are so wide held   this graph show  for the same sampl of period  the amount of averag excess reserv in the day lead up to the fomc meet   it also show what more typic level of excess reserv look like over the first four day of a mainten period  base on reserv level from period in      and      in which there was no polici chang and in which there were no high payment date in the first four day   in       the desk was alreadi provid much higher level of excess reserv than normal in the day lead up to the fomc meet dure these period  in order to mitig the anticip effect  and these anticip effect becam even more pronounc in       despit our have increas the level of excess reserv even further   we tend to believ that the higher anticip effect seen in      reflect a learn process on the part of market particip sinc the start of the tighten cycl in mid       as buyer and seller test their abil to arbitrag their reserv hold over more day in the mainten period around the expect polici chang   it   s not clear what the natur limit is to this process   mr  chairman  i am happi to report onc again that there were no foreign oper in the period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper     and i are happi to take ani question
i   d like to go back to the british experi  which i think is intrigu in a number of differ respect   the unit kingdom has tip type issu go out fifti year   what do they index the fifti year matur to  incident
it   s the rpix
so it   s not terribl dissimilar to our   but what i think is realli quit fascin is that these relationship are larg demograph driven   in other word  the question is essenti that  if we   re head into a societi in which an ever increas proport of the peopl are retir  then you have some real pressur to fund   which we don   t do but everyon els should   let   s put it this way   everi pension theoretician will tell you there is no problem with pension   all you have to do is make the appropri matur match   and if you get a big surg in potenti retire  the demand for longer term issu goe up  which we take as a given  but this is the first evid   at least that i   ve been abl to see   that this is an overwhelm forc becaus  irrespect of the other forc that drive the long term rate  the spread between the thirti year and the fifti year is realli quit pronounc   and it is suggest that it cannot be an econom forecast   we have enough troubl forecast nine month   laughter   but to draw the distinct between thirti year out and fifti year out  i submit  is a wholli random variabl   and so it has to be the demograph   and what the demograph are tell us is that the issu is larg enough to essenti domin the longer end of the market  this suggest to me that the thirti year  which we struggl to get rid of and is now come back  may not turn out to be the longest matur we   re eventu go to sell becaus the evid suggest that there is a veri heavi demand in thirti year forward  all of which will tend to depress the thirti year yield if we don   t have a greater matur   and there will be market pressur to de link that whole thirti year plus back onto the issu  i was wonder whether or not this subject is engag the street becaus i   ve been puzzl by the tranch of the thirti year issu  which matur from      on  when the fiscal problem in the unit state seem mount potenti instabl   which is anoth way of say that these pressur may overwhelm the econom   at least they are do so in britain  and the question is  do you think we   re go to be replic britain   s experi
well  my reason for includ this detail at the meet realli is becaus that   s the anecdot feedback that i   ve been get over the past few week and month   and  in a sens  the u k  experi caught a lot of portfolio manag here by surpris  and it has made them rethink their assumpt about the effect that a chang in pension rule would have on our long end   and that  i think  is exact the point that you   re make
but if we know that there has alway been this presumpt  well  it can   t be larg enough to have an effect
i think what we   ve learn from the u k  case is that it can be   in a sens  the thirti year gilt in the unit kingdom becam disengag from the rest of the curv some year ago   and we had an upward slope curv to about ten  and then it becam invert becaus of these pension effect   or that seem to be the prevail consensus   so some particip in our market are tri to think ahead over the next five  ten  fifteen year about what chang in pension rule would do to the shape of the curv   what will be the demograph that will drive it   and it   s make them rethink their assumpt about demand driven by demograph  as you say  versus other kind of demand that might increas suppli becaus of fiscal factor   so you might get an iron effect in which you   ll get more suppli but the demand is even higher becaus of what   s happen
mr  chairman  may i make three point   the first is that i would underscor what dino said   a great event studi occur when the prudent man law in the unit kingdom chang  and you saw longer term yield fall as a result becaus pension manag had to go out further on the curv
what was the date of that
around        second  as you know  in the discuss with the treasuri  we actual tri veri hard to convinc them to go to thirti and then to go beyond   but that   s a veri slow move boat   third  real long term secur are veri convex in return   so just becaus of the arithmet of the yield curv  you would think that the fifti year yield should be below the thirti year  as the thirti year is below the twenti year   so in an environ of uncertainti about futur yield  it isn   t that surpris
well  what happen to the term premium
in fact  the yield curv is a competit between two factor in uncertainti   becaus of uncertainti  the term premium itself should march up at approxim linear in matur
it get overwhelm by the arithmet
but convex is a quadrat and start about at the twenti year matur pull down yield   that   s whi typic the thirti year yield is below the twenti year yield  when you get out to the fifti year  then the effect of convex is even more pronounc
when we were do the analysi of the chang in the term premium  sinc we know the convex characterist and we know what the longer term rate are  were we abl to infer part of our analysi from the longer term element   that   s the onli thing we realli add
sure   for instanc  when the unit kingdom first issu a fifti year secur  we price what a fifti year matur would be in the unit state   and it was well below the thirti year and not that dissimilar to what actual happen   so part it is just that  becaus bond are in price and that   s what peopl care about but we quot yield  the effect of convex is go to pull down longer term yield
go back to the chairman   s question on size  dino  the press and mani analyst focus on central bank reserv when they talk about what   s buffet intermedi term rate   if you talk to barclay  they give you aw big number of potenti dedic money on the pension side  an order of magnitud of  say  multipl of six or seven  e what central bank reserv are   could we studi the potenti size that   s at play here   and  of cours  the unit kingdom is not just dedic to u k  fix incom instrument   they   re also look at our fix incom instrument at the longer end of the curv   so get a sens of dimens here  if possibl  might assist this convers   i think that this is veri  veri import
i think it can be look at   i think the other point that you hint at  which is veri import  is that it   s not just u s  manag look at u s  tip but european manag look at u s  inflat link secur   it   s a veri good point   i think it   s worth studi
i just want to note that i meet on monday morn befor open market committe meet with a few pension fund manag and mutual fund manag just to hear what they   re hear in the market   they are veri much on the same wave length that you were  mr  chairman  in feel that the flat of the yield curv was larg due to the desir for long date secur in the pension fund arena to better match asset and liabil and that it was not at all  or at least not in major part  a comment about the economi but more a function of institut and market demand for these long date secur   now  i don   t know whether they think that the legisl now in the congress is go to pass  but they seem to be veri focus on the fact that they need more longer date secur and that suppli of the thirti year would  in effect  creat more demand for the thirti year
the legisl realli is irrelev   the problem here is that a set of liabil is be creat by the steep of the retir curv  and there is an obvious requir to fund that set   but the bill in the congress is tri to play game with the type of discount rate that compani can use   the onli real discount factor that fund manag can use  if they serious believ that what they are promis is to be guarante  is to put pension fund in u s  treasuri and to tranch them in a manner that exact meet the matur requir   that situat  therefor  has noth to do with what the piec of legisl is and everyth to do with the rate of chang of the popul over
i agre with you  but the fund manag that i have talk with would frame the problem in the context of increas pressur from the outsid
in other word  whether that bill pass or not  the pressur to fund these liabil are go to increas  especi after the babi boom generat start to retir and fund manag look at the size of it
i have heard a few anecdot regard ceo who have been veri surpris and becom angri when they saw that their unfund pension fund cost them earn over the past few year   they basic direct the cfo and  in turn  the pension manag not to let this happen again   thus  regardless of legisl  there has been a shift at the margin from equiti into debt with match durat
yes   that   s certain what the fund manag were say
vice chair  would you move to ratifi
thank you   would you like to make an econom present  dave  thank you  mr  chairman   a few year back  i note that my
brief could larg be character as a collect of confess and excus  this morn i would like to add a new element to that list   denial   as you know  the bea   s advanc es  for the growth in real gdp in the fourth quarter   shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit   came in last friday at an annual rate of     percent  about half the pace that we had project   but at this point  we don   t believ that this es  should be taken as a signal that the economi has fundament weaken   to be sure  after a first round of sort through the detail of that report  we haven   t found a smoke gun that give us ani strong reason to overrid the bea   s es    but we have assum that there will be a bounceback in some area that were surpris weak last quarter  most notabl motor vehicl output and feder

sector  the subject of exhibit     the accumul data have made us more confid  though far from certain  that we are reach an inflect point in the hous boom   the bigger question now is whether we will experi the gradual cool that we are project or a more pronounc downturn   i   ll be interest to hear your report this morn   as for the recent data  sale of exist home  the red line in the top left panel  have drop sharpli in recent month and by more than we had expect   new home sale  the black line  have also move off their peak of last summer but are more consist with our expect of a gradual soften   that expect receiv some further support from the more  e mortgag banker    purchas index   plot to the right   purchas applic also are off their high but are not indic ani sharp retrench through januari   with respect to hous price  the recent data and anecdot also have point to some weaken   as a result  our forecast of a sharp deceler in home price   shown in the middl left panel   seem less of a stretch than it did a while back   as shown to the right  the bottom line is that  after contribut import to the growth of real gdp over the past four year  residenti invest is expect to deceler sharpli this year and to turn down a bit in        as we have note befor  our hous price forecast also has implic for consum spend   slower growth of hous price is the chief factor caus the wealth to incom ratio  the black line in the bottom left panel  to drift down over the project period   that downdrift  along with the lag reaction to higher interest rate  result in a gradual rise in the person save rate over the next two year   as shown to the right  although spend growth fall short of that of incom  overal pce receiv consider support from the strong gain in dispos incom that result from the project flatten of energi price  ongo employ gain  and a step up in the pace of hour compens   busi invest is the subject of exhibit     spend on equip and softwar  plot as the black line in the top left panel  slow gradual over the project period  larg becaus the acceler effect that propel the earlier recoveri in capit outlay begin to wane   nevertheless  with the cost of capit remain moder and corpor balanc sheet strong  we are forecast solid increas in real e s spend this year and next   our project for total nonresidenti structur  shown in the panel to the right  reflect some diverg pattern in the compon   we expect outlay for drill and mine  line    to increas sharpli further this year in respons to the run up that has occur in the price for crude oil and natur gas   although those price are expect to level off  the lag effect of the earlier gain should result in some further  albeit diminish  increas in drill activ in        exclud drill and mine  line    we are project a modest recoveri in nonresidenti construct activ in respons to ongo gain in employ and gradual declin vacanc rate in the offic and industri sector   one of the reason that we are reason op ist about the invest outlook is that the total return to capit   plot in the middl left panel   remain quit favor   and although we expect that return to reced a bit as labor cost pick up  it would still remain elev by histor standard over the forecast period   the remaind of the exhibit is someth of a go away present to the chairman   while he alway seem to have a grip on where product was head in the futur  we alway seem to be struggl to explain what had happen in the past   most recent  those struggl have center on understand the continu strong gain in product in the first half of this decad   one import element of our stori has been that the invest boom of the late     s was at least part respons for sow the seed of the further acceler in multifactor product that we have experienc this decad   that capit equip embodi rapid improv technolog and allow firm to some  radic restructur busi process   more broad  as adjust cost associ with absorb those invest wane  the product advantag show through more clear   the bottom panel provid some modest support for the proposit that some of the improv perform of multifactor product of the first half of the decad can be trace to the earlier invest boom   that panel employ a new data set base on research spearhead by my colleagu   corrado  paul lengermann  and larri   that calcul multifactor product for detail industri  along the x axi  we measur for each of    industri the averag rate of growth in invest over the      to      period relat to that industri   s histor norm  on the y axi  we plot the acceler in mfp experienc by each industri from the      to      period to the      to      period   as seen by the red regress line  those industri for which the growth of equip and softwar was unusu high in the late     s were more like than other to experi a subsequ acceler in multifactor product in the first part of this decad   obvious  this is not a structur relationship and is meant to be impressionist   but the recoveri in equip spend over the past few year leav us op ist that multifactor product can continu to grow at a rapid clip  though perhap not quit at the pace regist over the first half of the decad   sandi will now continu our present
your next two exhibit detail the suppli side assumpt of the staff forecast  start with the project of structur labor product   in our analysi  structur labor product growth is defin as the increment to labor product that can be sustain over  e   it is a medium  to long run concept that attempt to elimin the bulk of the cyclic influenc on product growth   as shown on the top right  structur labor product growth can  in turn  be decompos into the contribut from capit deepen  labor qualiti  and structur multifactor product growth   as indic in the middl left panel  the recoveri that has occur in the level of busi capit spend over the past four year translat into a pickup in the growth of capit servic  although not to the pace that prevail dure the boom year of      to        the contribut of capit deepen to structur product growth   that is  the product of the growth in capit servic per hour and the capit share of output   pick up gradual over the next two year   note in the middl right panel that the bulk of this contribut come from invest in inform technolog   as has been the case for all of this decad   in contrast  the pace of growth in structur multifactor product   shown in the bottom left   has great exceed the pace over the      to      period   this is just the manifest at the aggreg level of the drive forc shown in dave   s scatter plot   howev  we have allow for slight slower growth in      and      than in the preced year as the margin gain from addit organiz improv and embodi technic chang begin to wane   in addit  as note in the right  we   ve seen some level off in expenditur on research and develop late  which may well manifest itself in a somewhat slower pace of technolog chang in the year ahead   your next exhibit present our es  of potenti output growth   as shown on line    we expect potenti real gdp to expand at a    percent pace over the next two year   as you can see on line    total potenti hour work   or trend labor input   is expect to slow somewhat   although popul growth is expect to be well maintain  the trend in both labor forc particip and the averag workweek are offset factor   as we   ve note befor  the downtrend in the labor forc particip rate  shown in the middl left  main reflect the chang demograph composit of the workforc   the es  trend in the workweek  in the middl right panel  shift down in        reflect the introduct of naic in the payrol survey   and is expect to fall at about the same pace in      and      as it has sinc        the implic of these suppli side assumpt for the labor market are shown in the bottom two panel   although nonfarm payrol are expect to increas brisk in the near term  we expect gain to slow progress over the next two year  reflect the moder in the pace of econom growth and the slower growth in the potenti labor forc that i just describ   inde  we expect trend payrol growth to averag onli         per month over the next two year   as shown on the bottom right  the unemploy rate hold fair steadi this year and next   given the pace of econom growth last year  our model of     s law was surpris by the extent of the declin in the unemploy rate   the gap between the red and black line   we are expect this error to be work off over the cours of this year  and in      the unemploy rate move in sync with the     s law simul   your next exhibit present the outlook for the growth in labor compens   in the januari  book  we project hour compens  as measur by both the eci and p c compens per hour  to acceler over the next two year   we think that continu strong growth in structur labor product will elev wage demand  while labor market slack will be a relat neutral influenc on compens growth   inflat expect to date have remain anchor  but we have allow for some pass through into wage of the higher price inflat in      and        this morn   s read on the eci show that hour compens in privat industri increas   percent in the    month end in decemb   the same as the judgment project in the januari  book   howev  as you can see in the bottom left  our econometr equat for the eci has overpredict the actual growth in compens sinc the middl of       possibl suggest that our es  nairu of   percent is too high   in look at the rang of econometr wage and price model that we follow  the evid on a chang in the nairu is mix   we have note a tendenc for some model to overpredict inflat late   but as shown in the bottom right  the random natur  and the smaller absolut size  of the error from one of our better reduc form price equat   not yet suggest the need to lower our es  of the nairu   i will return to the implic of this assumpt later in my remark   your next exhibit present the outlook for inflat   recent read on headlin inflat  shown in the top left  have remain at the high end of the elev rang that has prevail sinc        those read reflect main the direct effect of higher energi price  which have increas at an averag pace of    percent per year over the past two year   in contrast  we have seen some moder in the pace of core consum price inflat  with the twelv month chang in both the core pce and the core cpi index slow to about   percent   look ahead  we have had to cope with somewhat greater pressur on inflat in this  book   these pressur stem main from the upward revis to our project of crude oil price and core nonfuel import price that dave discuss  as a result of these chang  the moder in pce energi price is somewhat less than in past  book  and we anticip greater spillov on the price of other industri materi  shown in the middl right    on net  we expect core pce price  line   in the bottom left panel  to increas    percent this year befor deceler to    percent in      as the influenc of these cost shock reced   the bottom right panel show two altern simul that address key risk to the inflat outlook   the advers shock simul assum that the economi is hit with addit increas in the price of oil  non oil import  and industri materi that match those that prevail in        under the assumpt that the fund rate remain on it baselin path  core pce inflat move up to about     percent in      and       the red line    in contrast  as i note earlier  our es  of the nairu may be too high  and a second simul examin the implic of a    percent nairu   essenti one standard deviat below our current es   under this assumpt  core pce price inflat fall to     percent by the end of next year   even though these two simul embodi some fair larg differ in assumpt from the  book baselin  both simul remain well insid a    percent confid interv about our forecast   nathan will now continu with our present
your first intern exhibit focus on the dollar   as indic by the red line in the top left panel  despit widen u s  extern imbal  the dollar rose strong against the major currenc through much of

half of last year climb to     percent  as growth in the emerg market economi  line    exceed   percent   go forward  we expect the foreign economi on averag to expand at a strong pace of     percent

industri countri are seen to step down in mid       as the run up in oil price play through   for the emerg market economi  oil price increas typic pass through into consum price more slowli  as a number of these countri have price control or subsidi in place that temporarili cushion the upward pressur on price   as such  the rise in oil price should continu to push up consum price inflat

from      q  to      q    a period of dollar appreci   the current account balanc fell      billion  which was more than account for by a declin in the non oil trade balanc   over the next four year  the second column   the current account balanc drop anoth      billion  larg becaus of a continu declin in the non oil trade balanc  despit a net depreci of the dollar  and a sharp rise in oil import

the final exhibit present your econom project for      and        the central tendenc of those project anticip real gdp to increas about     percent this year and then to run between   and     percent in       forecast of core pce price inflat are center on   percent this year and between    and   percent in        meanwhil  the unemploy rate is expect to be between    and   percent both this year and next   i would appreci receiv ani revis in your forecast by the close of busi friday   my colleagu and i would be happi to take ani question that you might have
in exhibit    the averag workweek is someth of a puzzlement   i   m curious to get a sens of what is our now retrospect explan of the sharp fall in the year         and the failur to start back up as the economi pick up   are we look at an age or a demograph mix
well  the      effect was the incorpor of the naic classif into the payrol survey   so it was just a methodolog chang that was realiz
so  realli  we never had such a drop   the seri is just discontinu
it   s discontinu   if you look at the two slope  they   re about the same befor and after  but there is discontinu in
we know labor forc particip chang as peopl move into differ age bracket   so if we have data of averag hour by age  do we have ani judgment as to whether their averag workweek hour chang as well
not to my knowledg
i don   t know either  mr  chairman   i would suspect  though i don   t realli know  that workweek would tend to declin later in an individu   s life cycl  certain relat to the prime age work year
individu also may be more affluent so that they have an abil to actual
or affluent and more like to be take on part  e work in retir    laughter   i   m not suggest that your workweek is like to fall  i   m sure it   s go to maintain it current level    laughter
i object to that    laughter   i mean  there are data by age  certain in the household survey we pick up someth
i   m just curious   presid santomero
i want to go to the hous issu   in the project in the  book  as i understand it  you   ve got hous price go up at about a     percent rate as compar with last year   s number  which i think is    percent   we   ve been look at the sensit of what happen to our gdp growth rate in       and       to the extent that hous price stay flat   our number suggest that a flat hous price associ with the declin in residenti invest would shave about    percentag point off gdp in       and about     or     if you add the consumpt effect     that sound like a reason sensit to you
that sound like a reason sensit   as you know  we have present this effect in the past   it   s a littl larger than the effect that we get when we run our model  which would be measur more around   percentag point to    percentag point   now  you may recal that last june     present some simul of various hous price scenario   our relat small effect come from just simul a lower path for the price of hous  and as you know  our model has a relat low margin propens to consum out of hous wealth  one that is similar to that out of overal household wealth  it   s not difficult to imagin up those effect   if one want to assum that  instead of the three and a half cent on the dollar effect that we have incorpor in our model  the margin propens to consum was around five to seven cent on the dollar  those effect would obvious be increas   the second potenti channel that our straightforward model simul don   t account for is that a lower path for hous price could be accompani by some hit to consum sen ent   there would be an outsiz effect on consum spend if household realli becam more pessimist given the downturn in what is an asset with a high profil in their portfolio   and the third possibl that   explor in his simul was relat to one of the altern simul we show this  e around   if weaken in hous price and hous activ occur when the term premium was widen back out  you would then have the effect not onli direct on the hous sector side  which could be amplifi  but also on other form of interest sensit spend  so i think there are some pretti wide confid interv   the number that you cite are bigger than our standard simul  but seem reason and in the ballpark if one want to make a few adjust in some of the assumpt that we made   as i contempl our outlook and the thing that i worri about the most on the domest side of the economi  i   d say the hous sector is clear one of the biggest risk that you   re current confront
nathan  if you look at the differ between the  book forecast of the path of the extern balanc and those of other forecast  can you summar for us what the major sourc of differ are   are they about the exchang rate assumpt  or are they about someth els
i think the sourc vari from forecast to forecast   one differ across these forecast relat to our is in the oil price   the other forecast are in the         rang  wherea we have an oil price of     to       so that   s a piec of it   look at the assumpt embed in these forecast pretti care  the one forecast that has a much sharper depreci of the dollar than what we   ve written down is the global insight forecast  which show the dollar fall quit dramat over the next year or so   but i don   t find signific differ assumpt about the exchang rate in the other forecast   so i guess the bottom line is that i think a lot of this differ is just a differ in model  and we   re confid that   if you give us an exchang rate  relat price  and so forth   we   re pretti good at map those under variabl into a path for the current account
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  befor we go to the general discuss  becaus of the unusu natur of this particular one day session with various  e problem  i just calcul that  in the eighteen year i   ve been here  we   ve gone from an averag present of three minut to one of six minut    laughter   the drift has been inexor upward   and i will suggest to you that  unless we are somewhat unusu restrain today  we   re go to run way over what our luncheon plan are  and we will be forc to call them dinner    laughter   so may i suggest  if at all possibl  that you tri to restrain the  e that you   re employ on this particular occas   with those restrict  who would like to start off   laughter
with restraint  mr  chairman  most of our contact this round were posit about current busi condit   howev  they were cautious about the prospect for        larg becaus they didn   t see ani obvious driver for growth  with regard to current condit  nation labor market appear to be solid   both of the temporari help firm headquart in our district report that their busi was veri good   of cours  they mention that it was softer in the midwest  primarili becaus of the problem of the big three automak and their spillov and becaus of supplier in the region economi   one mention that michigan was the onli state in which he had seen a drop in the demand for busi and technic worker   i mention last  e that thing could get wors if the delphi negoti result in a strike  and all three parti   delphi  uaw  and gm   are talk   delphi has tone down it rhetor  and the deadlin has now been push back to februari     turn to cost and price pressur  wage and benefit continu to increas at a moder pace   with regard to other cost  i heard the usual concern about price for energi and energi relat input in ship  but the report about other materi cost were mix   there was one interest case in which capac consider were show up in higher price  and that   s the airlin industri   unit report that the reduc capac in the industri has made it easier for them to rais price  particular when it come to pass through fuel cost   and  as you know  they are schedul to exit bankruptci short  as i mention in the past  i   m concern about the high amount of liquid circul in financi market   for exampl  one of our director who head a major privat equiti firm note that such fund were have no troubl attract investor   he said that the amount of new money invest in privat equiti firm is expect to expand    percent this year  and there is a slight omin look to some of the new investor  such as underfund state pension fund that are    reach for return     as he describ it   similar  earli last week we held our semiannu meet of academ and local busi economist  and i heard comment about unusu high liquid level from sever economist who work for invest firm and commerci bank   and as we all know  risk spread are quit low by histor standard   so i worri that there   s a lot of money chase invest out there  and that this may have driven the price of risk down too far  in the nation outlook  even with the weak fourth quarter number we continu to expect that econom activ will expand at a solid pace similar to that in the  book   we see growth at or slight abov trend over the next two year and the unemploy rate remain around   percent   of cours  if the fourth quarter sluggish spill forward  we would have a more complic set of issu to deal with  but i agre with the staff and expect that growth will bounc back this quarter   with regard to price  we think that core pce inflat will averag close to   percent over the forecast period   the outsid economist at our meet last week general agre with this outlook  although a coupl predict that gdp growth would fall somewhat below   percent in       most of these economist thought that we would rais the fed fund rate to    to   percent and then go on hold   as alway  we   re go to have to take a hard look at the data and forecast befor we decid what to do   inflat could moder further   we   ve been pleasant surpris at firm    abil to absorb cost shock   if they continu to do so  we could be look at core pce inflat rate head down this spring   in that event  inflat risk would be diminish  and there would be fewer risk in end the current rate cycl   but there   s a good chanc that recent cost increas will pass through  and we   ll experi a repeat of last winter   s uptick in core inflat   moreov  i can see some plausibl outcom for growth that would pressur resourc util   and in that event  we   d be look at a forecast for core inflat that was stuck abov   percent   i think this would be a problem   with inflat remain at such rate  we could begin to lose credibl if market mistaken infer that our comfort zone had drift higher   when we stop rais rate  we ought to be reason confid that polici is restrict enough to bring inflat back toward the center of our comfort zone  which i believ is     percent   and as i read the long run simul in the bluebook  it seem to say that the fund rate need to rise a bit over   percent by late      to bring core inflat down to     percent within a reason period   so for today  we should move forward with an increas of    basi point  and we should allow ourselv enough flexibl so that polici can either stop or continu move  as the situat warrant
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data on econom activ  as summar by the fourth quarter gdp figur  have been surpris weak   but there are good reason to believ that much of the soft will prove temporari  so i tend to agre with the  book and other forecast in expect a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter  that said  i want to sound a note of caution   this view is base on incomplet data for the fourth quarter and a pauciti of inform concern activ in the first quarter   it is not inconceiv that the weak number for the fourth quarter could presag a more prolong  sluggish phase as the lag effect of past polici tighten and higher oil price take effect   this caution is heighten by my concern that the economi face some pretti big downsid risk  especi have to do with the interrel issu of possibl overvalu in hous market and low term premium in bond market   these risk are highlight by the altern simul in the  book concern a rise in the save rate and a higher term premium   in summari  i see the  book   s view of real activ for this year as veri reason  but downsid risk to that forecast give me paus  turn to inflat  core pce inflat over the past twelv month   at     percent   has come in higher than i would like to see   but assum that growth slow to trend later this year  my outlook for inflat in      is more op ist than the  book   one reason stem from work our staff has done on the extent of pass through from energi price to both labor compens and core price inflat   as i   ve said befor  the evid suggest to us that there has been relat littl pass through sinc the earli     s  perhap due to the credibl of our commit to the stabil of core inflat   under our assumpt of veri littl pass through  we expect the core pce price index to rise around    percent  both this year and next   the  book show an increas of    percent this year  presum reflect larger energi price pass through  and then a drop to about    percent in      as the effect of energi price subsid   so though i differ with the  book on inflat in       over the longer period i think we   re about on the same page  so as i look at the total pictur  i would say that the overal outlook is quit posit   the economi is near full employ with real gdp tend toward trend like growth   core inflat is within a reason rang but a bit on the high side   needless to say  it   s fit for chairman  span to leav offic with the economi in such solid shape   and if i might tortur a simil  i would say  mr  chairman  that the situat you   re hand off to your successor is a lot like a tenni racquet with a gigant sweet spot    laughter  posit though the situat is  it also obvious rais the issu of how much higher the fund rate need to go to keep the economi on this desir trajectori   there are a number of way of look at this question  all yield similar answer   first  a fund rate of     percent rest right near the center of the rang of es  for the equilibrium fund rate   along the same line  our staff ran simul of frb us to calcul the net effect of monetari polici action over the past sever year on real gdp growth   the result are that  after ad import to growth over the last few year  past polici accommod is rough neutral in term of growth this year and next  a second approach is to compar a fund rate of     percent with the recommend of taylor type rule   such calcul suggest that a     percent fund rate this quarter is a bit on the tight side now but should be about right later this year under the  book forecast   the long run simul in the bluebook are a third method to judg the stanc of polici   these simul show the fund rate op  peak at a littl over   percent  well abov where we are now   but a major factor account for this relat high peak is the  book   s assumpt  incorpor in the bluebook simul  that energi pass through push up core pce inflat to    percent this year   and as i   ve emphas  we   re not convinc that this much pass through is like  and our lower inflat forecast impli a lower peak for the fund rate along an op  path  taken togeth  then  these approach suggest to me that if we tighten polici at this meet  as i think we should  we will be close to the appropri peak in the fund rate base on what we know now   as for the futur path of the fund rate  i believ it should be high depend on unfold event and cannot be prejudg with ani degre of confid   so the bottom line is that we need to posit ourselv for flexibl in our polici choic go forward
thank you   presid santomero
thank you  mr  chairman   consist with the nation economi  overal activ in the third district slow somewhat more than expect in the fourth quarter  despit this slow  the general view in my district is that our region economi is like to expand at a moder pace in       payrol employ continu to expand in our three state  but at a more moder pace than we saw in the first half of        overal  market condit remain firm   the three state unemploy rate end up at     percent  slight lower than the nation rate   region manufactur activ continu to expand at a moder pace   the index of general activ in our manufactur survey declin to plus     in januari  it lowest level in seven month   but the index of shipment  new order  and employ were all up   this diverg is unusu  typic  they move togeth   when they do diverg  i tend to put more weight on the shipment and new order index  as these reflect the respond    own firm rather than the opinion about general econom condit   in addit  the fact that our firm have not yet chang their capit spend plan for      suggest that their outlook remain posit  retail sale in our district are rise moder   retail still express concern about the potenti depress effect of higher gasolin and heat cost on consum purchas in       our auto dealer have not fare as well   in fact  our district has seen a declin in automobil sale  growth in construct is one of the question mark in the      outlook   in our district  nonresidenti construct continu to improv   in fact  the offic market absorpt rate is rise in the philadelphia metropolitan area  and offic vacanc is declin in both the citi and the suburb   by contrast  over the past month or so  we have continu to receiv anecdot report that a slowdown in residenti construct may be at hand   real estat contact report that hous price appreci has slow or even ceas  and there has been an increas in inventori   these sign  howev  seem to point to a soften of activ  not to a sharp drop  we have receiv some welcom indic of a moder in price pressur in the district   our survey measur of price receiv and price paid were down in januari and well below their octob peak   expect price increas also declin sharpli   the onli caveat i would put on that statement is that the survey was taken befor the most recent run up in energi price  turn to the nation  the advanc fourth quarter gdp report was quit a bit weaker than we were all expect   that said  we  too  think it   s too soon to conclud that the weak seen in the fourth quarter is more than a temporari soft patch   our forecast for gdp over the next two year is similar to that of the origin  book that we receiv this month   we expect growth to be on averag around     percent  near potenti   we have a somewhat smoother path than the  book sinc we expect the boost in activ from the rebuild effort in the hurrican afflict area to be more spread out than front load  we also see somewhat stronger employ growth next year than the  book becaus we see somewhat stronger output growth in        we project nonfarm payrol to rise at an averag of         a month this year  stronger in the first half as peopl displac by hurrican continu to return to work   we project an averag increas in payrol of about         per month next year  the  book employ project is similar to our in       but the board staff see a deceler next year to an averag of about          as was point out in the present  howev  our unemploy rate forecast are similar  about   percent  becaus we see somewhat higher labor forc particip  we anticip core pce to rise a bit less than   percent in      and then to acceler to   percent in       reflect a modest acceler in unit labor cost   in contrast  the  book see a slight deceler in core inflat over the forecast period  our forecast is predic on be near the end of the tighten cycl   exact where we stop is yet to be determin  the data will tell the committe   but all of these data suggest that we are close in and we are close to be done   for this meet  i think it   s prudent for us to do what the market expect and make anoth move of    basi point   but i think we also want to be in a posit to paus if that is appropri  given the incom econom data  of cours  i will not be here for that interest discuss    laughter   as you know  this is the last fomc meet that i will be attend as presid of the philadelphia feder reserv bank   i am honor to have had the opportun to lead that institut   of all the experi dure my six year of servic at the fed  none was more challeng and more reward than serv on this committe   i have enjoy and learn from the first rate staff of the reserv bank and the board of governor   i feel privileg to have serv at a remark point in econom histori   in my tenur  we   ve gone through a recess and a recoveri  seen concern shift from disinfl to inflat  move to a record low fund rate  and then return it to more normal level   and all of this was accompani by an unpreced degre of transpar in our polici discuss   i have also been inspir by the leadership shown by our chairman  i may add  in forg a consensus from divers opinion in period of uncertainti and in fo  a collegi atmospher among us   i want to thank you all for an import part you   ve play in make my servic at the fed a reward experi   thank you  mr  chairman
i should point out that a luncheon in the presid   s honor is plan at the march meet   and i guess you and i will be look from the sidelin  but neither one of us will know what happen at that march meet until we get to it    laughter   thank you for your nice remark   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   there   s not a lot new in new england   so i thought i   d just skip over my usual probabl more lengthi than necessari comment on the region  let me just mention a coupl of thing  though   employ growth is still slower  and incom growth is still slower than that of the nation   our region unemploy rate went up rather than down over the past year  and we have seen some slow in residenti real estat market  howev  surpris enough  there seem to be a good deal of op  in discuss we have had with peopl about busi spend and about commerci real estat market   so  for the first  e in five or six year  we   ve actual had net absorpt of space  both downtown and in the suburb   that situat is make a big differ in the smile on peopl   s face around town   i hope it mean that new england is get back and move along the same trajectori as the nation  turn to the nation  we  like most observ  were surpris at the modest growth rate of the economi in the fourth quarter   but we  like almost everybodi els  believ that the reduc pace of govern spend and smaller than expect inventori invest that affect the fourth quarter are like to be temporari and reflect issu of  e rather than overal econom strength   thus  we  too  anticip a slight stronger first quarter this year than we had befor   but our forecast take the same basic trajectori over the balanc of       and         that is  strength in the first half of       and then moder as the effect of tighter monetari polici  cool hous market  and less fiscal s ulus take hold   this is the same trajectori as that in the  book  howev  as we look at gdp  our forecast for       is slower      percent or a littl bit less   than the forecast for        reflect an expect outright declin in hous invest   we also see inflat trend off both this year and next  with core pce inflat never abov   percent over the two year period   i mean  not    never     which is a strong word  but at the point we   re map  some of this differ in price pressur is account for by a sens of a somewhat greater suppli of labor resourc  as reflect in a slight lower nairu and a higher labor forc particip rate  look at these forecast and assess all the data and anecdot input i have receiv sinc the last meet  i am struck by a coupl of thing   first  these forecast  and the vast major of those avail from other sourc  describ an almost ideal outcom   u s  demand is strong but slow  as consum save more and borrow less   fiscal s ulus diminish  busi spend remain solid  employ grow  inflat edg off  and foreign growth is spur by domest demand at last and act to creat some export growth  though we continu to have a widen current account deficit   if these forecast were to be realiz  it would truli be just about the best of outcom  and i would agre with presid     a major sweet spot as the chairman hand over the rein  but that scenario sort of beg the question of risk  both larg and small  and how they are balanc   we could certain be surpris by new energi shock or geopolit event of such magnitud to caus financi turmoil and consum and busi retrench   we could also wit the turbul that could accompani a sharp unwind of the nation   s ever grow extern deficit   but you don   t have to focus on major upset   risk of a lesser proport loom as well   we could veri well be wrong about the remain capac in labor market  and the result upward pressur on wage and salari could creat a more rapid pace of inflat  particular given the solid pace of extern growth and pressur on a rang of commod price   to date  howev  the growth of wage and salari has been on the slow side  particular relat to product  and there is littl evid that firm believ they have the price power to pass on much more than energi surcharg   inde  their profit margin suggest that they have a cushion against increas in input cost   altern  the impact of a cool hous market could take a larger bite out of consumpt than we now expect and caus a greater than project  though welcom  increas in person save   this would  of cours  slow the economi from baselin and damp price pressur   we haven   t seen this yet either  but it could be just as like as miss on the inflat side  thus  as i look at both the upsid and downsid risk  they seem to me to be more balanc than they have been   as some evid of this  both the  book and the fed fund futur market anticip that polici is near a tip point   move a bit more now and then retrench in late       or earli        i also find myself begin to wonder about the cost of be wrong   when polici was arguabl much more accommod  it seem to me that let inflat get out of hand might be harder to deal with and ul  more damag to the economi than if growth slip a bit   that may still be true   but just as our credibl regard price stabil is import in set market expect so  too  is some sens that polici will be support of growth when the threat of rise inflat is less immin   in short  we need to be credibl about achiev both our goal   at this point  anoth nudg toward a polici rate that neither s ul nor restrain the economi seem appropri   but the need for further move seem to me to be increas driven by the incom data
mr  chairman  i took note of the two      forecast of     percent growth in the first quarter   especi against presid     s comment  it brought to mind the name of one of henri jerom   s album on the decca label call    brazen brass      that is  some might consid brazen or even brassi that it jibe or  in this context  jive with what i   m hear anecdot both in our district and nationwid   though we have onli three and a half week of observ and the year end to look at  veri quick to sum up these observ  the cfo of up put it this way     the economi feel much better than what i read      up report a veri strong decemb adjust for season  and januari has stay strong   over the year end in the recent past  they have had onli one holiday peak day of process    million shipment   they had three at year end of more than    million  burlington northern   santa fe   s volum for the first three week of       is up   percent year over year   interest  they just auction off their entir lumber carri capac for the year at an   percent premium over current market   texa instrument report a posit book to bill ratio  which is a veri rare thing come out of the fourth quarter   they find that they underinvest relat to demand and report a seven  to ten day deliveri delinqu rate   as the cfo say     we have stop scratch our head about demand  and we   re just take it all in     the ceo of wal mart u s a  report that    the consum hasn   t hidden    as expect   it   s true that traffic is down  but averag purchas are up in the southeast and texa  and the west is strongest in overal demand  aid by the warmest winter by their calcul in     year   the ceo and the top manag met with their       supplier the week befor last in kansa citi  and he report that the supplier describ themselv as    upbeat      wal mart and other report what we   re hear from the railroad  the shipper  and other retail   all of which lend verisimilitud to what was evid if you pars the beig book  and that is that the rim   from richmond down through atlanta to the state of florida and then  of cours  the    uber    state across texa and up to california and the west coast   is enjoy robust growth   to the extent that there   s weak  it appear to be in the north central and northea n region  on the price front  dick    on our board  of cullen frost  a veri astut banker  say that he    keep hear peopl talk about potenti inflat  but the economi seem to be abl to pull it out of the hat      wal mart intern report no price power other than in resin base product  the ceo marvel at how the world continu to  as he put it     replac technolog at lower and lower price      further up the retail chain  penney   s ceo report no price inflat in home furnish and continu price deflat in apparel   and on the two subject for which i report price pressur befor  the ceo of dx servic  a larg chemic compani  report that pvc price have fallen off becaus of overproduct but the price of the key build block of chlorin and ethylen are fall      there   s no price on the upsid     accord to that ceo   and as for my other favorit subject of diaper  incident  proctor   gambl and kimber clark have roll back their price increas of   percent  our ship contact at northern navig report that panamax rate   and panamax is the key fleet of bulk carrier   are now down to         per day from         in decemb  which was down    percent from the averag for the year of         the contain fleet will absorb a    percent increas in fleet size per year for the next three to four year driven larg by what one could consid chines ego becaus they have now enter the build market in size   and interest  up worri that  if this continu  they will come under price pressur to decreas air freight rate   despit fierc demand and deliveri delinqu  texa instrument report that it has slow down it price increas  so  mr  chairman  we have forecast a core pce inflat of   percent for the year  and we feel comfort with it   i start with henri jerom   let me conclud with anoth henri  the fifth  at least as written by shakespear   i   ve been honor to serv with you  mr  chairman  the least  e of anybodi at this tabl   in alfalfan term  i   m just a sprout in the crop of otherwis experienc men and women   but i   m sure they would agre with me  without get too dramat  about the appropri of henri v   s remark at agincourt   and i   ll rephras them   economist and banker now asleep  rememb these are banker  shall think themselv accurs that they were not here   i consid myself privileg to have been here  mr  chairman   this isn   t agincourt  but it   s import   i   ve serv under two saxophon player now   laughter  and i would say without question  you   re a leader of the veri best kind  and i thank you for your leadership

thank you  mr  chairman   by now i   m sure that most of you are tire of hear me report that condit in my district are not as vigor as condit in most of the countri   i know that i   m tire of repeat it   fortun  op  is increas in mani part of my district   my director and busi contact that have nation and intern busi interest report fair solid condit in most of their industri   they tell me that they plan to maintain a strong pace of capit spend this year and that they expect healthi product gain from do so   these trend encourag me to think that our economi will be abl to maintain the   percent rate of structur product growth that under the  book baselin project  sinc we are near the point of monetari polici neutral  i   m count on a strong rate of product growth to help us gradual nudg the inflat rate back down over the next sever year   i have not chang my think about the under trend in the economi sinc our last meet   i was pretti much in sync with the  book outlook then and remain so today   the bea   s fourth quarter revis appear to affect the  e of econom activ across a coupl of quarter but not to affect the longer term outlook  even though i still expect to see headlin and core inflat moder over the project period  i have becom a bit more sensit to the upsid inflat risk in the baselin project  first  in the  book we receiv last week  the staff conclud that inflat this year could creep up a bit more than they had thought in decemb  and the staff elev their es  of core pce inflat for the fourth quarter from     percent to     percent as a result of the most recent bea report   the staff hedg against that possibl by impos a temporari    basi point surtax on their decemb fed fund rate path begin at our next meet  and it seem sensibl to me to keep this option open   at our decemb meet i said that i thought we were veri close to be abl to stop increas our fed fund rate target at everi meet   i still think so   if monetari polici is a combin of scienc and art  i think we   re now out of the laboratori and insid the art studio  and have flexibl as we go forward is high desir to me  final  mr  chairman  i have to admit that i   ve spent more  e sinc our last meet think about what to say in acknowledg of your last meet than i   ve thought about econom condit  and it   s imposs to come up with word to express my feel   i just simpli want to say that it has been truli an honor and a privileg to serv under your leadership of this committe   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i also have not had the occas in the public farewel ceremoni to say thank you to you   so let me say what an honor it has been to serv under your leadership and to be associ with the great confid and respect you   ve given peopl in what we do at the fed   thank you   thank you veri much  given your request for breviti  let me confin my remark to a few observ about our district that may have implic for the nation outlook   general i would say that the anecdot inform and the avail data suggest that econom growth in our southeast region continu at a veri solid pace   at the past two meet  i report evid of the slow in the real estat market  and those report continu   it has becom especi notabl in a few select market  includ sever that have been hot for some  e  like florida   bank are now clear pull back on their construct lend   we   re receiv increas number of report that plan project have either been put on hold or are not go to come out of the ground   and we   re now begin to see some sign of downward pressur on price   in some case in the high singl digit  but in a few market substanti higher than that   as an exampl  we heard one report that in the panama citi area of florida  condo that had been go for      a squar foot are now be price at      a squar foot   that   s a    percent correct   i think we have to view these correct that are take place as healthi   worker shortag due to hurrican cleanup work in louisiana and coastal mississippi are also contribut to the slowdown in florida   i would emphas  again  that this evid is not indic of a broad trend throughout the district   our general real estat situat still feel pretti solid  i   d also like to make a coupl of comment on the situat of the hurrican area  where  accord to the staff   fema spend turn out to be less than expect in the fourth quarter   at the last meet i note it had becom clear that the s ulus from the flow of govern fund would be slower than expect   work in both mississippi and louisiana is still most in the initi cleanup phase   despit what we see in public statement  there is no substanti rebuild under way yet  except for casino reconstruct in mississippi   the grace period on mortgag payment has alreadi or is about to run out  and this could bring addit hardship for the affect properti owner  with obvious implic for lender   inde  a hand of small communiti bank may actual be at risk  consider uncertainti exist concern feder flood insur polici go forward  and in certain area no rebuild can take place until flood map are redrawn  build code are reassess  soil contamin is assess  and permit are issu   all of which could take mani  mani month   becaus so few peopl have been abl to move back to their properti  even those home that were onli modest damag by the storm are now begin to show sign of deterior due to mold and a lack of mainten and repair   i think the take away from this discuss is that the econom kick we   ve been expect from hurrican rebuild is probabl go to be spread over             and perhap even a bit further  the damag to the energi sector in the gulf now appear to have been wors than most had thought   although nation product of crude is report back at about    percent of pre hurrican level and natur gas product is back to    percent of pre hurrican level  our sourc tell us that    percent of the gulf region capac for crude and about    percent of the gulf capac for natur gas remain shut in   and that shortfal  in my view  remain signific   more than half the crude oil that is shut in is attribut to the product lost from shell   s mar platform  which isn   t expect to be oper until mid        our contact are also now say that natur gas product will probabl not fulli return to pre hurrican level becaus the product at sever site is alreadi in declin   as much as   percent below the peak  final  as has been the case for some  e  we   ve continu to receiv inform from our director of price pressur  of plan to push through price increas  and of a greater willing on the part of upstream purchas to accept those increas   and i think we are like see some of that in the latest inflat data  on the nation front  veri briefli  like everyon els  i was surpris and somewhat disappoint by the consider weaker than expect initi report on fourth quarter gdp  but like the  book  i think i   m satisfi that we can explain most of the shortfal   i do not see it as an eros of fundament  and in fact  i think we may well see some offset gain in the current quarter   i expect a return to solid growth in the current quarter   my own forecast for output  inflat  and unemploy for      and      remain posit  at the same  e  there are some especi interest unknown and risk at the moment that we   ll have to watch be play out   as other have alreadi suggest  energi remain a major wild card with the veri delic balanc between worldwid suppli and worldwid demand  with recoveri of the energi industri in our gulf coast region not yet complet  with the fragil polit situat in mani oil produc region around the world  and with the ever present risk of natur disast and sabotag  it seem reason to expect continu elev energi price and substanti energi price volatil   it   s not clear to me whether household and busi have fulli adjust to these new realiti   the residenti real estat adjust  which seem to be begin to take place both in the level of activ and in price  could have import implic  as dave   and other have alreadi suggest   whether consum will be abl and will to continu to smooth their expenditur relat to current incom seem to be substanti depend upon home price  mortgag interest rate  and the abil to tap home equiti   and the potenti inflat pressur we   ve highlight for some while  and which still do not seem to have play out fulli  should not be too easili and too quick discount  all thing consid  i think we have to be reason comfort with the outlook and the polici path we have been on  but i look forward to discuss of polici and the way we communic what we see ahead   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  in think about the status of the u s  economi and the appropri fund rate target at this meet  i would start by suggest that  in my judgment at least  the current fund rate is probabl within the neutral rang   therefor  we should be mind of not go too far  especi when it would appear that growth is slow to trend   the most compel reason for consid the move now is the continu drift upward in core inflat  but even in this case  i think we need to be especi awar of the past increas in the fund rate   we have yet to see their full effect on inflat  the fourth quarter growth was surpris  but at this point  as other have said  it   not yet alter our long term outlook   like the staff  howev  i revis upward my      forecast   percentag point and now expect that growth will be about    percent in       about    percentag point abov trend  and will return to trend in        turn to the inflat outlook  i expect core cpi inflat to be about     percent this year  as higher energi price are pass through to higher overal and core inflat   howev  it is reason to expect that the increas will be temporari  as other have said  with core inflat like to fall back to    percent in       the reason for this pattern have a familiar ring   greater than trend growth reflect the lag effect of past monetari accommod and general support financi condit  wherea the prospect slow growth reflect the remov of monetari accommod and  in this instanc  higher energi price  evid from our district is consist with an outlook of strong but slow growth as well   manufactur product and new order rose solid   expect for futur product remain high  and expect for futur order actual surg   hire plan also rose strong in decemb and januari   howev  for the district as a whole  hire announc were onli slight greater than layoff announc   final  hous show sign of level off  and consum spend was solid  though not spectacular  dure the holiday season   in fact  a number of our contact said their holiday sale were below plan   just quick in the farm sector  there are concern be voic for      follow a general good year in       and they were most  that drought may be reemerg in the district  wage pressur in the district remain most subdu  and increas in raw materi cost actual slow somewhat   howev  manufactur continu to rais output price in respons to past increas in input cost  and a substanti number said they were rais wage more than normal for certain type of worker in short suppli   report of retail price said that increas were down somewhat from the last meet but still higher than they were just last summer  let me turn just briefli to the risk   i would submit that inflat risk are on the upsid and output risk have becom more on the downsid recent  not exact the kind of risk that are friend from a polici perspect   the outlook for core inflat is    to     percent   this is higher than i would prefer   moreov  the potenti for even higher energi price make core inflat more like to be higher rather than lower over the next sever month   but at the same  e  the risk to output are on the downsid   first  forward momentum has certain diminish  for exampl  real gdp grew about     percent dure the last half of       decid below trend  in addit  while the fourth quarter slowdown was probabl temporari  it could also be signal a more fundament slowdown   final  a possibl increas in the term premium pose downsid risk to growth   you know the term premium is far below the histor averag   if the declin revers fa  than expect  both would be signific weaker as shown by the  book altern scenario   as i see thing then fall out  the choic are obvious difficult  but i think that the inflat risk for the  e be is the greater risk  and therefor i would be inclin to move at this meet   but we should have the odd no greater than       that more upward chang are like in the fed fund rate at the next meet  and final  mr  chairman  although i have not serv as long with you as some other around this tabl  i have serv among the longest with you  and i would like you to know it has been a real privileg
let   s break for coffe   sinc our  e is realli quit restrict  i would request that we come back in seven minut    laughter   coffe break
mr  chairman  i quick consult with my labor economist expert at the coffe break about your question about the demograph effect on the workweek  and  inde  there is   and it   s incorpor in our forecast   a modest effect of the age of the workforc on the workweek  with older worker have shorter workweek   obvious  the longer term trend has been driven more by the shift in the composit of employ from manufactur toward more servic orient industri  which have shorter workweek  but there is a percept demograph effect as well
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   what strike me from my convers with my contact is the grow confid that they do not see major risk on either side  that there are reduc standard error around their project   veri few had comment or concern about inflat outsid of energi  which  of cours  is on everybodi   s mind  i   d like to make an analyt point that actual come from my up contact   i think i mention at an earlier meet that up is move it busi off the mix rail   the piggyback  that move is a consequ of the fact that the railroad are unabl to speed up deliveri  e  which in turn is a consequ of the railroad    decis that it is not worth the capit invest that would be necessari for what for railroad is a relat low yield busi   up is also work to maxim the return on it own capit   the compani is veri disciplin about ad capit and is plan to price low yield busi out of it network   that is  for the low yield product  they   re go to rais price expect that the busi will go away   my contact at up said that he thought that the strategi would not realli be success and that they will probabl be look at substanti increas in capit spend in        onc they find that they have op  their exist plant  that the volum  sn   t go away when they tri to rais the price on it  or that not enough of it goe away   and i think that this phenomenon might be more general in our economi   compani are veri disciplin about their capit invest   but as the economi continu to expand  they   re go to run out of way to op  the exist capit plant  and we will see invest come in stronger over the next coupl of year   that   s an observ that may have more general applic  i support the  book   s forecast  plus or minus a quarter of a standard deviat   laughter   not worth worri about   instead  what i   ve been tri to do is to make list   and these could be much longer   of risk on the high side and the low side   on the high side  i would point to commod price  which are high and have gone up a lot  and grow strength   as i just comment   in busi fix invest   i mention high money growth  becaus i don   t think that the rapid money growth is fulli explain  and it certain has frequent been a precursor of higher inflat  some indic on the other side   we talk about hous  the possibl revers of the unusu low save rate  the behavior of the yield curv  the risk of oil suppli disturb   most of oil has been demand driven  but suppli disturb becaus of the problem in the middl east primarili   africa as well   could certain produc a signific downward shock on econom activ and upward shock on price   no doubt these list could be amplifi  and i think it   s probabl worth spend more  e think through the risk and how to respond to various event than it is tri to op  the forecast and get that last quarter of standard deviat exact right  mr  chairman  mani around the tabl have comment about their experi serv here  i will  of cours  echo those   i would like to put a littl differ angl on it   of the peopl who have had a major impact in my life  you are certain one   i mark on the finger of one hand the peopl who have had extraordinari influenc on me   you have influenc me most in my profession life but also in mani aspect of leadership that go beyond econom and polici in a narrow sens   so i thank you for that   i am also look forward to continu to learn from you  i understand that you have some book  at least in your head   and given my interest in make sure we have clear communic  i have a suggest for a titl for your first book   and it is in line with some book by your predecessor   so i suggest    the joy of central bank       laughter  and i suggest that your second book be    more joy of central bank       laughter
how to be a joyous central banker  even though we don   t have heart       laughter   can we end the specul on the titl    laughter   thank veri much  bill   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with one anecdot about hous activ in the district   i don   t know how repres this is nationwid  obvious  but there are sign of slow in both hous construct and  more dramat  in sale recent   and this winter in the twin citi  sever hundr union construct worker are not work   last year     percent were   but they   re all expect to be back at work in the spring  and that suggest to me   and this is more a question than a conclus   that the ul  correct in hous may occur later and be more sever than i was earlier expect  as far as the nation economi is concern  like other  i am inclin to discount the fourth quarter   i find the  book stori about the outlook reason convinc   i person think that we will see pretti good growth in both       and         i tend to reli  as you know  on the under fundament and the resili of the economi  and those thing seem to me to be sound and in place   and so i think the overal outlook is pretti good  i do think that there was a disconnect in the fourth quarter between the suppli or output side and the demand side   if you look at the number for employ and hour  you would have certain come up with a stronger forecast   now  you may plug in a negat product number  that   s one way of reconcil it   mayb the novemb and decemb employ data will get revis down   i guess that   s anoth way of reconcil it   perhap some of the aggreg demand compon will ul  be revis up a bit   but there   seem to be a disconnect there  noth that i find all that troubl  but someth i think worth bear in mind if we want to think about the fourth quarter  i think the key to the outlook and to polici go forward  though  is inflat   and i went and look at what has happen to the core pce over the past eight or nine year   and the rang of increas in core pce inflat over that period was about    to    percent  and i think the averag over the past eight or nine year was someth like    percent   i don   t cite those number just to prove that i can look them up   i cite them becaus i would character that whole period as a period of low inflat  mayb someth resembl price stabil   and if i ask myself     is inflat like to break out on the high side of that rang in the relat near term     my answer to that is    no      and i think most bond market particip  at least the way they are price thing  would also answer that question with a    no     part of that is  of cours  that we have been move polici  and it seem to me that polici  measur by the real feder fund rate  is now certain in the ballpark where it need to be   i anticip that we   ll move again today  as i think we should  in part to valid market expect  is polici perfect posit within the ballpark   well  i don   t know the answer to that  but i do think it is well posit within the ballpark  and i think we need to bear that in mind as we go forward
mr  chairman  in the interest of crisp  i   ve remov a substanti tribut from my remark    laughter
i am most appreci    laughter
i   d like the record to show that i think you   re pretti terrif  too    laughter   and think in term of probabl  i think the risk that we decid in the futur that you   re even better than we think is higher than the altern    laughter  with that  the economi look pretti good to us  perhap a bit better than it did at the last meet   with the near term monetari polici path that   s now price into the market  we think the economi is like to grow slight abov trend in       and close to trend in         we expect under inflat to follow a path close to current level befor slow to a rate closer to     percent for the core pce some  out there   relat to the  book  we   re a littl softer on growth in       and a littl stronger in        but our inflat outlook is similar  the uncertainti around this forecast still seem consider  perhap more than the market has price in   on the posit side  consum and busi confid still seem pretti high  with employ growth solid and compens growth like to pick up   we think that household incom growth is like to be pretti strong   invest may be strengthen  and it could surpris us with more strength   the tone of the anecdot to us seem more posit  less cautious than it has been   and just to cite our empir survey  the six month ahead number show a fair amount of op    overal  financi condit  of cours  still seem quit support of continu expans   global growth has strengthen   and like the staff  the market seem to have look through the negat surpris in the fourth quarter number and price in a bit more  rather than less  confid about the strength of demand growth go forward  on the darker side  we have the familiar concern about potenti advers shock  energi suppli disrupt  terror  et cetera   but even in the absenc of these event  we face a fair amount of uncertainti about key element of the forecast   the prevail expect of a gradual moder in hous price and a relat small increas in the save rate could prove too op ist   privat invest growth could slow further  product growth could disappoint  risk premium could rise sharpli   and  of cours  that could happen even in the absenc of a major deterior in the growth or inflat outlook   but this  on balanc  still leav us with what look like a relat balanc set of risk around what is still a quit favor growth forecast  the inflat outlook still merit some concern   i think modest concern   about upsid risk  under inflat is still somewhat higher than we would be comfort with over  e   the core index are run abov level said to defin our prefer over  e   other measur of under inflat are run abov the core rate   the behavior of inflat expect at longer horizon has been reassur stabl in the face of the elev headlin number  but the level are still at the higher end of comfort   with the economi near potenti  unit labor cost growth should acceler   and  of cours  although profit margin still show ampl room to absorb more unit cost increas  their behavior suggest continu price power   the strength of global demand  the continu rise in commod price  other input cost  and the latest increas in energi price all suggest a possibl of further upward pressur  with this outlook and this set of risk  we believ some further tighten of monetari polici is necessari with anoth small move today and a signal that some further tighten is probabl   we   re comfort with how the market   s expect have evolv over the past few week and with the present forecast of perhap one   mayb slight more than one   move beyond today   it   s hard  though  to understand whi the market attach so littl uncertainti to monetari polici in the second half of the year   and this underscor the fact that one of our communic challeng ahead is to make sure we convey enough uncertainti about our view of the outlook and it implic for monetari polici   in this regard  i want to compliment the recent innov to the bluebook present and hope that they persist
thank you  mr  chairman   the surpris of the fourth quarter gdp number and the slight elev inflationari pressur have caus us to take  i think  a closer look at the under strength of the economi   and to an extent it is reassur   certain  the strength in industri product and real person consumpt   howev  the risk that we have seen befor remain and may  in fact  be slight elev   the potenti risk of increas oil cost and the pass through effect into under core inflat is at least slight heighten  and with the flatten of hous valu  the potenti effect on consumpt remain slight strong  it is often easi for us at these meet to say we   ll have a clearer understand at the next meet of where we are  but although the next meet answer this meet   s question  it also rais new question   howev  in this instanc  we may have more reason than not to make that point   the januari job number will be out on friday   if the initi claim number has ani predict power  we may see a strong report   i couldn   t help but notic the juxtaposit of the initi claim chart next to the gdp number as an indic that it   s one that will be look at care   also  given the magnitud of the chang in the prior period gdp  the revis gdp number for the fourth quarter may be much differ from the preliminari number   also  between now and the next meet  our new chairman will be make a semiannu present to the congress on the state of the economi  with an opportun to be more definit than we can perhap be at this meet  in conclus  i suggest that we make the obvious move and rais our target   point but not be ani more definit or predict than necessari in the accompani statement   i support presid     s suggest for flexibl in our descript today   and i share with everybodi els the honor of have work with you for these four year that i   ve been here
thank you veri much  governor   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   the  book baselin present a relat posit scenario   but as the    percent confid interv given in the  book clear indic  there is consider uncertainti around this baselin   in a theoret world of certainti equival  that rang of uncertainti would not matter   but as you   ve taught us mani  e  in the world of practic policymak  how that uncertainti is resolv will matter import for polici judgment  as a mere cadet  if you will  sit next to the monetari polici yoda   laughter  i will attempt to look at some of these uncertainti and to understand how they may unfold in their implic for polici   yoda  of cours  is a complimentari word in my household    laughter  one particular salient aspect of uncertainti relat to the way that inflat expect are influenc by energi price   as we   ve seen recent  despit spike oil price in decemb  near term inflat expect remain stabl or edg even somewhat lower  revers the run up that we saw in the fall   as the present this morn show  preliminari januari michigan survey result for median inflat expect for the come year tick down  and median five  and ten year inflat expect also move lower   rate spread from tip also indic remark contain inflat expect despit oil price shock  this stabil is both remark and quit import  becaus  in my view at least  the op  cours of monetari polici at this junctur depend critic on the fragil or stabil of inflat expect in the presenc of the oil price shock   i judg that  for now at least  this import element of uncertainti support a continu execut of the strategi we are follow to date  with no need to fear that we   re fall behind the curv  even as energi price have spike again   of cours  with the slight rise in the near term inflat outlook and  in fact  slight deterior in near term inflat itself  prudenc will requir close monitor of these variabl as we go forward   but thus far  i judg that the announc strategi is consist with maintain our credibl  second  as we discuss earlier  there is great uncertainti about whi long term rate are low and what the shape and level of the yield curv may impli for us   as we saw in ye day   s board brief  forward nomin rate fair far out in  e have move down over the past year  both here and abroad  and are low today by histor standard   as we know  long term rate are low today part becaus inflat expect are low   if this were the whole stori  short term rate would not need to depart from the histor term or norm in real term   but while this is part of the stori  it isn   t the whole stori   as we   ve alreadi discuss  if the shape of the yield curv and low rate both indic that market particip expect some further econom weak  then the proper respons would be to run a looser than averag monetari polici  but i agre  and i think most of us agre  with the staff assess that the low real long term interest rate and a flat yield curv are not precursor to a global soften and an expect drop in rate but rather are due to an unusu low term premium   in my judgment  part of the reason for that low term premium is an increas assess on the part of global investor that the futur look like an environ involv less risk than usual   this was born out i think in dino   s pie chart earlier on and also in the global equiti market   i   d also say  base on various convers i   ve had with central banker in januari on the various committe that i attend and other i attend with the chairman  there is a general sens in the world of polici that this low risk assess is approxim right   howev  i continu to think that these lower rate reflect some forc that are hold back invest demand global   and  for the unit state  i think they also reflect a drag from the extern sector   howev  with corpor balanc sheet in good shape and global growth firm  i don   t expect a sudden reassess of risk and a rise in the term premium to result from these sourc  i do have some concern that we may see a snapback in term premium from anoth sourc that we   ve touch on a bit alreadi  and that   s the third and final uncertainti i wish to look at  which is the hous sector   here i   d say that presid santomero   s comment in some sens preced and introduc mine   i don   t doubt that the hous market is slow somewhat  but i do wonder about the impact of a slow of hous price and wealth extract on household save and consumpt   here i pick up where dave left off  which is that the model take a histor norm  let   s say we   re at about the   percent that dave indic   i think there   s possibl a greater risk  for reason that dave has alreadi indic  that we may find a much stronger impact on the global economi  certain on the u s  economi  base on a slow of hous price   and here  though i recogn their economi are differ  i am still somewhat troubl by the experi in the unit kingdom  australia  and the netherland  all of which had an unexpect larg impact  from a gdp standpoint  from a relat slow flatten of hous price   i recogn that these other economi are differ from our  but i   d also say that we   ve seen even in our own economi some nonlinear that have emerg   for exampl  as asset price move down relat rapid   that might have surpris us in the past  so what   s the implic of all of these uncertainti   i   d like to put three thing on the tabl for this meet   first  i continu to believ  as i think the  book or the bluebook    that the equilibrium real rate has  in fact  move down somewhat on averag  to lower than it was  let   s say  over the past ten year  with the except of the recessionari period of      and       second  i firm believ  as do mani of you  that we are well within the rang of neutral at this stage   and  third  sinc i would say there   s a great deal of uncertainti here  i want to make sure that what we say  both in word and in deed  reflect a great deal of flexibl   i heard vice chairman   suggest that we want to put out some word that say it   s probabl that we   ll move at the next meet   i suggest that we be a littl more nuanc and put out some word that suggest it   s at least possibl that we move at the next meet  have said all of that  obvious  i  along with everyon els  think that what happen go forward will be extraordinarili data depend   all the more reason for us to keep  if you will  our powder dri and our option open   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   the project i submit for this meet reflect expect of an economi that probabl is oper in level term somewher in the neighborhood of it long run  sustain potenti and will continu to do so over the next two year with growth broad in line with the growth of potenti and inflat basic stabl   my forecast for      are veri close to those i submit last januari and june   that   s part a product of innat stubborn    laughter   but it also reflect the fact that      came in larg as expect   after allow for hurrican and an energi shock last year that elev core inflat and damp growth somewhat compar with our forecast last januari   this is encourag in that it suggest that we are not look at major unexplain and unanticip forc act on the economi  at this point  our focus appropri is on keep inflat contain   i see sever reason for op  in this regard   one is the perform of core consum price and price measur  which continu to suggest that the pass through of higher energi price will be limit   core inflat was rough stabl last year   it pick up a bit in the fourth quarter  but that was from unusu low read in the third quarter   declin consum inflat expect in the most recent michigan survey  along with the failur of market base inflat compens read to respond signific to the substanti run up in oil price and higher core read over the intermeet period  just reinforc my assess that ani pass through should be small and limit in durat  as we note at the last meet  perhap the greater threat to sustain good inflat perform come from possibl increas in pressur on resourc   the critic question is whether growth in output close to trend is a reason expect with onli modest further polici firm  given the low level of long term rate  reduc drag from energi price  and a boost from rebuild   i thought it was a reason expect  for a number of reason   first  after smooth through the fluctuat caus by auto incent and hurrican  privat domest final demand alreadi show sign of moder last year   growth in privat domest final sale slow from    percent in the first half of the year to   percent in the second half of the year  with everi element   consumpt  busi fix invest  residenti hous invest   moder   the staff es  that about     of this was due to hurrican effect  but that still leav under privat demand slow to an annual rate of about    or     percent   this moder did not reflect the full effect of our polici tighten  especi on the hous market  even well anticip increas in the short term rate seem to be have a signific effect on hous market  which have becom more depend on adjust rate mortgag to maintain afford   we are just begin to see the anticip slowdown in this sector  with growth in consumpt and sale constrain by a level out of hous wealth  busi are unlik to see the need to step up the pace at which they are ad to their capit stock   as a consequ  invest growth could slow  at least slight  over the next few year  reflect reduc impetus from the acceler   final  although foreign economi are strengthen some  foreign invest and consumpt remain subdu relat to incom   and given our continu outsiz appetit for import  net export are unlik to be put ad impetus to demand on domest product  i think there are sever upsid and downsid risk around this pictur of growth near potenti  as a number of you point out   i agre that the hous market is the most like sourc of a shortfal in demand   i don   t think we can have much confid about how the dynam of this market will play out now that it has begun to soften   my suspicion is that  as littl bubbl in the froth are pop  the risk are tilt more toward quit a sharp cool off than toward a veri gradual eb of price increas and build activ   on the other side  it seem to me global demand would be a major upsid risk to growth and to price stabil   the extraordinarili rapid rise in commod price and upward movement in global equiti price may indic a veri fundament turnaround in foreign demand and attitud beyond just a stepwis strengthen of growth   for now  these remain risk that we   ll need to monitor  in make my forecast  i assum we would tighten at this meet  and like at the next as well  to gain greater assur that inflat will remain contain over  e  consist with my forecast of a    percent increas in core price in        howev  i do see action in march as depend on the read we get in come month   there is  as usual  consider uncertainti about the precis natur and magnitud of the risk to the outlook  but we   re deal with an econom pictur that overal is remark good and expect to remain that way for the forese futur  reflect on this situat  among mani  mani aspect of the past  i end my remark as i began them   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   when i was prepar for this meet earli last week  i was feel veri comfort with the forecast of good growth in       in the mid   percent rang near potenti  and a modest uptick in core inflat abov   percent   as mani of you have alreadi remark  the gdp number on friday made me slight more pessimist  both on growth and on inflat   the surpris drop in govern spend  i have full confid will turn around  final sale fell  howev  so that all the growth that occur in the fourth quarter came from inventori growth   given that inventori   sale ratio continu to run at histor low level  though  inventori should continu to be a sourc of growth go forward   as mani of you also have note  other indic show much stronger perform   initi unemploy claim  good order  capac util  and strong corpor balanc sheet   all of them effect say that we have a strong foundat underneath this growth   the inflat number tick up to     percent gave me a bit of paus   we came through two good quarter  the second and third quarter  with veri low inflat  but again  the uptick show how much variabl we see around the inflat number quarter to quarter and warrant attent  the one area   and i want to second dave     s remark   of main concern is the hous market   let me talk about it a littl differ from some previous comment today  when we look at the aggreg level of debt that household have and relat price  one of the thing as an old lender i worri about is the abil to servic the debt and the discretionari spend that household have   while    percent of mortgag are fix rate     percent are variabl  start in       we saw a jump in arm  take advantag of the veri steep yield curv at the  e   we now are in a period when not onli the fanci option arm  the exot product of the past eighteen month  but also the     arm and the five year arm that becam veri popular in      and      are repric  if interest rate just hold where they are right now  we es  that the month debt servic cost is go to go up by at least    percent on that    percent of mortgag portfolio   if you look at the  book  you   ll notic that the financi oblig ratio rose quit substanti in the past six month   it is now back to the peak of      and       and we have a lot of mortgag still to repric   we also know that some of these exot mortgag don   t amort  but they will kick in and start amort and that will also pull cash out of discretionari spend  in an overal look at consum  with hous and the cost of heat this winter rise  you   re begin to see a littl caution in the borrow number   the drop in home equiti line of credit that i mention a meet or two ago now has been sustain through the whole quarter   so we have actual seen that home equiti line outstand that have been drawn on have drop  consum credit as a whole drop  exclud mortgag credit  and mortgag growth as a whole slow to just over    percent   so household are signal that they   re pull back on new borrow  not just in hous but in general   when you look at the abil of consum to spend discretionarili out of their month take home pay  these are signal we need to look at   and the rise fix payment that they have is someth  in look at the tail of the distribut on hous market risk  that i think is import for that segment of the popul go forward  the other sad thing is that this is our last meet with the chairman  and i just person also want to echo some of the comment of my colleagu around the tabl to thank you for your leadership   i   ve been veri impress with the kind of atmospher that i found when i join dure your tenur as leader of this institut   the integr with which everyth is done  your emphasi on the qualiti of idea  and your continu to search for new way to look at inform   becaus the economi is dynam   remind us that we have to watch for new thing alway evolv   the collegi with which you have led this organ has made it enjoy for all of us to be here  and final  as an old risk manag  i was glad to feel right at home with your approach to monetari polici    laughter   so thank you for your leadership   it has been a pleasur to have serv with you
thank you so much      thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that
low hand out dure the coffe break   judg by the inform deriv from money market futur plot in the top panel of your first exhibit  this seem like to be anoth of those meet in which the import part of the discuss is about word  not the upcom deed   as can be seen from the bar in the top left panel  market particip put near a     percent probabl on a   point firm today and high odd on a like size move at the march meet   both those probabl were mark up over the past seven week  part on appar increas pressur on cost  what with oil and other commod price surg and the foreign exchang valu of the dollar weaken  and   unfortun   on market commentari that was taken as have an insid track on your polici choic   the  the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     expect feder fund rate  plot in black in the top right side  now move modest abov     percent this spring befor turn down late this year   market particip appar have bought into the notion that  with inflat impetus a bit more intens  the committe will want the real feder fund rate  the solid black line in the middl panel  more assur in a rang that is not associ with polici accommod   what market particip do not seem to have bought into is the idea that you   ll act like the hypothet policymak describ in the bluebook   the path for the nomin and real feder fund rate  deriv from an op  control exercis use the version of the frb us model endow policymak and financi market particip with perfect foresight  are shown in the bottom panel   the solid and dot line are the polici prescript under inflat goal of     percent and   percent  respect   with actual inflat and the frb us measur of long run expect inflat now run around   percent  policymak can hold the nomin fund rate steadi and allow the real fund rate to drift lower to achiev   percent core pce inflat in the long run  to induc enough resourc slack to work toward a     percent inflat goal  howev  policymak would have to rais the nomin fund rate to about   percent   market particip see you steer between those two path for a while   probabl for some combin of three reason   the first two explain whi   even if your goal for inflat is     percent   you might be less aggress than in the correspond simul   for one  market particip may see less near term pressur on inflat than in the  book and it extens   for anoth  they may believ you   d toler inflat toward the high end of that rang  in part becaus of the percept that you would be unwil to creat econom slack deliber to achiev a differ outcom   instead  they may think you are will to wait for some opportun in the futur  when a negat shock pull inflat down   and the third is a reason that   even if you were aim for inflat of   percent   you might be tighter than the correspond simul   in particular  market particip may believ that your polici choic will be shape by consider about risk that determinist simul cannot captur   for exampl  you might be satisfi with inflat around current level  if it were ensur  but be asymmetr concern with regard to it be higher rather than lower   thus  you might tighten more than the   percent goal simul as insur that inflat   not move higher   if  like market particip  you see yourselv oper in the rang between the two path call for by the op  control exercis  you most like would be will to tighten   point today and place high odd of do so again in march   the two chief word issu that follow from that decis are list at the top of exhibit     first  how high are the odd you place on tighten at the march meet  in write the bluebook  we thought you   d want to preserv the current configur of financi market price  which appear to be base on a         split on tighten versus no action in six week   thus  in the portion of the statement languag of altern b list in the bottom left  we offer the sentenc     the committe judg that some further polici firm may well be need to keep the risk to the attain of both sustain econom growth and price stabil rough in balanc      we thought that this word give a strong presumpt that polici will tighten onc more but not the certainti that make mani of you uncomfort   from what i   ve heard today  i would suggest tweak that verb phrase to dial down the market   s percept of futur action by remov the word    well      the second question is  how strong do you want to underscor that come decis depend on incom econom data   we thought that the last sentenc of the decemb statement  also repeat in the bottom left panel  provid suffici assur on that score   inde  this layout seem to have the attract of express a back up strategi in which you would deviat from the anticip polici path if event dictat   we also thought that you   d want to make as few chang to the languag as possibl today   an altern is to revers the order of the last two sentenc  as is done at the bottom right      the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fo  the attain of both sustain econom growth and price stabil   in these circumst  the committe judg that some further polici firm may well be need to keep the risk to those object rough in balanc      note that the first sentenc now describ the baselin assumpt  not a conting plan   this word is similar  but not ident  to languag circul by presid pool   it share his reorder of the sentenc but   not repeat the    measur polici firm    phrase on the logic that the committe may want to free up expect about action in march   dure the polici discuss  it would be help if you would focus some of your remark on the two question i have rais   with the help of exhibit    i now turn to my standard procedur in close to hector the committe on some point of govern   the issu  as i explain in my memo of januari     is that the statement releas this afternoon will like be onli part cover by the committe   s vote   the respons to the survey i sent around earlier indic signific support for vote on the entir statement but that a minor was decid oppos   those oppos are primarili concern that requir member to agre on all the word in the statement may make it more difficult to reach a consensus   in addit  the public may be confus if a member dissent  not becaus of disapprov of the polici action but becaus of distast for the word character the action   moreov  fomc particip arguabl have more leeway now to offer view to the public differ from those in the statement than would be the case if the entir document had the committe   s seal of approv   those favor a formal vote on the entir statement hold that all it aspect  includ the descript of the economi  are import in shape market expect about the futur path of polici   in that view  it may be a good thing that the formal vote constrain how member subsequ describ the rational for polici action to the public  as it would send a more consist messag about the prospect for polici   these argument suggest that fomc particip may want to consid three altern list in the exhibit       vote on the entir statement and the direct      vote on the direct and assess of risk  as now   but to clarifi ownership of the remain portion of the statement  the committe could also vote to author the chairman to provid a rational for that action       retain the status quo  perhap with the issu to be rais again at a later date under the next chairman   the two bottom panel present the formal vote for altern b should you prefer  respect  option   or option      the languag for option    as alway  is in the bluebook    student of this institut probabl believ that the statement is part own by the committe and part by the chairman   for the rest  what is issu at      p m  on the day of decis is a committe document   thus  some peopl would view option   as delimit the chairman   s author  while other would view option   as roll back the committe   s author   it would seem best that such suspicion not be harbor about the new chairman by resolv this govern issu today if option   appeal to you   that is  vote onli on the interest rate  not the rational  portion of the statement and grant the chairman an explicit author to craft the rest   if  instead  you prefer to vote on the entir statement  then i would suggest put off option   to anoth day   so as not to risk creat a misimpress about your intent   one such opportun might be the march meet   ben bernank has ask me to relay that he prefer that the next meet run for two day   monday and tuesday  march    and      so that you can discuss the best way to organ futur committe discuss   the secretariat will send around formal notic about the logist of this meet as soon as possibl  subject to a notat vote by this committe name a new chairman   some support document for the two day meet will then circul dure the intermeet period   your last exhibit repeat tabl     i should note that we chang the    smooth    languag that few of you favor   instead  the rational portion open     although recent econom data have been uneven
how do your inflat expect evolv in your two simul  and in particular  how are they affect by polici   is it just through the effect of resourc slack on actual inflat
in these simul  long run inflat expect evolv veri gradual base on the path of actual inflat   so what happen is in the     percent simul you start off with inflat expect of   percent  and you have to experi inflat below that to work it down
anybodi els   do we have copi of the statement   could you circul them  pleas   i will be rather brief for a number of reason  not the least of which is i most agre with what has been said around this tabl and i just don   t want to duplic it   i do think that this is an extraordinari economi   if you look at the world data  the balanc out there in europ and asia and japan   rememb japan is the second largest economi in the world  and we use to forget that becaus it never move and henc did not contribut to either expans or contract   but it   s clear now move beyond it veri serious difficulti and is like to be a posit forc  as inde much of asia and now  more recent  europ is begin to be   so the outlook out there is benevol  but benevol is not someth that goe on forev  so far i think it   s fair clear that there   s consensus around the tabl that we   ll move    basi point today   and i think that there is an awar that we   re probabl not all that far from where we want to be  consid that our major focus was the remov of accommod  which we had purpos put in place to bring the fund rate down to   percent over a protract period   i think that  at this particular point  whatev the feder reserv   henceforth  it is go to becom increas depend on the data becaus we   re not in the posit in which we had been for quit a period of  e of essenti say what it is we plan to do and then proceed to do it   we have run the string   we have gotten to where we want to be  and now the data are go to determin what larg is go to happen  i don   t think there   s much debat on this particular statement relev to what the march actual action is go to be   i suspect that whatev the committe   in march will depend veri margin on what we say today and veri signific on the whole seri of event that have to work their way through over the next six week   and sinc we   re not veri far from where we would like to be  there   s no real problem here  therefor  i would ventur that we move    basi point and that we adopt the languag  the critic part be    further polici firm may be need      this languag in my judgment is essenti consist with the outlook as we can best evalu it  and i would move  in the context of what   has been say  both the statement and the action and would request that our secretari read the appropri languag
do you want to go around first
i   m sorri   i   m tri to cut the discuss short   laughter
do you have someplac to go    laughter
no  but i   m look at the clock
the clock  i mean  it has stop   laughter
let the record reflect that the committe has thwart the attempt by the chairman to chang the process in a way that     laughter
actual i thought it was eleg done    laughter
mr  chairman  i  too  think that we should move by    today  and i   m comfort with the languag as it   s modifi here   i do think that it   s import to note that the market judg the odd of march as probabl   the  book assumpt is more consist with that and  as   said  some of the bluebook filter we can use to look at thing are slight more in that direct   but have said that  i think it   s fine to leav the statement with    may     and i don   t realli know whether the market   s reaction to that statement would take out some of the price now built in or leav it where it is   it   s hard to know  i want to say one thing in respons to vinc   s second question  although i   m not sure that we need to spend much  e on it   i think we should defer this decis until march   my own view is that the action the committe take are realli not princip the chang in the fed fund rate we announc or don   t announc at the meet   they have a lot to do with how we character our view of the path of output and inflat relat to our object  the risk around that  and what we signal  if anyth  about the monetari polici implic of that judgment   have said that  i think it is hard not to argu that the committe need to express a view when it vote on that basic set of signal   i think it   s worth defer that judgment  though  simpli becaus we should talk through a littl more what it realli mean for our process and how we   re go to manag the prepar and the discuss in a world where we   re more explicit decid what we   re go to vote on   so my compliment to vinc for frame it the way he did  and i suggest we defer the vote
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre on the second point that we should postpon consider of what we vote on for the reason that the vice chairman just note   i support the increas in the feder fund rate today   i   m a littl concern  like the vice chairman  that this    may    languag could caus a bit of a ralli in financi market  but i think it reflect the general tone around the tabl and is certain close to my think   i think we   re more like to have to firm than not at the next meet   the odd are         or greater   and this put the market on notic that that   s approxim what our think is   so i agre with that one
i support the recommend in term of the    basi point and also the word   i actual like    may    rather than    may well      i think the data will in all likelihood be a littl stronger  which will buy us that    may    to    may well    as  e evolv  but not necessarili   i like the order as is present here   so this fit veri well into my view of where we should be  on the last point  i   d like to compliment vinc for predict that he will yet again be back talk about it    laughter   i think that   s the right path   i think bring it to everybodi   s attent is a good thing   but your third solut  which is somewher in between  is actual the right answer  how one fo  a consensus around that is t i  and i   m glad i don   t have to do it
i support the increas of    basi point at this meet   i would like to add a third question to the two that vinc gave us at the top of exhibit     what languag creat the best basi for smooth transit of futur languag   everi  e we make a chang  it get pars  examin  cut  read between the line  and so forth   so part of my motiv in suggest the revers of those two sentenc was to make what i thought might be an easier transit in the futur   clear  it   s a veri fine point  but that   s what we end up deal with in order not to provid ani signal that we didn   t realli intend
well  i support a    basi point move   i think presid pool has made a good point   i wrote a note in support of it  but i can accept the languag that   s here   then  final  i am in full accord with the presid of the reserv bank of new york   s articul of the issu of procedur  which i think we should defer
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend of    basi point   i rather like move the oper forward look languag to    may    as oppos to    may well    becaus i think it free the market to look much more at the data  as they would do natur anyway   i do think it   s at least          as governor kohn said  mayb a littl bit more  but i think    may    cover us well enough for march  on the procedur point  i obvious agre with the consensus in the room that we should postpon this until the march meet   i must express some uncertainti about how we vote on an entir statement and direct as a group of nineteen   so i would have a tendenc toward the status quo  but that just may be becaus i   m inappropri conserv and not appropri imagin   so let me stop at that and move on to the next person
yes  mr  chairman  i agre with your propos   i   m veri pleas with take the word    well    out just becaus i think the statement should be give the market         odd rather than someth greater than that as we look forward   and we are data depend   so i realli prefer that   and i agre with postpon the discuss on procedur for the next meet  there   s much to be done  and i think in the transit we need to wait until then
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i find myself in agreement with  i guess  everybodi who has alreadi spoken   the   point increas seem appropri to me   i   m comfort with the languag as propos  and i think we should defer the discuss of ownership of the statement until march
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  am comfort with your propos to move    basi point today   i am also comfort with this languag   i actual could have gone with an even shorter formul that was on page    of the bluebook  which basic combin row four and five and didn   t make refer to the need to move further   but all thing be equal  take    well    out probabl goe a bit in that direct   so i   m comfort with the way it is  fifti fifti   i don   t know   i am not sure that it is a         chanc  but mayb it is   so i am okay with that  on the ownership of the statement  what presid santomero said reson with me   i think there is a halfway path here  and the issu need a littl more convers   i don   t think it   s someth we should decid now   so we should stay with the status quo  i   d also like to rais some concern if monday   tuesday is go to becom commonplac  monday is a hard day  particular if you   re not go to give us the  book and the bluebook until late the week befor   i think the  e put a lot of pressur on everybodi that we could allevi by go with tuesday   wednesday
the reason for monday   tuesday was that you probabl alreadi had travel plan that got you into d c  on monday  wherea have to extend to wednesday might pose more of a hardship   but it was view as just for this meet
