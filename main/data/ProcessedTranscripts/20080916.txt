good morn  everybodi   sorri for the late begin  the market are continu to experi veri signific stress this morn  and there are increas concern about the insur compani aig   that is the reason that vice chairman   is not attend  and chris cum will sit in his place  i want to turn in a minut to bill   for his usual report  and he will be abl to give you more inform about the situat   there is anoth action item i would like to add  given what is happen  which is that there are veri signific problem with dollar fund in other jurisdict   in europ and elsewher   after bill make his present and we have our discuss  i would like to put on the tabl a request for author for swap line   i prefer not to put a limit on it  so i know i   ve got my own bazooka here    laughter   there is a foreign currenc subcommitte that consist of myself  the vice chairman of the fomc  and the vice chairman of the board   again  after bill   s discuss  i would like to discuss the possibl of give us a temporari author to use swap line as need  befor i turn to bill  let me say one other thing   obvious  we start late   we have a lot to talk about   i would like   just for today  if you would indulg me   to condens our discuss to one round   in your discuss  pleas includ your tentat view on the polici decis   obvious  that is not ideal becaus you will not have heard everyon els   s view  but we will have an opportun afterward for peopl to amend  revis  and give addit thought  but in the interest of  e  i think it would be more effici at this  e just to do it that way  without further ado  let me turn to bill and ask for a report
thank you  mr  chairman   i am not go to go through this in great detail   you can look at these chart at your leisur     i am go to focus on    the materi to which mr    refer are append to this transcript  appendix     what is go on right now  how we have respond to it  and what i think the issu are   just to give you a snapshot of what has happen sinc sunday even  stock are down worldwid     percent plus everywher   ye day  the u s  stock market was down about     percent  and s p futur indic a lower open today   as you might expect  there has been a big flight to qualiti  especi into the treasuri bill market   ten year treasuri note yield fell about    basi point ye day  and there has been a big ralli throughout the treasuri curv   the big thing  where there has probabl been the most sever stress in the market  is in dollar liquid for foreign bank   as you rememb  foreign bank  especi in europ  have a structur dollar fund shortfal  and they look to execut foreign exchang swap or borrow in the dollar libor market to fund that   there was signific upward pressur in that market   overnight libor rate today were      percent   and that pressur in europ is leak over into our market   ye day the feder fund rate open at   to     percent   despit our do a     billion repo at our normal      a m   e  the upward pressur on the fund rate ye day continu   it rose to as high as   percent in the late morn  and that is whi we came in with a second oper of     billion around noon ye day   to tri to have more effect on this issu  this morn we came in much earlier than we normal do   around      a m   we did a     billion overnight repo   the fund rate at the  e was trade at    percent   i think this mean that we are obvious ad way too mani reserv for the current mainten period  but the good news is that  when this mainten period is over a week from tomorrow  we get a fresh start   so at the current  e i think we will see essenti a lot of firm in the fund rate in the morn and then the fund rate trade down to zero late in the day   where the fund rate averag relat to the target is go to be somewhat difficult to say   ye day  despit the collaps in the fund rate to essenti zero at the end of the day  the fund rate was quit firm relat to the target   i don   t rememb the number  but it was in the     percent rang   we are go to tri to hit the target on averag  but it is go to be veri difficult   in the current circumst  it probabl is more sensibl   at least my advic would be   to err on the side of provid enough liquid to the market rather than tri to be cute and worri just about the target feder fund rate   now  the lehman file has also intensifi the pressur on morgan stanley and goldman sach in a number of respect   the lehman failur mean that investor now view the debt of morgan stanley and goldman sach as have much more risk than it did on sunday   this mean that these firm need bigger liquid buffer than they had befor  and it   have implic for long term profit   as a consequ  their share price fell veri sharpli ye day   morgan stanley was down about    a share  to      and goldman sach   s stock was off    point  to        morgan stanley experienc a modest  but not insignific  pull back of their counterparti and ate into their liquid buffer by a measur degre   the lehman problem also were evid in some other area   this is veri incomplet  but the one that came to my attent were money market fund   especi  the reserv fund that had larg withdraw  and they encount a signific liquid problem   i am actual not sure how that was resolv  but i think that state street was in the situat of have to cover a veri larg shortfal of the reserv fund last night   the risk here  of cours  is that  if aig were to fail  money fund have even a broader exposur to them than to lehman  and so break the buck on the money market fund is a real risk   the capit resourc of the entiti that are associ with the money market fund often are quit modest  so their abil to top up the money fund and keep them whole is quit limit   thus the money market fund are definit one import issu in how this contagion could be broader   the second issu is the peopl who are deal with lehman and who have posit with lehman as their counterparti and how they wind up those posit  as you know  the parent file for bankruptci  but the u s  broker dealer is still in oper   but be in oper  sn   t mean that they are necessarili conduct busi in a normal way   one issu that has receiv a lot of attent is from some of the asset manag on their mortgag tba posit with lehman   appar  the sell side can net these up pretti easili through the ficc  fix incom clear corpor   but the asset manag have posit with lehman to either take on mortgag back secur or to sell mortgag back secur on a forward basi  and they are not realli sure what those posit are go to be when we get to that date   lehman was not execut those trade ye day  and so these asset manag are in the veri unfortun posit of not know what to do   do they offset their lehman posit with a trade elsewher or not   so that has been anoth veri open end issu for the market   in term of market function ye day  it was manag in the sens that market did trade   but i think it is much too soon to think that we are go to make it through just base on ye day   s move becaus that move  even though it wasn   t particular sever in term of  for exampl  the share price movement  did caus quit a bit of damag  and peopl are still pull away   of cours  we also have the issu of aig   the aig problem is at least start as a liquid crisi   the problem with aig is that the parent compani  sn   t have a lot of liquid resourc and  sn   t have easi abil to funnel liquid up from their subsidiari becaus most of the subsidiari are regul entiti   so aig is run into two problem   one  they are unabl to roll their commerci paper and  two  as their rate are downgrad   they were downgrad by moodi   s ye day  i think from aa minus to a minus  but don   t quot me on that   they have to post a lot more collater against their deriv exposur and also with respect to their gic  guarante invest contract  busi   so aig is in a situat in which the parent is basic go to run out of money   today  tomorrow  thursday  or veri  veri soon   now we say it   s a liquid thing  but a lot of  e when peopl look closer at the book they find out that the liquid crisi may also be a solvenc issu  i think it is still a littl unclear whether aig   s problem are confin just to liquid  it also may be an issu of how much this compani is realli worth   final  let me talk a bit about the facil that we introduc over the weekend  basic  we did two thing   we broaden the primari dealer credit facil  pdcf  signific in term of collater elig   wherea  befor  the pdcf took invest grade secur onli  we broaden it to includ basic everyth that is in the tri parti repo system   we felt that  by backstop the tri parti repo system complet  we would reassur tri parti investor that they didn   t face rollov risk  and so we would keep tri parti investor invest with the bank   that seem to be most what happen  at least ye day   we did get quit a bit of pdcf borrow ye day even  but it was predomin lehman   it was about     billion of lehman borrow   i think the total borrow was someth on the order of     billion   that is tell you that most of the borrow we had was associ with lehman   s not be abl to roll over their tri parti repo posit with their investor   we don   t realli know the reason for the other borrow  but it probabl was most to test the facil as oppos to actual need   so broaden the pdcf collater elig   seem to be work  so far at least  in keep tri parti investor in the game and continu to provid fund to the other primari dealer   the second thing we did was to the term secur lend facil  tslf    in term of the collater requir  that had been aaa rate rmbs  cmbs  and asset back secur   we broaden that collater  so the term are now the same as the old primari dealer credit facil   we think that there is quit a bit of collater that the primari dealer have in those aa  a  and bbb class of asset back secur  cmbs  and rmbs   so we think that is go to provid more support to the primari dealer in term of fund their liquid collater in this environ   we also increas the size   the origin author was for      billion   our auction schedul had been      billion  and we put that     billion increas into schedul     rememb  there are schedul   and     schedul   is treasuri and agenc   schedul   is treasuri  agenc  and this other stuff   so the schedul   auction are go to go up in size  and we frontload that increas becaus the tslf has not been fulli subscrib   we are actual go to be abl to do two tslf schedul   auction this week of     billion  so we are go to get quit a bit of tslf liquid into the market this week  which we think will also be help   so that is where thing stand   otherwis  i think thing in the market are do what you would expect   there is a flight to qualiti   the japanes yen and the swiss franc are outperform   the dollar is sort of in the middl  and the high yield currenc continu to be under pressur   but that is just what we have seen for the last year under these risk trade   i have a lot more materi  so if you ask question i can get into that   but i think i will just leav it there
question for bill   presid
just an amplif on the state street situat   my understand is that no money actual went out   there was     billion in withdraw that came in late in the day   they had a      billion credit line   state street had enough collater to do      billion   they were unwil to do     billion   they ask us what our posit was  and we told them that they need to make their own busi decis in this case   i haven   t heard what has happen this morn   i assum that they are scrambl for fund   but i would emphas that a real concern is that there will be a run this week on money market fund becaus they may have to freez the fund   it is possibl that they will break the buck  and this will be at organ that don   t have suffici capit to make peopl whole   so i think that is a real concern
just a question on the pdcf  about the expans of the collater base  you said there was     billion      billion of it was lehman   do we know what kind of collater lehman post   did they actual make use of the expand option or not   what was the natur of it  do you know
that was not actual even known until late ye day even   it take a while for us to get the report from the clear bank to be abl to go through and tell you what the collater is   in term of the lehman collater  they are not allow to broaden the pdcf   they are basic bring us the stuff they had on friday   it is also import to recogn that for lehman we are demand a lot higher collater requir on the non treasuri and non agenc secur   their collater haircut for those is    percent   so the fed is take some credit exposur there  but we put in place on friday   and we are continu that   a    percent collater haircut on the non treasuri and non agenc stuff that is in the pdcf for that exposur to lehman   we think that   s about rough three  e the market level that investor had been charg previous  so i think that give us a fair degre of protect
thank you  mr  chairman   the higher collater requir  is that just lehman
at this  e  i believ that is right
okay   i know there was a lot of concern go in ye day about the tri parti repo market  and i envis two scenario and anyth in between them   one is tri parti lender pull away from particular name and move their fund to other name  anoth  at the other extrem  would be tri parti repo lender pull away from the market as a whole   if you look at the tri parti repo market from the point of view of the borrow  that is a frighten scenario   then the lender are go to do someth with that money   i have been curious about what they would do   my understand is that cash balanc  in essenti deposit account  pile up at state street and boni ye day and that they were abl to do tri parti repo with some institut that had been pull away from   is that a valid observ   what are the prospect for that provid some kind of resili for the tri parti market
well  i guess the first thing i would say is that you are absolut right  if investor pull away  they have to take their money somewher   it  sn   t disappear   i think that the primari dealer credit facil has been shown to be pretti signific in provid support to this market   if you look at what happen to lehman  for exampl  even though lehman was under extrem pressur on friday  the tri parti repo investor stay with lehman on friday night  which actual surpris me   i think the reason that they stay is that they knew they didn   t realli have a lot of rollov risk   as long as the broker dealer didn   t file for bankruptci over the weekend   and that was the risk they realli were take   the feder reserv and the pdcf would be there as the tri parti repo investor of last resort   lehman   s experi suggest to me that  if we can contain the broad paramet of this crisi so that it  sn   t spread much further  then we can keep the tri parti repo investor from bolt becaus they don   t realli have a huge amount of risk as long as we are there behind them to take them out when their overnight oblig come due the next day
so  if i can just follow up  my understand is that tri parti repo are exempt from the automat stay  so it is not file per se that is the risk   it   s the risk that they don   t have the cash  right
well  i   m not sure about that   i thought that there was an issu about broker dealer file   i know that the clear bank are certain quit nervous about that eventu  but i   m not a lawyer
the repo are exempt from the automat stay provis of the bankruptci code   but if lehman had gone into sipa liquid  they could have been subject to a sipa stay
all right   then a question about the tslf   is it this program in which we provid treasuri
we give them treasuri  and they give us other stuff   you know  this will also probabl be help this week in provid more treasuri to the market   there was a tremend amount of treasuri fail ye day   so this mechan   two thing   it take illiquid collater from the dealer  and it also suppli a lot of treasuri to the market  which should help improv the market function in treasuri
other question   bill  would you be abl to talk a bit about the need for swap
i have just sketchi detail base on a phone call  so this may not be quit right   but my understand is that this morn norway put in place a facil by which they are go to offer their bank dollar  up to    billion  on a one week term   sort of an open facil   the fact that norway is do this suggest that the situat has broaden quit a bit further becaus this is the first  e that we have heard about norway in this stori  except for mayb some exposur to the iceland bank  i have had some convers with my counterpart at the ecb this morn   this is at a staff level  so i can   t realli say what would happen if you were to take this up the chain of command   but certain  at least on a preliminari basi  there is quit a bit of interest in have a similar facil for the ecb  which would not be a taf loan type of facil but more of an open facil where european bank could come and get dollar   this would reassur peopl that dollar liquid was avail in europ throughout the european day   my advic to you is that this is probabl a good idea in this environ becaus we are see that the lack of dollar liquid in europ is realli have a feedback effect on peopl   s willing to do busi with one other in the broader market   i think we should be open to do this with the ecb and perhap with the bank of england and the bank of japan as well   at least have the abil to do it should it prove necessari
you had a two hander  governor kohn
just to note that we did have a discuss of foreign exchang swap in the committe on the global financi system a week and a half ago  and the general consensus was that these had been veri handi in damp pressur in money market   dollar fund market in particular   when the foreign exchang swap market isn   t work veri well in europ and in switzerland   the central bank around the tabl  which are all the major central bank  are quit support of expand the facil   we were talk about put someth on a standbi basi for use in situat just like this   so the other central bank view this as veri help to them in contain pressur in their own market
the bank of japan has request at the staff level to set up a facil that would be on the shelf for year end becaus the japanes are quit worri that their bank are go to face a dollar fund problem at year end   now  this preced the recent crisi  so even befor this last week they were concern that the japanes bank could potenti have problem  and they were interest in explor with us have a facil in place   we were actual go to pursu this  and i hope we will have more at the octob fomc meet if not sooner
bill  if we were go to take action today  what would you recommend in term of counterparti   should we say an unlimit amount   should we specifi an amount   can we leav the  e open   what are your recommend on all those dimens
certain you want to make it pretti broad   you want to make it to the bank of england  switzerland  the ecb  the bank of japan  potenti canada   i would leav it to their discret if they would like to particip   i would make the offer to them  and if they want to particip  then we should be will to do that   in term of size  i think it is realli import that you don   t creat notion of capac limit becaus the market then can alway tri to test those   either the number have to be veri  veri larg  or it should be open end   i would suggest that open end is better becaus then you realli do provid a backstop for the entir market   as we   ve seen with the pdcf  if you provid a suitabl broad backstop  often  you don   t even actual need to use it to ani great degre   so i think that should be the strategi here
remind me again how big the european system of central bank    own outright hold of dollar balanc are
i don   t know
do you mean in term of their dollar foreign exchang reserv
right   the ecb   they all have their own dollar reserv
i don   t have the number
i believ that number is about      billion of dollar reserv in the euro system   the ecb itself has control of onli a fraction of that
these are held at individu nation central bank  so our swap line to them aren   t approach that level yet  right
note here a sens of discomfort with our lend them dollar that they alreadi have and so our serv as a substitut for their mobil their own dollar reserv for this purpos   obvious  the demand could swamp their own reserv  and at that point i would feel differ about this   but my understand is that the distribut within the european system of central bank is uneven  and in some sens this just provid them with a way to circumv negoti how those dollar would be distribut from differ central bank to differ privat sector bank within their own system   broad  i   m uncomfort with our play that role
whether it   s sensibl or not  the ecb has made a pretti strong distinct with us between their foreign exchang reserv and their dollar that they use in these oper   they realli want to keep those segreg   they want  to some extent  to repres this as be a collabor effort with the unit state as oppos to someth they are take on their own behalf   from their perspect   actual presid pool rais the same issu earlier on  and we had this discuss   they seem to put a lot of valu on have a distinct swap line  which symbol the cooper and coordin of the two central bank as oppos simpli to use their own reserv   presid
mr  chairman  i was go to say that we had this discuss befor   we did approv the swap line   i wonder if you could just summar for us what you view as the downsid risk to our do this
well  i don   t think there are ani signific downsid risk  there are oper issu that bill   and his team have to worri about   if we extend fund to the european  which they then relay to their bank  it affect our reserv posit and affect the manag of the feder fund rate and requir  il   that   s an oper issu   i suppos  if there were realli veri larg draw  it would begin to affect some of these balanc sheet constraint concern that we have   i think that is not an entir separ issu  but it is certain one that we are look at in term of tri to get interest on reserv and those other kind of measur  again  my expect is that have the facil would in part provid some confid over and abov how much we actual extend   so i guess the oper issu and the further draw on the balanc sheet would be the downsid  but to me  it seem to be a relat straightforward step   one we   ve done in the past and one that has the addit benefit of indic global cooper on these issu
in principl  we could talk to the ecb and other central bank about have the rate on these swap line be at a slight penalti relat to normal  e to tri to mitig the potenti reserv impact   i mean  it  sn   t have to be at   percent or    percent for overnight fund   it could be somewhat north of that   but if we have a credibl backstop  then it should calm the market  and then the backstop should not be use   if we have a backstop and it actual is use  that is presum becaus market condit are horrif   so in that environ  you could argu that the reserv manag thing are veri second order concern in some sens
other comment   all right   then i   d like to propos that the fomc deleg to the foreign currenc subcommitte an unspecifi author  in term of amount  to offer swap to foreign central bank as need to address liquid pressur in those other jurisdict   those decis will be made  again  by the foreign currenc subcommitte in consult with the open market desk   we would keep the fomc close inform  and we would revisit and discuss this issu again in octob   is that an accept resolut   ani amend to that   further discuss  comment  or concern   presid  n
yes   i am in favor of this   i just wonder how the marketplac will look at the open end natur of this becaus typic we have dollar magnitud associ with swap   it may all go relat smooth  on the other hand  it may rais question about exact what we think the issu are here
well  i think we are go to have discuss with our foreign counterpart to decid what the right strategi is   i think right now it is better to have it open end
that   s fine
whi don   t we have discuss with our counterparti   we won   t announc anyth today  i would assum
no  i think they have to take it up the chain of command  just as we do here   so it   s go to take probabl a day
this would come out in the minut for this meet
right   we   ll announc someth
but i assum there will be an announc at some point
of cours   when would we announc this measur
i think it would be after we   ve had a chanc   i mean  i think we have a lot of work to do with our foreign counterparti   this was basic rais to me this morn
all right   so this is all condit on agreement and discuss with other counterparti   we will come up with a joint communic announc strategi   presid
i just have one clarif   i have no basic object to this   i wonder whether or not  if the fomc is go to deleg the decis to this group  it is sort of an open end deleg to do this on an ongo basi     it make sens to defin a period of  e for which this open end deleg is appropri   that it would expir and would have to be renew
yes   we have author extend right now to januari    for a lot of these facil  so that would certain be a reason  e frame  i think
exist facil go to januari     is that right
januari      would that be accept
yes   i think it ought to have a termin point so that  if we want to renew it  we would be free to do so  but it wouldn   t last forev
one more clarif  mr  chairman   this is intend for g    central bank  to includ the ecb   just to be clear  if somebodi ask  this is not to give to central bank of emerg market economi
i presum so
i think we should presum so   if the other were to happen  we would come back to the committe
yes  this is about the major financi center and the abil of larg bank that oper global to obtain dollar fund
okay   so i amend the propos to termin on januari     presid
could i hear a littl more about the benefit of an open end commit   all of our program have been cap at a certain size   you said someth about    test the limit     and it make me think of foreign exchang regim   what kind of scenario do you have in mind
i think a lot of the program that we have are actual open end   the discount window is open end in the sens that it   s limit onli by the amount of collater that the bank post there   the primari dealer credit facil is open end in that it is limit onli by the size of the tri parti repo system   my point here is that  if foreign bank worri about capac limit  even have a larg program could in principl not be suffici in extremi   but if the program is open end  the rollov risk problem goe away   if i lend you more dollar today  i don   t have to worri about get those dollar back becaus i alway know that the facil is there   so it   s realli the elimin of the abil to flatten out your posit if you need to in term of your dollar exposur
it   s not open end in the sens that it is not an open window that anybodi can come to and take   it just give us the author to adjust the amount
so you will set a definit amount
we will certain negoti with the other central bank and tell them what we   re do now   but we want to have the flexibl in case of an emerg to respond  and we also don   t want to communic to the market somehow that we have a hard limit that is not go to be chang   that would be potenti bad for confid
but we will communic a program size
i think that remain to be discuss with our counterparti   i think we need to have discuss about what would be most effect   would a big size that   s fix in quantiti be most effect   would an open limit be most effect   i think we have to have those discuss   i think the import thing here   and what we   re go for   is credibl   in a crisi you need enough forc   more forc than the market think is necessari to solv the problem   and we   re go to have to have discuss to determin how much is enough forc
i think it is most a communic issu   anyth els  all right   do you want to call the roll on this one
we need a second
all right   thank you
can we read the resolut
the resolut is to provid to the foreign currenc subcommitte the author to enter into swap agreement with the foreign central bank as need to address strain in money market in other jurisdict   this will be done in cooper with the open market desk and in consult with those other central bank   the amount are unlimit in principl  but the decis will be made by the foreign currenc subcommitte as need and as appropri for the particular circumst   the fomc is provid this author through januari      it will  of cours  be open to discuss at ani meet
as action are taken  presum you   ll circul the outcom of these decis to this committe in advanc of ani announc
of cours   all right   let   s take a vote
chairman bernank first vice presid cum   governor duke   presid   governor kohn     governor     presid pianalto presid       presid  n governor     yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
thank you      have you circul the statement
yes  mr  chairman   everybodi should have it
has everyon a copi of that   good   befor we get start on that  i just want to comment that we may want to say someth in the statement about financi condit  but we   ll come back to that later   we need also now a vote to ratifi the domest open market oper
ani object   okay   thank you   let   s turn now to the econom situat   dave   and nathan sheet
thank you  mr  chairman   in respons to your request for some economi in our remark this morn  i   m go to set asid my prepar remark and just hit some of the highlight here   we did receiv a great deal of macroeconom data sinc we close the  book last wednesday   we didn   t seem to get ani of it right  but it all net out to just about noth    laughter   retail sale came in consider weaker than we had anticip  enough by themselv to have knock about    percentag point off third quarter gdp growth   but some of that was offset in higher retail inventori  and the rest was offset by a stronger than expect merchandis trade report for juli   it all left us still feel veri comfort with our forecast becaus it look to us as though econom growth is go to drop below   percent on averag in the second half of the year   in term of the thing that realli have stood out over the intermeet period  at least to my mind  one has been the weak in consumpt   as i indic  the retail sale report was weak  and now with that report in hand  we   d probabl mark down our current quarter consumpt forecast to a declin of     percent at an annual rate   what i think is realli remark about that is that this weak is occur even though we still think spend is probabl receiv some boost from the rebat   so exclud that effect  we   d be look at someth even weaker   now  as you know  we   ve been head fake a number of  e by the retail sale data  which are subject to some pretti substanti revis   so i wouldn   t necessarili take that report at face valu   but the drop we   ve seen in motor vehicl purchas pretti much mirror in size and  e the kind of falloff that we   ve seen in overal consumpt spend   so it look like a veri weak pictur for consumpt   the other notabl develop over the intermeet period has been the weak in the labor market   now not princip in the payrol employ figur   privat payrol employ has been fall pretti sharpli but not ani fa  than we would have thought   but the rise in the unemploy rate is remark   now  some of the     percentag point increas in the unemploy rate last month could be statist nois   it wouldn   t be entir surpris to see it fall back some   but the more than   percentag point rise that we   ve had sinc april is not go to be statist nois  some of that increas probabl reflect a bigger respons to the emerg unemploy compens program than we previous thought  and we   ve up our es  for that to a littl less than     percentag point on the level of the unemploy rate   but even put that asid  we have experienc a more signific rise in the unemploy rate  and i think that   s consist with other thing that we   re see in term of the labor market data   we   ve seen anoth appreci jump in initi claim   announc job cut are up   job open are down   survey hire plan have soften   now  this sharp rise in the unemploy rate is a bit difficult to squar with a gdp figur that look as though it was run abov   percent in the second quarter and even   percent if you want to averag the first and second quarter togeth   there are occasion larg error in     s law  as i think i   ve note in the past   it seem as though     s law get obey about as frequent as the    mile an hour speed limit on i       laughter   but still  one of the thing that we should probabl be consid is that perhap the economi has not been as strong as suggest by the real gdp figur  real gross domest incom  which is output measur on the incom side of the account  has risen about   percentag point less than gdp over the past year   and if we look at industri product and compar that with the compon of gdp that are  in essenc  good product  there   s about a   percentag point discrep there  with industri product suggest weaker figur than gdp   we see no reason to discount the rise in the unemploy rate as suggest that we   re enter the second half with more labor market slack than we had previous thought   furthermor  on net  we   ve revis down our project growth in gdp over the next two year   admit just a bit   and that was in respons to two pretti strong crosscurr   one was the signific lower oil price that we have in this forecast  we do think they   re go to provid some support to under dispos incom and spend   but the posit effect of that on our forecast go forward was more than offset by a signific mark down in our forecast for net export   which nathan will be discuss   in respons to an appreci of the dollar and a further downward revis to our outlook for foreign activ   on net  that left us with a littl lower growth rate and carri forward a notic higher unemploy rate over the forecast period   now  those were pretti small adjust   i don   t think we   ve seen a signific chang in the basic outlook  and certain the stori behind our forecast is veri similar to the one that we had last  e  which is that we   re still expect a veri gradual pickup in gdp growth over the next year and a littl more rapid pickup in        the three thing that are absolut central to produc that outcom are our project that we   re go to get a stabil in hous in        and earli in       that there will be some diminish of the drag on growth from the financi turbul  and that oil price flatten out   of those three  to my mind  the compon that probabl is most central and most import would be see some stabil in the hous market  not onli becaus this has been a big drag on growth and will also have consequ for household wealth but also becaus if there   s go to be some clariti and reassur to financi market particip  it seem as though some end to the hous debacl has to be in sight   we think we are see a few glimmer of hope there   howev  we thought that on occas in the past and have been proven wrong  but sale of exist home have been flat sinc the turn of the year   sale of new home have been flat for sever month now   we   ve had a drop in mortgag interest rate that follow the takeov of fanni and freddi   start have fallen so much now that  in fact  builder are make signific progress in work down the inventori of unsold new home and even month    suppli has tip down of late   so we think that some thing are look a littl better for us there   as a consequ  we   re expect to see some bottom out near the end of this year or the begin of next year   but not a sharp recoveri   overal residenti invest actual is still a negat for      but less of a negat than it has been this year   as you know from the  book  our es  suggest that the financi restraint on overal activ   actual on the level of gdp   will increas between      and       but their effect on the growth rate of gdp are diminish somewhat   final  with regard to oil price  by our assess the rise in crude oil price sinc the begin of      is probabl knock about    percentag point off growth in       and with a flatten out of oil price  we expect that to be more of a neutral factor over the next two year   that   s provid some impetus   a lot of what   s go on in our forecast is bad thing not worsen ani more quick next year than they did this year  rather than thing actual get better   i guess it   s a sad comment that we   re reli on second deriv turn posit to be the main forc generat some upward impetus to econom growth   but we are project a gradual pickup   now  on the inflat side  this morn   s cpi report for august actual came in a littl better than we were expect   the cpi in august fell     percent   we had been expect an increas of     percent   that surpris was all in the energi compon  but we at least did see some moder in the retail food price side that we were look for  and the chang in core cpi fell back to     percent after a string of     percent increas   i don   t think these data will do much to chang our basic forecast  which is for total pce price to be up somewher in the neighborhood of a   percent rate in the third quarter  and core price up   percent   still  if one look back at the last few cpis and pces  thing have come in a littl higher on the core side   the project   percent increas is up about   percentag point from where we were in our august forecast  and our interpret of this is that we   re probabl see more upward impetus and pass through from the higher energi price  other commod price  and import than we had previous expect   that certain squar with what we   re hear from our busi contact   it also squar with what we saw last week in the ppi  which was anoth veri sharp increas in price of intermedi materi   at least go forward  for the first  e sinc this process got under way  we are see more than just a futur price forecast flatten out   some eas in the price of both oil and other commod and the appreci of the dollar are give us at least a littl more confid that some of these cost pressur are go to abat go forward and that we will get the disinfl that we have been forecast   we continu to see reason encourag sign on inflat expect   the medium term and long term inflat expect in the preliminari michigan report last week drop     percentag point  to     percent  tip haven   t realli done veri much  and hour labor compens continu to come in below our expect   so base on our assess  onc these cost pressur work their way through the system   and we still think that the process will take place over the second half   we think that we   ll get some reced of core inflat from the     percent that we   re project for this year to     percent next year and     percent in        just a coupl of final remark on current event   hurrican gustav and ike obvious creat an enorm amount of devast for a whole lot of peopl  but they don   t realli appear to us to have signific macroeconom consequ   there will be some temporari disrupt to oil and gas extract and refin  but it look as though the basic infrastructur has larg been spare   i   ll be interest to hear presid     s report   retail gasolin price have jump in the last few day  but wholesal price for deliveri in octob are actual lower than they were befor the storm were on the horizon   i think that suggest that this is not go to be a major negat event   undoubt  industri product is go to fall like a stone in septemb  reflect these two hurrican as well as the boe strike  but we   re expect that to bounc right back again   i don   t realli have anyth use to say about the econom consequ of the financi develop of the past few day   i must say i   m not feel veri well about it at the present  but i   m not sure whether that reflect ration econom analysi or the fact that i   ve had too mani meal out of the vend machin downstair in the last few day    laughter   but in ani event  we   re obvious go to need to wait a bit to see how the dust settl here  but i think the sign would be obvious in a bad direct   i   ll turn over the floor to nathan
i also will be veri brief in summar econom develop abroad   inde  i would just like to make six veri brief point   the first one is that the incom data we   ve receiv sinc the last  book for the foreign economi have been extraordinarili soft   inde  we   ve mark down our forecast or project of the second quarter by a full percentag point   the data also suggest that we should carri forward a fair amount of that soft at least through the next year   so our foreign outlook is much softer than it was befor   the second point is that this soften outlook in our view has been a key factor that has contribut to further sizabl declin in oil and commod price   this morn  oil price were trade around     a barrel  which was down anoth     a barrel from where we were at the  e of the last meet   the third point is that this deterior foreign outlook also seem to have trigger someth of a reassess in currenc market   sinc your last meet  the dollar has strengthen near   percent in broad nomin term   in our view  what happen in currenc market was that the market had price in the expect that the foreign economi would remain quit resili in the face of a slow in the unit state  now with the incom data over the past coupl of month  it is becom clearer and clearer that the u s  slow is go to have a mark effect on these foreign economi  and this has shift the relat attract of the dollar and support the appreci that we   ve seen over the last coupl of month   the fourth point is that  in a number of emerg market economi  we   ve seen a resurg of certain sort of financi vulner   we   ve seen across realli a broad array of these economi rise extern debt spread and rise cds spread   we   ve seen fall equiti price and  for a number of these economi  downward pressur on their currenc   on that last point  a number of the asian have been interven in the foreign exchang market over the intermeet period but have actual been interven to tri to prevent their currenc from depreci  which is a mark chang from what we   ve seen in the last coupl of year   the fifth point is that the surpris strong perform of u s  export that we   ve seen appear to have continu through juli   after the  book went to bed  we got the juli trade data  and they continu to point to a fair amount of strength in the export sector   it was particular strong in the auto sector  but it was a broad base strength through juli   nevertheless  our view is that  given the rise in the dollar and the soften outlook for foreign growth  we   re veri like to see some slow in export growth go forward   the final point i   d like to mention is that  also late last week after the  book went to bed  we receiv data on import price   these data  realli for the first  e in a long  e  show a mark deceler in both materi intens good import price and finish good import price   our forecast for a long  e has call for a deceler in import price in line with the project flatten out of commod price and a project flatten out of the dollar   now it seem that we   re at a point at which all those thing that have been incorpor into our forecast but we haven   t had a lot of evid for are start to materi   we have the dollar flatten out and  inde  somewhat stronger than in the last  book   we have lower path for commod price  and then the data that we recent receiv show an actual deceler in core import price  which give us some confid that perhap the rise in those import price has peak   i   ll stop there
thank you   are there question for dave and nathan
could i ask just one question  mr  chairman
could you interpret for us the bank of china   s cut in the bank lend rate
yes   ye day the pboc cut it main polici rate    basi point   i guess they felt that    would not have been enough and    would have been too much    laughter   and    was just the right number   i   d say a coupl of thought were there   one import point is that inflat in china has deceler signific   in the spring they were look at twelv month inflat rate of around     percent   the latest read for august was     percent   so it   s clear on a deceler trajectori   that has been driven by a mark declin in food price   earlier this year  food price were move up at over a    percent rate  and now it is about    percent   so the deceler in price  some concern about where activ is go  particular in the aftermath of the olymp  and sign of slow extern demand have given them the scope they need to cut polici rate   besid the cut in monetari polici  we   re also hear report that the author are pois to implement fiscal s ulus if that   s necessari
three is a lucki number in china   don was go to tell you that   cube is       laughter
he was also go to wonder  mr  chairman  whether we need to har the mystic power    laughter
i think we have good feng shui here
the scienc of monetari polici
ani other deep question for our colleagu   i   m a littl surpris
we   re all tri to be brief  mr  chairman
everyon has been veri brief   i   m shock    laughter   my propos  which i can be argu out of  is to do one round  if that   s accept   pleas indic your preliminari view on polici  and you will have anoth opportun to refin and extend your view  is that accept with everybodi
should we have     s present
yes  of cours   i was about to turn to that   if that   s accept  let   s turn to   and have your discuss
i will be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern and trial run survey result     the result of the survey are shown in exhibit     in the interest of  e  i will not cover them this morn   the subcommitte on communic plan to be in touch with the committe on this issu over the upcom intermeet period   the first page of the packag reproduc the version of tabl   that you receiv ye day afternoon   this version includ three polici altern   as in the bluebook  altern b would leav the stanc of polici unchang at this meet  and altern c would involv a    basi point firm today   howev  altern a now entail a    basi point polici eas rather than the unchang fund rate that was specifi in the bluebook version of this altern   i will begin by discuss altern c   the discuss at your last meet suggest that you general saw the next move in polici as like to be a firm  a point that was explicit in the minut of the meet   even though market volatil and financi strain have increas notabl in recent week  you might view those develop as have onli limit implic for the econom outlook and henc see econom fundament as continu to suggest that polici should soon be firm   inflat has been well abov the rate that committe member judg as appropri for the longer run  and despit lower oil price and greater slack in labor market  there remain consider uncertainti about how soon and how much core inflat will slow   in these circumst  you may believ that a firm of polici is appropri   under the version of altern b distribut ye day even  the committe would hold the target fund rate constant at this meet  and the statement would suggest that the committe see the risk to growth and inflat as rough balanc  you may believ that this combin is appropri for this meet if your modal outlook for the economi has not chang much sinc the last meet and if you judg that the upsid risk to inflat have diminish  given the sharp drop in energi price  the declin in indic of inflat expect  and the greater econom slack impli by the recent unexpect sharp jump in the unemploy rate   you might also believ that the downsid risk to growth have increas as a result of the recent increas in financi strain   but at the same  e  you may want    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     to let the dust settl a bit befor conclud that these develop warrant an adjust in your polici stanc   in particular  you may think there is a good chanc that the latest enhanc to the feder reserv   s special liquid facil will help keep market function and mitig the risk to growth   relat to the bluebook version  the languag of altern b has been revis in three materi way   first  b  now note that    strain in financi market have intensifi      second  the claus    some indic of inflat expect have been elev    has been drop from b  in view of the recent declin in inflat compens and survey measur of inflat expect   final  the first sentenc of b  has been revis to suggest that the committe now see the signific risk to growth and inflat as rough balanc   given market particip    expect that the fund rate could trade soft to the target for a  e in light of recent develop  gaug exact what is built into market for the outcom of today   s meet is difficult   but earlier this morn  market price appear to incorpor high odd of at least a    basi point eas today or possibl more   thus market might well see a decis to keep the fund rate constant and to make no appreci chang to the languag of the statement as signal less concern about financi develop than they anticip   if you saw recent develop as signific boost the downsid risk to growth or notic lower the modal outlook  you might consid eas the feder fund rate    basi point at this meet  as in altern a   the rational languag for this action would begin by note that strain in financi market have increas signific and would go on to indic that the polici action should help to promot moder growth over  e   the committe would cite the recent declin in energi and other commod price and the increas slack in resourc util as factor that are expect to fo  a moder of inflat   the risk assess would indic that    the downsid risk to growth have intensifi  but the upsid risk to inflat remain a concern to the committe      with a polici eas larg built into market  shorter term interest rate would like declin modest in respons to such an action  depend on how much is built in  or they might be littl chang   as the chairman indic earlier in the meet  adjust to the statement could be consid in light of the further volatil in market over the past day   thank you  mr  chairman
if i could add a few thought on market expect about this meet   i think it look as though eas is price in for two reason   one  dealer do expect the feder fund rate to trade soft as we add excess reserv  so i would not take the soft in the septemb feder fund futur contract as indic of necessarili expect an eas   two  i think it is import to recogn that the rate embodi in those fed fund futur contract are mean not mode   so i would character the market expect as either that thing get veri  veri bad and the fomc cut rate signific or that the fomc   noth  i think that actual a    basi point cut is probabl the least like outcom that the market anticip   as evid of this  a coupl of dealer ye day did chang their forecast to a    basi point rate cut   i   m not awar of anybodi who has chang to      probabl peopl like that are out there   i know that my colleagu at goldman sach  where i use to work  are say that they think the fomc is go to keep rate unchang today but  if they were to move  it would be     that give you a sens that it   s realli a bimod kind of view and that put differ probabl on    and zero give you some eas price into the feder fund rate futur market   so i think the consensus view still in the marketplac is that the fed probabl will not cut rate today   that would be a disappoint to a degre becaus there   s some probabl place on the idea that the fed might do     but that   s how i would interpret what   s price into the market today
could i ask for a littl clarif here   the indic of sen ent is import  is it not  in term of expect from the popul that you   re talk about   the signal of our direct would be import here
well  i think the market particip would gain some comfort to the extent that the feder reserv as an institut indic concern about what   s go on in the financi market   but in some way the desk has alreadi signal that concern by it intervent  so i   m not sure that addit indic are need   but in the languag you might want to indic to market particip that  if thing were to materi worsen in the financi market  the committe might revisit the issu of where the feder fund rate should be
just on the issu of trade soft  though  the octob decemb has also come down  and there is certain some shift in the actual polici expect
that is true   i think on friday the mood was basic that the fund rate was go to be flat for a long  e   probabl place on either eas or tighten were quit low  and sinc then the probabl of eas has gone up fair signific   but i think it   s hard to interpret becaus it   s realli not about    versus zero   it   s realli about zero versus    or mayb even     as you look out longer term   either the financi system is go to implod in a major way  which will lead to a signific further eas  or it is not
other question   all right   if not  let   s begin with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i final the think that went into my prepar remark late last week  which seem like a good idea at the  e   but i should follow the philosophi of   brown  who i think said     never do today what you can put off until tomorrow       laughter   obvious  we can   t ignor the event of the weekend and ye day   s financi market   so late ye day i review the view that i shape last week and tri to ground them in an assess of whether the outlook for the real economi has chang materi  whether the balanc of risk has been alter  and whether  in my opinion  we must reintroduc a risk manag approach and consid take out more insur  with that as prologu  let me make just a coupl of comment on region sound from the last coupl of week   anecdot report from the sixth district support the view that the economi is quit weak but not deterior mark   the cfo of a larg retail of hous relat good said that they think they see a bottom form   i am also start to hear some report that hous market feel as though they are begin to stabil  but  realli  it is a littl too earli to say that a bottom has form in ani of our hous market   my overal sens from district contact and our survey is of an economi that is quit weak  with no clear trend evid  turn to the nation outlook  like most forecast  my view on the like path for the economi has not chang materi sinc our august meet   i see noth in the data and hear noth from district report that alter my view that the second half will be veri weak   i expect this weak period to be follow by a slow recoveri gather in       but the foundat of a recoveri start around year end or earli      may be far from solid   the contract of credit avail that is confirm by both survey and anecdot evid could deepen as financi institut face tight liquid and difficulti recapit   a protract credit crunch would like oper as a substanti drag on the economi  consist with the  book  i expect some near term improv in headlin inflat  as we saw this morn  some near term deterior of core inflat measur  and inflat move in the right direct later this year and into next year   that said  one director said that he and his particular industri had seen no moder of price increas up to this date  i am comfort somewhat that the upward drift in some inflat expect measur appear to have been revers   in addit  my staff has been monitor revis to inflat forecast of profession forecast  which also seem to suggest that concern about acceler inflat have abat somewhat  regard the balanc of risk in the economi  i am concern that the downsid risk to growth may be gather forc  as evidenc by the weaken person consumpt and retail sale data  the weaken economi of export partner  and the delic state of the financi market   at the same  e  i perceiv that there is signific risk that the current disinflationari environ may fail to bring core inflat down to anyth resembl accept level for the longer term   ad up all of this  i perceiv a veri rough balanc of risk that could break either way in come month  my view of the appropri polici path is consist with the  book   that the fed fund rate target will remain stabl at or close to the current level for sever month go into        my prefer is to hold the fed fund rate at the current level of   percent   among the reason is that a   percentag point drop  as suggest by altern a  is realli not clear call for by a chang outlook for the real economi   inflat risk are still in play  and i think we should give credit market more  e to digest event and sort out rate relationship  as regard the statement  my prefer is altern b   howev  i am concern that the refer to the recent financi turbul is not quit strong enough  so i took a shot at rephras just the begin of the rational section to read as such      econom growth appear to have slow recent  and labor market have weaken further   in addit  strain in financi market have increas signific      basic take the slight stronger express in the altern a rational and put it in altern b   so my posit  mr  chairman  is to hold at this meet   thank you veri much
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be brief   this is alreadi a histor week  and the week has just begun   the labor market is weak and get weaker   the unemploy rate has risen     percentag point sinc april and is like to rise further   i am not convinc that the unemploy rate will level off where the  book is assum current   the failur of a major invest bank  the forc merger of anoth  the largest thrift and insur teeter  and the failur of freddi and fanni are like to have a signific impact on the real economi   individu and firm will becom risk avers  with reluct to consum or to invest   even if firm were inclin to invest  credit spread are rise  and the cost and avail of financ is becom more difficult   mani securit vehicl are frozen  the degre of financi distress has risen mark   deleverag is like to occur with a vengeanc as firm seek to surviv this period of signific upheav   given that mani borrow will face higher interest rate as a result of financi problem  we can help offset this addit drag by reduc the feder fund rate   i support altern a to reduc the fed fund rate    basi point   thank you
mr  chairman  i see no reason to focus on the detail of the forecast  clear  the economi is under stress  both as we look at the econom growth forecast and as we look at the inflat forecast   so i recogn the amount of stress we are under here   i would say to you  in deal with that stress  i am fulli support of the action that we take in term of liquid   the taf and the other effort to provid liquid into the market   these are tool that we can and should use for these kind of shock in a short term context   on the other hand  i would encourag the committe to resist the impuls to eas polici in a sens of do someth   the issu is not the level of our polici rate at this  e   it is the dysfunct of the market that we hope our liquid effort will help address   to begin to talk about eas or even to put languag in there that suggest eas is to caus peopl  on the expect that we might eas at some point even if we hold off now  to delay decis that they would otherwis make that would benefit the economi  i also encourag us to look beyond the immedi crisi  which i recogn is serious  but as point out here  we also have an inflat issu   our core inflat is still abov where it should be   headlin inflat has been up  even though there are some sign that commod and energi are back off   but the busi themselv are say     how do i recov my margin      so there is no impuls to pass along those reduct   we talk about wage and labor back off   but they are hold off  they are not back off  and in negoti they are much more antagonist   those kind of pressur will emerg at some point   those are the longer run issu that i think we need to keep in mind as we deal with this immedi crisi   so i would strong encourag us to leav rate where they are  to be veri care with our languag  not to encourag the expect of further rate decreas  and to continu to be aggress in our liquid provis as we have been the last sever week and month   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   dure the past sever week  my head offic and branch director have becom decid more pessimist about the econom outlook   my own assess of incom data coincid with their   my contact also report that their busi are still rais price in respons to past increas in commod and import price that boost their cost   i expect as a consequ that core inflat will remain uncomfort high for a while longer  but the mark declin in commod price sinc june reinforc my convict that there is light at the end of this inflat tunnel  with respect to growth  our forecast is similar to the  book   s  with a littl more weak in the second half of this year and a littl more strength in        i think the risk to this forecast are decid skew to the downsid   i agre with the  book   s assess that the strength we saw in the upward revis real gdp growth in the second quarter will not hold up   despit the tax rebat  real person consumpt expenditur declin in both june and juli  and retail sale were down in august   my contact report that cutback in spend are widespread  especi for discretionari item   for exampl  east bay plastic surgeon and dentist note that patient are defer elect procedur    laughter   reserv are no longer necessari at mani high end restaur   and the silicon valley countri club  with a          entranc fee and seven to eight year wait list  has seen the number of would be new member shrink to a mere thirteen    laughter  export were a huge sourc of strength in the second quarter  but i am concern that we cannot count on veri larg contribut to growth from export go forward  now that the dollar has begun to rise and econom growth abroad has slow  even turn negat in some import trade partner   inde  the grow weak of the global outlook appear to be an import explan for the revers in commod price  and this add a dimens of gloom to what would otherwis be a decid plus for both inflat and demand  recent data also suggest that labor market are weaken across the board   a develop that will cast a pall on household incom and spend   the interact of higher unemploy with the hous and financi market rais the potenti for even wors news   name  an intensif of the advers feedback loop we have long worri about and are now experienc   inde  delinqu have risen substanti across the spectrum of consum loan  and credit avail continu to declin   one ray of hope is that the chang at fanni and freddi have caus a notabl drop in mortgag rate   anoth is that the declin in home price has becom somewhat less steep  and we have seen an outright improv in home inventori relat to sale   but my contact are veri pessimist about the prospect for nonresidenti construct   they note that construct is continu on project in the pipelin with commit fund  but new project are all but imposs to financ  turn to inflat  i have long anticip and still expect that inflat will fall to more reason level in        howev  develop sinc our august meet diminish the upsid risk to this project   the drop in oil and other commod price  along with the appreci of the dollar  should work to moder the current inflat bulg and diminish the potenti for a wage   price spiral to develop   import inflat has alreadi begun to eas  furthermor  we have seen a remark declin in inflat compens for the next five year in the tip market   i would not reli heavili on this declin to support my view  but i do have to say that the declin is a lot more reassur than the altern   i was also encourag by the    basi point drop in long term inflat expect in the most recent michigan survey   i anticip that the recent jump in the unemploy rate will place some addit downward pressur on growth in labor compens  which has been quit low  and in core inflat  although the jump in the unemploy rate probabl part reflect the extens of unemploy insur coverag  a back of the envelop calcul suggest that the upper bound on this effect is just a few tenth of a percent   i would agre with the  book es    we have also examin the possibl that the increas in unemploy reflect a rise in the nairu due to sector employ shift out of construct and financ and into other industri   ned phelp has argu that the sector shift stori impli a sizabl dispers of employ growth across industri and state   but we look at these data and found no signific increas  so i don   t find this phelp argument particular convinc   consid all of these factor  i expect both headlin and core pce price inflat to fall to about   percent for      as a whole  and i see the risk to this project as rough balanc  with respect to polici  i would be inclin to keep the fund rate target at   percent today   for now  it seem to me that the addit liquid measur that have been put in place are an appropri respons to the turmoil   i am fine with the word of altern b and would support presid     s suggest for chang   that would seem fine to me  too   in view of the intensifi financi stress and the potenti for more turmoil  obvious i think we will need to be flexibl in set polici go forward  and i am veri concern about downsid risk to the real economi and think that inflat risk is diminish

thank you  mr  chairman   i am go to start with the nation economi in the interest of breviti here   concern the nation outlook  it is difficult and probabl unwis to tri to assess growth and inflat prospect in the immedi aftermath of an event like the lehman bankruptci   i expect to see more failur among financi firm  and i expect those failur to continu to contribut to market volatil   this is part of an ongo shakeout among financi market firm  follow some of the worst risk manag in a generat   i expect sluggish growth in the second half of       in part due to labor market that are somewhat weaker than expect   financi market turmoil is certain a key concern  but the u s  economi still outperform expect in the first half of       despit the demis of bear stearn   an event not too differ in some respect from the current episod  my sens is that three larg uncertainti loom over the economi have now been resolv   the gses and the fate of lehman and merril lynch   of these  the resolut of gse uncertainti seem to be the most pivot  even though it is not the one lead the news today  normal  the elimin of key uncertainti is a plus for the economi   as is typic in this type of situat  safe interest rate have fallen dramat across the board  a second macroeconom shock stem from the dramat rise in oil and other commod price has been an unwelcom develop dure the past six month   the retreat of west texa intermedi price to     a barrel  and today down to     a barrel  should improv second half growth prospect  meanwhil  an inflat problem is brew   the headlin cpi inflat rate  the one consum actual face  is about    percent year to date   that   not includ today   s report  this is against the feder fund target of   percent   while it make sens to focus on financi market for the  e be  it is essenti that we keep in posit to put downward pressur on inflat go forward   the financi crisi threaten to roll on for such a long  e and to demand so much attent that the privat sector may ration conclud that we have lost all sight of our inflat object   in such a case of unmoor expect  outcom could be far more sever than those envis in the  book  my polici prefer is to maintain the feder fund rate target at the current level and to wait for some  e to assess the impact of the lehman bankruptci file  if ani  on the nation economi   in uncertain circumst like these  i think it would be unwis to react too hastili to a fluid situat   ani immedi effect may not be the one that are intend  and further down the line   that is  onc more data have accumul   a hasti action may leav the committe out of posit relat to the incom data   by deni fund to lehman suitor  the fed has begun to reestablish the idea that market should not expect help at each difficult junctur  chang rate today would confus that import signal and take out much of the posit part out of the previous decis   in addit  a rate move would be poor target toward mitig of difficulti at particular financi firm   the fomc has alreadi done a great deal to creat a low interest rate environ in order to shepherd the economi through a substanti shock to the financi and hous sector   the committe now need to allow the financi sector shakeout to occur use liquid facil to the extent possibl to help navig the result turbul   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   new data and survey and anecdot inform in the third district suggest that the economi in our district continu to be weak  there have been further declin in some industri and deceler of growth in other  but general data are come in as expect   employ growth was flat over the three month period end in juli  and i expect that unemploy rate in our three state will tick up in august  when the region data come out  much as it did in the nation data  overal  the activ in our region  as i said  has remain weak sinc the last meet  hous construct continu to be weak   sale of exist home remain sluggish  and inventori remain high   one builder said     thing don   t feel veri good   i feel as though i am in a tar pit   my feet are mayb now on the bottom  my nose is still abov the level of the tar  and while i may feel the bottom  it still  sn   t feel veri good      on the commerci real estat side  we saw a slight uptick in the valu of juli contract  but they are not veri high   in fact  they realli remain at the averag level of the last seven year   retail remain pessimist in the latest beig book   district bank saw loan rise slowli but steadili in august   the beig book report from them see slight gain in consum and real estat lend and c i loan essenti flat  the good news is from our busi outlook survey for septemb  which will be releas to the public on thursday at       a m   but the result are in   the survey is from the first two week of septemb   the general activ index has been negat  if you recal  for the last nine month   sinc decemb        the last valu was minus        the septemb number  not to be releas until thursday  is a posit      so that   s a swing of    point to the good   this is clear somewhat encourag  although we don   t want to get too excit about one month   but it is good news   furthermor  both the new order and shipment index in the survey improv in septemb   price pressur have abat somewhat with the fall in commod and oil  but they remain   the six month ahead outlook index also improv substanti in the new survey   this is the best pictur that the survey has paint in certain quit a while   about the last six or eight month   in summari  the econom condit of the third district remain weak and sluggish but are not materi differ from what we and our busi contact had been expect over the near term  while a lot of attent in the short run is be paid to financi market    turmoil  our decis today must look beyond today   s financi market to the real economi and it prospect in the futur   in this regard  thing have not chang veri much  at least not yet   inde  the  book forecast has chang onli modest sinc the last  book   the economi remain weak but not appreci differ from what i anticip or even what the  book anticip at the last meet   i agre that the recent financi turmoil may ul  affect the outlook in a signific way  but that is far from obvious at this point   we also need to acknowledg the long lag  e associ with the effect of monetari polici action on the real economi   action today will not help us veri much in the veri  veri near term where the real economi is concern  on the inflat front  there has been some good news   the declin in the retail price of gas has contribut to a declin in headlin inflat in august   in my view  the price declin in commod and oil have mitig somewhat the upward pressur on expect and have reduc the likelihood that inflat expect will becom unanchor  at least in the near term   nevertheless  i remain concern about the inflat outlook go forward   in part  my concern stem from the fact that i do not see that the ongo expect slowdown in econom activ is entir demand driven   as i note befor  the impact of financi shock and high commod price can plausibl lead to a declin in the growth rate of potenti output   if so  there will be less offset to inflat go forward than incorpor in the baselin  book forecast  which reli heavili on slack variabl to control inflat   the  book simul entitl    cost realloc    provid some welcom effort from the staff in this regard  and i appreci that   yet the detail of that experi were a bit sketchi for me  and at some point i would be interest in a littl more detail as to how that actual play out  in my view  the main driver for the outlook of futur inflat over the next two year is not  nor has it been  oil price per se  but the path of monetari polici that the committe will adopt over the next sever month and quarter   i appreci the memo that the staff produc regard the stanc of monetari polici   accord to the memo  the current stanc of polici is not unusu accommod   howev  i would like to note that that conclus depend critic on the specif forecast and the natur of the frb us model   a differ model  one that say that inflat expect are more forward look  may well lead to a veri differ conclus   but i take the messag of the memo to be that the assess of the stanc of monetari polici is depend  at a point in  e  on a model  and i veri much agre with that assess   given that my model is somewhat differ from the staff   s model  i continu to believ that monetari polici at it current level is accommod and that  if this current stanc is sustain  the economi will experi fa  inflat in the medium term   clear  we must pay attent to the advers effect of the financi disrupt   but we also must recogn that our polici action today and over the next sever month will affect the outcom of inflat over the medium term   as i said  it is my view that the current stanc of polici is inconsist with price stabil in the intermedi term and so rate ul  will have to rise  now  i acknowledg that there are risk to econom growth go forward   the slowdown and the financi market turmoil could turn out to be wors than i expect   i also recogn that  given the event over the weekend  now is probabl not the  e to shock market by rais rate   but neither is it a  e to panic and lower rate   a cut today may be reassur to some in the financi market  but it also may serv to scare market by send a signal that we are much more worri than perhap they are   there is just way too much volatil and dust blow around to make such snap judgment on monetari polici   we have been aggress with our liquid provis  and we will continu to be so  and i support that   stabil come from monetari polici is an import attribut  and i think we have an opportun to provid some stabil here   howev  i am uncomfort with the current  book baselin path that has the fund rate remain unchang well into the second half of next year   in my view  that will not deliv an accept path of inflat outcom over the medium term   at the same  e  i do not perceiv an immedi threat to the unanchor of expect  so i can accept keep the fund rate at an unchang level at this meet   but at some point  befor the unemploy rate begin to improv substanti  i believ this committe will need to rais rate in order to deliv on our inflat object  regard languag  i can live with the languag in altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  even befor the event of the last sever day  i thought that this was the most sever financi crisi  certain  that i have seen in my career   and the last sever day   as well as some of bill   s comment about possibl contagion spread from break the buck and so on and so forth   have onli heighten that convict and my concern about where we are   so i think it is fair to say that the headwind confront the economi have intensifi even further   it is difficult to comment on the degre or the durat  but i think we know the direct   as far as the near term econom outlook is concern  i wasn   t terribl op ist about the next two or three quarter to begin with   if i were go to prepar a new forecast at this point   or even had i prepar one last week   i probabl would mark it down a bit   but  of cours  there is not much we can do about that at this stage  as far as the inflat outlook is concern  i have thought that  late in this year and into next year  inflat would start to abat  and recent develop perhap heighten my convict about that   but i will agre that it is still an open issu   so it seem to me that all of this suggest that the outlook  at least in term of financi condit and the economi in the near term  has clear deterior   the inflat outlook  if anyth  has perhap improv a notch  or at least the outlook that i had earlier is a littl more solid  given the lag in polici  it  sn   t seem that there is a heck of a lot we can do about current circumst  and we have alreadi tri to address the financi turmoil   so i would favor altern b as a polici matter   as far as languag is concern with regard to b  i would be inclin to give more promin to financi issu   i think you could do that mayb by revers the first two sentenc in paragraph     you would have to chang the transit  of cours  i would say that if we want to chang polici at this meet   and that is not my prefer   i would do it by    percentag point  and i would think that the rational would be psycholog reason   again  i don   t think we are go to have a big effect on the near term perform of the economi   but if we think psycholog in the marketplac is suffici bad or that there is suffici concern that the feder reserv somehow  sn   t quit get it   i would think that all our action cumul  includ the action over the weekend  should not make that a grave concern   then i think we would want to do more than   percentag point  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the unfold financi situat is inject enorm uncertainti into the econom outlook and polici pictur   although this analog is imperfect  today   s uncertainti remind me of march        then  on the eve of the invas of iraq  the fomc decid that geopolit uncertainti was so great that the committe could not character the balanc of risk at all in the polici statement   today  the downsid risk to output are almost too dispers to character   in one or two week  we may know better that either the economi will somehow muddl through or we   re like to be face the mother of all credit crunch   i think that the first outcom would be quit an accomplish under the circumst  but at the moment it   s veri hard to say how this will turn out  nevertheless  we have to offer an opinion   with respect to the econom landscap befor the develop of last weekend  one thing that i kept hear was that uncertainti and caution in the busi communiti had increas in recent week and that they were caus mani firm to hold back on spend and commit to financi invest   but a number of my contact indic that the weak was not out of line with their earlier expect   on the plus side  i got the impress that  with the except of hous  there are not mani excess on the real side of the economi that need to be work off   notabl  i did not hear of inventori overhang or unus capac  and manpow even indic that their client had been care not to go overboard earlier in the hire cycl  and so we   re not left with bloat workforc   still  this sen ent and the incom data did not paint a pleasant pictur with regard to the nation outlook  as one of my director said  turn the common phrase against me  the econom problem that we are face appear to be remark resili   even befor last weekend   s event  the econom risk had increas somewhat   we had the larg rise in the unemploy rate  the recent weak consumpt data  and heighten caution by firm   now  of cours  the financi risk have increas substanti and further threaten the growth outlook   at a minimum  credit standard are like to tighten further and crimp spend  i   m not look forward to put a forecast togeth in octob   dave and the board staff have my sympathi and respect for do this each meet   it   s unfortun  dave  that we haven   t had the  e to spend talk about the excel special memo that you and your staff put togeth on gaug the effect stanc of polici   i thought that was veri help   i had on previous occas mention that it would be nice to have some marker that we could look at  and at least for me  that was quit help   now  it   s not a larg stretch to expect that inflationari pressur will reced  given what we   re face   we could see enough weaken in the econom outlook that the project slack in the economi will point inflat more clear down and below   percent over the medium term   just last week i was still a bit skeptic that these forc would be larg enough to achiev this disinfl   but we need to be forward look  and that would be how i would mark my inflat forecast down today  so what   this mean for polici today   i favor altern b   in my view  we   ve kept the polici rate low so that we would not be far from appropri polici if and when the risk to growth intensifi enough relat to the risk to inflat   so we are well posit to act if we need to   i agre with presid  n that  if we were to act  we should do someth signific on the order of    basi point   but i think we should be seen as make well calcul move with the fund rate  and the current uncertainti is so larg that i don   t feel as though we have enough inform to make such calcul today   we will know much more in a coupl of week  i hope at least about the chang in under financi condit  and will thus have a better sens of the risk to both element of the dual mandat and the associ polici action   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   the recent financi market news is shake peopl   s confid dramat   but even befor recent event  the evid was alreadi point to more effect of the financi crisi on the real economi than i had built into my project at our last meet   the report from my district contact and the incom data caus me to revis down my near term output project even befor the latest round of financi market troubl   the improv in net export that was reflect in the second quarter gdp growth has not encourag manufactur in my district to revis up their export project   they are still hold firm to the opinion that the global economi is slow and that export growth will slow with it for sever quarter   of cours  manufactur are concern about weak spread further within their domest custom base  the ongo turmoil in financi market continu to affect busi in my district  some of the bank in my district are find it veri  veri difficult to attract new capit and to manag their way out of troubl   i am hear that credit is harder to come by for mani borrow who in the recent past would not have thought twice about their creditworthi   last week i met with a busi contact with a veri long and success track record of buy and oper privat compani   he report that he had reach a deal with a bank to financ a project at a   percent interest rate with the loan amort over a fifteen year term   on the morn of the close just three day later  the bank fax him the paperwork  which reflect a    percent interest rate on a non amort loan with a    year term   so the deal obvious is not go forward   one of my director  who head a veri larg region bank organ  report at our board meet last week that mani bank are shed asset and that in some case they are walk away from longstand custom relationship in order to do so   he said that investor are veri skeptic about put new equiti into bank deal and that those who have done so in the past vow not to be burn twice  let alon a third  e  of cours  inflat remain an import issu as well   my contact  as dave mention in his report  are not so confid that a broad array of intermedi and retail price are actual go to move back down as a result of the recent declin in energi and other commod price   sever of my contact report that major supplier are tri to maintain their price despit the declin in raw materi cost just to make up for a long period of absorb price increas   nevertheless  most of my contact agre that the commod price environ has stabil consider  make me more confid that core inflat will gradual slow over the next coupl of year  at our last meet  my forecast was broad consist with the  book baselin  today my forecast for output and price are broad similar to the  book   s for      and       although i am expect more weak in econom activ in the second half of this year than the  book is forecast   my contact in the manufactur sector have persuad me that export are go to be weaker in the short term than i had previous thought  and i have also revis down my consumpt path on the basi of the credit constraint on household   although i am more encourag about the recent declin in energi and commod price  i would like to see further evid of price stabil in these market and also continu stabil in inflat expect for a while longer befor i reduc the upsid risk that i place on my inflat outlook   howev  a grow risk to my outlook is that the short term weak that i have now built into my outlook extend further out into the forecast period   i worri that my outlook  sn   t fulli captur all of the mani way in which financi forc at work in the economi are actual go to restrain spend  on friday  i was convinc that the best cours of action was to keep an even keel in these rough sea   to be flexibl  of cours  but to look beyond the latest wave crash over the bow  onli six week ago  inflat risk were on the verg of be unaccept  and today the troubl of wall street are the focus   i was sure that we were go to be in for mani more surpris  i just didn   t know when and from where they would be come   so i support not onli keep our polici unchang but also keep our languag chang to a minimum even if that languag miss some nuanc of the outlook   given the event of the weekend  i still think it is appropri for us to keep our polici rate unchang   i would like more  e to assess how the recent event are go to affect the real economi   i have a small prefer for the assess of risk languag under altern a   i think it captur my concern that the downsid risk have intensifi  howev  i can support some of the comment and chang to highlight the financi market strain that were made by presid   and presid  n   so i can support the languag under altern b with some addit comment about the financi strain that we are face   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be brief   the fifth district hasn   t chang much  it pretti well align with the nation outlook   on the nation outlook  i find myself  all except for the polici path  align well with the staff   there have been a lot of econom report sinc the last meet about particular categori of spend or particular sector of the economi  but they net out to onli a small chang  if ani  in the broad contour of the outlook for me for overal growth   i expect it to be sluggish for the remaind of the year with recoveri begin at some point in the first half of next year   i   ll commit the sin of say that uncertainti is especi high now   there seem to be reason plausibl risk in the outlook in virtual everi spend categori and  in mani case  on both side of the outlook  about inflat  so far our credibl has help to prevent a pickup in compens growth   in fact  it   s hearten that compens growth is come in a littl below expect in respons to the energi price shock this year   this has allow us to accomplish the inevit declin in real wage without set off an inflationari acceler in wage rate   but we   re still in the midst of an upsurg in core inflat  which the  book expect is go to tick up near   percent this quarter   as i said befor  i think it   s critic import for us to emerg from this episod without trend inflat ratchet upward  and i   m not sure we can take the forecast moder for grant   inflat compens has been well contain  and that has been hearten   but i have also said this befor   i think the current level of five year  five year forward inflat compens seem more consist with a trend abov     percent than it   with a   percent trend   so i   m not convinc that there   s go to be much gravit pull down from an elev rate onc core rise   at the veri least  i think there   s some uncertainti about that  for financi market  this is yet anoth histor week  as presid   remark   i think the question face financi market particip  the uncertainti they face  can be use partit into three broad categori   one is the aggreg magnitud of fundament loss that the financi sector face   anoth is the locat of those loss   where they are go to pop up within financi intermediari sector   the third is the likelihood and the magnitud of fiscal transfer in the form of government support for particular firm   i think the weekend   s event have caus financi market particip to revis their assess of the futur   it seem to me at this earli date in the process that the revis in the outlook has had more to do with the latter two categori than with the aggreg size of fundament loss we have come down the pipelin  that is to say  it   s about where they   re pop up  which firm are affect and are go to be hit  and about the likelihood of govern support  what we did with lehman i obvious think is good   it has had an effect on market particip    assess of the likelihood of other firm get support  and i think you would have to attribut at least some of chang in equiti price to that   we   re like to see a lot more disrupt this week and in the day go forward than we   ve seen so far   i don   t want to be sanguin about it  but the silver line to all the disrupt that   s ahead of us is that it will enhanc the credibl of ani commit that we make in the futur to be will to let an institut fail and to risk such disrupt again   on the other hand  if the disrupt prove less sever than we expect  the silver line is that that will strengthen our hand in the futur as well   howev  i would note that i don   t think that what we did with lehman has set a clear and firm boundari on the circumst under which govern support is like to be forthcom   all the languag around not support lehman was of a one off natur   so i   m not sure about the extent to which we   ve diminish uncertainti about the likelihood of support go forward  and i think that such uncertainti is like to exacerb financi volatil in the month ahead until we can make more progress on articul a reason principl polici on when we   re go to interven and when we   re not  or at least enhanc clariti about that  overal  i don   t take what   s happen in the last few day as chang much   it   s not obvious to me what the implic are for the outlook for inflat and growth  at least at this point   so i don   t see a reason to deflect from our polici path at this point   i can support stand pat with the fund rate today   i think that   s a good idea   i think  look forward  that we will want to rais rate sooner rather than later if core inflat  sn   t moder   i think we   re more like to requir a path more like the august  book than the current one   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    i have a question   i realli would like your advic on this   histor  if we look at situat like japan and scandinavia  ul  there come a point at which the bank system is decapit and dysfunct and the govern interven on a larg scale   those intervent have been veri expens  but in those case i mention  they have general restor the bank system to health and have help the economi recov   what   s your view on the right sequenc   do you think that we should remain veri tough until such  e as it becom inevit that fiscal intervent is need   do you think that we should avoid fiscal intervent at all stage   i   m serious interest in know what you  or anyon els who would like to comment  think is the appropri stage  if ani  at which fiscal intervent becom necessari
we have a legisl program of fiscal intervent   deposit insur   and the boundari around that are veri clear   which liabil are insur and which one are not are veri clear   around the edg there   s some lack of clariti about what least cost resolut mean and the extent to which deviat from that can be verifi  and that provid some room for the feder deposit insur corpor to deviat from that and implicit to forbear to some extent  but even that is sort of a well contain and well defin govern support   that   s what the congress has enact  and it   s not clear to me whether we should go beyond that   japan got down to deposit insur   scandinavia did  too   that seem like a natur benchmark
but i think this is a histor fact   that  onc the bank becam decapit  there were also capit inject into the bank in both of those case
sure   those were fiscal action
and the fdic   exact that when it resolv a fail institut
mr  chairman  i have thought about this consider becaus i think we have come to a  e in our histori when we have institut that clear ought to be and may in fact be too big to fail   i think we tend to react ad hoc dure the crisi  and we have no choic at this point   but as you look at the situat  we ought  instead of have a decad of deni too big to fail  to acknowledg it and have a receivership and intervent program that extend some of the concept of the fdic but goe beyond that   that is  if you are insolv  it is not a central bank issu   we are a liquid provid   and therefor the govern come in   but unlik the gses  everyon has to take some hit   the equiti holder  certain the prefer stockhold  also the subordin debt holder  and perhap the senior one   by assum a certain amount of loss  they would have immedi access to   pick a number      percent   the research would help us pick that number  and they can have access  but the rest becom a subordin subordin posit after the liquid so that you have still a sens of market disciplin in play and you don   t get the system game it in that  if you know there   s a bailout come  you buy the debt and sell the equiti short to make a bundl   i think therein lie the distort that are absolut detriment to the long run health of the economi  regard how we go forward  i think we are go to have mani lesson from this   part of the problem has been veri lax lend and  obvious now  weak in some of the oversight  also a histori of our react from a monetari polici point of view to eas quick to tri to take care of the problem and  therefor  to creat a sens in the market of our support has rais some real moral hazard issu that we now need to begin to remedi as we look forward in deal with futur receivership   we are in a world of too big to fail  and as thing have becom more concentr in this episod  it will becom even more so
i certain agre   and the treasuri secretari and i have said public   that we need a strong  well defin  ex ant  clear regim   but we have the problem now that we don   t have such a regim  and we   re deal on a daili basi with these veri sever consequ   so it is a difficult problem
i think what we did with lehman was the right thing becaus we did have a market begin to play the treasuri and us  and that has some pretti negat consequ as well  which we are now come to grip with
i think it   s too soon to know whether what we did with lehman is right   given that the treasuri didn   t want to put money in  what happen was that we had no choic   but we took a calcul bet   if we have a run on the money market fund or if the nongovern tri parti repo market shut down  that bet may not look near so good   i think we did the right thing given the constraint that we had   i hope we get through this week   but i think it   s far from clear  and we were take a bet  and i hope in the futur we don   t have to be in situat where we   re take bet   it   highlight the need to look at the tri parti repo market  look at the money market fund industri  and look at how they   re financ   there are a lot of lesson learn  but we shouldn   t be in a posit where we   re bet the economi on one or two institut   that is the situat we were in last weekend   we had no choic   we did what we had to do  but i hope we will find a way to not get into this posit again
okay   presid
mr  chairman  it may surpris you that presid   and i agre   laughter  at least with the recommend  as i do with the major   i also agre firm with presid hoenig     want to know a littl more about houston  so i will start out with that  and then i   ll quick go to the polici matter  the storm devast galveston and beaumont   their combin popul is          the popul of the greater houston area is     million   the damag to houston was moder  the overal effect on the texa economi should be relat mild   we still expect employ growth this year of     percent or so  plus or minus  even though the storm realli hit hard an area that account for    percent of our employ and    percent of our output   in term of the nation impact  i think it   s import to understand that the energi infrastructur took minor loss  the short term function of that infrastructur is hamper by power loss and water problem  gasolin price have gone up becaus     million barrel a day  or rough    percent of the u s  refin capac  has been shut down   by the way  that affect the spot market   i think that   s some of the reason you   ve seen this weak recent   and mayb the near term futur market   if you look at the gasolin price market  the gasolin price went up anoth    cent ye day  but the near futur market is down    cent   i think it reflect expect that  onc power is restor  the refineri will come back on line about a week later   so we will like have a temporari bump up in inflat due to the gas price   but i think it is import to realiz that this  unlik katrina  didn   t shut down the mississippi  and the effect on other commod price is like not to be signific  with one except   if you look  you   ll see that price of soybean and soybean oil have spike recent   clear  the weather has an impact  but i think that   s more suppli   demand imbal   someth that i   m watch care  the silver line  if there is a silver line to human tragedi  is probabl twofold   one is  if you notic  that lumber price are actual up this year  which is kind of odd in term of lumber trade   of cours  lumber produc are probabl pretti happi with the devast in our state  second  mexican labor will be veri happi if we let them into the countri becaus the hispan build most of our build in the unit state   but i would say that the storm should not have ani effect on nor should it alter our prefer polici direct  and i would like to talk about that veri quick  i have been affect in my think about econom growth and inflat by what i   m see oversea   i   m global orient   i do expect that we   re go to have less impetus from export  which were signific in carri our growth   our number show that  and your number     show that  and all of our convers have revolv around that   we were surpris on the upsid by it   now i think weaken econom growth elsewher is like to subdu that effect  we have also had an appreci of the dollar   oil price have declin   i dove deep in my anecdot explor with the major and also with all suppli compani   for whatev it   s worth  they are convinc that opec now has      rather than     as their benchmark   most of them expect price to slide down to somewher in the     rang   but over the longer term  whatev that term may be  we   re go to talk about      plus oil   then  of cours  mani commod price are off their peak   they have retrac signific   some entir  that said  in my anecdot interchang  i am still hear about the likelihood  as i think presid pianalto mention  that peopl are seek to preserv their margin   they   ve been stung for mani year  and i   ll just give you one case becaus i think it tell us someth   if you talk to the ceo of wal mart usa  what they are price to be on their shelf six to eight month from now has an averag price increas of    percent   now  of cours  you might have this revers as we go through  e   my biggest disappoint  incident  was that the one bakeri that i   ve gone to for thirti year  stein   s bakeri in dalla  texa  the best maker of not onli bagel but also anyth that has crisco in it   laughter  has just announc a price increas due to cost pressur   but i do think we have a mitig of inflat  and we also have a mitig of the impetus to econom growth  as to the current financi predica  i want to go back to a comment i made a long  e ago   this is not the first for me   i like to teas presid  n about his matur   i don   t go back to the panic of       but to herstatt        new york citi   s failur              and what happen in japan   incident  you see the same pictur repeat in everi newspap   it   s alway the trader hold his head or look up at the board   now it   s in color  it use to be black and white   i think it come from the same archiv  and it is repeat throughout  e    laughter  all of that remind me   forgiv me for quot bob dylan   but money  sn   t talk  it swear   when you swear  you get emot   if you blasphem  you lose control   i think the main thing we must do in this polici decis today is not to lose control  to show a steadi hand   i would recommend  mr  chairman  that we embrac unanim   and i think it   s import for us to be unanim at this moment   altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much   coffe is readi   whi don   t we take about thirti minut   i have a coupl of call to make   see you at about         coffe break
okay   if we   re readi  we can reconven   first vice presid cum
thank you  mr  chairman   in our forecast  we do show a downgrad in real activ in the near term sinc the august meet   downsid risk to the economi we see as still veri consider  and i would probabl say that they realli have increas quit a bit   i   ll say a few more word about that   i   ll also talk about the inflat front   we have long thought that inflat in the medium term will moder  and we   ve been take some comfort from recent develop that have been cite alreadi  on the weaker econom outlook  we see the intensif of advers growth come from mani thing mention alreadi   the unemploy rate increas and the likelihood that consum spend is go to be negat   i would put great stress also on indic that world demand is slow abrupt  as nathan mention   i think that all three of these thing are occur in an environ in which we have massiv correct  adjust  structur chang in auto  hous  and financi intermedi   that adjust is realli interconnect   one has effect on the other   as part of this   particular in the financi sector  i would say   in our senior loan offic survey we   ve seen indic that  even as rate in  say  the mortgag market start to eas a bit  nonpric term may still be tighten   presid pianalto talk about other area in which borrow are face much tougher term   as financi institut feel their capit is constrain   and there   s plenti of evid that balanc sheet are constrain across much of the financi sector   those kind of nonpric ration measur probabl will becom more evid  second  as we discuss earlier  we   ve seen that credit loss  which thus far have been larg confin to the financi sector and increas their sharehold  run some risk of spill over to other kind of investor  who to date realli have not felt that impact  such as money market fund investor  as mention earlier   in addit  the three big correct that we have seen in auto  hous  and financi intermedi are not limit to the unit state   in particular  as you know  sever g    countri are face veri difficult situat in their hous market  not much differ from us  and the financi intermedi adjust is truli a global correct  on the inflat side  as i mention  we have acknowledg that we   ve seen elev rate of inflat   but the recent develop   as we   ve seen in inflat expect discuss earlier  in energi and other commod price  the unit labor cost develop that presid   discuss  and the year over year chang in import price   are all point in the direct of some moder of inflat and moder of inflat expect   in particular  we have look at inflat expect as measur by financi market and feel that the declin that we see in those expect cannot be explain simpli by the drop in energi price and technic factor but look larger than that   we would attribut that to indic  again  that global demand is slow  come into this meet today  we favor altern b   i would associ myself with the comment of presid  n and presid    that if we were  in fact  go to make a move today  it would be better to make a larg move of    basi point   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think that  even befor the recent intensif of financi market turmoil  there were trend becom increas evid over the summer  sinc late june  that suggest that the economi was on a substanti slower path than it had been befor   resourc util was fall appreci  and the expect downward path of inflat in the futur had much better odd of occur   inde  i think that the expect weak in the economi and the financi market are interact   we have one of these feedback loop in play  there has been a lot of concern not onli in the unit state but in other countri as well  as i heard in basel last weekend  about a spillov   that the problem were not confin to the mortgag market but were spill into the loan book of the bank   that was relat to the weaken in econom activ and was tighten up credit condit  which would  in turn  further weaken econom activ   so this feedback loop was at work certain in the unit state and was begin to be felt a littl more in other countri as well  sinc late june we have come to know a coupl of thing a littl better   one is that consumpt is not immun to soft labor market  increas in energi price  declin hous wealth  and tighter borrow condit   even if we can   t pars out the effect of each of these factor  consumpt has weaken substanti   we have had three month in a row of declin in the retail control compon and veri weak auto sale   although recent declin in oil price will support dispos incom and consumpt  i think the other sourc of restraint on household   declin hous price and tighter credit condit   are more like to intensifi than to abat in come quarter  anoth thing we know is that busi have not gotten ahead of their need to shed labor  and they continu to trim staff in respons to actual and expect weak in demand   the declin in employ show no sign of abat   initi claim are run more than        higher than they were at the end of june  and they have remain elev past the  e that the introduct of the temporari extend benefit should have been felt   the unemploy rate is alreadi   percentag point higher than anyon around this tabl predict for the end of the year   the household survey  along with nation incom statist  could be signal greater soft in activ and higher output gap than is evid in the gdp and spend data  anoth thing we have learn  as nathan emphas  is that foreign economi have not decoupl from the unit state  and their prospect have been revis down substanti  they   re absorb the effect of weaker u s  domest demand on their export  and grow risk avers in financi market is spread abroad   the latter  the grow risk avers  is begin to have  as chris cum was note  effect on a number of emerg market economi  where capit inflow show sign of abat or even revers  and indic of financi stress have risen as a consequ of all this   becaus of the stronger dollar  we will be abl to reli less on export go forward than we did befor  we never expect a rapid return to more normal financi market function  but the adjust in the financi sector now look to be more sever and to take longer than we thought befor   financi firm need to bol  profit to offset loss and track capit   they need to de lever by reduc debt relat to equiti   they need to consolid  and abov all  they need to protect themselv against the possibl of a run   all of this impli a prolong period of veri cautious lend and a high cost of capit for borrow relat to benchmark interest rate   if the current sever financi situat persist  i think the flight to safeti and liquid could dri up credit to a broad array of all but the veri safest borrow and reduc asset price with feedback on spend  and that feedback loop could intensifi if these market condit pertain   i think that   s a substanti downsid risk to the growth outlook  not all news affect spend has been negat   capit good order have held up   the declin in interest rate and commod price that respond to the markdown in global growth will help support domest demand  and action to stabil the gses are help the mortgag market  activ is more like to stagnat than to declin   but i think that we can be more certain than we were  say  at the end of june that the economi will move substanti away from our high employ object over the next sever quarter and that the downsid risk to that are larger  on the inflat side  incom data have been disappoint  a littl wors than anticip  perhap suggest greater pass through   the rise in import price at the begin of the third quarter was higher than anticip   but we   ve also learn over the last coupl of month that oil and other commod price can go down as well as up   the drop in retail energi price help to revers much of the run up in inflat expect at the household level and reduc inflat compens in financi market at least over the next five year   weaker economi  along with lower commod price  are expect to reduc inflat in our trade partner  and that along with the dollar should lower import price inflat   the broadest measur of labor compens avail through the second quarter continu to suggest no upward pressur on the pace of increas in nomin labor cost   despit elev headlin inflat  surpris good growth of product is hold down unit labor cost   take all of this togeth  i think that  despit the incom inflat data  we can have greater confid in our forecast that inflat will declin late this year and run much lower in the next few year than in the past year or so  though the risk to that still lie on the upsid until we actual see the declin in headlin inflat persist  on polici  mr  chairman  i support altern b  keep the fund rate at   percent   i think that  at least for now  is consist with lower inflat and a slow return to full employ in the futur over  e   we need to assess the effect of the financi turmoil   if asset price declin acceler and the tighten of financi condit is larg and like to be sustain  i would be open at some point in the futur to a lower of interest rate   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me do three thing   i   ll talk first about a modal forecast but probabl give it short shrift  second  about financi market condit  and third  about polici   work under the assumpt that our modal forecast  sn   t look quaint a week from now  if the world were somehow to hew to a reason moder view of how financi market condit work go forward  person i   d be a bit more op ist than the  book for the second half of         i think that the net export growth is like to prove stickier than embed in that forecast in spite of a stronger dollar and weaker global demand   but as we get to      and       i would actual be less rosi than the  book   i don   t see real catalyst for the economi to normal and to approach trendlik growth   key uncertainti around financi market  labor market  and hous and  i think  broader macroeconom uncertainti that i   ve discuss befor in term of trade polici  tax polici  and regulatori polici  would make the creep back to potenti slower than embed in those forecast  on the inflat front  i continu to be encourag by the strength in the exchang valu of the dollar and the work that is do for us on import price inflat   i   m encourag by the move down across a breadth of commod   not just energi  metal  and food but realli across the entir basket   but i   m still not readi to relinquish my concern on the inflat front  let me turn now to financi market condit   i have talk befor about the financi architectur   i guess what we can say today with more confid than i   ve been abl to say befor is that the dismember of the exist financi architectur has acceler in the last few day and week  and we will veri quick look at busi model  and industri will find new busi model  we hope  to provid credit to the real economi   financi market have been test financi institut with weaker capit structur  uncertain manag team  and unsustain busi model   i think the question befor us today that   s hard to judg is whether financi market are now to the point at which they are act indiscrimin  test all financi institut regardless of capit structur or busi model   i   d say that the evid of the past twenti four or forti eight hour is still unclear   i think we   ll have a greater clariti sever day from now about whether market are abl to make the distinguish judgment that we would count on  look at the cds spread for the two remain independ broker dealer  goldman sach and morgan stanley  which bill referenc   goldman sach   s cds move up anoth     or so this morn   they are up     in the last two day   morgan stanley   s are up       i wouldn   t want to say whether those number are right or wrong   it may be that the busi model is a fail one   that is  wholesal fund is no longer practic in the world that we   re now in   if the problem were confin to that part of the financi servic industri  it would be tough and it would be ugli and  if you were a resid of new york  particular pain   but i don   t think it would rise to the level that would forc us to recalibr monetari polici   but if  in fact  those loss end up be endem to all financi institut  even those with strong deposit base and higher capit ratio  then we certain would have to take that into consider   the few that are tri to swim against this tide are flail  and without extraordinari action either by a consortium of their competitor or by the offici sector  they   re like to continu to fail   i think our effort to date to protect the broader financi market and the economi from knock on effect in particular financi servic sector do seem to be help to cushion the blow   but the prospect of some meaning discontinu and of some system risk remain real  and it   s hard for me to judg today whether that prospect is as low as we might have thought even some week ago  ul   the question for the real economi is whether the emerg of this new financi architectur can come quick enough to get credit market to normal   is the sudden of event in the last week go to acceler the move toward a new financi architectur   will the forc of creativ destruct make that fa  but ul  bring credit back to these market sooner   are these forc so strong and overwhelm that all financi institut will be hunker down  cling to an architectur that no longer work   that   s a question to which i don   t know the answer  a coupl of more point on market   i think the work that was done over the past few day on lehman brother should make us feel good in one respect   market function seem to be work okay   by which i mean that the plumb around their role in the tri parti repo busi  due in part to the fed   s action  seem to be work   it   s ugli   the backroom offic of these place are go crazi   there   s a lot of manual work be done   so they wouldn   t give it high mark   but it look as though posit are be sort out in a tough workmanlik way  and so that   s encourag  other than the cds move and the equiti move on the other broker dealer  goldman sach and morgan stanley  i don   t think that that is the real specter that   s cast some question over broader financi institut   i think the lehman situat  no matter what judgment we made this past weekend about whether or not to provid offici sector money  is not what is drive market broad outsid of the invest bank   what   s drive the broader uncertainti are question about institut like aig that were rate aaa  that were so strong that counterparti didn   t need collater  and that were a certain bet to be a guarantor around stabl valu fund and all sort of other product   if in a matter of week that aaa rate and that secur could turn out to be worthless  then that would forc institut to evalu two thing   first  narrowli  how much aig exposur do i have   second  more broad  if that   s aig  what about the rest of the insur compani   what about the rest of the financi institut  which aren   t invest bank but are realli repres the foundat of the u s  financi system   so it is both those direct and indirect aspect that we have to tri to understand as best we can   my own view is that the aig question would be more financi devast if these institut turn out to be meaning insolv but actual  in some way  less market disloc among intermediari   that is  lehman brother  merril lynch  and bear stearn are touch and are in the middl of mani more flow of data  and there are real loss be felt   but if an aaa compani like aig were realli fundament insolv  the direct loss to a rang of institut  particular those that are not just wholesal institut but are retail institut  could be veri signific   i don   t think we know the answer yet to the question of whether aig speak to a broader loss of confid that could affect the foundat of the u s  financi system  let me turn final to polici  mr  chairman   i support altern b and  base on some of the discuss from presid   and  n  i   d make some simpl suggest that may strike a balanc that acknowledg the concern we have about financi market but  sn   t put us in the posit where we are inclin to lurch in one direct  which as some peopl suggest could creat more uncertainti than we intend   my suggest  mr  chairman  would be to take the first sentenc from altern a  paragraph        strain in financi market have increas signific and labor market have weaken further      and make that the first sentenc of altern b   then strike the second sentenc of altern b  becaus i think we   ve larg cover that   that order give proper attent  it strike me  to the financi market develop  final  in the assess of risk  mr  chairman  if you look at the last sentenc  i would suggest modifi that ever so slight by insert the word    close    and make one other modif  so that last sentenc would read     the committe will continu to monitor econom and financi develop close and will act as need to promot sustain econom growth and price stabil      also  if you think it   s accept  rather than say    financi develop    mayb there we would say     the committe will continu to monitor econom and financi market develop close      those would be my suggest to tri to strike that balanc   that we are keen focus on what   s go on  but until we have a better view of it implic  we are not go to act   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   sinc the last meet  there have obvious been a number of flare up in the fire that have been burn in the financi market   the gses and then certain what   s come this past weekend and what   s like to come over this week and into the futur   a number of peopl have mention thing rang from aig to pressur on money market fund to some larg financi institut   there are some veri larg region bank and a veri larg thrift that will be face a lot of challeng as the uncertainti in the market continu   i won   t repeat what governor kohn said about the continu pressur on the bank balanc sheet   i think it is import to take into account that those pressur will be there go forward not onli on u s  institut but also increas on intern institut   no one has mention ub yet  but that   s anoth institut about which there   s a lot of concern  and if you look at cds quot there  they are skyrocket also   much as governor   said  i think that peopl are worri about what the next shoe to drop will be and whom we have to challeng   whom do we have to get more inform about to make us feel comfort   if that sudden becom everyon  then of cours the market don   t function  i just want to focus quick on consumpt and consum credit market and then on inflat  and then i   ll conclud   we have made some refer to how consum have act in the past and whether they will continu to act this way   in some sens the consum has been on a marathon sinc the earli     s  face an incred amount of shock   a lot of contract in       signific declin in stock market wealth  septemb     corpor govern scandal  sustain job loss  and low real incom growth   nonetheless  the consum continu to consum   but now the consum seem to be flag   we have perhap a veri modest effect of the s ulus  which obvious can lead to negat payback for the rest of the year   so a drag go forward as well as drag from hous and stock market wealth  continu job loss  rise unemploy  and pressur on incom   although mani of these shock were similar to one that happen earlier in the decad  it seem that consum do not have the same resili now that they did at one point   it   s not surpris that  after have run this marathon  they   re go to be a bit tire  part of it could also be the credit condit that are put much more pressur on them  just to give you an anecdot report  but it   s from one of the largest provid of consum credit in the economi   after stabil basic through our fomc meet in august  we   ve seen some signific deterior in delinqu and in the perform of those who get into delinqu   they roll right to full chargeoff much more rapid   so we have seen not exact a qualit chang but a signific deterior   also  the abil to securit credit card has chang dramat   after our have open the window and the market have open up in the second quarter  they basic haven   t been abl to do anyth in the third quarter  and that   s befor this weekend   obvious that   s not go to be help them  of cours  there are some offset factor that can help the consum   the veri signific declin in mortgag rate has led to quit a respons  accord to this veri larg provid of consum credit in the unit state   the number of applic for mortgag  particular for refi  has doubl over the last coupl of week   so peopl do respond to price  and that can help to eas some of their incom burden   obvious  the reduct in energi price and mani food price is help on that  but of cours  what has been good news for u s  consum may not be good news for intern consum   as a lot of peopl have mention  the rest of the world is see a veri signific slowdown   i think the elev commod price had help to mask a lot of the under fiscal and structur problem in these economi  actual much like rise hous price in the unit state had mask the problem in underwrit standard and what was go on in the mortgag market   so i think there are go to be signific challeng in a lot of countri around the world   the boost that we had earlier this year from the intern sector is someth we can   t reli on  on inflat  we   re hearten by some of the lower energi price   but i want to relat one anecdot   in a meet at the oecd  the ceo of one of the largest privat oil produc in the world was ask what refer price he use becaus obvious he has to make ten of billion of dollar of decis on invest and so they thought here   s someon who would realli have a good notion of what the price of oil would be go forward   without hesit the person respond           plus or minus           laughter   that kind of uncertainti from someon who is realli in the market and make those kind of decis show us that we have a reason degre of uncertainti in inflat pressur go forward   that said  i think the  book forecast is where i would be also  although we   re at uncomfort elev level now   there are a lot of reason to believ that  although they may be even a bit more elev in the come quarter  there are like forc to bring thing back down   this is particular credibl in the context of both survey base and market base expect be quit contain  the market base expect be at the low of the year or even over the last coupl of year  so this bring me to support altern b for no chang today   on the statement  i do believ that some greater recognit of the stress would be valuabl   i think it would be valuabl to have someth in the first sentenc of paragraph   that focus on the strain   perhap just a singl sentenc about the strain   and then we can put the other piec on consumpt and hous into the next sentenc   it is import in the final paragraph to leav our option open if we do see signific negat feedback effect so that we can make a move that wouldn   t be a shock to the market but it also wouldn   t be someth that the market could bank on   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor duke
thank you  mr  chairman   i continu to focus on the tradit commerci bank structur   i look at two larg retail bank  three region bank  and three communiti bank  and two thing came out of this   first  capit is drive everyth  and the amount of capit that the bank need is now be driven more by the analyst and the rate agenc than it is anyth that the regul are do   the bank feel as though they have done everyth they can do in term of capit manag   they   ve quit buy back stock   they   ve cut their dividend  they   ve reduc expens   there is no more capit avail in extern market   not common stock  not prefer  not anyth   one bank did issu some prefer stock through it own network and a common stock issu   interest sort of snuck it into the market   they dribbl it out in small amount becaus they found that  as soon as the market determin that they were go to need to issu capit  they start to short the stock  figur they could buy it back   so they did almost a revers stock buyback  the market are fragil to dead   so what are they go to do   the onli thing they can do is contract the balanc sheet and not lend   befor i get to that  there was again discuss in sever of the convers about nake short sell   one bank report had     percent of total outstand in short interest  and that seem odd to me   so i went and check it this morn  and it turn out that it was not     percent   it was onli    percent   but if you subtract out the stock that was own by the offic and the director  then it was over     percent   anoth bank said that the rule in the disclosur that surround long posit have to be replic somehow in short posit becaus they   re have just as much control over what happen in the fate and the manag of the firm  so what are they do in term of credit   ani heavi use of credit or predomin use of credit are just not be done   this elimin all commerci real estat   they   re activ tri to move that off their book   particip loan  in which the particip get onli the credit piec  are dri up   those aren   t avail   no bank has ani interest in go back into residenti construct lend   one larg bank said they were approv onli one third of the consum credit that they would have approv a year ago   the secondari market for jumbo for takeout on commerci are nonexist  and one bank told me that  with the current cost of capit and cost of fund  the breakeven spread for a loan was     basi point over libor   that   s the new lend market  and i don   t see it get ani better until some capit is avail  the credit qualiti side is actual a better stori   first  except for residenti real estat  it   s realli still pretti good   c i lend is hold up extrem well   in commerci real estat  again  outsid of residenti develop  thing are realli look pretti good   some small retail center are show soft with the small storefront  and in area like michigan  they   re worri about lose the anchor tenant   other than that  everyth is okay   the other consum credit feel like a mild recess but  again  is normal cyclic   home equiti is aw   the bank origin loan rang from good   one institut had        loan with    past due   to perform similar to unsecur credit   the broker origin loan  especi the later vintag  are     percent loss  within the mortgag  the rate of acceler in new past due has slow down   about reject  i ask them to project when the new delinqu would be offset by the resolut of exist delinqu  and they said somewher between year end      and mid        so we are move through that process   the sever  howev  continu to grow as hous price declin   it   appear that the portfolio lender are get their arm around the collect and the loss mitig effort   they   re assign resourc  account  and prioriti   it look as though they are final set up to do a pretti good job on that  manag it on sever front   the analysi of the issu  the earli stage collect  contact  and loss mitig   and actual assign a permit spend  if you will  to resolv the loan   foreclosur are go to take a lot longer and are particular affect by state law   appar in florida it take a year to get a properti in foreclosur   so those foreclosur are go to happen over a fair long period of  e  i ask about a bottom  and they said they do feel as though they   re see bottom in some market   ohio and coastal area in california  although not inland   las vega and atlanta are overbuild  but the in migrat will absorb it   florida is a bottomless hole   specul combin with insur problem   in arizona so much land was avail that they can   t find a bottom there   regard lot inventori  a communiti banker in omaha said they had seven year of inventori in term of lot  which i thought was pretti startl until i read in the american banker the same stori in atlanta and the same stori in orlando   so i think when residenti develop   resum  it will be to work out the lot inventori   also  the phantom inventori is at least as larg as the current inventori   phantom inventori be defin as peopl who want to sell but don   t want to sell in the current market   ask to compar current credit metric with those in the     s and     s  one contact said they peak in      at     percent nonperform   now they are at        i found a chart  and for the entir industri  nonperform were   percent in        they   re     percent right now   so the credit metric are just nowher near what they were in the s l crisi for the industri  i came out of that realli believ that  if we are go to do someth  we need to address the avail of capit to commerci bank but we should leav the bad loan in the bank becaus they   re get to the point where the portfolio lender are do a good job of work through these loan   to tri to take them out and put them into anoth structur  we would just have to replic that whole gear up process   i don   t necessarili think that   s the case with the servic  particular the servic of privat label mortgag   that   s someth on which i know we   ve done some research here  and i want to investig that a bit more to see if there   s someth to be known there  in term of the polici  i  too  would favor altern b with some chang in the languag to paragraph     thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much  and thank  everyon  for veri help comment   let me tri to summar  and i will just make some comment  and then we can turn to the statement and polici  the group indic  of cours  that econom growth has slow and look to be quit sluggish in the second half   i didn   t hear a great deal of chang in the general profil  with most peopl still view growth as be slow in the near term but perhap recov somewhat in        but obvious there is a lot of uncertainti surround that judgment   the ongo problem in hous and the financi system are  of cours  the downsid risk to growth  anoth factor  which is becom more relev  is the slow global economi  which togeth with the stronger dollar may mean that u s  export growth will be somewhat less   despit the tax rebat  consum spend seem like to be weak in the near term  reflect a varieti of factor that we note befor  includ hous and equiti wealth  credit condit  and particular perhap the ongo weak in the labor market   the labor market is deterior  with unemploy up  although ui program may play some role in the unemploy rate   it is somewhat difficult to predict the peak of the unemploy rate  given the upward momentum we are see   declin in energi price  howev  will improv real incom and help consum sen ent   so that is a potenti posit factor  the hous sector continu to be the central concern in the economi  in both the real and the financi side   there are no clear sign of stabil  although obvious region condit vari consider   the govern action regard the gses has lower mortgag rate and may be of some assist   credit condit have tighten  though  in other area as well  includ nonresidenti construct  firm are continu to struggl with weaker demand  higher uncertainti  and high cost  manufactur has been relat stabl to weaker  but we had at least one report of a survey that in the medium term the outlook is look a littl better   inventori appear to be relat well manag   credit condit for busi vari  but there are indic that some firm are find it veri difficult to attract capit  financi market receiv a lot of attent around the tabl   condit clear have worsen recent  despit the rescu of the gses  the latest stressor be the bankruptci of lehman brother and other factor such as aig   almost all major financi institut are face signific stress  particular difficulti in rais capit  and credit qualiti is problemat  particular in residenti relat area   one member note that it is not evid that market are clear differenti between weaker and stronger firm at this point  deleverag is continu  and securit market are moribund   credit term and condit are quit tight and may be a signific drag on the economi   howev  the medium term implic of the recent increas in financi stress for the economi are difficult to assess   we may have to wait for some  e to get greater clariti on the implic of the last week or so  on the inflat front  recent core and headlin number have been high  reflect earlier increas in the price of energi and raw materi   there are posit factor  includ the signific intermeet declin in the price of oil and other commod  which  if maintain  would bring headlin inflat down rather notabl by the end of the year or next year   the dollar has also strengthen   general speak  inflat expect  though noisi  have improv   we have seen a declin in tip breakeven and some declin in survey expect as well   but it was note that the five by five tip breakeven remain abov a level consist with long term price stabil   nomin wage growth has remain subdu so far  slack is increas  product has been strong  and therefor  unit labor cost are well control  again  all of these factor are posit in term of a better inflat pictur go forward   on the other hand  recent declin notwithstand  the cumul increas in commod price over the past year or so do remain larg  and there is some evid that these cost increas are be pass through into core price   commod price are extrem volatil  which make inflat veri difficult to forecast and make the inflat outlook  therefor  quit uncertain  wage could also begin to rise more quick as the economi strengthen   for all these reason  inflat risk are still in play and remain a concern for the committe   some particip reiter their concern that maintain rate too low for too long risk compromis our credibl and s ul inflat over the medium run   that is a veri quick survey of the comment   are there ani comment or question  if not  let me just make a few comment   person  i see the prospect for econom growth in the forese futur as quit weak  notwithstand the second quarter   s strength   i think what we saw in the recent labor report remov ani real doubt that we are in a period that will be design as an offici nber recess   unemploy rose     percentag point in four month  which is a relat rapid rate of increas   the signific of that for our deliber is  again  that there   seem to be some evid that  in recess regim  the dynam are somewhat more power and we tend to see more negat and correl innov in spend equat   so i think that we are in for a period of quit slow growth  that is confirm by what we are see in consumpt  which probabl would be quit negat if it weren   t for the remaind of the fiscal s ulus packag   other compon of demand are  likewis  quit weak   we are all familiar with the hous situat   some other factor that were support in q  are weaken   a number of peopl have note the export growth   actual  it is net export   which is import   not just export  and we are see both slow growth in export and some forecast of increas growth in import  a factor that we haven   t talk about much is the fiscal side   that has been support and may be less support go forward   general speak  though  i do think   and i have said this for a long  e   that the credit effect will be import   they oper with a lag   it is veri difficult to judg the lag   but my strong sens is that they are still some distanc from their peak  that they will begin to be felt outsid of hous  in nonresidenti construct  for exampl  in consum spend  and in invest  and that this is go to be independ of last week   s financi develop   i think that is go to be a major drag  probabl well into next year  there are a few posit  which give some hope of some improv next year   we have talk about energi and commod price as they relat to inflat  but of cours  the declin in energi and commod price is also a plus for consum and rais real incom and would be support of sen ent  as we have alreadi seen   there are a few posit indic here and there on the hous market  a few glimmer of stabil  particular in some region   i think that the gse stabil is go to be veri import   it has alreadi lower mortgag rate   it suggest that there will be a market for securit mortgag  and i think that is posit   so if i want to outlin an op ist scenario  it would involv stronger indic of stabil in hous  which in turn would feed into more confid in the financi sector and would lead over  e to improv in the broader economi  i do think that financi condit are a major concern   the situat right now is veri uncertain  and we are not by ani mean away from signific system risk   even if we avoid a major system event  the increas in risk avers  the pullback from all counterparti  the deleverag  the sale of asset   all of these thing are go to continu for some  e and are go to make the financi sector veri stress  which obvious will have effect on the economi  i have been grappl with the question i rais for presid    and i would be veri interest in hear other view either now or some other  e   the ideal way to deal with moral hazard is to have in place befor the crisi begin a well develop structur that give clear indic in what circumst and on what term the govern will interven with respect to a system import institut   we have found ourselv  though  in this episod in a situat in which event are happen quick  and we don   t have those thing in place  we don   t have a set of criteria  we don   t have fiscal backstop  and we don   t have clear congression intent   so in each event  in each instanc  even though there is this sort of unavoid ad hoc charact to it  we are tri to make a judgment about the cost   from a fiscal perspect  from a moral hazard perspect  and so on   of take action versus the real possibl in some case that you might have veri sever consequ for the financi system and  therefor  for the economi of not take action   frank  i am decid confus and veri muddl about this   i think it is veri difficult to make strong  bright line given that we don   t have a structur that has been well communic and well establish for how to deal with these condit   i do think there is some chanc   it is not yet larg  but still some chanc   that we will in fact see a much bigger intervent at the fiscal level   one is tempt to argu that by do more earlier you can avoid even more later  but of cours that is all conting and uncertain   so we will collect do our best to deal with these veri stress financi condit  which i don   t think will be calm for some  e  with respect to inflat  i accept the mani caveat around the tabl   i have to say that i think  on net  inflat pressur are less worrisom now   the last two meet have been veri posit in that respect   the declin in energi and commod price are quit substanti  natur gas  for exampl  has revers all of it gain of the year   steel scrap is down    percent in two month   we are see mani other indic that commod price realli have come down quit a bit   the dollar   s increas is also quit strike  and we have talk about wage  tip  and other factor   so i think overal i see at least the near term inflat risk as consider reduc   i do agre  though  with the point that were made that we may well see pressur on core inflat for a while longer  despit this morn   s reason benign number  the increas in commod cost  although they have been partial revers  have not been entir revers   certain over the last year to year and a half there is still a net substanti increas  which will show up as firm begin to pass through those cost  it is also the case  of cours  that we have seen a veri  veri sharp movement in commod price and the dollar   therefor  there is no logic reason whi that couldn   t be revers   clear  one problem we face is that the uncertainti about forecast commod price is so larg that it make our forecast exercis extraordinarili uncertain and mean that we need to be somewhat more care than we otherwis would be if we were back in the day of the texa railroad commiss  when we knew the price of oil six month in advanc   we don   t have that privileg anymor   so i think core inflat may be elev for a while   it may take a while for inflat to moder   everyth i say is conting on the dollar and commod trend not be strong revers   but if those thing are not revers  i think we will see some improv in inflat in the near term  i also agre with those who say that  when the  e come  we do need to be prompt at remov accommod   it is just as much a mistak to move too late and allow inflat  and perhap even financi imbal  to grow as it is to move too earli and be prematur in term of assum a recoveri   i think that is a veri difficult challeng for us go forward  and i acknowledg the import of that  which a number of peopl have note  so that is a quick summari of my view   let me just turn briefli  then  to polici   do we have the statement   let me just preview   i talk with governor    and he gave me now dure the break some of those suggest he made   as they fit close with other thing that peopl said around the tabl  we have made a version here that incorpor them   i   ll discuss that in just a minut    first  as a number of peopl have said  let me just say that i thought the memo that the staff prepar over the intermeet period was extraordinarili help   we have been debat around the tabl for quit a while what the right indic of monetari polici is   is it the feder fund rate   is it some measur of financi stress   or what is it   i think the onli answer is that the right measur is conting on a model   as presid   and presid   point out  you have to have a model and a forecast mechan to think about where the interest rate is that best achiev your object   it was a veri use exercis to find out  at least to some    the statement refer to here is append to this transcript  appendix     extent  how the declin in the fund rate that we have put into place is motiv   in particular  the financi condit do appear to be import both direct and indirect   direct via the spread and other observ that were put into the model and indirect in term of negat residu in spend equat and the like   the recess dynam were also a big part of the stori   i hope that what this memo   for us   again  i think it   s extraordinarili help   is to focus our debat better   as presid   point out  we realli shouldn   t argu about the level of the fund rate or the level of the spread   we should think about the forecast and whether our polici path is consist with achiev our object over the forecast period   i am sympathet to the general view taken by the staff  which argu that those recess dynam and financi restraint are import  that we are look at slow growth go forward  and that inflat is like to moder   base on those assumpt  i think that our polici is look actual pretti good   to my mind  our quick move earli this year  which was obvious veri controversi and uncertain  was appropri   their analysi also suggest that the amount of insur that we have is perhap limit  given that they take a risk neutral kind of model approach   have said that  i think they have also clear set out the condit and the framework in which we can debat go forward exact where we should be go   to the extent that those around the tabl disagre with the model or with the project  then that is the appropri way  it seem to me  to address our polici situat   so  again  i do veri much appreci that   it help me think about the polici situat   as i said  i think our aggress approach earlier in the year is look pretti good  particular as inflat pressur have seem to moder  overal i believ that our current fund rate set is appropri  and i don   t realli see ani reason to chang   on the one hand  i think it would be inappropri to increas rate at this point   it is simpli prematur   we don   t have enough inform   there is not enough pressur on inflat at this junctur to do that   on the other hand  cut rate would be a veri big step that would send a veri strong signal about our view on the economi and about our intent go forward  and i think we should view that step as a veri discret thing rather than as a    basi point kind of thing   we should be veri certain about that chang befor we undertak it becaus i would be concern  for exampl  about the implic for the dollar  commod price  and the like   so it is a step we should take onli if we are veri confid that that is the direct in which we want to go  therefor my recommend to the committe   and i will open it up for comment in a moment   is to keep the fund rate at it current level   i listen veri care to the convers around the tabl in term of the statement   i think it was presid    presid  n  and governor    among other  who talk about strengthen the languag on financi market   so the draft statement that you have in front of you is an attempt to make that chang   it has two chang relat to exist altern b   first  as governor   suggest  it revers the first two sentenc and so focus in the first sentenc on    strain in financi market have increas signific and labor market have weaken further     and then the rest of it is basic the same as it was   the other chang  which is in the last paragraph in the risk assess  is pretti small  but it is probabl worth consid   the word    close    has been ad to suggest  obvious  that we understand that the situat is chang rapid and that we are care follow condit as they evolv   kevin  we took your word    market    there   what was the rational for it
my sens is   and this is certain open for discuss   that we want the focus to be that we are realli watch market develop close   we are not tri to monitor the broader economi  which we might not be abl to measur too much   i will admit that we have    econom and financi market     with    close    modifi both of them  but the idea was to put the focus on the market side to a slight greater extent than we normal do
okay   so i think that   s use  although i do note that  all els be equal  there   s a slight barrier for make ani chang  and that one word is a chang  presid
i am sort of indiffer about this  but i don   t want to forget what governor duke was talk about   it   s not just financi market  it   s financi develop  we are also talk about the intern dynam of what is happen in the bank system and the credit contract you spoke of   so we lead off with financi market   i don   t want peopl to think we are focus onli on market   governor    i would disagre on that point   it   s a minor disagr  but i think it is overkil
all right   let me open it up for ani other comment on the statement or the polici action   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   it is realli just a question   what type of reaction do we think will be engend by insert    close      everybodi understand that we monitor financi develop veri care   so we are bring attent to this   will there be a presumpt that we are like to do someth intermeet or someth like that   i am not say that is wrong  but it is a question
i would say that the market will take it as a statement that is condit on what happen in market   if market get suffici bad  if there is some threshold of deterior  that can potenti provok an intermeet move is the way i think they would take it      would you agre with that
i agre   the fact that the first sentenc of the risk assess has a parallel treatment of the upsid and downsid risk may communic a bit the sens that you are not readi to eas immedi
okay   we will decid   we will take a vote on it  if necessari   presid
yes   i echo presid     s concern   my recollect is   and i haven   t consult the record recent   under your predecessor there was some phrase like    watch market develop close    that came to be wide understood as a signal of an intermeet move
i think it was    monitor close      is that what it was
monitor close    or some languag like that
yes     monitor close      mayb you   re right
yes  and that give me paus   then  about    market      like a lot of economist  i am will to constru the word    market    veri broad to includ intermedi mechan of all type and the market for commerci credit in  you know  dillon  south  ina    laughter   but i am not sure that market particip are go to take it that broad  they are go to take it in the sens of market in trade financi instrument and organ exchang and such   i just wonder if they are go to interpret it too close as wall street
okay   so the sen ent over here on this side is that nobodi think    market    is import   let   s get rid of    market      we   ll discuss    close     presid
i think    market    may be constru too narrowli   we don   t realli mean it that way  i don   t think
market    is alreadi gone   all right   other comment  suggest  or thought   governor
but i do think it is the delta  so it is the chang   by includ    close     i think the market are go to look veri close at that chang  and they are go to think that we are clear tri to convey someth with that   i just think we have to make sure that we feel comfort in do so   certain some peopl have suggest that they would be happi to move    basi point if they saw the market move  but i do think that that one particular word will get a lot of attent   not that it should  but i think it is go to be focus on   just as at one point we use the word    yet     and that got an enorm amount of attent  and this has two syllabl    laughter
unless you are from the south    laughter
the sad thing is that governor   is right   we have seventeen peopl debat over this word  and it actual   matter     anyon els want to weigh in   okay   i think my sens is that there should be a barrier  a bit of a hurdl  to chang  so i am lean toward stick with what we have   would that be okay  governor    do you think
on    close
get rid of    close
let me ask   and bill      without    close     how do you think the market will react to that
that you are not particular readi to chang your stanc of polici
i think the expect go in is  for most peopl  that you are not prepar to eas today  but if thing got realli dark from here you would   so the question is  how do you convey that with the right word   you need someth in between    close    and
i think the sen ent we are tri to suggest is watch wait   we are not indiffer  we are not clueless  we are pay attent  but we are not predispos   henc  governor kohn   s suggest
my suggest was to substitut    care    for    close      i agre that    monitor close    had this other connot  but i think we should be seen as pay more attent than usual   there might be anoth altern
the committe will care evalu econom and financi market develop      that mean you are on the case
well  it is not an analyt thing we are do   we are just watch close
keen   care
mr  chairman
yes   presid
includ    close     what   that impli about the opposit   i mean  are we go to be abl to take that out
well  we have done thing like    in a  e manner    and other kind of phraseolog
yes  but this is an adject
no  it   s an adverb
there goe my credibl    laughter   if we take it out  can we use the phrase without it
what we have done in the past is basic just use a new phrase
so that mean we have to throw this phrase out
mr  chairman  i would support    care
is that better   presid
just to be clear  we have gone a long way just now from it be a semant discuss to whether or not the committe want to hint at the possibl of a near term action   i do not have a problem with that   in fact  in my comment i suggest that the resolut of uncertainti might improv in the next coupl of week  but that seem to be the princip issu here  which i don   t realli recal us discuss in as much detail as we just have
no  you   re right   but there is anoth issu  which i think is the thing we   re concern about and which motiv the chang in altern b  paragraph    we don   t want the world to feel that we are not awak  that we are not pay attent   we know that veri unusu thing are go on in the financi market  and we are prepar  mayb not through monetari polici but through whatev mechan is necessari  to address that
right   so i fulli support that sen ent  and if you find the right word that captur it  that   s fine with me
other comment   presid
as long as we are throw monkey wrench into the languag  i think we do signal our concern   in paragraph    we put the veri first sentenc  which say     strain in financi market have increas signific      so we have acknowledg that at the veri top of this statement   so there is no go back on that   i am a littl concern about what move back    close    mean   anoth altern that i   ll throw out would be  rather than use    close     to say that    the committe will continu to monitor econom and financi develop     sever   that   s what it said last  e
well  that seem fine   we are monitor these thing   is this the fomc statement dictionari we are go to   is this the code book    laughter
ani other comment   all right   let me just ask for a straw vote     close     no    close     or    care      do we want    care      all right   is    care    more accept to those who are concern
it   s less of a code word   the intent was to loosen it up a bit but not revert to those code word that near promis intermeet action
we make note of this in the lexicon of fomc terminolog
the semiot class will begin as soon as the    laughter  all right      care      is that okay   i   m see nod   all right   governor
yes  sir
i   m close the dictionari
all right   so we are chang the last part of that sentenc  we are strike the word    market    and chang    close    to    care      ani other comment or thought on the substanc  sizzl  or market   or as   would say     moychandis      but he   s not here    laughter   all right   if not  ms
