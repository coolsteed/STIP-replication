thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were circul a few minut ago   the top panel on the first page graph three month cash deposit rate for the dollar and the euro as well as three month deposit rate three month and nine month forward   the u s  three month deposit rate   the solid red line   declin in anticip of an eas at the committe   s novemb   meet and fell further after the    basi point reduct in the target fed fund rate  while the three month forward rate track movement in the cash rate  the nine month forward rate diverg from the cash rate and actual rose about    basi point over the intermeet period  as mani in the market began to weigh the possibl that the end of the eas cycl had been reach   in recent day  the three month forward rate has fallen slight  react to some weaker than expect data  includ the ism data and the unemploy rate   meanwhil  deposit rate in the euro area also were declin steadili in the intermeet period  as the market increas anticip an eas move by the ecb at it decemb   meet  deposit rate in the euro area continu to fall in the past few day  in reaction to the ecb   s surpris    basi point cut in it minimum  refinanc rate   in contrast to the relationship between cash and forward rate observ in the unit state  forward rate in the euro area continu to trade at or below cash rate  suggest that market particip expect further eas by the ecb   u s  treasuri yield have fluctuat wide  tend to rise after the committe   s novemb meet as risk avers reced   but yield subsequ declin as  sever weak data report again attract flow into govern bond   the bottom panel of chart   show recent rate on the two year treasuri note along with the target fed fund rate   the yield on the two year note actual rose in the aftermath of the committe   s novemb meet  and the spread to the target fund rate widen to    basi point in late novemb  the widest such spread sinc earli juli   one of  the reason cite was the more posit sen ent trigger by the eas action itself  second  some particip view the elect result as posit   third  technic factor relat to posit of the two year note also may have play a role  final  as i note earlier  there was a sens that the novemb cut in the fund rate was perhap the last move in the eas cycl     the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix        urn to page    the situat in credit market has improv mark sinc the last meet   bid offer spread have narrow to more normal level  liquid is improv  and issuanc has reviv in recent week   spread relat to treasuri have narrow  in some case signific   as shown in the top left panel  the spread of mortgag back secur to treasuri declin onli slight sinc the last meet  but it had declin about    basi point sinc mid octob  to below     basi point   more pronounc has been the improv in invest grade corpor spread   shown in the top right panel   which declin from a recent peak of     basi point to about     basi point   the spread for high yield bond   the middl left panel   exhibit a similar narrow  fall from over       basi point to about     basi point   the embi  spread  driven in part by a recoveri in brazil  also narrow similar   anoth way to view the situat in the corpor debt market is to look at how  much of the outstand stock is trade at distress level   for this exercis  we arbitrarili defin distress invest grade bond as those trade at a spread over treasuri of     or more basi point  and we defin distress high yield bond as those with a spread of       basi point or more   as shown in the lower panel by the  red bar on the left  on octob    about    percent of the invest grade univers met that definit of distress   that percentag drop sharpli one month later in the day immedi after the committe   s meet  and it fell still more as of this past friday as shown by the   bar on the bottom left   as can been seen on the right side of the bottom panel  there has been improv in the high yield sector as well  though proportion not quit as much as in the invest grade sector   look at volatil across asset market   page     volatil measur have trend lower recent  but they have risen somewhat in recent day  coincid with the releas of some weaker than expect data   the s p     volatil index  or vix  fell from about    percent in earli octob to about    percent in late novemb  coincid with the ralli in the major index   in recent day  this volatil index rose again into the low   s as equiti price began to declin   interest rate impli volatil also fell sharpli over the intermeet period   the middl panel depict the impli volatil on eurodollar deposit futur contract   from  extrem elev level of between    and    percent in late octob  it fell sharpli in the day around the committe   s meet   even though it has drift back up to about    percent  still a relat high level for this contract  it is half the level of onli six week ago   final  twelv month foreign exchang volatil for the major currenc pair have remain low and short date volatil were lower still   in particular  the one month volatil of the euro dollar cross rate was briefli below   percent  as the currenc pair appear stuck near pariti   let me turn briefli to the behavior of the commerci paper market  as we approach year end   the top panel of page   graph a  p    a  p  spread from  septemb   to the end of februari for the year         and          for the   urrent year it show the spread from septemb          to date   the top panel depict this spread for thirti day paper on the left and for nineti day paper on the right   in        the black line   the spread between a  p  and a  p  spike sharpli in late novemb  trigger by the crisi in the california electr market   last year   the gold line   spread similar widen  affect by both the aftermath of septemb    and the enron crisi   to date this year   the red line   spread for both matur are onli slight wider  and market condit report are show none of the stress exhibit in the last few year   the bottom panel on page   graph commerci paper spread around the year   end relat to treasuri   the left side depict yield on nineti day a  p  paper relat to three month treasuri bill   the bottom right show the same relationship for a  p  paper   onc again the black and gold line repres the spread for the last two year  and the red line depict the spread for this year through last friday  the rate on a  p  paper has bare budg relat to treasuri  and that on a  p  paper has widen somewhat  though less than in previous year   the reduct in risk avers that help explain the narrow of credit spread is probabl relev here as well   but the other factor at work is the notabl shrinkag in the commerci paper market in the past year  as the most vulner issuer withdrew from the market and term out their debt   turn to page    european market have cope with weak data  lower forecast of futur growth  a weaken fiscal outlook in major countri  uncertainti about the stabil and growth pact rule  and   until last week   uncertainti about the willing of the ecb to eas polici to counter slow growth   european equiti market along with the u s  and other global market fell in septemb and earli octob befor recov somewhat   the german market lag  as the outlook regard the strength of the german bank system in the near term was view as particular bleak   despit that bleak  in the euro area bond spread narrow in line with global trend   the middl panel graph bbb rate and a rate bond relat to german ten year bund   the lower rate bbb bond in particular narrow sharpli in relat to bund   and issuanc in the euro area bond market    as shown in the bottom panel   revers cours in novemb  rough tripl from  octob   s depress level   final  turn to page    japanes market continu to be noth if not interest   the dollar yen exchang rate  though trade in a relat narrow rang recent  has been suscept to bout of short term choppi   comment by financ minist shiokawa eight day ago  suggest that an exchang rate of     to     per dollar was appropri  initi weaken the yen   mr  shiokawa back off in subsequ day  and the yen retrac it declin a bit  but on net it was modest weaker against most major currenc over the past month   market particip general still presum that the japanes author prefer a weaker yen  though so far the price action has been limit   the fact that the exchang rate has been stabl in the face of these comment is view by some as evid that statement by offici have littl effect beyond the veri short run   but other note that the volatil   as been low for anoth reason   becaus the bush administr has not engag in a tit for tat public exchang and reaction to comment by japanes offici  such as those made by shiokawa   accord to this view  it was those type of back and   forth exchang that made market nervous in previous year   in the fix incom market  the ten year japanes govern bond  jgb  yield has been stuck at around   percent despit the uncertainti about the takenaka plan  which involv the potenti for signific higher issuanc of jgbs   inde  the jgb curv has trend down dure        the middl panel depict two snapshot of the jgb yield curv   as of januari   of this year and as of ye day   the entir curv is lower  especi at the long end where thirti year yield are about    basi point below their level at the begin of the year   final  neither the bank of japan   s announc of it equiti purchas plan in septemb nor the takenaka plan has so far inspir confid among equiti investor   the nikkei index has trade most below      in recent week  a level that is thought to be problemat for portfolio of mani bank and insur   the bank of japan began it equiti purchas from bank on novemb     these purchas in the aggreg could be rather modest at about   trillion yen   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv our domest oper   and i   d be happi to take ani question
question for dino   governor bernank
dino  on the mortgag back secur chart on page    i wonder if the sharp declin might reflect a declin in refinanc risk   or do you think they reflect the same consider of all the risk that appli to other kind of debt
i think the lower refinanc risk probabl were a factor  but the mortgag market is rather complic  and the option in mortgag is someth that obvious is hard to predict   it   s difficult to disentangl the refinanc aspect of the mortgag market from  the broader trend that were narrow spread more general
other question   if not  vice chairman
move approv of the domest oper    hairman  span   without object   thank you  veri much   let   s turn now to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   i was impress at the last meet with the creativ languag use by mani member of the committe to describ the econom outlook   so this morn i thought i   d tri my hand at explain the forecast use some of that languag   to begin with the current quarter  i can report that   as the say appar goe   there has been about as much pumpkin as we had earlier anticip though there is clear less pumpkin now than in the third quarter
it turn out to be seedi    laughter
the stori of our longer term project should be familiar  though we believ that there was a littl jam ye day and that there is some jam  today  we would have to admit that in the project it   s still most jam tomorrow  the inflat pictur also is about unchang  everyth at the dollar store still cost a dollar   with respect to the risk to the outlook  we think we see light at the end of the tunnel  but we   re nervous about the fact that  whatev the light is  it seem to be get brighter while we are stand still   i apolog for not cite all of the color metaphor that seem to be guid your deliber at the last meet  and even more so for now return to my own plod prose   in fact  there   s not a great deal more to be ad   it has been a reason tranquil period for the forecast by the standard of the past coupl of year   the princip chang we made was to incorpor the effect of your eas of monetari polici and to account for our percept that the elect had shift the polit balanc in favor of somewhat greater fiscal s ulus   the incom data  on balanc  have been close to our earlier expect and have reinforc our impress that we are inde work through a soft patch in econom activ   the sign of sluggish have been most evid in the labor market and in the manufactur sector  especi the motor vehicl industri   onc again  we receiv an employ report immedi after public of the  book   privat payrol employ drop        in novemb in contrast to our expect of a gain of          essenti the employ increas that had occur over the summer have now been revers   our largest forecast error  occur for the unemploy rate  where we had expect an increas from     percent to     percent and instead saw a jump to     percent   that said  i would character this develop as more a    surpris    of  e than magnitud   as you know  we had been puzzl by the failur of the unemploy rate to rise notic in recent month  given the weak in payrol employ   the puzzl now seem to have been resolv in a singl month   the onli upward surpris in the novemb labor market report was in hour work  which increas a bit more than project in the  book   taken togeth  the novemb data suggest a bit weaker labor   arket than we had expect but with littl materi consequ for our forecast  we would probabl carri a slight higher unemploy rate into earli next year    on the order of a tenth or so   and leav our gdp forecast unchang for now   the labor market  howev  was not the onli sourc of weak   the major contributor to the sharp slow in activ between the third and fourth quarter has been the motor vehicl industri   sale of light motor vehicl have drop back consider from the torrid pace regist this summer  as the averag level of custom incent has fallen  on net  sinc august   the slump in sale has led the automak to trim product in the fourth quarter   so after contribut about   percentag point to the growth of real gdp in the third quarter  motor vehicl assembl are lop off near     percentag point from growth in the fourth quarter   and even those product adjust have not been suffici to prevent inventori from have becom a bit heavi  so that some combin of further product cutback and sweeten incent like will be necessari in the month ahead   more broad  activ in the factori sector has sag again in recent month  we now expect manufactur ip outsid of motor vehicl to drop about   percent in novemb  continu a pattern of declin that emerg in late summer   in our forecast  we are not look for ani notic increas until the spring   the recent weak stem  in part  from a signific diminish impetus to activ from  inventori invest   a smaller swing in nonauto inventori invest and the cutback in motor vehicl product account for essenti all of the slow in the growth of real gdp in the current quarter   to date  we have seen few sign that this period of weak is spread or cumul into someth more serious   with the except of motor vehicl  final sale are project to grow about   percent at an annual rate in the current quarter  the same rate as in the third quarter   moreov  initi claim for unemploy insur and insur unemploy have both come down in recent week   for the most part  nonauto inventori appear to be in reason balanc   and commod price have been relat firm  suggest that the recent weak in factori output is not yet of cyclic dimens   instead  this appear to be a particular soft spot in a general subdu expans  we expect subpar econom perform to extend into earli next year  with real gdp project to grow about    percent at an annual rate in the first quarter   unchang from our previous project   howev  beyond the near term  we have made more notic adjust to our forecast  larg to reflect chang in our under polici assumpt   most import  we lower our assum path for the feder fund rate    basi point in light of your action last month   we assum that the fund rate will stay at    percent through the middl of      befor gradual rise   this more s ul monetari polici account for the bulk of the upward revis that we have made to the forecast     e have also built in a slight more s ul fiscal polici  which provid a small addit boost to growth in        we have assum a reduct of person incom tax payment of     billion in       over and abov the next instal of margin rate reduct   these tax reduct are assum to be part offset by about    billion of cut in feder spend   we view these adjust to our forecast as better balanc the risk in light of last month   s elect   as we note in   the  book  we are larg agnost about the form in which this s ulus will be deliv   but as an exampl  a packag of this dimens could includ pull forward the child tax credit and marriag penalti relief that are current schedul to occur later in the decad   the more s ul monetari and fiscal polici give a steeper tilt to the trajectori of growth in this forecast   we now project real gdp to increas    percent in      and    percent in        about   and    percentag point fa   respect  than in the octob  book   that pace is rapid enough to begin to erod the margin of excess capac by late next year  and the unemploy rate is now project fall below     percent by the end of        as has been the case at sever junctur over the past coupl of year  our outlook is onc again appar at odd with that of the market   even after the develop of the past week  market particip are anticip an earlier and more aggress tighten of monetari polici than we have incorpor in our baselin project   in our forecast  growth remain subdu through midyear  weigh down by the continu adjust of household spend to the declin in stock market wealth  the play out of the boost we have been get from inventori invest  and the lacklust econom perform of our major trade partner   as a consequ  we do not envis the same urgenc for tighten as is built into market expect   onli by late      do the wane effect of the earlier stock market declin and the improv invest pictur lift growth in real gdp abov that of potenti   we readili admit that we could have this wrong   the market appar continu to be look for someth that resembl a more convent period of econom recoveri   and with the real feder fund rate at or below zero for near two year  we cannot rule out a period of more vigor growth   those risk are amplifi by the possibl enact of a major s ulus packag earli next year  certain the buzz about that possibl has been grow in recent day   given the uncertainti about the magnitud   e  and composit  we were dissuad from build into the forecast a larger and more immedi s ulus packag   instead  we address that possibl in an altern simul that assum a combin of a payrol tax holiday and an acceler of the margin rate reduct includ in the      tax legisl  with those action take effect earli next year   that packag    rough      billion of ad s ulus next year   rais growth of real gdp abov   percent  on averag  throughout the project period   in this altern scenario  the fa  pace of activ push the unemploy rate down to   percent by the end of       and core pce inflat level off at just under     percent   while there are   lear upsid risk to our project  we continu to see some sizabl counterbalanc risk to the downsid   the most obvious risk center on our forecast of capit spend   to be sure  there has been a substanti turnaround in equip spend from last year to this  steep declin in spend in      have given way to modest increas this year   in our forecast  that process of improv continu into next year and       with growth in real e s spend pick up from low singl digit this year to low doubl digit next year   acceler output and sale  a low and declin cost of capit  and tax incent are project to help propel fa  growth of spend over the next two year   but thus far this year  equip spend has continu to fall short of the fundament  at least those that we are capabl of quantifi in our model   that shortfal like reflect a varieti of factor includ gloomi busi sen ent  a sens of heighten uncertainti about econom and geopolit condit  financ difficulti in some sector  and linger overhang of capit   whatev the sourc  the unusu restraint on busi spend will need to larg dissip by the second half of next year in order to get our project acceler of busi spend   and that still remain a forecast   although report on capit spend plan have been mix of late  i think it   s fair to say that the combin of caution and pessim still predomin   there are risk to the consumpt outlook as well   we view this quarter   s flatten out as a paus  driven import by the drop off in motor vehicl purchas   if that slump reflect the begin of a more persist weaken of overal consum outlay   one that occur befor the acceler of busi spend   the current soft patch could come to look a lot more like the la brea tar  pit   a final downsid possibl is that financi market have overreact to a few piec of good news in recent week   we were impress by the extent to which the market move on the posit surpris in read on retail sale  durabl good order  and initi claim   all noisi indic of activ   ani substanti retrac of these recent gain   and we have seen some of that in the stock market in the last  few day   would caus us to revis down our project for growth  all els be equal   in sum  we feel comfort with the balanc of risk surround our project of real output   but those risk remain consider   i have devot littl attent this morn to our inflat project larg becaus there has been littl news with regard to price inflat or it determin  measur of core inflat have general drift down over the past year   and  with slack in resourc util expect to persist over the project period  we anticip a further slight reduct in these measur over the next two year   but neither our model nor survey of inflat expect suggest ani sharp deviat from the recent perform of price in the period immedi ahead      son will continu our present     s   son   as we report in the  book  the staff did not see the develop sinc the novemb fomc meet as indic a need for ani major revis to our outlook for econom activ abroad or for the u s  extern sector  some new inform did prompt margin chang to our forecast for particular countri  but these small adjust were larg offset  the challeng confront us as we put togeth this forecast remain that of ensur that the overal strengthen in the global economi that we have again present is consist with the extent of s ulus we see outsid that present in the u s  economi   we have becom slight more pessimist about the outlook for the euro area and have written down real gdp growth in that region by     percentag point in      and slight less in        most  but not all  of that revis is account for by the chang in our outlook for germani   we see the obstacl to growth in germani as loom larger than we had previous thought   german fiscal polici is constrain in the near term by the failur to have made more progress over the past sever year in achiev the medium term goal set out in the stabil and growth pact   the momentum for structur reform within germani seem to have fade  perhap becaus of the polit of the elect this year   there are particular problem in the german bank system that rais question about the effici with which capit is be alloc and that may be imped a return to more dynam growth   and the general weak in busi spend on new capit in europ and elsewher work to the disadvantag of germani   s manufactur industri   the core of the german economi   slight upward revis to our project for mexico and for some of the emerg market economi in asia essenti offset our less favor outlook for the euro area   these small posit chang were driven by some recent data  which confirm solid expans in mexico and korea  and by the stronger outlook in this forecast for the acceler in real output in the unit state over the forecast period   these region are extrem vulner to ani weaken in u s  activ or  for asia  to ani falter in the recoveri of the global high tech sector   we have built into the forecast the consequ of the current quarter slow now appar in the unit state and elsewher   but our slight more op ist project for output growth in      and      in mexico and emerg asia reflect the boost to u s  growth expect from your move at the last meet   it is not the consequ of ani signific stronger domest demand now evid in those foreign economi   last thursday  the ecb council lower it offici lend rate    basi point  bring the minimum repo rate down to      percent   ahead of the meet date  member of the council had signal the likelihood of this step  and we had incorpor it into the  book forecast   we are not look for ani further reduct by the ecb and do not expect them to begin move up rate until mid          we view rate at the current  rather low  level as necessari for the moder recoveri in growth that we expect will begin next spring     he under factor that are the basi of our expect for moder acceler in the pace of activ abroad are similar to those for the u s  economi  monetari polici is s ul in sever of the major industri countri  although it effect in japan remain a concern   inventori cycl abroad are well along  and  to vari degre  we expect will be ad posit to the chang in output  over the forecast interv   the restrain effect of lower equiti price on spend  either becaus of hit to confid or direct wealth effect  should be wane   and lower oil price will reduc headlin inflat  boost confid  and support domest spend   domest demand has been buoyant in a few case   such as canada  the unit kingdom  and korea   and appear to be firm in other   these factor point to onli a moder pace of recoveri in        such an outcom should allay concern that now weigh on spend and support further recoveri in growth to more vigor rate in        except in canada  this project path for real activ still leav the level of output below potenti in the major foreign industri countri even at the end of        we are concern that there is limit scope outsid the unit state to react to ani new negat econom develop that might aris   in both japan and the euro area  option with respect to fiscal polici are sever limit   but most countri do have room to maneuv with respect to monetari polici should the recoveri go off track   in south america  even a veri favor outcom would not generat posit spillov elsewher  at best  we are look for no major deterior in brazil and so no negat contagion problem within the region   in emerg asia   the region that has so far display the most resili   there would be some scope for absorb some extern shock to the real economi   continu robust growth in china is a stabil factor in that region   nevertheless  we judg that  were u s  real gdp not to acceler as project in the baselin forecast  the project strengthen of activ elsewher in the global economi would be undermin as well     and i will be happi to answer ani question
incident  did you factor in the expand es  of oil reserv in the la brea tar pit
to the extent that that is built into the futur market  it   s comfort within our forecast
i think we will defer in all respect to presid jordan in case he want to leav earli and go back to the privat sector    laughter
thank you   dave  i saw a report last week that the      census had been adjust further   by anoth     million peopl   to correct an undercount   and if my   emori is not alreadi fail  the roll forecast initi had number that were     million or so lower than the preliminari census      data   we   re talk about close to    million peopl not count over a ten year period   that is huge  it seem to me   have you had  e to look at those data and think about what the revis   to some of the mani number we look at on incom and product  for exampl  and also to the diverg between the household and the payrol employ seri
well  the short and honest answer is    no      we   d have to think long and hard about what aspect of the statist program would have to be adjust and thus blown up by a larger popul number   obvious some measur would not need to be adjust becaus mani of the figur   the census of manufactur  the retail census  and so forth   are univers count alreadi and would be unaffect   other measur clear would be affect    the total level of household employ  for exampl   so i   m not sure what that chang in the popul figur would produc in the way of alter the pictur of the overal economi  howev  with respect to some of the fundament characterist of the expans in the     s  i don   t see this revis chang  for exampl  the sharp acceler of product that we had   i don   t think it necessarili would alter thing like the perceiv level of slack in the labor market  given that chang in popul probabl would affect both employ and the labor forc   i   m sure there are some consequ  but at this point i just don   t know exact what they would be
theoret  popul is also a factor embodi in the under hous demand analys that we   ve been do   haven   t we taken that into consider to a signific extent    r      well  as you know  part at your direct  prior to the      census we had been look at the possibl that there would be some signific upward revis in the popul es   and in some sens that certain had alreadi inform our think  these recent revis  howev  are addit refin   but again  i   m not sure that they would affect the pictur of the     s in ani materi way   i don   t think the revis would have ani percept effect on the forecast go forward becaus these are most level adjust rather than growth rate adjust
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a coupl of question i   d like to ask   if we were to compar the forecast this  e with the forecast last  e use the market base fund rate line in your altern scenario  i take it that not veri much has chang   am i read you correct   i didn   t pull out my previous  book to verifi it  but i think last  e the nearer term market forecast on the fed fund rate was down from where you had it  and this  e it   s the other way around
yes  and the differ weren   t veri pronounc last  e  wherea this  e they are more pronounc
they are more pronounc this  e   so if we were compar the two forecast  there has been a littl improv in the market   s outlook for gdp  employ  and  so forth  but not all that much
yes  as of a littl over a week ago it look to us as if the revis in market expect for the fund rate impli an upward revis to the market   s outlook for spend   in contrast  our forecast was onli adjust to the extent that we had lower the entir path of the fund rate go forward to reflect your eas move at the last meet   now   ur expect regard the fund rate path realli has come back closer to where it was at the  e of the last meet  suggest no signific revis there either
okay   my next question is about two rather outsiz number that caught my eye   the less import one is the surg in m   which was concentr in institut money market fund   it   s a big number   do we know what   s go on there   and second  what do you make of the product surg   that   s obvious a veri import issu  and the product number is realli quit larg   you didn   t say veri much about that  it seem to me
i   ll start with your second question  and perhap   will speak to the m  data   obvious there was anoth veri signific surpris in the product number   some of that is real in that output  in fact  turn out to be a bit better than we had expect   some of it is a reflect of the way the statist system is construct   the  product seri that we show and that get featur by the bls is a seri for nonfarm busi exclud the hous sector   it turn out that mortgag refinanc  which acceler veri rapid in the third quarter  are treat as intermedi input to the hous sector   that  show up as less gross product origin from the hous sector   the latter is subtract from nonfarm busi output  so we get a much bigger increas in nonfarm busi output in the third quarter   we think that will be an addit increment to product growth in the fourth quarter   then  as the refinanc begin to wane some next year  that will be a factor hold down the growth of nonfarm busi output ex hous
incident  if it is an intermedi product  then that   s a correct calcul
that   s absolut right   but i would say
that   s not to say that it didn   t happen    r      right  and if it realli did  that would show up as much more product or output in essenc in the provis of financi servic
what i   m tri to get at is that unless one is argu that the interpret is question as to whether it   s an intermedi or final product  then that   s no differ than ani of the other
well  i   m tri to explain whi nonfarm busi output   when one look at the top line of gdp   was so close to what we had expect while product was so much stronger   you   re absolut right that to the extent that this product growth realli reflect higher product in the mortgag bank industri  for exampl  that   s real product  obvious  though  that still leav us with a substanti addit surpris on product   we have revis up our es  of the level of structur product for       and we continu to believ that some of this improv is like to fade away as busi caution begin to erod   but more of it is go to persist than we thought at the  e of the last forecast   we   re still nervous about whether we   ve underdon it in term of revis up the growth rate of potenti output go forward   that is someth we plan to reevalu befor the next meet  with a bit more data in hand  to see where we are   we typic make more signific revis in our suppli side forecast at the januari meet   and at the august meet after we get the annual revis   so we expect to look at that further   but the pattern that we   re see still appear to be one where we are be surpris by the weak of overal employ and by the strength of overal product   we   ve interpret that part as indic that firm are abl to extract more out of their given resourc base  at least for a  e  and we view some of it as true structur product    r  pool   yes  but except for the refinanc issu  there   not seem to be ani statist anomali that you can put your finger on
no  but i do think there are some reason for be a bit cautious when we get sharp move   there is a question as to whether the account system is in fact complet frictionless   i   m not sure
so it   s not just a one quarter phenomenon
it   s not just a one quarter phenomenon   obvious  we   ve had a year now of absolut spectacular product growth
yes  a year of remark number
just to remind you  we did see a pattern of quit strong product  growth in the earli     s that play out befor the acceler in the expans got go   we saw a surg in the earli     s that one also could have interpret as an acceler of under product  which turn out later not to have occur   so i think we have a littl statist support for a pattern similar to what we saw at that  e   but i would say that the risk clear are more to the upsid than to the downsid on this aspect of our project   and we tri in the altern simul to give you a sens of how import that might be go forward
as you note  presid pool  m  has been grow veri rapid  it   s on track for someth like a      percent rate of growth in novemb  that is account for most by the growth in money fund  which probabl expand at a rate of about    percent last month   that in turn is a direct result of the polici eas and the histor account in money fund   they pay the averag return on their asset   when short term market rate fell with the     point polici eas at the begin of the month  investor rush in to extract some of those capit gain   we think that pretti much has play out
but the fund obvious are not come   not entir anyway    from  other m  asset
a lot of them would involv some substitut from rps in particular  but we think that  on net  there is some attract from other sourc of fund into m
do you have ani idea where the fund were come from to the extent that  they were from outsid m  asset
not in particular  no
i had a question about the deflat scenario that you show in the  book      as i understand the scenario  deflat was caus by two factor   one was the downward adjust to price  and an unexpect weak in aggreg demand was ad to it   i have two question about this   first  if we didn   t have the aggreg demand shock but had onli the downward shock in price  what would the deflat scenario look like in term of it impact on output   also  one channel of influenc on output  of cours  would be higher real interest rate as a result of deflat   but are there other channel through which deflat  would have effect on output as well
in term of the relat contribut of the shock we built into this scenario from wage and price and from the weak in aggreg demand  it   s rough half and half   you can see that to some extent by take a look at the number in the recess scenario  which in essenc has just the weak in demand   that get real gdp in      down from the baselin of     percent to     percent   it goe down anoth    percentag point in the   eflat scenario when we incorpor the addit shock to wage and price   now in some sens  that   s just a matter of how we construct that deflat scenario   i think the import point is that it take a combin of shock to put us there   obvious  we could have a huge recess   a three standard deviat type of event on wage or price   and perhap get there  but essenti the model  sn   t want to push the economi into deflat without combin a number of these differ kind of shock   a combin of shock is necessari in order to get a persist deflat  as for the way the deflat affect output  i think the princip channel through which it oper in the model is the real interest rate   i should be veri clear that this altern scenario we   re show is probabl not the deflat scenario you would be most worri about   the latter is a situat where we get into a deflat and you had alreadi lower the feder fund rate to zero and couldn   t use convent monetari polici anymor to pull the economi out of recess   we   ve done some stochast simul to calcul the probabl of that type of deflat scenario  and the model suggest that it is less than    percent   someth like   or   percent   if we calcul the probabl of a deflat by allow shock to everyth    aggreg demand  product  the wage and price equat   the probabl is much higher  more on the order of one third   but that would not necessarili involv the kind of macroeconom situat that would creat signific difficulti for you becaus in mani of those simul you would still have some scope to lower the feder fund rate to tri to reduc the real interest rate and pull the economi out of that situat
let me make sure i understand the first part of your answer   if we had onli the shock from lower price and lower wage  that would not have a suffici impact to produc the effect on output shown in the  book simul    r      not of the dimens that we built into this scenario   again  we could construct all sort of simul  we could give the model ani kind of shock we wish  but in term of the type of shock we gave it in this simul  it would not be suffici to push us into deflat
and there are no other channel that you see deflat work through to output besid the higher real interest rate
not in the way that this model is construct   the zero bound on nomin interest rate  in essenc  is the place where the deflat begin to get it own traction in this model   obvious  mani of the thing one might worri about accompani a deflat are not featur that are easili model in the context of our frb us model   the various kind of financi stress and strain that might begin to develop   type of balanc sheet problem   are treat onli veri rudimentarili in the model   i would be hesit to use our model to analyz a deflationari economi  given that it equat have been es  on a postwar period in which  on averag  those kind of problem realli haven   t been embed in the data   so our abil to es  the effect of deflat veri precis is go to be relat small
okay  thank you
as you   ve alreadi said  a key factor in your forecast  which i think is a fair op ist one  is strong structur product growth   look at the way you break that down on page   in the first part of the  book  the strong growth in multifactor product is a big part of that   that has been acceler  and you expect it to continu at a signific high rate of increas for the next coupl of year  throughout the project period  i don   t think we understand a whole lot about multifactor product  and i   m wonder if that   xpectat is basic an extrapol   or do you have some more specif thought on which to base it
as you   re well awar  presid broaddus  multifactor product is in essenc a residu   it measur everyth that we don   t realli understand about product   in extrapol it  we use various procedur involv statist filter to tri to ascertain the under trend   and those statist filter general make us feel reason comfort with the kind of figur we   ve written down here   as i indic earlier  i think there are risk on both side   i see the risk more to the upsid than to the downsid in this particular aspect of our forecast  given the issu that presid pool was rais   our statist filter in a sens want to down weight some of the more recent observ  those data haven   t been through an annual revis yet   so there are some reason for be relat conserv  as we have been in our forecast   but the recent perform of product has been absolut spectacular   we are nervous about put in a lot more product growth than we   ve shown  in part becaus those same statist filter  as i indic earlier  over interpret the pickup that we got in the earli     s immedi come out of that recess   they show more of that pickup in trend product than ul  turn out to be the case   so i think we need to be care about get head fake by the last year   s data  given the rather extraordinari circumst of the period   but in term of be abl to model under technic progress or organiz effici   the kind of thing that actual go into product   we just don   t have a veri good handl on how to measur them
presid parri    r  parri      my question is relat somewhat to the interchang you had with michael   about deflat   i had a chanc to look at the board staff   s domest nonfinanci brief and the exercis of es  the probabl of attain deflat  as you defin it  over a four quarter period   i was struck by how larg that probabl is   i wonder what level of concern you had about that probabl     percent is not a small number   we had done a similar exercis for a previous meet  but we didn   t have quit the same definit   i actual like your definit better becaus i think it is more realist in term of assum a    percentag point error in the core pce measur of inflat   how did the probabl number strike you when you got those result
well  when we first start calcul those probabl earlier this fall  i think we were struck as well by how larg they were   again  one could imagin a situat in which we were get benefici shock to wage and price and fa  product growth    scenario where those develop were the princip driver in a period of declin price  but from a polici perspect  deflat probabl distort   just as inflat     relat price signal and the tax system   even with what i would term a relat benign deflat we   d have those kind of effect  so there would be some negat associ with that   as i indic to presid    the more serious concern is end up in a japanes style deflat with these shock lead us to zero inflat and with aggreg demand be weak enough that the committe had alreadi lower the fund rate to zero   that scenario has a lower probabl  still  i think one would have to admit that an   to   percent probabl of that outcom is pretti high  too   obvious  those confid interv reflect the fact that there is a lot of uncertainti in the outlook    r  parri   this may be more like a china version of deflat  where the deflat probabl reflect what is happen to product
that   s right   certain  if we creat       stochast run of the model to calcul the probabl  within the    percent of case with deflat there would be mani instanc in which the deflat was relat benign   those would be instanc where the deflat was caus by fa  product growth or benefici shock to wage and price set  with what i would perceiv to be less serious consequ for monetari polici
right  and for growth
may i follow up quick   the stochast shock you use are drawn  from the whole postwar period
they are from      on  which includ the high volatil period of the     s
the volatil of these shock has been much smaller in the last decad or so
yes  the volatil is much smaller  and inde the probabl are affect by that   that   s one of the issu we debat among ourselv in our discuss about how to present the result   we debat whether it was better to show the result use the post        period as oppos to the post      period   we thought there were some reason argument in favor of show the result use onli the post      period  but we conclud that in a sens that might be consid cheat in term of convey to you the degre of our uncertainti   howev  it is someth we are look at   we don   t know if what we   ve had in the past twenti year is good luck or if there has been a regim chang in how those shock are generat   we   re tri to see if someth has chang to make those shock smaller    r  parri   what would the number be if you use the post      period
to tell you the truth  i don   t recal offhand exact what the number were  but we   ve done that calcul  and we can certain circul them to the committe
that would be interest
i   d be happi to do that
to turn to the upsid risk to the forecast  i certain agre that they resid main in what the congress might do with regard to fiscal s ulus   but i would note that the  book forecast all the way through      is consider more op ist than most privat sector forecast on the state and local side   and by some multipl depend on what period one is look at   i assum that other were impress as i was by the gulf between where state revenu are and where they need to be to achiev anyth close to a balanc budget requir  which i think exist in everi state except vermont   major cut will have to occur in state spend to achiev those balanc budget over the next coupl of year   i know you have a number of staff work on the state and local side  and i thought you might want to comment on that
inde  we do see obvious risk associ with that piec of the forecast   but our general outlook is that we will begin to see some overal acceler of activ and incom  so we   re go to get help for the state and local sector from a coupl of  differ direct   one is improv tax base over the next year   also  lower interest rate are certain help both the financi condit of state and local govern and their abil to tap capit market   as they appar have done   in order to maintain a number of their spend program   and while mani state have run through their raini day fund  there is still   ome margin to shift fund from there as well   still  as we look at our      forecast relat to the trend of the last decad or so  those figur are relat weak   but we think overal that some of the intens pressur that sector is feel right now will probabl be allevi over the next year   nevertheless  the state and local sector is clear a downsid risk relat to the feder side  where we see more upsid risk
and  as you know  a number of the polici propos that have been talk about use the feder govern to provid some fiscal relief for state and local govern   the administr has not sign on to that idea at all yet
but the polit of that might not be all that attract
yes  but there is certain some pressur in that direct
i have a coupl of addit comment   first  it is incred difficult to interpret some of the announc that are come out in the state and local area   for exampl  governor davi as you know   excus me  i   m not quit as emot about the topic as my falter voic suggest    laughter
over the weekend or late last week  governor davi announc a packag of     billion of budget cut   my understand  base on public sourc  is that onli about      billion of those cut are to be appli in the current fiscal year  the remain    billion and chang will be appli in the follow year   that goe to the more general point that while there is a lot of distress in the state and local sector   and we   ve reflect a good deal of that in our project   there   s quit a bit of latitud for the state to meet these so call   alanc budget requir  they can do that in a number of differ way   i think what we   ll see in come month is recours for thing like access capit fund
right  and securit tobacco settlement
there   s a whole constel of financi devic avail includ  as dave mention  the state financ of capit project through bond issuanc rather than on a current basi
i agre with all that   i just was struck that the  book es  of growth in the state and local sector even in      is at least doubl that of dri   and other forecast are below dri   s forecast   i know reason peopl can differ on this  but that seem like a big differ
just to remind you  we have a higher es  of potenti output  too  than most other forecast
yes  that   s true
that   not explain all of the differ  but it   account for at least a few tenth of it
i agre with the point you made about the  e of those spend cut in california   but that   s becaus the budget deficit is about    billion in the current fiscal year and an es      billion in the subsequ year   so these announc cut are onli part of the program
yes  governor davi indic that there are further announc to come
if they   re go to get to a balanc budget   hairman  span   are they go to use real es   or is some of that trust fund shuffl and the usual account procedur they some  use to fill the deficit gap   do you have ani idea what they   ll use
i think they   re meet this week to figur out how they   re go to do the rest of it becaus what has been propos so far   the number that   mention   are main cut in spend  half of which are in educ becaus that   s half the budget   i   m sure there are short term action they can take  but those action probabl are not go to be the solut to the problem
just on that point  could i ask bob a question   i read somewher last night that  even if california laid off all it public employe  that would cut the deficit onli by  two third   can that be right   have you seen that number
yes  i did see it   it struck me as a veri surpris number   i can   t rememb who made that comment
it could be relat to the pension fund in the sens that the state could fire everybodi but the prior pension oblig would still be there on the outlay side
i don   t know  but i   ll take a look at that
let   s move on to the committe discuss   you have prioriti  presid jordan
thank you again   look at the inform that has becom avail in the few week sinc our last meet  if one filter out the like effect of the sever winter weather in part of the countri  the equiti market gyrat  the wax and wane of concern over terrorist attack and a possibl war with iraq  along with the fact that there are fewer   hop day than usual between thanksgiv and christma  there   s noth left to say   laughter   we have all this  e to fill up befor lunch  nevertheless  i will report that the particip in a recent meet of our communiti bank advisori council as well as our twenti three director are less gloomi than they were a few month ago   whether this cheerier mood will last beyond the holiday season won   t be known for some  e  of cours   but clear the group dynam have shift from a  competit to report more negat anecdot than the other to a desir to point out thing about which to be posit   for exampl  one director said he believ that a    percent increas in order backlog and a    percent increas in shipment of forklift vehicl versus a year ago will prove to be a lead indic of a stronger invest sector   i   ve never studi the lead indic properti of forklift  but my suspicion is that the chairman has    laughter  in ani event  the cleveland staff is alreadi on the case  that same director is also on the board of a veri larg insur compani  and he report that premium at that compani are on a pace to increas     to     percent this year  one banker report that the most signific develop to him is that lend on recreat vehicl has been his strongest line of busi this year   i don   t know whether that was suppos to be good news or not   in a go around of the banker  most said that the local economi they serv will be better next year but that their own earn will declin as a result of narrow interest margin and an expect declin in fee incom   as a side note relat to the subject of potenti output and capac util  most express the view that their mortgag depart were oper beyond a sustain capac   the banker also general believ that their custom expect higher interest rate in the futur  so the banker    effort to extend the   atur of their liabil by offer higher yield on longer term cds have generat littl respons  on the nation economi  while the various threat and uncertainti about the futur that we   ve been talk about all year have not gone away  there are more posit forc at work  those includ the narrow of qualiti spread in capit market and the ampl growth of the entir constel of reserv and money measur   moreov  there   s an expect that margin tax rate are more like to be reduc than increas in the forese futur   all those factor should enhanc the inher resili of the natur forc in a market economi  i continu to believ that the overal perform of the u s  economi in      will be judg to have been far better than ani ex ant expect about what the first year after the terrorist attack would be like   i trust that the second year will be even better   thank you

you may rememb that last month i report that the economi in  our region had soften in octob  and i attribut that at least in part to the sniper shoot in the d c  area that were keep peopl at home   activ   appear to have firm up a bit in   ovemb accord to some of the preliminari number we have from the survey that our bank conduct   but asid from hous  which for the most part is still quit robust  i would character the overal pictur as veri  veri sluggish in our region   factori shipment and order were a littl stronger in our novemb survey than in octob  but my sens is that manufactur remain quit weak  not surpris  given the general soft economi  capit spend in our district    both current and prospect   is veri restrain  the comment i   m hear are veri similar to those toni  jack  and cathi have mention alreadi   some servic sector firm have plan to upgrad their comput equip and softwar  but most manufactur compani are alreadi plagu with excess capac   they don   t expect ani signific new invest   some  compani in the paper industri  for exampl  are actual spend at less than the depreci rate  so they   re tri to reduc capac in that industri   i think that   s true in a number of other industri as well   so that   s the news on the region economi  on the nation economi  the  book   s forecast for gdp growth over the project period has been revis up  reflect our rate cut and the assumpt of addit fiscal s ulus   under the circumst  i think it   s a fair op ist forecast in that it call for a  steadi acceler of growth over the next four quarter to an annual rate of about   percent by the end of next year   in addit to the s ul polici assumpt  the forecast is base on the view that an adjust process is now in place that  if given  e  will bring the economi back to a balanc growth path   a key drive forc in this adjust  as i see it  is that structur product growth is expect to exceed   percent in each of the next two year   the strong product growth in turn is expect to generat rise profit  strong cash flow  and firm stock price  which are suppos to help reviv invest spend next year    urther  the recent higher equiti valu and strong growth in real wage are expect to bring forth the real consumpt expenditur necessari to underwrit growth in gdp of rough    percent in      and    percent in       i consid this project emin reason as a central tendenc   in fact  i think someth like it is the most like outcom in the month ahead   but i still believ that on balanc the risk in the forecast are skew to the downsid   let me quick list four of the risk that i think deserv particular attent   the first  which goe back to the question i ask   earlier  relat to product growth   the op  regard overal product growth reflect an assumpt that multifactor product is go to rise at a rate of about     percent in      and       that   s slight abov even the recent relat high realiz rate of growth in mfp   i am person op ist about product  but there   s no guarante that we   ll get that kind of growth   as we note earlier  there is a lot of uncertainti here   and product is not an area about which we know as much as we   d like   that   s the first risk i would point out  second  and i think this is an import point  the  book assum that the fed is go to keep the fund rate at it current level until mid        this expect give monetari polici a relat big kick in the forecast sinc it pull long term interest rate down   a risk here is that the market may not believ that the fed will leav the rate so low for so long  probabl in part becaus we remov the tilt at the last meet   so the actual term structur may not in fact reflect the degre of s ulus that   s built into the forecast  third  the  book is project a strong upturn in busi fix invest   quit strike strong  i thought  in look at the number   begin in the first quarter   it may happen   but there   s not much direct evid that it has start yet  and we   re onli about three week from the first quarter at this point    inal  the rise in the unemploy rate from     to   percent in novemb rais the possibl that this recoveri  like the recoveri from the gulf war recess  may turn out to be a jobless recoveri   unemploy may rise further   and if it    the fed may have to cut the real fund rate further next year  as we had to do in the latter part of      and in       i don   t think ani of this warrant a chang in polici today   but it may be construct to find some way to signal the market and the public that we   re at least awar of these risk and are prepar to move decis to deal with them as need

that judgment  one element of that is a reduc concern about near term downsid risk   with busi hold back on invest and hire  what was most worrisom was the possibl that consumpt was show sign of fall off and that  especi with a weak labor market  household could pull back even more than they were alreadi show sign of do   in the event  although labor market inde remain tepid  consumpt has come in onli slight short of expect   hous activ appear to be a tad stronger than anticip  and consum confid is off the low of last fall  i also think we have had some support  albeit veri faint  for the forecast of stronger growth ahead   for some  e the key to that outlook has been diminish uncertainti and risk avers and stronger capit spend   the posit news on uncertainti and risk avers come from the financi market  as mani of us have note   equiti price  although fall back in recent day  general have held the gain regist sinc earli octob   despit further decreas in expect profit as read from project of equiti analyst  the impli reduct in risk premium on equiti has been manifest as well in the credit market  where bond spread   ave continu to drop substanti   obvious  this narrow did not reflect ani diminut of geopolit risk   rather  like presid    i suspect it was the respons to the declin in near term downsid risk i just mention and also perhap to a percept that busi and financi market are make progress in work through the after effect of the boom year of the late     s   as  e goe by without major new revel of financi chicaneri or misrepresent and as the size and the number of earn restat declin  investor may becom less fear about sever downsid surpris left over from that era  the improv in financi market is import becaus it could indic that the concern of busi and household more general are decreas from the extraordinarili elev level of last summer and earli fall   in addit  not onli has the better tone in financi market put a floor under household wealth  it also has facilit long term busi financ  with both bond and equiti issuanc pick up in novemb from veri depress level  stronger balanc sheet  by afford busi a measur of protect against the consequ of downsid risk  may make firm more will to respond to favor fundament like an acceler in sale and the declin cost of capit   in fact  the pickup in equip and softwar spend has alreadi been under way  and the new data for this categori of invest have point to a slight greater upward tilt in the trajectori than previous expect   e s spend both for the third and fourth quarter of this year has been revis up  so now the second half of the year is appreci stronger than the first   it   s much too earli to call this the kind of strengthen trend we   re all look for to boost growth in the year ahead  still  it is encourag that the new order data were suffici good to lead the staff to boost their project of growth in e s expenditur in the first quarter from the higher level now expect to prevail at the end of the year   this first quarter project is for a fair strong pace    nd there may be downsid risk   but even with some shortfal from this project  the upward trend would still be in place  notabl  the pickup in e s invest this year   and it further acceler in the forecast   occur with an ongo lack of price power   fortun  price power is not necessari for busi to perceiv profit opportun in new invest becaus mani of us  myself includ  wouldn   t mind see overal inflat sustain somewher around it current level   what is requir is that firm are abl to anticip that the revenu from capit invest will exceed it cost by enough to provid an attract margin   when revenu is constrain by stabl output price  other sourc of revenu growth must be found  or cost must be compress  in the outlook  increas in unit sale and greater product of capit should provid opportun to rais revenu stream   moreov  restraint on compens growth  increas in labor product  declin in the cost of high tech equip  and save from replac worn out equip should be suffici to hold down cost   beyond earli hint of diminish uncertainti and stronger invest spend  it now seem more like that addit fiscal s ulus will be boost growth down the road  i recogn that i   ve been accentu the posit aspect of a veri mix set of intermeet develop  and that the negat  includ the employ report and retreat of equiti price  have been promin in recent day   the firm in activ out of the current soft spot is still a forecast  not a realiti  and one that has plenti of downsid risk even in the absenc of a new shock   but for the first  e in mani meet  there have been some favor develop   and the new inform on balanc has at least been consist with the   ossibl of a strengthen economi next year  and it did not indic a softer economi and greater downsid risk than i had anticip   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the tenth district economi has shown some sign of improv sinc our last meet  but i would say that the improv is still veri  veri modest  and i wouldn   t wish to overemphas it   manufactur activ has firm somewhat over the last coupl of month  and op  in our survey of manufactur about the futur has increas as well   and we are see some veri modest sign that capit spend is increas  in our survey  the year over year index for product rose from minus    in septemb to plus   in novemb   it   s the first  e the index has been posit sinc octob       which is good news as far as we   re concern   in the survey we recent conduct  it is interest that  while about    percent of those we survey still are think about decreas in spend  that   s actual less than last  e   so in that sens it   s a posit note  consum spend actual has pick up after eas earlier in the fall   both discount store and depart store report that their sale increas in the first part of novemb and that busi was also better over the thanksgiv weekend   but talk with retail is to me a bit like talk to rancher in the sens that  while they said the situat was better  they   re still veri  veri negat about the holiday season   the pessim is due in part to the short of the thanksgiv to christma sell period   we   ll have to see how that turn out  hous activ in our region also continu to hold up remark well   new start and resal are both fair strong   commerci real estat  on the other hand  is depress    particular so in the denver area   vacanc rate are high  and there   s also leas space that   eopl would veri much like to get rid of   labor market remain slack  and there are virtual no wage pressur in our region   energi activ has edg up slight in the octob novemb  e frame   and our farm economi is mix  with ranch veri depress and other area do well  base on the subsidi they   re receiv  turn to the nation economi  i would say that the pictur is veri similar to what we are see in the region  the data are mix   but a slight improv seem to have occur  as other have note  and i do agre with the  book forecast   the downsid risk are obvious   there   s uncertainti about whether consum spend will hold up  especi given the drop off in auto sale  and about whether busi fix invest will continu to strengthen  which is so import for the incipi recoveri   and  of cours  how well foreign economi do also will influenc the outcom  on the posit side  as has been note  monetari polici is s ul and has becom more so   fiscal polici is s ul  and the likelihood that it will becom more s ul is higher than it was a coupl of month ago   and financi market condit have improv sinc our last meet   so i think we are in a posit where we can be a bit more op ist  but we realli have to wait and see
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet  short term interest rate were arguabl too high and the outlook for aggreg demand too weak   there was a lot to talk about   by this meet  there has been some adjust on both side   both the fed and the ecb have lower short term rate by    basi point sinc our last meet   the econom outlook seem clear stronger here and not much weaker in europ   and even the latter develop is say someth becaus the general pattern this year has been to downgrad   he european forecast pretti sharpli   while it   s much too soon to tell  at this point monetari polici might be posit about right to induc a sustain recoveri   even the neutral bias look pretti good to me now   noth is cri out to be chang  and there  sn   t seem to be much to talk about today   this is one of those meet that could have been cancel   laughter   but it wasn   t cancel  so let me take my  e to point out an interest contrast and to pose a thought provok potenti dilemma involv the so call jobless recoveri  the term    jobless recoveri    was introduc into the lexicon ten year ago with the recoveri of the earli     s  larg to make a polit point   but in term of all the labor market indic   payrol employ  help want  total hour work  the employ to   popul ratio  and the unemploy rate   there are quit strike similar between the jobless recoveri that began in march      and the one that seem to have begun in decemb       also with neglig job growth  while the job pattern have been quit similar in the two recoveri  there is an interest differ   the      recoveri was character by higher inflat and a less accommod monetari polici than we have now   rememb  that was still the  e of opportunist disinfl   fiscal polici actual was tighten for most of the recoveri period becaus of deficit fear   product was strong but not as strong as it has been this year   at least in a relat sens  the      recoveri now look like one part constrain by policymak who were  in turn  look at inflat and deficit  with product play a secondari role  the polici constraint seem absent this  e around   almost everybodi feel that monetari polici should be less constrain by inflat   inde  sinc the project unemploy rate is in excess of nairu throughout the recoveri  the staff is actual   orecast inflat to declin   earlier we were promot opportunist disinfl   now we   re worri that we may get too much disinfl  as for fiscal polici  as a long  e fan of higher nation save  i am person quit nervous that long term fiscal au  goal may be dismiss from the polici agenda   they are be deemphas at least  if not dismiss altogeth   this mean that fiscal polici has been and is like to be much more accommod than in       with aggreg demand grow more rapid   the jobless part of the jobless recoveri is therefor not a polici stori  as it was last  e  but rather come from the incred perform of product  this interest contrast between the two jobless recoveri then lead to a potenti quandari for us   on one side  vigor product growth and declin inflat would argu for us to be quit slow to rais interest rate as the economi recov   on the other side  fiscal polici might well becom high expansionari in the recoveri period  in stark contrast to the      pattern   in this case  overal polici might easili becom too accommod  and the fed might have to take on it tradit role of remov the punch bowl   a question to ponder as we look ahead   thank you
whi don   t we break for coffe   but befor we do that  let me just mention that the reason i left the room was that i got a call from bill donaldson  whom mani of you know   he said he is about to be nomin by the presid for the chairmanship of the secur and exchang commiss   so i gave him my condol    laughter   shall we break

thank you  mr  chairman   the second district economi appear to have pick up some steam sinc my last report  with sign of improv in the labor market and stabil in manufactur   retail are report some improv in sale in novemb  particular over the thanksgiv weekend  with the winter weather produc a rebound in apparel purchas   and the street of manhattan were fill with tourist  which we were veri happi to see   surpris  consid all this  consum confid remain depress in novemb follow a big drop in octob   unemploy rate are about flat  they edg up veri slight in the most recent month   sale of exist singl famili home weaken notic in octob  while sell price slip veri modest  home construct retreat a bit in octob but remain at a fair high level  particular in the multifamili sector   lower manhattan   s offic market remain stabl in octob but offic vacanc rate in the rest of manhattan rose further   manufactur and purchas manag report that condit general have been stabl in recent week  the fiscal situat in new jersey  new york citi  and new york state has remain veri grim inde   and we have what i think could now be call a fair high probabl of a transit strike begin at midnight on sunday   the demand by the transit worker are well beyond the abil of the transit author or the citi to accept   the effect of a transit strike on the citi  especi on consum and tourist  would be veri unfortun   it look as if it   s an accid that should be avoid but may veri well not be  the banker in the district report that residenti and commerci mortgag are be increas sought and not just refinanc   they have been tighten up on their lend standard  which is not surpris becaus delinqu rate on consum and home mortgag loan have increas some   we share the view that the fourth quarter will be weak  perhap even   ess than   percent on gdp  and that growth should come back somewhat slowli next year  howev  we still think the risk to the forecast are somewhat to the downsid  although that   s less clear the case than at our last meet larg as a result of our move  on the intern front  i think     s report was as usual veri well balanc  howev  the news in latin america  my earli area of specialti  is get wors   the mexican polit situat is essenti frozen until next juli   s congression elect   the presid   not wish to negoti with the opposit  and the opposit  sn   t want to negoti with  the presid  and so noth will happen   fiscal polici cannot be expans simpli becaus the govern can   t find the revenu  and monetari polici has been tighten a littl veri recent   in brazil  the delay in presid elect lula da silva   s name of his econom polici committe is not good news   i think there is a grow conflict between his econom advis and the leadership of his labor parti   if it continu  that could result in an addit and unnecessari blow to confid among both domest and intern investor   that would keep real interest rate high and  therefor  make the sustain of the debt level in brazil more question   in my view  the risk are not overwhelm  but the direct is not a happi one   thank you
the presid elect was here in washington today  wasn   t  he
i want to mention a coupl of point that i   ve pick up in discuss with banker  which tend to reinforc what we   ve heard around the tabl today   basic the sens of banker on the commerci lend side is that the psycholog seem to have chang   light but lend activ has not yet follow   of the four banker i talk to  one of them who is the ceo of the largest mortgag lender in the countri emphas the signific declin in the number of home loan refinanc applic receiv in the last sever week   we discuss some of the reason for that   refinanc applic tend to show a correl with movement in the ten year treasuri note   but the recent falloff is disproportion to the movement in the ten year treasuri issu  so that has caught his attent  two of my banker contact comment on the growth in save account at their bank  most of the discuss i   ve had with banker over the last year have focus on the asset side of the balanc sheet   this is the first  e much has been said about the liabil side   both of these banker emphas the growth in save account  they said consum were ad to save as oppos to put fund into an interest bear transact account   implicit in that behavior  in their view  is that consum expect interest rate to stay low for some  e   a similar reaction came from a banker who talk about what was happen with home loan equiti line of credit  which are variabl rate instrument   fifteen percent of those loan are now first lien posit  which carri the same suggest   that home owner are take advantag of the lower interest rate line of credit as oppos to lock in a longer term rate   implicit in that behavior  too  is some sens that the consum think rate will remain low for a while  on the fiscal polici side  i think the onli thing we can know for sure is that it will be a front burner issu in the new congress and will involv a lot of legisl activ   also  the continu resolut to fund the govern expir januari     and still onli two of the thirteen appropri bill have been pass  it seem to me that the two scenario built into the  book are the most like and are veri realist   the payrol tax holiday and the acceler of the margin rate reduct   as   resid   suggest  the discuss of the tradeoff between tax chang and budget balanc will spark a veri live debat   but at this point veri littl has chang from six week ago
thank you  mr  chairman   when i came in this morn  i thought one of our problem today might be that mani of us would be leav the build earli and the press would see us and wonder what we were do this morn   but we seem to have solv that problem    laughter  my wal mart contact   and obvious that compani is intens interest in the issu of consumpt behavior   report mix current that their peopl find puzzl   i   ve comment in previous meet that wal mart watch veri close the pattern of spend over the cours of the month and has note a paycheck cycl  there   s a tendenc for retail sale to pick up just after peopl receiv paycheck  with a bigger cycl at the end of the month and a smaller cycl in the middl of the month   ordinarili there is no particular notic midmonth cycl in sale of item such as food and pharmaceut   recent such a cycl has been appear  and wal mart interpret that as a sign of consum distress   appar at least some household aren   t abl to spend on food on a steadi basi but are wait until they get their midmonth paycheck   on the other hand  that   s not consist with the fact that sale of discretionari item  electron  and fashion apparel
is that an oxymoron
well  at least wal mart   s version of fashion apparel   how long has it been sinc you   ve been in a wal mart   at ani rate  those item are continu to sell fair well  so  there are these crosscurr   at ani rate  my contact was concern about whether   ousehold are get somewhat stress  and the pattern of food sale was one factor he point to in particular  my contact at fedex and also at the truck compani  j b  hunt  both said that not much has chang in recent week   the outlook for next year is about the same as it has been   i ask my fedex contact particular about the middl east situat   as you know  both fedex and up have contract with the defens depart that allow aircraft to be divert for cargo lift to anyplac in the world   the word that he has from the defens depart is that the number of plane like to be divert would be small and would not have ani effect on domest busi becaus there is plenti of excess capac in that industri   so in his view noth draconian is like to happen in that regard   there may or may not be militari action in the middl east  but his best guess right now is that even if there were  the direct effect on the u s  economi is not like to be sever   of cours  the psycholog effect is a differ matter  i   ve been in europ  and i spent a day at the bank of england   incident  i was pleas to be the first person from the fomc to congratul mervyn king   in person anyway  offici at the bank of england are veri  veri concern about price increas in their hous market   hous price have gone up about    percent in the last year   they view that as a hous bubbl  as someth that has the potenti to caus a lot of problem in the futur when the bubbl collaps   certain they are look at it that way rather than as a sign of a great deal  of op   on the contin  i attend a confer at the bundesbank   the gloom there is hard to pierc   peopl are extrem pessimist about be abl to come to grip with the structur rigid that exist  they don   t know how they will ever get a polit agreement on polici  given all the restrict rule they have   in germani  of cours  there is a lot of budget pressur    hey   re in danger of pierc the budget guidelin of a   percent maximum deficit   for what it   s worth  which is probabl not veri much  there are a lot of high fashion shop in frankfurt  and all the manikin are dress in black   the display are bare reliev by ani color whatsoev except for the christma decor in the shop  in term of the nation outlook  the  book forecast make veri good sens on a central tendenc basi   al broaddus talk about some of the downsid risk  but it   s import to understand that a central tendenc also has upsid risk   at some point in the next year or two i think we are like to see a lot of thing come togeth that in retrospect anyway might be call a boom or  at least  a    boomlet      there will be a chang in mood   i believ we will see posit develop in the stock market  employ growth  corpor profit  and other area come togeth at some point   that   s the histori in our economi  and i just want to be sure that that   s on the tabl and not forgotten   we need to rememb that that is a veri real possibl   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   follow on bill pool   s introductori comment  i want to share with you a comment that ed   made to me when he was on this committe   he said that  when we have meet such as this  the less there is to discuss the more there is to say    laughter   so i think i   ll just say my piec  to me the oper question  obvious  is whether the incom data should give us ani reason to rethink the decis that we made at the last meet   i   d say the answer to that question is    no      inde  a cautious central banker could easili say that the incom data are not inconsist with the main theme of slow but still posit growth in the near term and the   iew that the so call soft spot we   ve describ will go away at some point  lead to a gradual strengthen over the intermedi period  as i look at the incom data  they are clear quit mix  as other have indic   on  the one hand  we have had some posit news that attract market attent   retail sale earli on  initi claim  product surpris  etc   on the other hand  there was clear some negat  news as well   the recent ism index  nonfarm payrol data  and the unemploy number pop up slight   so  if one think of that as balanc  then the question on my mind is  whi am i as comfort as i am with the baselin forecast   i think the answer realli is that the way these data play into the financi market now make the financi condit much more consist with the kind of growth  the slow growth  that   s embed in the baselin  while the equiti market have been somewhat soft of late  it   s clear that sever week of solid gain in equiti market should certain play through to consum and to those busi that depend on the stock market as a sourc of capit   addit  the volatil of equiti price  while still somewhat high  has declin notic from the octob peak  again  suggest that investor have a somewhat greater sens of confid about the longer term outlook in the equiti market   accommod monetari polici and  as other have indic  like increas in the degre of accommod in fiscal polici should also support both the household sector and the busi sector  if one look more close at the two major privat sector segment of the economi  household and busi  one might also have some confid that the financi condit in each of those two sector are support of the baselin forecast   recent indic of household credit qualiti appear to be basic stabl i would say   certain not worsen   the still larg posit gap between the averag coupon on outstand mortgag and the current fix rate   uggest that refinanc are like to continu to be a sourc of strength for household go forward  though they may have slow  as governor olson indic  there   s still some room to run   subdu inflat and rise product should support increas in real incom as well  as will the continu health in the hous market   so  while some concern has been express about the household sector  i think the situat there look fundament sound  i   d say the same is true on the busi side   spread  while still elev as dino indic  certain have come off their earlier high   take advantag of these calmer market condit  busi have reenter the bond market in a veri major way and have reenter equiti market in a much more subdu manner   so clear busi have the financi abil to resum invest as soon as the period of haze or uncertainti that surround them dissip  final  with respect to this period of haze or uncertainti  i would argu that the passag of  e and continu gradual improv in the tone of the economi   absent a larg negat shock or war   should allow risk avers to reced and the outlook to clear   and with that i think busi confid is like to increas  base on those comment i would say that the risk around the baselin  against the background of the accommod polici in place and over an intermedi  term  e frame   certain do seem balanc   but in line with what presid pool just said  my sens of the balanc of risk is just that   that there are risk both on the upsid and the downsid   given how accommod polici is   from the standpoint of both current monetari polici plus expect with respect to fiscal polici   onc this period of uncertainti lift  there is a possibl that activ could pick up more quick than the baselin suggest   on the other hand  we don   t know how to factor in the issu with respect to corpor govern that may return to haunt us in a surpris way   and obvious  geopolit risk still stand   inde  a   eriod of relat slow growth where job are not be creat has  if you will  it own downsid risk   so  similar to what presid pool was suggest  i think we realli should be prepar to be flexibl go forward   we  may end up have to be aggress in either direct  but this seem like a good  e to sit still   sinc the market expect veri littl out of this meet and given the fact that it   s close to the holiday season  if we take no action today    dare i say it   that would not be a lump of coal from the market   s perspect   thank you  mr  chairman
i   m go to borrow a term that presid   use earlier   i  too  had in the introductori sentenc of my note that i think we   re in a    bumpi    period right now   the news sinc our last meet has been mix   as mani of you have indic  we have seen evid of the good news and the bad news scenario   product has been veri strong  and as a result  unit labor cost are fall  holiday sale start off well  and initi unemploy claim continu to move down   but on the negat side  privat payrol and industri product have declin in the last few month   the elect has us all think about chang in fiscal polici   we realli don   t know exact when those chang are like to happen or how larg the tax cut may be   in general  i   d assess the situat today as one where we are still stuck in our soft spot  but  mr     i don   t think we   re in the la brea tar pit yet  i want to comment a littl about my perspect on the product data   we   ve been talk a lot about that in the last few month   recent i had occas to meet with a group of senior corpor financi execut to discuss what they are do to get these product number   they made me promis not to use the term    multifactor product     and they would   ontinu to talk with me    laughter   i quick went back to my cfo jargon  and we got along fine again  what they said is that they are obvious in a profit squeez   they realli can   t rais price  and demand in term of volum growth is modest   consequ  they are focus particular on expens reduct   mani felt that their compani had quit a bit of potenti to cut expens  for sever reason   one is that in the late     s mani of these compani made a lot of acquisit  aggress get into new product line and open new store and plant   they were all so focus on the extern side of support sale that veri littl was done intern in term of ration their busi process  but that is what they are do now  basic go through a busi process redesign   i was amaz as we went around the tabl at the number who talk about elimin step in almost all of their busi process  from bill to procur  which has radic reduc their infrastructur cost   and becaus a lot of these chang don   t requir much capit  invest  either in the form of softwar or equip  they are get veri big payback on these type of adjust in their intern process   they are also redesign manufactur line   and they are get veri hard nose about final elimin the less effici plant or store that aren   t meet revenu expect   moreov  the general sens is that this cost cut can go on for quit a while  they all felt that they weren   t run out of steam yet and could continu to push this type of restructur to improv the bottom line   and in their view this was realli good news in term of enhanc longer term product growth   with their cost structur ration  two thing will happen when they  get to the point where demand is get stronger   first  it will throw more money to the bottom line and boost profit   more import  it will generat more free cash flow  which will allow   hem to fund bigger invest or acquisit when the  e is right   so as financi offic they were feel veri posit  they view the current period as a break of sort that has allow them to look intern at way to improv the product pictur   and i didn   t get a sens from ani of them that they thought they were run out of idea   in fact  they thought these endeavor had energ everybodi in their compani  and they were veri posit about the outlook for product for the next few quarter
i guess i   m bat cleanup again   at this point there   s not a great deal to add  but i   d like to reinforc some of the comment made by presid pool  governor    and governor bie about the upsid potenti for the recoveri  although the news has not been entir posit sinc our last meet  i think the risk of a doubl dip or wors has reced consider   consum seem like to continu to support the recoveri  and there are also some earli sign of spring in invest and in the labor market  no doubt      will go down as have been a veri difficult year for the economi  but in everi cloud there   s alway a bit of a silver line   in that regard i think that there   s some evid that the u s  privat sector has use the past six month or so veri effect to restructur itself and to posit itself for futur growth  on the real side  the product number we   ve talk so much about indic a great deal of cost cut  restructur  and consolid that will provid a basi for further expans   the weak in invest we   ve also discuss extens  the one hypothesi is that it   s the respons to geopolit uncertainti and other kind of uncertainti   i think part of the stori may be that compani  particular those in high tech industri  are still digest and absorb the invest they did in the late     s    learn how to use it better and look   or new direct and new opportun   there are in fact some  indic of recoveri in the high tech sector  suggest that perhap that adjust process is at least begin to wind down  lay the basi for a recoveri in that area  on the financi side  one strike factor is that mani firm have engag in balanc sheet repair   improv liquid  improv their debt structur  and so on   i think there   s also some  sens that the new corpor govern environ that fell upon us in the summer is begin to be absorb to some extent by market and firm   my evid of this is onli the general calm of financi market  the declin in spread  and the fact that we are begin to see some new issuanc in the market  i   ll just mention that  while still in it veri earli day  the new secur environ is caus both firm and govern to begin to adapt  with some adjust be made along those line   so  while it has been a weak year  the upsid is that a lot of restructur has occur to prepar for the futur  which may help to provid a basi for good growth in the next year  as i mention  the consum continu to hold up his end   if one look at the detail of the consum   s posit  it is not as bad as those in the media make it out to be   despit the up and down movement in the stock market  wealth to incom ratio appear to be stabil around normal level   incom continu to rise smart   and the refinanc wave has support not onli spend but also the consolid of debt  with the extract of equiti from home help to reduc and consolid credit card and other debt  for exampl   the labor market is  still somewhat of a puzzl  but it  sn   t seem to be deterior  and i think there are some ground for op  there    he main risk to the op ist recoveri scenario are larg extern to the privat sector   we   ve talk about war and terror  and there   s a lot of fiscal uncertainti as well as fiscal possibl   and condit abroad are an issu  i think our eas last  e was veri well  e   it seem clear to have benefit on the second moment of financi market as well as the first moment   as we go forward  i person will keep a close eye on the risk premium and other measur of stress in financi market that i think reflect a number of these concern   also  sinc our measur of output gap at this point are fair problemat  given the uncertainti about product growth and so on  i think it will be import to keep a close eye on core inflat  which may be our best indic of the output gap   overal  i   m quit happi about the outlook   though the pictur is mix  on balanc i think the inform that has becom avail over the last five week or so has been posit   thank you
thank you veri much   let   s move on to   reinhart
actual    madigan will give the monetari polici brief
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the tabl and chart label    materi for monetari polici brief      as background for your polici decis today  i thought it might be use to review in a bit more detail how market particip react to your decis at the novemb meet   on the eve of that meet  a small minor of investor anticip no chang in the stanc of polici  most look for a    basi point eas  and some expect a larger move  survey result suggest that market particip were essenti unanim that you would retain a balanc of risk toward weak  and market yield appear to incorpor expect that you would reduc rate by a cumul    basi point by earli next year   thus  the announc of an immedi    basi point move and a shift to balanc risk surpris market particip   as shown in line    column    of the    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix        irst exhibit  over the afternoon of the announc  the expect fed fund rate for the month of decemb drop    basi point   column    line   through    indic that treasuri coupon yield declin modest in the first few minut after the announc  and equiti price  line    increas a fraction of a percent   bond yield then appar react to the advanc in equiti and the impli spur to activ by more than revers their previous declin  and treasuri coupon rate finish the afternoon actual up a bit  column     market particip seem somewhat divid on how to interpret the risk assess   polici expect deriv from the februari fed fund contract  line    should not have been contamin by turn of the year effect  unlik those for decemb and januari  and the      percent valu deriv from the februari contract seem to impli that market on the whole did not take the assess as indic that the eas cycl necessarili had end   over the next few week  econom report and news bear on earn boost investor    spirit  and longer term polici expect  index in exhibit   by the expect fund rate for august   the dot line   move higher on balanc   over the past ten or so day  howev  investor saw the news as more downbeat   as a result  equiti price most recent have declin  leav broad index off about   percent on the period and pull polici expect back down   on the posit side  as a number of you have note  credit spread have fallen consider and liquid in bond market has increas  spark a pickup in corpor issuanc   thus  your novemb action could be judg as have contribut to a modest net improv  in financi market condit   with that improv and the outlook for the economi not too differ on balanc from that just after your novemb eas  market particip all but unanim expect that you will keep the stanc of polici unchang today   and a larg major report think you will again judg the risk to be balanc   a polici decis consist with those expect could be justifi in term of an econom outlook similar to that of the  book   the committe might find the gradual increas in resourc util and the modest declin in core inflat in that  forecast credibl and appeal   and even if it prefer a fa  declin in unemploy  it might be skeptic about it abil to calibr an addit dose of s ulus to achiev the desir small boost to growth and not much more  given the uncertainti about under trend and the amount of s ulus still in the pipelin   at the same  e  the committe might find the risk around that forecast still to be about rough balanc  perhap with the possibl of greater fiscal s ulus that presid   and other note offset the downsid risk stem from  geopolit threat   or  as note in the bluebook  it might see the current stanc of polici as rough balanc the low odd but high cost of mark further disinfl accompani by econom weak against the arguabl higher odd but lower cost of an unexpect overshoot of growth and inflat   even if the committe has a somewhat stronger outlook than the staff   which  base on your comment today    ppear not to be the case   it might find hold to it polici stanc for a while longer to be warrant  given the like persist of slack for at least sever quarter   if the committe convers is of the view that the outlook remain a bit too weak  it might choos to eas polici anoth quarter point at this meet   while credit market condit have improv on net over the intermeet period  the improv has been modest and perhap less than would have been anticip in view of the novemb polici move   and although the acceler in activ in the  book is plausibl  as was note it is still larg a forecast   moreov  the pickup is rather gradual  and some slack remain even two year henc   the result continu declin in inflat could constrain the committe   s abil to engin lower real interest rate should a negat shock at some point requir anoth aggress eas of polici   the committe might prefer to preserv a somewhat greater inflat buffer and make fa  progress against econom slack by eas polici again   a polici adjust at this meet  of cours  would surpris market particip   a    basi point move could feed through almost fulli to other short term rate  especi if investor extrapol the two consecut polici action  the respons of bond yield is difficult to predict  but an increas could not be rule out if equiti market ralli  as was the case follow the novemb move   of cours  leav the stanc of monetari polici unchang  with a statement of balanc risk  would be right in line with particip    expect  and market price probabl would chang littl in respons   as alway  market particip will be look care at the word of the announc for clue about the committe   s outlook   thank you  mr  chairman
i   d like to ask you a question about the path for monetari polici in chart   in the bluebook  which is right befor page     the chart in question is at the upper left  the  book path for the fund rate is abov the perfect foresight altern for about a year and then fall below it   i have two question about that   first  could you talk a littl about whi that path was chosen   and second  if we go for a period of a year  say  where the path is abov the perfect foresight altern  is there a risk that market might begin to think that our inflat object is below   percent     r  madigan   your first question relat to whi the baselin assumpt for monetari polici was chosen   i   ll pass to dave   for that
well  in write down the polici assumpt for the purpos of the  book forecast  i   m not sure i would choos a path that would be consid op   so to speak   if you gave me your object function  includ your object for both inflat and the outlook gap and your sensit respons  i   d be happi to use that for the purpos of the baselin  book forecast   i don   t do that becaus i don   t know your object function and i don   t necessarili want to inject the staff   s view direct into your current polici deliber by make it appear as if we are come to you with a polici recommend at each meet   so in some sens we   re tri to distanc ourselv a bit from the issu that you   re go to have to debat rather than be seen as advoc of a particular polici
but there is an impli view about polici
that certain   not leav us off the hook  we have to put down someth as a polici assumpt   so what do we do   where i think the  book baselin path for the fund rate deliv a polici forecast is that our baselin forecast put the economi on a path to get the unemploy rate back to the natur rate   and in the extend forecast   we get inflat down to about    percent   we do it  obvious  with a differ trajectori or differ  e of polici   with a littl more tight relat to the op  path in the near term and a littl more loos relat to that op  path over the longer term   but that forecast is still not inconsist with arriv at some rough equilibrium out there four or five year down the road
and that   s better becaus    r      again  from my perspect it   s more a polit issu than an econom one becaus i would not like to sit here at each meet and tell you that a particular polici is the op  one   i don   t believ it   s the staff   s role to say that you should be cut the fund rate    or    basi point  or that you ought to be do that in three or four step  or that you ought to rais it by a certain amount   but i think the  book forecast is use becaus it is not deliv a result that is signific at odd with what i perceiv to be  rough speak  your longer term polici object  in term of what would happen if we were to pursu this op  path  the market clear are not build in expect of someth that look like that path   if anyth  as i indic in my remark  they   re expect more tighten   so in our forecast when you don   t tighten to  the extent that the market current anticip as we move into the second half of next year and        that produc some ralli in the bond market   when the market see that the economi   not necessarili need that tighten   and they see you are not do it   they are go to revis down their path for the futur expect fund rate   i don   t think these action somehow result in a downward revis in the market    view  relat to current expect  about what your longer run inflat object is   so that   s a long wind explan of whi it is that we don   t use that so call op  path as the baselin for the project  i would just say  howev  that i   m open to suggest   obvious  we are tri to produc someth that is use for your deliber   but if i were requir to produc a forecast that involv take a strong stand on exact what the committe   s object function look like  that would be a task fraught with difficulti for me
i think one could also say that the mechan applic of the polici made under a perfect foresight rule suggest perhap more confid in the exact   tructur of frb us than anybodi around the tabl actual has   in particular  one properti it has is the abil for monetari polici to have an almost contemporan effect   a one quarter effect   on real activ   therefor  it   lend itself to a polici involv sharp chang in the fund rate   that   s whi we have to put in a penalti for smooth the fund rate   so i think the staff is in the posit of not know your object function nor know the median structur of the u s  economi that would togeth form  the op  polici path   the interest rate assumpt just tri to smooth through some of those problem
i agre  but there is an impli object function in what   get put into the baselin  and i think it had some interest characterist this  e
let me just say on this issu that i don   t think anybodi has to apolog for not use the model ultra precis   i alway look at the perfect foresight simul  and the main thing i was worri about this  e was what would happen if we lower rate now   would that be consist with the outcom that we would like in the long run   so if we don   t lower rate all the way to the level suggest by the simul  that  sn   t worri me so much   i think our polici has been rough consist with this model   we   ve lower the fund rate  and then at some point we will rais it   the fact that we   re not right on the button i don   t think is as much a stori as is the fact that we are do rough what this model would suggest
other question for     if not  this is the place where i usual hold court for an hour and a half    laughter   sinc i don   t have anyth to say at the moment other than what has been said around this tabl  i won   t do that today  and mayb i   ll get   redit    laughter   i would conclud on the polici issu that we should stay where we are at    percent on the fund rate and retain the balanc risk assess   vice chair
i support your recommend and applaud the breviti   and i hope that it will be imit by all
i support the recommend
i support your recommend and will put asid my two hour speech    laughter
i support the recommend   i was intrigu by the convers on the perfect foresight model becaus i am a bit concern that we keep aim the baselin of polici at an outcom that  to me anyway  has a littl too much excess capac for too long a period of  e   but i was veri taken with presid pool   s and governor bernank   s discuss of the upsid risk   asid from fiscal s ulus  i hadn   t realli given a lot of thought to other upsid risk   i am convinc that the risk are pretti balanc and that in fact we   re go to have some fiscal s ulus that may take thing in the direct my two colleagu mention   so i   m happi to be where we are
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  and i promis that i will never reveal that i observ the chairman speechless on one occas    laughter
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman    hairman  span   presid hoenig

i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   follow up on the exchang between bob parri and dave    i do worri a littl about the disconnect between our polici assumpt and market expect   so if there were an opportun in the statement to recogn that  with a term or a phrase  it might help to bring these diverg view back into better align   that perhap would reduc some of my concern about the downsid risk  although i recogn that my view on that is clear an outlier at this meet
i agre as well  mr  chairman
governor bie    s  bie   i agre with you  mr  chairman  and follow up on other comment  mayb you didn   t bank your minut  but we don   t know if you have rollov minut for the next  e
