at the outset i want to welcom toni santomero from philadelphia to his first meet   i assum that you have been given the various paraphernalia you will need  includ a fedspeak dictionari    laughter   our first present is usual indecipher even with the dictionari   i call on        laughter
all right   thank you  mr  chairman    laughter
that was meant as a compliment
at least i   m worthi of note   i   ll be refer to the usual packag of indecipher chart  which have been relabel special  in accord with your wish  mr  chairman
thank you veri much
the top panel on the first page depict forward and current deposit rate   sinc your last meet  both the current and the   month forward deposit rate have declin   and the current   month libor rate is about    basi point lower than at the  e of your last meet   moreov  the   month    month  and   month forward   month deposit rate are all more or less right on top of each other  yield     percent   if one assum the exist of some term premium  the fact that the   month forward rate is about the same as the   month forward rate impli that someth funni is go on  or at least that the market may be expect an eas or is fill with uncertainti   i think it   s veri hard to sort out whether this is one of those case where uncertainti about the state of macroeconom condit and fiscal and monetari polici in the first quarter of next year are lead the market to price interest rate for differ matur in a glob togeth   but implicit  it look as if the market is price in an eas in the further out contract   look at the euro area  euro current and forward rate have risen sinc your last meet   it is noteworthi that this is the first  e in the    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix      euro   s histori that those rate have move in an opposit trend from our forward rate for an extend period of  e   recent ecb muse and their bulletin about inflat risk push the rate up most recent   in the bottom panel on the page  you can see that the bank of japan final did it  rais their rate  as everyon know  on the   th of august  i think it is worth go back over some ground here   forward rate and current deposit rate in japan back up in late june as they have everi year for the last sever year  as all the contract start to incorpor forward period end date  the fiscal half year end in septemb  the calendar year end in decemb  and the fiscal year end in march   and that elev all the deposit rate as it has veri consist for the last sever year   they remain elev into earli juli  as the market began to anticip a bank of japan move at it juli meet   then with the sogo bankruptci just a few day befor that juli   th meet  the rate came off as the market conclud the boj wouldn   t be move in the event   inde  the decis was for no chang in rate  then rate began to price up in anticip of the meet on august   th when in fact the boj did rais rate   one point worth note is how much steeper the rise in the current   month deposit rate was than the anticip   i think that reflect the fact that tokyo banker have for the first  e in a decad had to deal with an increas in rate and how to price deposit in such an environ   turn to the next page  i thought i   d briefli discuss the plight of the euro   the top panel show the    year and   year dollar and euro swap rate and the middl panel depict the differenti between those rate  the   year and the    year dollar euro differenti  and in the bottom panel i have plot the euro exchang rate against both the dollar and the yen  sinc the start of may  the   year differenti has narrow almost     basi point  approxim half due to our rate come down and half to their go up   the    year differenti has narrow almost entir as a consequ of our rate come down  with onli a veri littl uptick in their    year rate   while the initi narrow of these differenti coincid with the euro   s brief ralli off histor low in may  at first appear the more recent narrow in interest rate differenti seem to have done littl for the euro   the euro has drift back down to it spring  low and was trade below    again this morn   i think a better interpret  look back  is that in all likelihood the euro would have been a great deal weaker had these interest rate differenti not narrow as they did   forecast for euro area growth have been revis up to around  and in some case even abov        percent  while forecast of u s  growth have tend to be revis down toward that neighborhood  just north of       percent   mani market particip  myself includ  had long expect that a converg of anticip growth rate and the eras of a growth   differenti would be the signal for a strengthen of the euro   but that has not been the case   i think european busi confid continu to express itself in a quest for outward invest  particular into north america   and the capit market in general have been mesmer by the grace moder of growth in the unit state and the continu product gain  both of which for the  e be are reflect in the strength of the dollar   on the next page  i have depict the four domest yield curv that i show you from  e to  e  those for u s  treasuri  interest rate swap  fanni mae  and the ford motor compani  on three select date   in   is the yield curv in juli of last year  in blue the curv on the day after your februari meet  and in red the most recent read as of last friday   most are notic lower than they were in earli februari of this year   the one except is ford motor compani   s yield curv  which is almost ident to where it was in februari   but i think it   s import to note that that is not onli fair typic of corpor yield but also probabl reflect the strength of issuanc we   ve had over the last few month   so that outlier is more like indic of a suppli effect than a market driven expect for interest rate   turn to page    i thought i   d briefli go over the impact of the announc we made in juli of the chang in our oper with respect to outright purchas   we announc on juli  th that we would tend to concentr more on outright purchas for the system open market account at the short end of the yield curv and lean more toward purchas off the run issu and limit our particip in the primari market   the top panel show the eurodollar futur strip for septemb and decemb      and for march      as background  in term of polici and macroeconom expect   the middl panel depict   year and    year treasuri yield  which you can see follow a more or less consist pattern   from the  e of our announc on juli  th    year yield did outperform    year yield veri margin until the auction of the new    year issu on august  th  when the relationship began to revers   but this behavior is realli consist with the econom data the market was see and with our announc that we would be buy more in the short end   those factor may have given a slight boost to the short end of the yield curv  but it   s veri hard to pars that out from the polici impact  the short end was ralli across the curv  as you can see in the top panel   in the bottom panel  i   ve depict one measur of the differenti between on the run and off the run yield in the treasuri market   here it is a littl easier to see that our announc had an impact   after juli  th you can see a narrow of these spread  there is a lot of nois in this   seri  especi as we come up to the new auction where the cycl will chang and a new    year issu will come into the market   but we did seem to have an impact  as we expect   we hope to avoid have much of an impact on the shape of the yield curv  and i think we succeed  but our announc did seem to affect the off the run spread   turn to page    let me go over our oper sinc the last meet   at the  e of your juli meet our reserv need were project to grow as a consequ of econom factor by a littl over    billion in the intermeet period  as indic in the first column of number  we expect to redeem about     billion net of treasuri secur  so that was go to add to our reserv need   and then  given our forecast of a slight declin in total nonborrow fed balanc  we thought we   d have to do about     to     billion in combin repo and outright oper   the next column depict where we were in fact through ye day  the autonom factor drain fewer reserv than we anticip   most of the      billion differenti between our forecast and the actual was a result of less demand for currenc than we expect   our redempt were somewhat lower at     billion  not     billion   the treasuri up the size of it bill offer a bit and that reduc how much we were go to redeem under our    percent limit   thus we had less of a need to add reserv than we had expect      billion rather than     billion   look forward to the next intermeet period through earli octob  we are expect autonom factor to drain about        billion  soma redempt to be about        billion  and our need from septemb  th forward to grow by about    billion   on the next page in the top tabl  the number in the left hand column are the one i show you last  e  indic that we purchas about       billion in outright secur from januari through june   so  in the first half of the year we purchas a littl over         billion   just in the past intermeet period we purchas         billion  rather aggress on our part   but under our new guidelin we thought that was manag and we did that   in the tabl below you can see that the averag level of repo outstand  with the shift in reserv need less steep than we expect  has declin to about       billion  in contrast to       billion in the period end june   th   look forward  i don   t think we   ll tri to buy anoth     billion in treasuri secur between now and your next meet   but in all likelihood we will tri to purchas someth on the order of     billion by your novemb meet  probabl do    billion between now and the   next meet and    billion from that point to novemb   obvious  as i   m go through this  if member of the committe have opinion on the appropri pace of this activ  i would like to hear your view   final  i might just note a coupl of other point  mr  chairman   at the last meet i mention that the treasuri was veri serious consid chang the bid rule for foreign central bank to curtail their abil to bid noncompetit becaus of the uncertainti that preferenti bid procedur give the treasuri in manag it cash balanc   as i said at the  e  this is overwhelm an issu of manag relat with the the treasuri did not announc that chang in earli august  as origin ly plan  in part to ensur that our japanes colleagu understood what was like to transpir and were comfort with the way we could work with them on this   this is a matter of some consider sensit   the market has becom awar of the fact that if the current bid procedur for the foreign central bank continu  by the middl of next year that will overwhelm domin the market  the market has realiz that someth has to give   i don   t think there have been ani leak on this matter
there will be no market if everyon is will to accept  the market price but nobodi has a transact
that   s right  mr  chairman   so the market is wake up to this situat   it isn   t realli an issu of the    year fiscal forecast   it is a matter of the matur schedul over the next two year   there is like to be a notic declin in issuanc about a year from now  as the amount the treasuri has to roll over declin sharpli   the treasuri and we at the new york bank are tri to work with both to ascertain their comfort level with this chang and  our announc of it   the question is whether to announc this in septemb or to wait a littl longer and work a littl harder in our discuss with the                     that is someth the treasuri will be decid in the next coupl of week   mr  chairman  the fund rate has behav quit well over the intermeet period  so i   m not even go to report on that   we had no foreign exchang intervent oper to report   i will need the committe   s ratif of our domest oper   also  i have sent the committe a memorandum on chang i   d like to make in coordin with the treasuri on the invest of the system   s euro reserv and i   m hope the committe will concur that this is a prudent thing to do   i   d be happi to answer ani question
i think the treasuri   s debt to the public is down to       trillion minus our hold of      trillion or so   and a veri larg chunk of the remaind is held by offici parti abroad   do we have ani veri recent evid on whether they are pare their hold as the treasuri liquid it debt or are contempl do so   in other word  in your discuss  or the presum discuss that you are go to be have with the japanes and other on the issu of bid  are you expect to get ani sens from them that they are go to be pare their hold of u s treasuri secur   or are we go to find that as the suppli of treasuri issu declin  the valu of them  at least to mani of the central bank  will rise   it is even conceiv that they would bid higher and absorb a good part of the privat float suppli   do you have ani indic yet of what is go on in that area
yes  in discuss with my central bank counterpart in other countri it is clear that a great deal is go on in that area   let me tri to distinguish a coupl of class of central bank   there are some central bank that have rather sophist foreign currenc reserv manag program   i mean that in a complimentari way  not a disparag way   they have thought veri hard about how they want their portfolio structur and have diversifi out of a simpl portfolio of treasuri hold   in that categori the                                     come to mind  they realli are rather distraught at the idea of a shrink suppli of treasuri secur becaus they alreadi have achiev their diversif out of treasuri in a way they view as op    so that   s one case where there is some concern about the shrink suppli  they don   t want to be respons for chase treasuri that are lower and lower in yield   but they feel a need to do that as it suit their portfolio  anoth categori of central bank involv one that are sophist but more aggress   i mean that in a slight less complimentari way   they are tri to generat as much  yield as they can  rather aggress   they   ve diversifi out of treasuri hold pretti  effect   and they will look at this as a veri opportun driven situat and probabl will shift as yield chang   i think of                                                   as the sine qua non of this group   which they want to leav in treasuri   they don   t want to chang that strategi   i have some grave concern  as do my colleagu at the treasuri  that                        left to their own devic  would bid to hit in everi auction in which they feel a need to particip   they could push yield lower veri fast if they took a rather mechanist attitud   we   ve done some analysi  which i   ve share with staff here at the board and the treasuri  and have conclud that at least over the cours of next year        we could work with author and perhap get them to diversifi their hold   what we are think about is essenti    percent of their hold across the entir spectrum out to    year  their current matur ceil   they haven   t gone beyond that   their current hold are veri lumpi   in some issu next year they could well bump up against the    percent legal limit the treasuri put on ani one bidder   you can imagin what would happen in a treasuri auction where    percent of the total was be bid on with the bidder want the certainti that all it need would be fill   that could realli move yield around quit a bit  so  at a veri mechan level  that   s what we   re tri to work out with the we are tri to work with them with the object of buy them anoth year of  e in which we could help them stay in the asset class of u s  treasuri  but diversifi themselv more even across all the avail issu outstand  that would buy them some  e befor they even need to think about diversifi into other asset class   but undoubt  there are other central  bank with smaller hold than                                                         which may be in the same   behavior pattern as the ministri  as you suggest
is there ani chanc that they would realli stonewal and just continu to do what they are do
yes  there is alway some chanc of that   but i believ has veri good relat with                                       and we   re hope that the offici from both countri will be abl to talk this through   i think the more junior peopl in understand the complex of this  and on that side of the hous i   m quit confid that there is no animos among the                                                     the staff peopl on both side have work togeth for a long  e in manag these asset   i don   t think the problem in            is stonewal but inertia   the                                       not move quick in the best of circumst   there may be some skeptic about our fiscal forecast   is it all pie in the sky   and whi do they realli have to bother with this   and there is a question of the sophist and interest on the part of the                                  to deal with this kind of chang  it   s a daunt prospect
it is   it   s sad in a sens
with respect to diversif of these hold oversea  have you seen foreign govern or foreign central bank move more aggress into gses or have they been move out of gses   i know some of them do hold gses   do you know how they have been deal with those hold
yes  there may have been someth of a rotat there  we have custodi of their hold of gses  but it   s been pretti stabl   it has not realli been chang much in total  some may have been driven to them and other were dissuad from think of hold them as the  singl answer to the problem by some of the statement about gses of the chairman and the   secretari of the treasuri over the last eight month   but it   s a veri delic balanc   they want to put their fund somewher in our market   and i believ they will take a more cautious attitud as to the amount of their exposur in gses   but mani of them are not in a posit to avoid that asset class   it simpli is not someth that make sens for a larg holder of fix incom product   but i don   t think their gse hold are grow veri rapid at present
i don   t understand whi the u s  treasuri should be unhappi if the are will to hold u s  treasuri at   percent or some unusu low yield   it would seem to me that if the market understand whi this has come about  it won   t caus ani troubl   it would just benefit the u s  taxpay
obvious  it   s not the level of the yield  which would be a save for u s  taxpay   it   s the lumpi of the                                  in one five year auction they might take down    percent of the offer and in the next one they wouldn   t particip   and we don   t realli have ani way for the market to get a transpar sens of what the                 are go to bid for   we have put detail about the composit of our portfolio on line  with week updat   i   m not expect the                                  to do the same in the near term   so it   s most a question of the disproportion size of their hold of individu issu and the fact that aggress behavior by them would have a volatil effect on our auction outcom
and  therefor  market yield
which in turn is like to have a negat effect on the propens of foreign    willing to hold u s  treasuri
yes  absolut   the feedback effect of make the market more volatil    more quick is a concern
with respect to the foreign exchang propos in your memo  is this go to be announc public or to the market in some way
yes  in due cours   it would need to come out in the quarter report on our foreign exchang activ that we produc joint with the treasuri   the announc effect is someth that i think the treasuri in particular need to be sensit to in term of our relat with other ministri of financ as issuer of debt   so the languag i use in that last paragraph about public announc has the type of word that we have been discuss with the treasuri for insert in the quarter report   my basic postur would be that if the treasuri think it import to preannounc it in some way  i   d leav that to them
i think it   s fine to do this  as we discuss earlier  as a housekeep item   but it occur to me  given the condit of the euro  that this could be seen by at least some peopl in the market as a signal that we may be more inclin and more will to interven in foreign exchang market than we have been in recent year   i would hope  howev it come out  that we would be sensit to that possibl interpret and not do anyth to reinforc it
yes  we certain don   t want peopl to think that how we invest our reserv has anyth to do with our intervent appetit   and we will tri to make sure that  howev announc  it is communic as    good housekeep    in our invest
i had to get that on the record
mr  chairman  i have more of a comment than a   question   it seem to me that a countri that has a current account deficit of more than   percent of gdp has to be veri concern about anyth that would affect foreign view about invest in that countri  as your comment a moment ago suggest   i think the likelihood of our be abl to lead the                                                 to understand what we want them to do and have all those convers be tranquil and pleasant is quit low   i believ we have to be veri sensit to the fact that   and those at the under secretari level at the treasuri have to have an ongo amic relationship with their                                         this may be a case where some of the heavi hit has to be done by peopl with fanci titl who will have to take on a more aggress  but i hope pleasant  postur in get                       to do what we want them to do   as your comment suggest  if we have a u s  treasuri market that is serious disturb  it could have a signific negat effect on foreign    view of whether they want to invest in a broader rang of u s  asset   until we get our current account deficit reduc  if in fact we do  that is an outcom we simpli can   t afford
let me just add to that point  in light of presid pool   s comment   the treasuri is motiv here by the cash manag nuisanc   they just don   t want to end up with more cash than they need  which is a result the foreign add on procedur has produc sever  e in the last six month   that   s also a nightmar for us   if the treasuri is routin end up with much more cash than they anticip  it make it harder for us to manag reserv   so we share the treasuri   s object   and they are tri to make clear to the                                     that that is their motiv  it   s a mechan issu that is drive the need to chang these bid rule   that is how we   re tri to present our posit   our postur is that i am then give them advic  as a manag of reserv  regard how we have gone about particip in                         and treasuri bill  auction                to avoid disturb the market   we don   t bid to hit   we tri to put in a reason   set of bid  and then if our need are not fill at auction  we buy in the secondari market   we don   t want to have an outsiz impact on their market   so we   re tri to couch the convers in term of collegi advic about manag reserv  given the sensit bill pool has allud to
further question on this subject
this includ the topic of the euro diversif
no  we haven   t gotten there yet   but if there are no further question  we can now turn to that subject  as you know and as   mention  he has circul a memorandum on the issu of diversifi foreign reserv out of german euro denomin instrument into other euro denomin instrument   i assum that this issu  which was discuss previous  is of interest to us   presid jordan  i believ you want to make a comment with respect to that
yes  first a question  though you may want to treat it as rhetor when i get to it   what is the current dollar equival valu  rough  of both the fed and treasuri hold of yen and euro denomin asset
i should have that number right in front of me somewher  but i   d say it   s about      billion at current market valu
the combin total of our hold and the treasuri   s of both yen and euro denomin asset
when the dollar is veri strong  as it has been  the valu of those foreign currenc hold goe down   that is a factual matter   i   m sorri i don   t have the precis number
the number that stuck in my mind from a coupl year ago was         billion  so if the exchang translat reduc that  that   s great   is that the right amount to have
i have no idea what the right amount of foreign currenc reserv hold   is for the u s  monetari author
well  that was the rhetor part of the question    laughter
i thought it might be
we got to this situat where we hold asset that are claim on foreign taxpay by way of histor accid in a sens   we somehow got here   and then  especi if al broaddus keep prevail  we won   t interven  which mean that we don   t add to that but we also don   t reduc it except for exchang translat effect   there must be a point where we should step back and look fundament at what it is we are do when we are hold claim on foreign taxpay as oppos to claim on our own taxpay   or  if the treasuri situat were to continu as the baselin forecast suggest  claim on some other earn stream   when a central bank hold the oblig of it own feder taxpay  as we do for the most part in our portfolio  it has monet that debt in the import sens that those pay the interest on the debt  the taxpay   are the same peopl who are benefit from those payment   that   s onli true in the case of feder debt and feder taxpay   it wouldn   t be true if we were hold agenc issu or state and local govern issu or foreign govern oblig   to have a strategi that say we   re go to hold claim on the japanes taxpay or the german taxpay or the french taxpay is someth that i think need to be address fundament   whi are we hold those and how much should we hold   when we hold debt claim on our own taxpay  they get the benefit from the monet of that debt   in the altern of hold foreign asset  again hold asid what   s go on with the exchang rate and result translat  there is a cost impos on our taxpay if the yield on the claim of foreign taxpay  japanes yen debt or euro denomin debt  is below the yield on u s  govern debt   so if there   s a cost  there   s presum a benefit   and sinc we    we  the feder reserv plus the treasuri  by our action or behavior are impos a cost on our   taxpay  we should think through what the benefit are on the other side and tri to keep those in balanc   i would think in principl that the answer to the question of what is the right amount involv ask to achiev what end   what are the cost and benefit of hold ani foreign currenc reserv   i have a hard  e get myself back to the point where it make sens for our countri  mayb uniqu in the world  to hold ani offici asset that are claim on foreign taxpay
there is a histori to this  as you know   clear  if the general polici of the unit state govern were never to interven in the exchang market  then the op um amount of foreign exchang reserv would be zero   the troubl with that  becaus the treasuri has the presum ul  author to determin our intern financi polici  is that treasuri chang from one administr to the next and polici within ani particular administr chang   so it   s veri difficult to get a formal polici direct precis at the question of the cost benefit analysi of what our reserv posit should be   it was a moot issu for a long period of  e becaus  as the dollar deterior through most of the period when we had reserv  we were engend capit gain and nobodi care   and if our offici forecast  at least as embodi in the  book materi  we will generat capit gain again   and one can argu that it may be desir to do that   but i think the truth of the matter  as you correct point out  is that everi  e we   ve endeavor to come at this issu in a formal polici orient manner  we have fail larg becaus it is not the feder reserv that has the ul  author to make that judgment   my impress basic is that it has becom an issu that nobodi wish to confront   and i guess that   s realli underscor by the fact that none of us know exact how much we have in the way of reserv  wherea   or    year ago i could tell you how much we had within     franc  swiss franc  that is  when we use to hold them   but i would gather that if the dollar   continu to strengthen and if the loss we publish  which are true or real loss  rise substanti  congress is go to start to react   it hasn   t   i haven   t receiv a singl note  question  or anyth of that sort in ani of my contact with the congress   and to my knowledg neither has the treasuri  but that  sn   t answer your question   mayb the thing to do  not now becaus we   re approach a potenti chang in administr  is to have that issu be one of the earli item on the agenda for discuss with the next administr
i would suggest as we all think about this  and we can   t avoid think about it becaus of surplus as far as the eye can see  so to speak  that we look back to the earlier practic of exchang of foreign asset with our foreign counterpart   i know it   s the treasuri   s call  realli   but if it were to turn out that central bank in other countri chose to reduc their hold of u s  govern oblig  i think we should at least be open to opportun to do an off market swap or exchang of currenc
we can do that now without refer to ani particular feder surplus or deficit   well  i grant you that if the treasuri were go to do it specif  it would
it would get to the question of the composit of our portfolio  what we have in  say  euro denomin asset versus someth els  becaus some thing might have to happen   say we wind up onli own claim on german and french taxpay but not on japanes  and i think right now whi we hold so mani claim on the japanes taxpay is an interest question   but if  say  an island off the coast of mainland china decid it want to reduc it hold of u s  asset  depend on what it want to hold instead  then an off market exchang might be appropri
you are talk about quemoy    laughter
that  too   i   m suggest that we be open to facilit  not interven  i know  in such a case by engag in an off market transact that would result in a reduct of our hold of asset denomin in foreign currenc in exchang for take their hold of u s  govern oblig into our portfolio   i wouldn   t want us to preclud the idea that those type of transact could be done
i think that issu realli ought to be on the agenda for one of our earli treasuri lunch with the new administr   we bring it up everi onc in a while with the hope that they will ration their polici   and we might as well keep tri   are there ani further question with respect to the euro diversif issu that   s reflect in     s memo   i hear no object  so i assum that you could proceed with that   we need a vote on domest oper
move approv of the domest oper
without object   also  in my enthusiasm to welcom our new member  i forgot to ask for a motion to approv the minut of the previous meet and i do so now   would somebodi like to move approv  speaker      so move  sever      move approv
without object   let   s now move on to the staff brief and the committe discuss   i call on dave   and    son
in put togeth this forecast  we had to address two central question  first  is the economi realli slow   and second  how much   it need to slow in order to prevent inflat pressur from    build   to jump right to the bottom line  our answer to the first question is  yes   and our answer to the second question is  not by as much as we previous thought   let me turn first to the question of the extent of the slow in econom growth in recent month   at the  e of the last forecast  there were onli tentat sign of the deceler in activ that we were project   sinc then  the evid of slow has accumul   inde  if anyth  we have been surpris more often than not on the down side   it still would be prematur to declar with confid that a durabl step down in the growth of output has arriv  but the odd of that event are look consider higher than they were a coupl of month ago   for one  the job market appear to have cool notic sinc last winter   to be sure  some of the slow of privat payrol employ growth probabl just reflect a shift in the season  e of hire induc by warm winter weather and strong overal activ   and  no doubt  there have been more than a few instanc in which hire has been held back by a lack of qualifi worker   but given the breadth of the slowdown and the absenc of ani appar upward pressur on the workweek that might be expect to accompani widespread worker shortag  we believ that a slow in labor demand has been the more import factor under the recent drop off in the pace of hire   on the spend side  tighter monetari polici appear to be leav it clearest mark on hous activ   start of singl famili home have trend down sinc the begin of the year  and the permit data give us littl reason to discount this declin   combin with a drop off in sale of new home and weaker price and product of construct materi and suppli  the data paint a reason consist pictur of softer demand in this sector   much the same can be said for motor vehicl   after the astound pace regist earlier this year  car and truck sale have slow consider  albeit to mere a veri strong pace  and inventori overhang have develop for a few model   at present  the automak are deal with these spotti problem by rais incent and move quick to trim product where necessari   inde  a drop in assembl contribut import to our project second half deceler of real gdp   outsid of the auto sector  real pce slow sharpli in the second quarter  and  although we are forecast a larger gain in the current quarter  the project increas in spend remain well below that seen late last year and earli this year   but here i   d have to admit that  with consum confid remain elev and with onli one month of data in hand  this    key element in our outlook remain more forecast than fact   given our view that the impetus to spend from wealth should be wane after about   month of relat flat equiti price  we are comfort with the underpin of our consumpt forecast   but the more subdu pace of spend that we are project is far from bake in the cake   in contrast to the sign of slow in household spend  busi outlay for capit equip have continu to surg ahead  one of the most notabl aspect of the recent annual revis to the nation account was that the invest boom of recent year is now es  to have been even stronger than previous thought  moreov  there are few sign  if ani  that higher real long term interest rate have put an appreci dent in the demand for equip and softwar   it just  sn   t look like this boom is about to dissip ani  e soon   this bring me to the second question    the economi need to slow   we still think the   percent pace of the past four quarter is not sustain   but becaus of our suppli side revis  that pace is not as far abov potenti growth as befor   with the revis data show a higher level of invest and with the near term indic point to continu strong growth in capit outlay go forward  we found ourselv forecast an economi in which the growth of capit servic will be high and increas   moreov  the annual revis portray a pattern of greater acceler of actual labor product  with the annual increas through the second quarter of this year in excess of   percent   there are a number of reason for discount the extent of the recent pickup in the nonfarm busi figur  but ani way we look at it  the perform of product has been phenomen   taken togeth  these observ motiv our upward revis to the growth of structur product and potenti output   inde  given both the mount contribut from capit deepen impli by our invest forecast and some further improv in the growth of multifactor product  we are project a modest ongo acceler of structur product        percent this year and       percent in       up about     percentag point from our last forecast   the revis to structur product not onli affect potenti gdp  it also has import implic for the demand side of our forecast   in particular  it boost the growth of real incom and spend and is the chief reason that we have adjust up our real gdp growth forecast by a half percentag point in      to   percent   this outcom might seem somewhat surpris in light of mani of the simul we have shown you in recent year   in those simul  fa     trend product growth typic caus growth in demand to outstrip that of the product enhanc growth of suppli  at least for a  e   as you will recal  an import channel for that effect came through the influenc of fa  product growth on asset valu and  consequ  on consumpt and invest   but our interpret of recent event is that while we hapless economist have been onli slowli mark up our forecast for product growth  the market and privat sector agent had alreadi been anticip this improv   thus  we are not look for ani addit increment to spend from a further product driven rise in the stock market   on net  our revis to the demand and suppli side of the forecast were near a wash for resourc util   in this project  we anticip the unemploy rate to rise to about       percent by the end of next year  just a bit abov our june forecast   by our assess  this remain too low to prevent a further gradual deterior in inflat   for this reason  our forecast assum some further tighten of monetari polici next year  as core inflat drift higher   of cours  major question mark continu to surround this element of our forecast   but we read the incom wage data as suggest that labor market remain extrem tight   virtual all of the data on hour compens have come in to the high side of our june forecast  decid so in the case of the eci  which outstrip our second quarter forecast by near a percentag point at an annual rate   although we have carri onli a bit of that surpris forward in our project  we expect to see continu upward pressur on compens   that said  these upward innov to our wage forecast have been more than offset by our fa  es  structur product growth  which has act to damp the rise in unit labor cost   as a result  the uptrend in price inflat is more gradual than we were previous project   we now anticip that core pce price inflat will move abov   percent by the end of next year  a coupl of tenth below our previous forecast  though still near    percentag point higher than it current pace   obvious  a wide rang of uncertainti attach to mani import element of our forecast   but the chang that we have made to this project bring into sharper focus the risk associ with our invest forecast   we are project some slow in equip spend from it recent pace in respons to rise interest rate and some deceler of final sale and profit    if the slower growth of earn that we are expect to accompani a period of below trend econom growth came as a signific disappoint to busi  there could be a sharper retrench in capit spend than we are forecast      the largest and most immedi effect of that retrench would come on the demand side of the economi  especi as multipli acceler effect amplifi ani slow of capit spend   reduc invest would also attenu the product enhanc effect of capit deepen on the suppli side of the economi   all in all  ani serious scale back of invest would risk some unwind of the virtuous cycl of invest  product  and price restraint from which we benefit in recent year   with the return to capit have been well maintain despit an invest boom that has last more than five year and with no sign that busi demand for new equip is let up  we are reason comfort with our forecast of continu strong invest spend   but clear  this is an area that will bear close scrutini in the period ahead   there are also upsid risk to demand associ with our outlook for the suppli side of the economi   as i note earlier  we have assum that much of the good news on the suppli side alreadi has been discount by the market   if we are wrong  and the enthusiasm of investor is rekindl by the pace of product growth envis in this forecast  a fed perceiv to be on hold  and no mark near term deterior of inflat  then a snapback in equiti market  with the accompani consequ for fa  growth of privat spend and higher resourc util  could present a more difficult environ in which to make polici     will now complet our present
after the  book was final last week  we receiv trade data for june   the figur for the trade balanc surpris us a bit   both export and import grew more rapid than we or bea had pencil in for june  with export show the larger upward revis   we would now project second quarter gdp growth at a     percent annual rate  rather than the     percent in the  book   the strength in june export is consist with the basic messag in the  book regard the global economi  econom activ in the rest of the world is expand vigor on averag   mani industri and develop countri have gone a long way toward close output gap  in some case elimin one that had open wide dure the crisi year of             inflat pressur  while for the most part not too far advanc  are begin to threaten in some countri   in respons  central bank in sever industri and develop countri have alreadi increas offici lend rate  and our  book forecast incorpor the assumpt of further tighten move      one notabl except in this general favor pictur is japan  although some sign of econom recoveri have emerg there as well   so far  that recoveri has larg taken the form of expand privat invest spend  and it seem fragil to us    japanes household consumpt spend remain restrain  although recent sign are posit   fiscal s ulus is like to diminish next year  as some of the element of the supplementari packag from near one year ago final have their effect but quick run their cours in the near term and other laps without ever be act upon   we see real output in japan continu to grow  but weak   the bank of japan move recent to end it zero interest rate polici  amidst controversi with other govern offici over whether the condit for such a move had yet arriv  we judg that the pace of recoveri in japan will not warrant further move in the near term  and in our forecast we have assum no addit measur by the bank of japan over the next six quarter   the project strength of foreign output is an import factor underpin our outlook for continu robust growth of export  anoth is the moder rate of declin we have again forecast for the exchang valu of the dollar  start next quarter   the fundament reason for this expect is the grow net intern indebted of the unit state and the associ rise total of claim on the u s  economi in foreign portfolio   but as the last few year have clear shown  we have no way of determin when the foreign appetit for dollar claim will stop expand   as long as foreign investor judg u s  invest opportun to be more attract than those elsewher  capit inflow will respond  and the dollar could well remain strong   one argument in favor of an earli adjust in the dollar is our expect that further monetari tighten move abroad are like in the near term  especi by the central bank of key foreign industri countri  wherea the  book path assum an unchang u s  feder fund rate until later in the forecast period    the project depreci of the dollar also act to slow import demand in the  book forecast   becaus our path for the dollar has a sizabl impact on the staff outlook  we includ in this  book an altern scenario use the global model in which the dollar continu to strengthen throughout the forecast period   in particular  we simul the outcom under the assumpt that the dollar continu to trend up and by the end of next year reach a level about   percent abov it second quarter averag   in that case  the staff model suggest that both gdp growth and core inflat would be about     percentag point lower in      than in the current forecast
or dave  the new  book assumpt for potenti growth and your forecast for actual gdp growth are  i believ  way abov the market consensus if one look at the blue chip forecast  for exampl   what do you think the chanc are that the baselin forecast may actual be accompani by a stronger foreign demand for our capit and also a stronger dollar   it seem to me that that would be the most like outcom  given these chang in the assumpt in the  book forecast   i think this is particular import sinc  as your altern simul indic  that would take some of the pressur off inflat
it certain is a reason whi we thought this was the right  e to includ that altern as oppos to some other altern   nevertheless  it   s not unlik the problem   describ with respect to the stock market   will   percent growth in      come as a big surpris to everybodi   in that case  a rang of asset price might adjust  includ the u s  stock market as well as the dollar   will it come as a surpris to some but not to other  and will it have a differenti impact on asset   we can   t rule that out in some sens   we   ve often seen news move the bond market and stock market in way that don   t seem entir consist  to be honest  i don   t know   i can tell you that most of the public forecast that i   ve seen do not have u s  net export in the current account widen the way we do in        and when i look to see whi  it   s becaus those forecast have much lower u s  growth than we have   so i have to believ that outcom  if it materi  is go to be a surpris to some forecast   but whether it will be a surpris to investor is someth we realli have a hard  e judg at this point
just to follow up on that   i indic in my remark that we hapless economist are slowli write up our forecast for product growth   i think the blue chip  forecast may be even more hapless than we are   those forecast suggest consider lower   potenti output growth than we have   that just  sn   t seem consist with what one hear
well  i   m not say that their forecast is right
no  but it  sn   t seem entir consist with the earn expect that one hear in financi market
but when they are more convinc about the truth  which is found in the  book  of cours  that would probabl affect investor    appetit for dollar
as both   and i indic in our remark  we certain up the risk in that regard   we made the assumpt that it has been larg discount  but we   re not total sure about that
you may have touch on this and if you did  i miss it   you have a veri weak project for hous activ in this quarter and also go forward for at least the next coupl of quarter   it   s import  i think  becaus that dip in hous activ is a signific element in the slow of growth that is forecast for the second half of this year  mortgag rate have come down signific in the last four or five week   i was just wonder if you have taken full account of that   or is that a risk in the outlook
we think we have taken account of that   it is still the case  obvious  that mortgag rate are up consider from their low and that arm rate also are signific higher than they have been   this is an area of the forecast where i think we have been somewhat surpris on the down side in term of the extent of the weaken   actual  in the next few month  we don   t have further declin from where we are   we have hous activ basic  hold at current level on the thought that the tip down in mortgag rate is probabl go to   provid  at least temporarili  some support for the current level   but all of the advanc indic still suggest that activ in that sector is like to be weak in the period ahead   there is certain some risk to that forecast  especi becaus we could get a temporari bounceback if peopl perceiv this as an opportun to get into the market and they rush to do the buy they had put off when rate were rise more rapid
we are hear a littl bit of that anecdot
i think there are upsid and downsid risk there as well
thank you   my question is for   on the intern side  but it   feed back on the domest side  i   m still not sure what i ought to be think with regard to develop extern to the unit state and how that feed back on our economi and  by implic  on our polici choic   there was the suggest that inflationari pressur may be emerg increas in other countri becaus of the close of gap and that  therefor  some tighten of polici abroad might be come along  which might tie in with a weaker u s  dollar  but of cours if all of the reason for higher nomin interest rate were higher inflat abroad compar to the past or to inflat in the unit state  then in real differenti term it wouldn   t have ani implic for the u s  dollar or for our polici action   you may have had this in mind and it wasn   t come out clear to me   if we thought that what is emerg abroad is all demand side econom activ  driven by whatev  monetari  fiscal polici s uli or someth  and that   s all  that   s one thing   but suppos we were to accept that some or a signific share of what is emerg abroad is suppli side activ  as we are now more increas incorpor into our think about the unit state   if we start to think that economi abroad were in the earli  stage of what we have experienc over the last four or five year  wouldn   t we come to a differ   conclus about the implic for the dollar and for the feedback on the unit state economi  your altern simul in the  book say that if the dollar is   percent stronger  that   s go to reduc our real gdp and inflat   well  that   s mechan   that   s becaus of the net trade effect   but that wouldn   t be true if what we are see  or if what we were will to think about what we   re see  whether it   s in latin america  asia  or europ  is more a suppli side kind of experi that is drive their growth  their product  and their employ
let me answer the question in two halv   under the assumpt that the same rule appli as have for year  i think in the face of rise inflat pressur  larg  if you will  from spend shift up in these economi  foreign central bank will bring about some  though perhap limit  increas in real interest rate   they aren   t just go to keep pace with inflat  they are go to tri to constrain it and they will have small increas in real interest rate  that is in effect what we were refer to when we said we see some increas even perhap as soon as two week from now   the market seem to think the ecb will act again that quick  although today   s news may have chang that   today there was a weak survey number from germani  the question of whether or not the type of technolog chang that have driven the u s  secular and cyclic experi over the past sever year are emerg abroad  and if so where and at what pace  is consum numer research around the globe   and that includ the peopl who work here in the intern financ divis   the clearest evid is in australia  if we want to cite a foreign countri as an exampl   the australian see it happen  we see it happen  and the world see it happen in australia   in other place peopl are look as care as they can and they are remain skeptic   there are some small place in europ where  we can see this sort of thing happen   finland  odd enough  is one and it   s not just stolichnaya    their vodka   but  as i hint in the chart show six week ago  we were look in various countri for ventur capit spend  we were look for the composit of invest  and we were look for the behavior of their stock market   we were look everywher we could for evid of it   it should be there at some point   one can make argument about whi featur of certain economi may make them slower or less like to incorpor technolog chang to their advantag as quick as we do   but it   s hard to believ that ani of those constraint could actual keep it from happen   could the electrif of europ have been suppress by some kind of bad structur polici three generat ago   i doubt it   i don   t think technolog chang can be complet suppress now  even with some bad polici   so we are veri alert to this   the fact is that in put togeth the  book forecast  we were not abl to find enough concret evid of it happen yet that we felt we should tri to factor it in systemat  i would point out that if i thought it were happen  i might be more aggress in lower the dollar  in the sens that the attract of invest opportun in the unit state has been cite as one of the more import factor influenc the dollar   so  if those who were do the save in the world came to believ that invest at home were on the cut edg  so to speak  i think they   d be onli too happi to invest at home   and that could caus the dollar to fall more rapid than we   ve portray in the tini depreci we have in the  book
i agre with the partial analysi implic of that last comment  but also our export demand would
it would benefit  yes
certain   i don   t know what those elast are  but that goe in the opposit direct
it    although on the whole  given that our current account has   worsen and yet the dollar has risen  we   re inclin to explain that by say the invest opportun mechan has been more import for the unit state over the last three year
further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   when we met in june  one of the key challeng that we face was assess whether the moder in demand we   d seen at that point was real   now we have tangibl evid in the affirm   both the anecdot report and the statist data confirm that demand growth moder from the first quarter to the second  today the question we face is whether the slow will persist or if instead we will see a rebound  as we have sever  e in the last few year  report in the seventh district suggest it   s more like that the moder pace will persist in the second half of the year   in support of this assess  the list of industri cite slow has increas and now includ retail  motor vehicl  especi heavi truck  machin tool  steel  aluminum  and paper   hous in the midwest had been do relat better than in the rest of the unit state  but recent it has move more in line with the slow that we   ve seen nation  as to al broaddus    point  we have not seen ani bounceback in the midwest in the hous area  in term of consum spend  most retail report overal slow  with juli sale mark by weak in apparel and strength in home relat item such as applianc and furnitur  one of our director from the retail industri indic that this pattern had continu into august  he said that back to school sale were disappoint so far   actual  he said they    stink      laughter   but custom were in the store and buy other item   anoth retail contact note continu but moder gain in sale of furnitur and housewar   light vehicl sale are down  from the exceed strong pace earlier this year  have level off at an annual sale rate of      million unit over the last three month   automak are not expect sale in august and the rest of the year to deviat signific from recent level   howev  inventori are somewhat higher than desir and incent continu to be veri import in support sale   one of the big three automak indic that it expect to reduc product level later this year rather than increas incent further   in addit  busi demand has eb or is at relat low level for some manufactur product import to our district   heavi truck maker  for exampl  note continu signific slow in activ  and some have announc layoff   product of farm equip is up somewhat from the low level of a year ago  but demand remain modest   due to favor grow condit  record corn and soybean crop are project for this year  which has contribut to lower commod price and extend the expect recoveri period for mani area of the farm sector  labor market are still tight in the midwest  but we   ve had some sign and report of modest eas   the unemploy rate for our five state has been drift up sinc earli this year and  while it   s still below the nation   s  the differenti has narrow   some contact in the retail and restaur industri note less difficulti find worker in the midwest  in contrast to this evid  the latest manpow survey indic continu strong demand for labor in the midwest and all other region of the unit state   hire plan for the fourth quarter are higher than in ani year end quarter in the    year histori of the survey   howev  our contact at manpow sens that there has been some eas in labor market  it   s a feel base on discuss with their staff and their client rather than on hard data   the manpow survey result won   t be releas until august   th  so they should be treat confidenti until then   turn to the nation outlook  the probabl of a soft land seem to have increas   over the last two month   first  there   s clear evid of moder demand   second  the news on product growth has been outstand   and third  core pce inflat has remain modest in recent month   although i still believ that the risk are tilt toward higher inflat  i   m reason comfort with the current stanc of monetari polici   one wild card  of cours  is the outlook for a continu deterior of the current account deficit   the good news for now is that our high product growth make the unit state an attract place for foreign capit invest   but as we discuss earlier  we must be mind that capit flow can revers quick  put pressur on the dollar and interest rate   that adjust process would be stress for the u s  economi and would increas inflationari pressur   nevertheless  my view is that the u s  economi seem well posit for a soft land this year

thank you  mr  chairman  the economi in our southeast region remain sturdi  but it   s clear expand less rapid than earlier in the year   i sens a grow caution and notic less exuber on sever front   obvious  the moder is most evid in hous  that slow is now even show up on the west coast of florida  which has been so hot for so long   moder in the residenti hous market now has to be consid convinc and not just a one  or two month phenomenon like we   ve seen earlier   retail also are give us a somewhat differ read this  e around   they tell us that while sale general continu to meet now lower expect  there are grow instanc where sale have come in below expect  perhap most interest of all to me are the comment we have been get from our banker over the last six week   there   s an amaz consist report from our larger bank of a falloff in loan demand across the region  and it   s report to be across borrow from mani sector  one banker report that his bank cancel it most recent loan review meet becaus of no  agenda   banker tell us that a number of project and spend plan have been put on hold until   their custom can assess where thing are go   i   ve had similar report from larg contractor who say they are see some project delay as owner have becom more cautious  some thing have not chang in our region   tourism activ and futur tourist book remain strong  although histori tell us that s one of the last place peopl adjust their spend   the oil and gas industri is final respond convinc to higher oil price  as rig count are now substanti abov year ago level and close to all  e high   and our labor market remain stretch with few sign of eas  especi for skill worker   despit this  wage and price general are not show a larg movement except for the passthrough of higher oil price and pharmaceut health care insur program cost  on the nation front  i would agre with the  book that there is evid  particular from the more interest sensit sector  that activ may be moder   and if one is will to look hard enough  there are other tentat sign of moder such as in the job number   overal  i still judg the economi to be strong  as evidenc by the strong gdp report and the continu strength in busi invest   although i think we all would like to have lock in the veri low inflat number we saw earlier  i view recent price movement as general constrain   have said that  i would join those who observ that were it not for the continu acceler in the applic of technolog and the associ product gain  i do believ we would be face a more troublesom set of inflat number and outlook than is evid today  while i think we can conclud that our polici move help nudg the economi in the direct of a more sustain pace  the question remain on the tabl as to whether we   ve done enough to damp aggreg demand and better align it with suppli   we   ve experienc numer shock on the inflat front   first  the damp effect of   the asian crisi  and second  the rise in energi price   togeth these factor seem to be work their way through the economi without yet engend acceler in trend inflat   i   m also convinc from our model simul that we did pay a price for our earlier reduct in rate dure the asian crisi  and that has been a factor in the upward drift in price sinc        i would say again that i still believ in preemptiv policymak   and if i fulli believ the forecast in the  book and some of our own var model work  i would be more anxious to get at least modest more restraint in place sooner   as we continu to sort out our view on reason assumpt about futur product and to identifi what portion of the general price pressur we are see and forecast is relat to the run up in oil price  direct or indirect  i think it   s reason to let thing play out a bit more   at the same  e  i think it   s veri import to indic that the balanc of risk is on the side of potenti deterior in inflat  as a remind to both ourselv and to other that our work may not be done   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman  the overal economi for the tenth district remain solid  it hasn   t chang a great deal from last  e   howev  there have been some veri slight sign of further slow sinc the last meet   in the interest sensit sector  particular home build  there is clear evid of some cool   also  manufactur activ appear to have slow systemat across the district in both the durabl and nondur good area   and while retail sale pick up in juli  the environ in that sector is clear softer throughout the district than it was earlier this year  howev  in the other direct  nonresidenti construct remain veri solid in the district and energi activ has expand fair signific as higher oil  particular gas  price  have persist throughout the last sever week   labor market remain strong in the region    unemploy rate continu to hover around the   percent rang   but have said that  there are no real sign of increas wage pressur   so  the situat is fair much the same within the district  on the nation level  my view haven   t chang signific from the  e of our last meet   the economi is carri momentum forward  but more sign of slow continu to come in on the nation level   and core inflat pressur obvious remain modest   perhap one way to describ our project is to say that it is veri similar to that of the  book except in a coupl of area   in our analysi we don   t have in mind a level of demand as strong as in the board staff   s project   our forecast of product gain is a bit less aggress and that outcom assum less aggress interest rate increas over the period   so  go forward  we see some modest slow in the economi and continu modest pressur on inflat   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   there are a few more hint of a slowdown in the new england economi sinc our last meet   region employ growth has slow recent  especi in construct  in the financ  insur  and real estat area  and in transport and public util   residenti construct contract have turn down  as have singl unit hous permit  and exist home sale have return to their      level   howev  it   s not clear in either employ trend or in hous whether this observ slow is fulli a demand phenomenon or still has some suppli characterist to it   labor market remain exceed tight  with sever new england state record unemploy rate below   percent and the rate for the region as a whole well below  a percentag point or more  the nation   s   everywher i go in the district  employ complain about the lack of avail worker and the potenti for fa  growth  if onli a greater suppli of labor could be found   similar  real estat broker report that a   diminish suppli of new and exist home is a factor in declin sale  though reduc afford is a factor as well  contact continu to report rise wage cost  though the region data suggest that wage pressur are off a bit from their high in mid        we also continu to hear report about novel adjust to tight labor market and increas invest in product enhanc technolog  firm report use out of cycl pay rais  higher start pay  and greater shift differenti  they also seek to offset these increas cost by reduc educ requir for new hire and compens for that by provid more train and use more sophist technolog   clear  they believ the task of both find and reward employe has becom more and more difficult  a major question for the region and for the nation as a whole is whether these sign of slow realli signal a trend   in that regard  i think the nation data may be a bit clearer than the local   in new england  while job growth and hous are less robust  whether becaus of demand or suppli or some combin of the two  manufactur is not   inde  while manufactur job count are not expand  they also are not declin as much as they were last year   moreov  manufactur contact are extrem op ist about demand  with one diversifi capit good manufactur describ busi as    sizzl      not surpris  this is especi true for manufactur of high tech equip  with one semiconductor busi report a    percent increas in revenu and a    percent increas in order for the second quarter over a year ago on the heel of an extraordinari first quarter   for some  this op  may reflect a sens of relief that thing haven   t been wors  given the interest rate increas   other  howev  firm attach their op  to the grow demand in foreign market  especi the asian pacif region   they also note rise input price  especi oil base input   but in general these rise price are be  offset by volum discount  electron purchas use the internet  and by a continu shift of   product to foreign locat  i   ve begun to host a seri of luncheon with region high tech ceo  focus primarili on the subject of product   in particular  i   ve ask the ceo who have attend to assess whether and when  if at all  trend in product growth are like to level off   and while these luncheon are onli in an earli stage  the comment from ceo produc veri differ high tech product were surpris similar   first  they believ that much of the chang to date has work to creat a platform from which further progress can be made or a whole rang of new product produc more easili   that is  product growth in their view is not like even to level off soon  second  they believ the action  in term of innov  is confin almost entir to the unit state  with not much take place elsewher   and final  they envisag an enorm array of opportun in their industri look forward   clear  these ceo are op ist about the endur and even acceler pace of product growth  as i look at the nation scene  and particular at the board staff   s forecast  i   m struck by the fact that the author of the  book seem to be in close contact with these ceo  laughter  and are increas op ist  if not euphor  about the potenti for increas product   while it is increas easier and more tempt to becom a believ in that outlook  i think some caution is warrant   move the growth of potenti from      to      percent put the staff   s es  well abov that of most other forecast  though recent dri seem to have drunk from the same water  when i look at our forecast at the boston fed  i   m struck by how power that assumpt about higher rate of product is   our forecast take more of a mainstream posit on potenti growth  somewher in the mid  to low   percent area  it also assum the second quarter slow in consumpt and hous will continu  and look ahead without ani chang in  polici   compar this to the flat fund rate altern forecast in the  book  unemploy in        is a half percentag point lower and pce inflat is almost a full percentag point higher with a lower es  of gdp growth  the  book   s op  about product thus make a larg differ in how one view futur prospect and how concern one is about the state of current polici   now  i   m not say that the  book forecast is serious flaw   certain  the detail and the care with which it is put togeth give it great credibl   but what if it   s wrong   what if the near futur bring slower cyclic product  which even the  book acknowledg is possibl  and inflat instead of trend down or sideway  depend on what measur is use  turn upward from it alreadi elev level      anybodi realli like the fact that the overal cpi number now start with a   rather than a lower number  even though oil is the main driver of the higher number  peopl do look to oil price in judg their view on inflat and how they think about the futur  or are we realli satisfi with the way the core rate has acceler over the last year or so  the cost of inflat get out of hand could be signific in term of financi market volatil and lost central bank credibl   wouldn t it make more sens to be less op ist about product and expect to tighten polici sooner rather than later   if we are wrong and the economi slow too much  revers cours may give market some confid rather than caus disrupt   it seem to me that at present there is a real asymmetri in the risk  where be wrong by use assumpt that are too op ist is potenti much more cost than take a more conserv  less op ist approach   now may not be the  e to act   some tighten is in the pipelin and the economi has begun to slow a bit   but it is also not the  e to think we can throw in the towel for the rest of the year
mr  chairman  the latest inform we have from our district is a   bit more mix than it was at earlier meet this year   on the one hand  factori output has remain at a veri high level in most  though not all  district manufactur industri   labor market are still tight   we have low state unemploy rate also   cathi  virginia s rate is at       percent and even in west virginia  which has perenni high structur unemploy  the rate is at about       percent  i believ   in fairfax counti  virginia  i don t know who comput this  the report unemploy rate is     percent   i don t know what the nairu is in fairfax   laughter  but that is a low unemploy rate   in general in this situat  in contrast to the point you made about wage in your area  tom  we are see fair widespread indic across the district of at least a moder acceler in wage growth  especi in manufactur   so  i think for the most part we still have strong product and tight labor market  at the same  e  though  like other we do see concret evid now of softer demand in our area than we had seen heretofor   retail sale overal are still grow  but sale of durabl good  big ticket item  have moder notic in recent week   in ask dave   earlier about hous activ go forward  i talk about the possibl of stronger sale   but residenti construct has been weak and home sale have been weaker in our area as well   that has had a particular notic effect on furnitur sale  which is a big industri in our region   and we are see some diminut in the output of the major furnitur compani in our district   we had a report recent that busi at a nation furnitur trade show  i think this was in dalla  bob  was about    percent lower than at the same show a year ago   and a former director who run a fair good size furnitur manufactur compani in we n north  ina told us that he has laid off all of his temporari worker   back in the second quarter busi was realli thrive  but now he has laid off all his temporari worker  is oper some of his plant onli four day a week  and is  offer discount for the first  e in a while becaus his inventori have been move up so   quick   so  again  i   d say we have a mix pictur in the district  with respect to the nation economi  rather than comment on the particular of the  book forecast  which seem reason enough to me  let me just offer a general reflect if i may   clear  the place to start today in think about the implic for monetari polici of recent develop in the economi is the remark recent growth in labor product and the extent to which that growth has continu to acceler   peopl use the word    amaz    a lot  but it is amaz to me   as the  book point out  growth in output per hour in the nonfarm busi sector exceed   percent in the four quarter end in the second quarter   that   s the fastest product growth sinc      when we were come out of the deepest recess in the post world war ii period   it is also especi strike given that the trend growth in product in the first part of the     s was onli       percent  nevertheless  in light of the wide rang in which product growth has move over the last decad  i think there is still a lot of room for doubt and uncertainti about the persist of it recent behavior and where the trend will ul  settl go forward   moreov  as we   ve discuss befor  product growth for monetari polici is a two edg sword   in the short run fa  product growth  of cours  allow firm to pay higher wage without necessarili rais price  which is whi a lot of peopl see the recent increas in product growth as a reason for us not to tighten polici further   but we know that rise product growth also produc a wealth effect   it is most visibl in higher equiti valu   even more import  it is also evid in household expect of futur wage growth   and they are rise   it is the magnitud and  e of this wealth effect that ul  determin whether the growth of demand over  e outpac the growth of suppli   that  of cours  is essenti the main focus of our concern   for purpos of evalu our polici option today  we need to know as much as we can   about the prospect evolut of product growth and it like impact on wealth and spend over  e   that rais a coupl of question about the recent burst in product growth that we are all wit and marvel at   first  how long will it persist and will it conceiv rise to an even higher rate than we have had to this point   second  to what extent has the surg alreadi affect household and busi spend plan   have they been affect a lot alreadi or is there perhap a lot more still to come   in other word  what is the public   s recognit lag with respect to chang product growth   you allud to this at least implicit     in your comment about how product may affect spend go forward   these question obvious are veri difficult to answer   but as i see it  at least  they are the core question that we need to be focus on now in make monetari polici decis at a  e when structur product growth is veri much in play   i think the staff can help us do this   for exampl  in the  book conceiv you could present some altern simul for trend product growth the way you do now for the fund rate and equiti valu   and you might discuss how differ recognit lag could affect the  e of the impact of these product chang on spend in the futur   but ul  econometr and statist analysi  i think  can onli take us so far at a  e when we are in a situat that is total unpreced  at least in the modern histori with which i   m familiar  at the end of the day in this veri uniqu period  i believ this committe is go to have to make some difficult polici call the old fashion way  by share relev anecdot inform around the tabl   we need to discuss what is happen and what may happen prospect to product growth in particular industri and particular region and then use this inform as best we can to make reason judgment about what   s go to happen to product growth in the aggreg go forward   obvious  we   ve been do this a great deal alreadi   but i think we  may need to focus even more clear and direct on these kind of issu than we have to this point    that   s my reflect   thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   sift through the recent data and anecdot on the district economi suggest that it remain quit healthi but that some chang are occur beneath the surfac   first of all  employ gain remain substanti   that is not a chang   labor market are veri tight and there is some continu upward pressur on compens   on the other hand  our contact say that signific price competit persist   overal manufactur activ is strengthen  although some produc are express concern about higher energi bill  and if that persist  i think it is a factor that probabl will affect output go forward   it appear that consum spend and residenti construct activ have slow a bit  but at this point those adjust appear to be modest in magnitud   in ani event  nonresidenti construct remain quit strong  we have made some inquiri recent about product and it prospect becaus some of our busi contact have express the view that the larg gain  mayb the largest gain in product  are now behind us   while some peopl adher to that view  i would say that the major of our busi contact remain quit op ist about the outlook for product and believ that further larg gain are in store   so  overal  we are hear a pretti posit  op ist stori in that regard  as for the nation  it look to me as if the u s  economi is on a favor cours   i think the outlook for real econom growth remain posit   as far as inflat is concern  our var model has no acceler of inflat over the next four quarter  it has inflat run a bit below       percent at an annual rate   obvious  there is a lot of uncertainti surround that kind of  forecast  but if it s more or less correct  it suggest that we at a minimum have some  e befor we   have to take further step to address that issu   thank you
first  regard the  book forecast  the board   s staff is appropri euphor about product    laughter   second  product growth is a good thing and recent product growth certain has not produc a wealth effect through the stock market  as for our region economi  growth in the eleventh district has slacken somewhat over the last few month  but it continu at a healthi and sustain rate   labor market tight  the impact of past interest rate hike  and a stall stock market are factor frequent cite for the slower pace   reduc growth in the interest sensit sector has been partial offset by the recoveri of the oil and gas industri  which is still in it earli stage   in spite of growth have slow from it breakneck pace of late      and earli       the texa unemploy rate at     percent is now at it lowest level sinc        i might reiter that in the major metropolitan area of texa the unemploy rate is consider below   percent   the rate for the state of texa is held up primarili by the border counti  but even in those area the unemploy rate have come down signific  the valu of construct contract in texa has been on a downward trend sinc earli in the year  have fallen    percent year to date   residenti construct is off slight but commerci construct is down sharpli   we are begin to see some diverg view on futur growth in construct activ   sever develop are veri op ist about futur demand growth but they have begun to complain that lender are    unjust restrain construct becaus they fear overbuild    a quick look at offic vacanc rate in an histor context suggest that the real estat develop may have a case   houston downtown vacanc are at an    year low  and in  austin rent and occup rate of    percent are at their highest level on record   the tighter   lend standard that bank are report in our lend offic survey seem to be reinforc the impact of higher interest rate  anoth area of slower activ is retail sale   in addit  continu drought has ad to the troubl of farmer and rancher   high tech industri  especi semiconductor  have been enjoy steadi sale growth intern sinc the end of the asian crisi   salari increas in the high tech sector  notabl in the dalla fort worth and austin area  are run at a    percent annual rate in the second quarter   and recruit are say that it profession can name their own salari   with h   b visa legisl stall in congress  the shortag of it worker is not expect to end any  soon   befor we jump to the conclus that doubl digit wage gain translat into price inflat  let s rememb that price of product such as semiconductor  comput  and peripher have been declin at a    to    percent rate for year on end  at the nation level  the economi appear to reflect the same factor that are affect the eleventh district  except that higher oil and gas price impact it differ   the more interest sensit sector of the economi have slow   the slower growth of demand  in tandem with constant competit pressur  has kept inflationari pressur in check   in fact  outsid of the inflat number in februari and march  there has not been a major inflat breakout this year  product growth has kept pace with compens gain  yield a declin in unit labor cost in the last four quarter   most commod price have been contain   gold has hover around a low      level and the dollar remain strong   we still hear as mani complaint about the lack of price power as we do about labor scarciti   i read this as evid that our monetari polici is appropri and that we can afford to await evid to the contrari befor feel compel to rais rate again
mr  chairman  the report around the eighth district are broad consist   with those alreadi note for other part of the countri   i would summar by say that the pressur is off but there is no sign that the economi is sink  one comment on the labor market   my up contact indic that his firm has had no problem in obtain profession and that for the first  e in sever year the issu of entri level labor has been success address   i had report earlier that obtain the entri level labor to do packag sort work had been a terribl problem for up   he note that the turnov for entri level worker is down to    percent as compar with    to    percent a year ago   so  the retent bonus and the referr bonus have done exact what the firm had hope they would do   our contact at both up and fedex also report that the intern market that they deal with are boom  i absolut agre with the  book outlook that it is more like that inflat is go to be creep up than drift down   and i would like to reemphas or echo the point that cathi   made  the reason for separ energi price from other price is to tri to differenti a temporari develop from someth that is longer run   but energi price have now been go up long enough and are like to remain at their current level  so that factor them out of our think and just look at the core cpi instead of pay attent to the total cpi i think is a mistak  i have a comment on the  book forecast exercis   i would like to see a forecast   and whether we call it a baselin forecast or not i don   t realli care  that is built as far as possibl on assumpt that are consist with market forecast   i think that is the case with oil price now  the assumpt for oil price is essenti what is in the futur market   i would like to see that basi for assumpt carri through wherev it can be   for exchang rate  that is not the  assumpt in the staff project   we can debat what the long run cours of exchang rate may   turn out to be   but to have a forecast for exchang rate over the next year or    month that differ with the market forecast is perhap not the most product way to assess the outlook becaus we don   t know when these long run forc will begin to take hold   at ani rate  i would like to see a  book forecast that is base on the market forecast for exchang rate   and i would say the same about the forecast for the feder fund rate   there is a substanti diverg now between the feder fund assumpt in the  book forecast and the feder fund assumpt that is built into market data   and unless we know where that differ is come from  it seem to me that we may not be get the most we possibl can out of the market evid that is in front of us  i   m uneasi about build the  book forecast on the assumpt of acceler product   product has acceler  the growth rate has been rise   but to project the rise into the futur i would say is a riski proposit   it may well be correct  but we know so littl about product and the under econom of product determin that to base a  book forecast on an assumpt of acceler product seem to me a rather riski bet   sort out what is temporari and what is perman is a veri difficult problem  and for the most part with product we are just extract observ from the recent past   to project ever increas product could  in my view  mislead us   that is all i want to say at this point
thank you  mr  chairman   not surpris  in mani respect recent develop in our district are veri similar to those     report for his district   i won t cover them in detail becaus mani of my remark would be a repetit of what he alreadi said   the most comment on develop in the district in the last coupl of month has been the slow in the motor vehicl sector  with the declin in larg truck product most pronounc   part supplier and truck compani are report substanti declin in new order   some are   say order are down    percent   so  some worker have alreadi been laid off and  more import  addit layoff are expect   layoff have not yet occur in auto assembl plant  but over  work for autowork has larg disappear in the district  residenti construct activ has declin  most notic in the low  and moder incom rang   within the district  build in we n pennsylvania is hold up best  mayb becaus that region was lag earlier  wherea contact from a number of metro area in ohio and kentucki have report what they consid to be overbuild   commerci real estat construct is said to have slow to a more sustain pace   both develop and banker claim that dure the cours of the past year a pronounc element of caution and restraint has crept into their previous op  about new develop and new project   they claim that the banker have realli tighten condit by demand more equiti in ani new project that is about to get under way  so  the real estat profession believ that widespread overbuild has not occur in the district  banker assert that the pipelin of new loan is start to empti out   and the banker on our board of director say that they are revis downward their project of earn asset growth for the balanc of this year  and their expect is that it will be soft next year  with increas frequenc we hear from manufactur compani locat in the district that their op  about the prospect for export pretti much balanc out their more pessimist view about domest demand   as i reflect on some of the comment that we were hear from these compani  what was notic absent  but i didn t think to ask about it at the  e  was concern about competit   there was no suggest or hint that the valu of the dollar or exchang rate level or anyth like that was influenc their abil to sell   their comment  main were about how strong these foreign economi are go to be and how much of the market   their firm could servic  report about retail spend have fluctuat wide in the last coupl of month   the onli thing that seem clear about the retail sector is that the uniform strong report that we were hear earlier have stop   the one sector where labor market condit continu to be veri tight or even tighter is health care   contact in the health care field say that they are tell employ to expect sever year of doubl digit increas in the cost of their medic plan   a disturb trend is that smaller employ report that they are offer young worker the option of higher wage in exchang for forgo ani medic coverag  at a recent small busi advisori council meet almost all particip said that they expect inflat over the next two year to be somewhat higher than it has been on balanc in the past coupl of year   most appar felt that wage and benefit cost would rise more rapid  but on other issu their view were somewhat divid   some suggest that continu product gain would keep pace with these higher labor cost   other suggest that their earn were go to be under pressur becaus product would not keep up   and they were equal split on whether or not they could be success in pass along unavoid cost increas  main labor cost  to their custom  turn to nation and intern prospect  i alway look forward to the meet after this one each year becaus that is when the staff add anoth year to the forecast horizon   i don t underes  at all how difficult that is  but to me two year or so is the right horizon to be think about in term of the current stanc of polici or even possibl near term polici action   i think it is import to get us think about what kind of environ we re go to face in the year after next year   it is sober and humbl to think back to the august meet two year ago  when the  russian were in the process of default that veri day  and what we went through in the   subsequ two year to get to where we are today   we have seen oil price at     or      we ve seen oil price at     plus   we ve seen develop in credit market and foreign exchang market that none of us would have been abl to forecast  let alon be sure about what the right polici respons should have been   so  i think we have to be veri open to the idea that there will be a lot of unexpect event   my own view is that these surpris are more like to be on the intern than the domest front over the next two year horizon  three month ago  when we last rais rate  i would have put mexico veri high up on my list of worri   now  three month later  and mayb i m just be total nave  the situat there seem to have chang dramat for the better and i would put it well down on my list of worri   but i could be wrong   we may get through the inaugur of their new presid and a transit and find out that someth was there that we couldn   t see   but when i look around elsewher for thing to worri about that may be differ in way that i could not possibl imagin  i think the domest fiscal side is go to be differ   and the report i read last night about how to think about u s  fiscal polici altern did not comfort me   i believ the fiscal stanc we have had recent of increas govern save has been s ul to at least one sector of the unit state   s economi  the invest sector   i find it difficult to think about increas spend  reduc tax revenu  and smaller surplus or even deficit as be s ul in an overal sens  it may be toward certain part of the economi  but i can t think of it as be s ul to the busi invest sector   so  over the come two year horizon it seem to me that we have to be will to think about fiscal impuls more flexibl than what was suggest in the materi i was read last night   when i look at the issu that was rais earlier about japan and the concern there  we   know that someth is go to happen in the next   to       year   i don   t know what baselin assumpt we should make  but someth is go to happen   polit it is alreadi start  how fast it will go is anybodi s guess   anybodi s is better than mine   we know that develop in europ are go to be quit differ than they have been in the past   the launch of the euro in currenc form a year from decemb will be a veri signific landmark develop if it happen  or even if it  sn t   and to get from here to there what has to be done in germani  belgium  itali  in a lot of these countri  could be social and polit veri  veri divis and difficult   as i said  i don t know what the right assumpt is to make   but i think it would be use to the committe in our octob meet  when we look out through the end of       for the staff to consid a wide array of possibl event and assign some probabl to them  and see where we come out on them   we ought to be prepar to be flexibl and humbl about our abil to forecast what is go to happen over the next two year
thank you  mr  chairman   in the philadelphia district busi condit have been mix recent  with improv in some sector and slow in other   in mani respect district develop are similar to what we have heard around the tabl this morn but with some interest differ  the pace of manufactur activ has pick up after a two month paus   on the other hand  recreat and tourism has remain strong as summer spend has hit the region   certain the hotel in the region got a boost from the polit convent  fill them to capac   but in fact the evid is broader than that about a good season for our recreat area   growth in retail sale in the region has flatten out this summer  although discount store and specialti store did  better than depart store   and most auto dealer in the region indic that sale have slow   this month   on the construct side  residenti  commerci  and public construct activ  although still strong  has been somewhat reduc in strength over the last sever month   the number of new construct project come into the pipelin is begin to declin   and industri contact report that while vacanc rate are low and real estat price and rent are rise  there has been a lot of caution  particular in our urban center  again note philadelphia in that mix  bank lend continu to rise moder  but with some slow on the consum side  includ residenti lend and non credit card consum spend in general   busi lend continu to be strong  howev   labor market remain tight  with our region s unemploy rate slight below the nation   s in the most recent month  and that is unusu   but report of outsiz increas in wage and sign bonus seem to have becom less widespread than earlier this year  more retail in philadelphia and in pennsylvania more general are report that they are see increas cost and are pass them on in the retail network   that s not true  howev  on the manufactur side   our busi outlook survey in august still show a veri high index for price paid by manufactur  but the survey indic that the index of price receiv by manufactur declin this month to it lowest level for the year   the manufactur are still have difficulti pass on input cost to final custom price   busi and bank general expect moder growth for the remaind of the year  turn to the nation  we too see mix signal in the recent nation econom data   on balanc these data suggest to us a moder in the pace of final demand that is move the economi toward a more sustain growth path   even though the economi remain strong and the labor market remain tight  recent consum and produc price measur indic that inflationari pressur are not as strong as they were in the first quarter   i also note with interest the  book s  latest upward revis in the trend growth of product and potenti gdp   i do think that the   outlook for core inflat is not as worrisom as it look sever month ago when i was first decid on this posit   i also am encourag by the fact that longer term expect inflat has been quit stabl  as indic in the releas of our feder reserv bank survey of profession forecast and the michigan survey   the stabil of these measur of long term expect inflat suggest that peopl believ that the fomc will keep inflat under control and lead me to conclud that the fed is not behind the curv in this regard  in sum  sign of slower growth are encourag  especi sinc we have not yet seen the full effect of the increas in the fed fund rate and the discount rate that have alreadi been put in place over the last year   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   recent indic suggest that econom growth in the second district has slow sinc the last report   price pressur persist but have yet to show up in ani broad base measur of consum price   unemploy rate in the district were mix in juli  rise from     percent to     percent in our part of new jersey  but fall from     percent to     percent in the state of new york   total payrol employ was pull down by declin in the public sector  reflect both a wind down of the      census and a substanti drop off in summer job program throughout the state  in the privat sector  job growth has moder a bit in recent month   in juli privat sector employ grew at a     percent annual pace  that is down from     percent in the second quarter and     percent in the first quarter   most retail indic that overal sale continu to run somewhat below plan sinc the last report   our contact report that an unseason cool summer  actual we didn t have to talk to our contact to find that out  laughter   has held down sale of  summer wear and air condition  lead to some buildup of inventori and veri steep   markdown  the district s real estat market have been mix  with sign of slow in the residenti sector   but in the commerci sector new york citi s shortag of offic space show no sign of abat  with rent continu to spiral upward   midtown manhattan s offic avail rate was littl chang at an extraordinarili low     percent at the end of juli  downtown   s rate was steadi at       percent   both of those figur are less than half of what they were just a year ago   not surpris the surg in ask rent has been stun   they have been rise at an annual rate of near    percent over the past three month and are rough    percent higher than at this  e last year   most of the leas activ is report to be come from the high tech  financi  and telecommun sector   in residenti hous  there is a definit slowdown around the district in general   in upscal manhattan  that is main reflect in the fact that bid war are less frequent and upscal apart stay on the market for as long as three week instead of about three minut as was the case about six month ago  the region purchas manag    survey suggest continu improv in busi condit in juli and some moder in price pressur   the consum price index for metropolitan new york citi rose     percent over the    month end in juli  which is slight higher than at the end of june when it was up     percent   the rise main reflect a sharp increas in energi price   electr cost in new york citi and the lower hudson valley surg in juli  with the averag custom   s bill up    percent from a year earlier   given that juli of      was  i believ  one of the hottest on record and juli of this year one of the coolest  one can imagin how larg the increas was per btu   loan demand in the district is slack off somewhat   so  in general there is a feel that the economi in the district is still pretti robust but slow somewhat   on the nation level  recent data indic that growth of consum spend has   moder  while hous start and sale are declin   for the second half of      we expect growth to averag about   percent  down from   percent in the first half   we continu to expect some further slow of growth in      to around       percent  larg becaus we think there is a fair amount of monetari polici tighten still in the pipelin   the continu acceler in product growth has led us to adjust upward onc again our es  of the economi s potenti  we now have it at       percent   with growth substanti below potenti over the forecast horizon  we expect the unemploy rate to begin rise later this year  eventu reach about       percent by the end of        that has led to a signific scale back of the project rise of core inflat in our forecast   we now have it at     percent q  q  for       down a full     percentag point from our forecast in june   although growth appear to be moder and the continu acceler of product has damp inflat project  we think the balanc of risk continu to be in the direct of concern about inflat   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet we decid to wait and see whether the     basi point of tighten that we had put in place was have the desir effect on the economi   i believ the incom data  as other have suggest  are general support of the wisdom of that postur and do suggest some slow is in train   clear  the interest sensit sector have shown some notic slow   more broad  it seem as though the job market has gone from super hot to what i would describ as sort of warm   the pace of job growth seem to have slow from about         per month dure the first four month of the year to an averag of about         dure the more recent four month   and final  the data suggest  that busi are boost inventori  which might be an indic that perhap demand is not   top suppli  if one take a longer perspect  i am fair comfort  as other also have indic  with the chang that the staff has introduc with respect to product growth   i come to that view for a number of differ reason   first  output of and invest in inform communic technolog continu to be the most robust portion of gdp growth   second  i too have had some convers with peopl from silicon valley who have work veri hard to convinc me that more is still to come on the product front  as a few of the presid have mention   obvious we will have to wait to see if that is the case   third  ventur capit fund still seem to be flow into these newer area  suggest that the invest communiti is also notic that someth special is go on there and they continu to be support of it  the staff has work fair hard to inform us of the risk surround this assumpt  and i think at least one other person has mention that   but  like the staff  i also note that the equiti market have been rise gradual in the recent past as oppos to at a torrid pace  and so perhap the wealth effect is not feed demand as strong as it had been befor  final  look to market data  base on the    year tip it seem as though expect in the market with respect to inflat are relat subdu  and i think that is also good news   have said that  i agre with other that the risk still continu to be main on the up side  and i   d cite two or three reason for that   first  obvious  consum are confid and labor market continu to be tight by histor standard   second  in that context  i do note that some analyst think the recent slowdown in privat employ growth might be attribut not to an eas in labor demand but rather to a tighten of labor suppli constraint   they support that content by the fact that much of the slowdown in growth has come not from interest sensit  good produc sector but rather from the servic sector   but when one look behind that  one   see that where the growth has been slow is in the servic sector and in fire  which obvious includ real estat  and also in the personnel suppli sector   so  that strike me as a bit mix   i might also say in this vein that the eci obvious should have given us some paus  but i think the staff is right in suggest that perhap some of that is simpli a reflect that this increas in product is be share with labor as well as with capit  a more serious concern with respect to the inflat outlook  it seem to me  is that financi condit have in fact eas a littl sinc our last meet   real interest rate fell over the intermeet period  and inde real interest rate for invest grade borrow appear to be up onli about   percentag point sinc may        so  in some sens our credibl  if you will  is lead perhap to a bit of leakag in our effort with respect to tighten   howev  my concern about accommod financi condit is temper a bit by the fact that net borrow from nonfinanci busi appear to have slow in juli from the rapid pace of the second quarter  also  at least compar to june  the composit of that borrow has shift back to bank  and bank are report a tighten of standard and a firm of term on busi loan   and  as a few of you have indic  it may well be that the demand for loan is skew back  final  i think we should note that there has been in this meet and certain in other some discuss of the nairu   and on that topic i   d like to share an observ from a well inform citizen about what she describ as the    nehru      this was in fact my wife   she want to know whi this committe continu to focus so much on the style of a man   s jacket that was onli popular for a few year in the     s    laughter   i said to her that some econom question realli can not be answer   but in a more serious vein  it   suggest that those who want to couch their  analysi in the term of the nairu clear have an extra strong burden of communic   thank   you veri much
thank you  mr  chairman   usual at these meet we are appropri forward look  but today i would like to tri someth differ   i want to look back into the past to see if we can learn anyth  and in my comment i am go to refer to a tabl that is be pass around    the great american inflat start in mid to late        while policymak and analyst did not have a core pce index at the  e  we can construct one in hindsight   it show that the core pce was quit stabl until the first part of      befor begin a stair step upward pattern where it rose for a while  stabil  and rose more befor the climb eventu end in doubl digit level   other indic of inflat that were then avail follow a rough similar pattern  we know from orphanid    work that both policymak and analyst general felt that the unemploy rate target  in defer to governor     s wife  this was befor the nairu concept was invent  was around   percent   basic  policymak felt the nairu was   percent  it turn out to be a lot higher  and polici prove to be excess expansionari   one could make a superfici comparison to today   today the fomc is behav as if nairu is around   percent despit warn that it is higher from the  book  from some privat economist  and inde from some member of this committe   the question then becom whether the fomc might now be make the same mistak that it made back in the     s   i for one have consist had privat guilt feel that we could be   henc i want to look backward and see what the evid say     a copi of the tabl use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix     the tabl that you should have by now give some number that compar the chang in   various key inflat indic between earli      and late      in the first column and between q       and q       in the second column   in make this comparison i do not mean to critic the fomc of the     s   we have sever import advantag today   we have better diagnost data  we have fiscal polici work to fight inflat  and we don t have presidenti critic of interest rate increas   i make this comparison simpli to examin similar and differ from the earlier period when we know that inflat took off  the tabl suggest the follow   in the earlier period the core pce  which as i said has been reconstruct from hindsight  went up by about a point in about a year   s  e   now it has risen by just one third of that   we have discuss the reason for the recent rise  and at least at this point i think there is agreement that relat littl of this rise reflect true acceler   unit labor cost rose sharpli in the earlier period larg becaus of a sharp rise in wage   product actual went up slight at that  e   in the recent period  we know that unit labor cost have been drop  with a slight rise in wage more than offset by a sharp rise in product   in the michigan survey   year inflat expect rose by two point in the earlier period and by one fifth of that now   but even these   year expect could be mislead for the recent period becaus long term    year inflat expect have been veri stabl  a seri that was not avail back then   nomin    year treasuri rate rose by   basi point then and    basi point now   but a more meaning measur is the spread between nomin and real    year yield  up just    basi point in the recent period   again this nomin real spread could not be measur back in the mid     s   this backward look show that in mani respect the earlier period look just as one would expect in a world where inflat was gradual increas   in each of these respect  the recent period look veri differ   the fomc may be   make a mistak now   we obvious can   t yet claim the contrari  but the risk that inflat is acceler seem far less now than it did back in        my polici advic follow from this analysi   our earlier rate increas  along with other factor  seem to have slow the growth of aggreg demand to rough accept level   whether we should be tighten further depend on whether we think the unemploy rate is below nairu or that product and good market are too tight   market clear seem to have been too tight in the mid     s   if we should see evid indic that situat now  in anyth like the form that exist dure the mid     s  i   d be the first in line to argu for tighten polici   but at this point i feel the evid is simpli not there  for now  as at the last meet  i   m comfort just watch the situat until we see more evid that inflat is acceler   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m go to focus my remark this morn entir on product  specif on the implic for the outlook of the appar further acceler in structur product growth   if i had a titl  i think it would be    in celebr of acceler product      i   m go to use a handout a littl later in my remark  or at least the first two page of my handout  but pleas  no peek yet     as it turn out  i   m go to respond direct to governor   who said that those of us who character our view of the econom outlook and challeng for monetari polici in term of nairu have a veri heavi burden in term of communic   i think he   s absolut correct  and i rise to the challeng    laughter   to me the most import develop sinc our last meet were the revis to the path of product over the last sever quarter and the higher    a copi of the materi use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix     than expect valu of product in the second quarter   likewis  the most import part of the   revis to the  book forecast for me relat to product   they were the upward revis to the assumpt about structur product growth and the interest decis to build into the forecast a further acceler in structur product  as impli by the capit deepen path associ with the staff forecast  now  i think presid pool made a veri worthwhil point about the need for caution in extrapol product acceler go forward   but i rather like what the staff did in this case becaus it made their forecast more intern consist   they have a path of capit spend  they have an assumpt about capit deepen   and what they realli did was to endogen their project of product to keep it consist with the capit deepen go on in the model  still  as other have point out  it probabl would be use to have altern scenario with differ product path sinc this is so veri import to the outlook  let me now turn to an interpret of the  book forecast   what is happen in this forecast is that the staff has revis upward the path of both actual and potenti gdp growth by about the same amount  preserv almost the same unemploy path as it had last  e   but inflat is lower as a result of the impact of a further acceler in product on inflat  an effect i want us to focus on in a minut   the pictur is clear bright   we have higher growth and lower inflat than in the previous forecast   but what is also import is that the  book has preserv the qualit stori of the last  book and previous  book  and that is that the unemploy rate is still below the staff   s es  of what i   m go to refer to as the short run or effect nairu   and as a result  there is upward pressur on inflat due to tight labor market  though less so than would otherwis be the case becaus of the acceler of product   inde  over the next year and a half  the dissip of the secondari effect of energi cost on core  inflat just offset the upward pressur that demand is exert on it  leav the core rate about   unchang   but thereaft core inflat would begin to rise in a longer run forecast   we would see that  for exampl  in the five year and longer kind of project like those we had in the bluebook at the meet last  e   and over the still longer run  as the short run nairu converg to the long run nairu  there could still be more rapid increas in inflat unless and until suppli and demand were rebalanc  i think the key to understand the role of product in the forecast have to do with two fundament issu   one is the effect of product on aggreg demand as well as aggreg suppli   we know that the staff has argu  i think persuas  that over the last four year the increas in product has actual increas demand by more than suppli  result in the declin in the unemploy rate that we   ve seen   they make a break from that approach in this forecast by move to balanc increas in demand and potenti suppli   that  i think  is support by the more modest tone of the econom indic and by the relat subdu path of equiti price recent   but we have an import element here of upsid risk becaus we certain could get a repetit of the pattern we have had over the last four year  in that each acceler of product actual brought with it even sharper increas in demand  the second effect is the one i particular want to focus on  and that is the temporari disinflationari impetus that come whenev we have an acceler in product   now  we are onli begin to learn about the complex dynam associ with an increas in product growth   first of all  there is not even widespread consensus about the framework that i   m go to be use here  though it is implicit in the staff forecast as well   but we realli don   t have a lot of histor data from which to learn about the impact of adjust to big increas in product   we had the big declin in product in the     s and we have this recent experi with acceler  in product  and that   s it   we have veri few data point   so  there   s a lot of uncertainti about   how it all work out  what i want to focus on  then  is the power and persist of the temporari disinflationari effect associ with the acceler in structur product   let   s look at that first term on the first page of the handout   what i identifi there is the effect on inflat of an acceler of product as be relat to this term  the differ between q  which is the actual trend product now  for exampl        percent in the staff forecast  and q   which is a move averag of trend product   the key in this analysi is that wage respond more slowli to increas in trend product than price  and this gap reflect that differ   the q  is a move averag of that trend in product  which reflect the slower impact on wage   as a result of this asymmetr respons of wage and price  an acceler of product temporarili lower inflat   and that exact term show up in the price specif of the phillip curv if there is an asymmetr respons of wage and price to inflat   just to give you an idea of how power this might be  take a look at the second page where i plot out that term  the differ between trend product and a move averag of trend product   i base the es  of the move averag on a    quarter move averag   i pick that particular length becaus that   s the specif the staff use in solv their wage equat and they found that that work relat well   what we see here is that becaus we have such a long lag length  the increas in product that we   ve seen cumul  they don   t dissip   they are still cumul and get to the highest impact we   ve seen   this term is now       percentag point  that say that the acceler of product is now respons for about a       percentag lower inflat rate than we otherwis would have had  you don   t have to turn to the mathemat deriv on the third page unless you are a glutton for punish  but the es  is all work out there in gori detail   but i think it  probabl overst the disinflationari impact for a coupl of reason   one  there is a good reason to   believ  or i think it is plausibl  that part of this acceler of product would be absorb by firm through a higher profit share dure this period   so  not all of this acceler is pass on in the form of lower price   second  it   s veri hard to es  the lag here   some equat  in particular those in the frbus model  have a shorter lag   to approxim this effect in that model would involv a lag of about   year as oppos to    year   and if that were the case  it would cut this disinflationari effect by about two third   it would onli be about    percentag point  so  it seem to me that this framework help to explain whi an acceler in product temporarili lower inflat for a given unemploy rate while preserv the role of balanc between suppli and demand in labor market as an import forc in inflat dynam  inde  the import of the long run nairu onc q  converg back to q   what it suggest to me is that this further acceler in product is definit a power forc hold down inflat relat to what it otherwis would be   i think the staff forecast of about stabl core inflat through next year and an upward creep after that make a lot of sens   and it suggest that we might have somewhat more  e in term of deal with the day of reckon   but we have to be mind that the unemploy rate might still be below the short run nairu here and that ul  these demand pressur will becom more meaning should we get a converg of the short run nairu back to the long run nairu onc product growth stabil
thank you  mr  chairman   i apolog that i have no handout   laughter  but i   ll tri to make up for it by be brief   the incom data that we   ve been review all morn realli need no repetit and i would onli add that on balanc they seem benign and favor to a truli remark degre   it may be a midsumm night   s dream but i think the recent  data could contain the seed of a near utopian extens of our recent superb era   if a modest   downturn   set in for an extend period  product improv could continu to hold unit labor cost flat   and if we have the good fortun to avoid the potenti negat shock from both known and unforeseen sourc  the stage would be set   we would experi sustain growth  higher real incom  slower but continu job creation  and steadi  perhap at some point reced  inflat   the onli other thing one could ask for is major leagu basebal in washington   laughter  that is an entic but quit plausibl prospect to be sure  but it would be folli to adopt it as a lock in scenario and i would not suggest that we do so   the real world is still a difficult and challeng place   inflat is creep up  the current account deficit   continu to grow  the stock market and consum debt are danger high  and household save are danger low  hot spot  both econom and polit  do glow threaten around the world   and the favor outcom reli almost entir on a continu of product increas unpreced in recent decad   if all this were not so serious and import  and if this committe were not so squar in the middl of the vortex  it would all be great theatr   at ani rate  to wait and to watch intens seem the best postur for today
thank you   shall we adjourn for coffe  which i think we   ve all earn   coffe break
mr  kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have remark  incom data sinc your last meet have tend to reinforc the sens that the growth rate of final demand and the economi   s abil to meet that demand are much more close align and are like to stay that way  at least for a while   on the demand side  consumpt is grow at a slower pace and   homebuild is declin  even befor the full effect have been felt of earlier tighten in financi condit  includ the level out of broad measur of equiti price this year   on the suppli side of the economi  a higher es  growth rate of potenti mean that demand need not deceler as much to achiev that align   from this evid  it would appear that the cumul effect of your prior action may well have tighten financi condit enough to keep the unemploy rate from fall further  even take account of the partial eros of restraint from the recent ralli in domest financi market   at the same  e  the new inform on price and cost  on balanc  has not indic ani further intensif of under inflat pressur   while these data may make you a littl more comfort with the determin that unemploy rate near   percent can persist for a while longer without serious advers consequ  they have not help great in know whether such rate are sustain over the longer run   labor compens has run to the strong side of expect  but so too has product  so that fa  increas in real compens have not put ad pressur on unit cost and price   price data have tend to confirm that core inflat rate are a littl higher than a year ago  though by less than anticip by the staff  at least in the case of the pce chain price index   moreov  the pickup in core inflat is small enough to leav ambigu the judgment as to whether it is attribut to the indirect effect of energi price increas or labor market disequilibrium   and long run inflat expect continu to be stabl  or  on market base measur  have even declin a bit   with inflat and inflat expect not worsen  and growth in demand near that of potenti suppli  the committe might see littl potenti cost to keep polici unchang at this meet   and wait would yield benefit  as new inform accru to help assess the under forc  especi those work on the cours of price   such a decis would still leav open the question of the risk go forward to be character in your press releas   most market comment expect you to stay with the bias toward inflat risk   but that may be part becaus they are assum you would want to avoid the attent and market reaction that a shift might bring   the flat yield curv and pattern of futur rate impli that the buyer and seller of secur see at least as much chanc that your next polici action will be an eas in rate as a tighten   with inflat compens in the real nomin treasuri yield spread below current increas in the cpi  even below those in core cpi price  investor would not seem to be anticip that keep polici on hold would pose an inflat risk   and  high level of equiti price and expect earn growth and a low impli equiti premium would suggest that investor do not anticip that a much softer economi and appreci rise in the unemploy rate will be necessari to achiev that outcom         if the committe  like the market  saw the recent data as support judgment that the current unemploy rate might well be sustain  and was now like to persist without further polici tighten  it might want to consid shift to a statement indic that the risk to satisfactori econom perform were now balanc   the staff forecast suggest econom expans is like to proceed a bit below the now higher growth of the economi   s potenti for some  e even with the feder fund rate at it present level over the rest of the year   and the committe might see the recent inform on labor cost as consist with littl pressur on inflat    in the forese futur     especi if energi price retrac a portion of their runup and the dollar remain strong as invest in the unit state retain their attract in an environ of strengthen product   but you may also want to consid that a statement that the risk were balanc would certain surpris the comment and like boost price in capit market  at least a littl   although no polici firm are built into those price  a statement of balanc risk still would be taken as reduc the probabl of further increas in interest rate   with demand still quit strong in a number of sector  the committe might not want to take the chanc that it announc would further fuel the recent runup in stock and bond price   moreov  there are a number of reason to believ that the risk go forward still point toward higher inflat   in the staff forecast  of cours  taken as a whole  they do   inflat pick up a littl next year in that forecast by some measur  and even with an addit    basi point of tighten  condit at the end of the period point to still further acceler of price   even if the committe did not agre with the staff assess that unemploy rate need to rise appreci  it action this year to slow the growth of demand indic that it see unemploy rate in the low  s as near the lower end of possibl equilibrium level  and the risk of rise inflat as especi unbalanc at the prevail degre of labor resourc util   in addit  the current rate of core consum inflat may now be closer to the upper end of what the committe consid to be compat with it price stabil object   in that case  the committe might be inclin to consid the cost of ani further increas to be particular high  to be sure  the standard balanc of risk statement address the direct of futur inflat  not it level   but a higher level might suggest more weight on ani possibl of further increas  even if such a possibl were relat small   as dave   explain  in the staff forecast the trajectori of price acceler has been mark down  larg base on a reassess of product growth   howev  the natur of the chang may impli that the risk to inflat around this revis are not symmetr   on the suppli side  the further pickup in product damp price increas through the forecast period by offset much of the effect on busi cost of worker effort to catch up to previous product increas and pressur from tight labor market   on      the demand side  though  household and busi are assum to have alreadi built the product acceler into expect growth of earn and incom  as a consequ  they have also incorpor the associ rise in the equilibrium real interest rate into bond yield  and the feder reserv has valid that increas with it monetari polici   henc  in the forecast the feedthrough of higher potenti output to demand is less than it otherwis would have been   the drop in real interest rate and relat small size of the rebound in equiti price sinc mid may support the notion that it is the economist  not the market  that are get posit surpris on product   of late  earn warn from firm have contribut to lower profit project by analyst for the balanc of this year and       though to be sure  their long term forecast continu to edg higher   thus  the new staff assess embodi two risk that both point in the direct of the possibl of higher inflat than in the forecast   first  if addit product growth gain are not forthcom  cost pressur from the catch up in real wage and tight labor market would rais cost fa  and squeez profit   second  if not all of the higher product growth rate is current built into market interest rate and earn expect  then more increas in equiti price may be in store  work to strengthen demand and tighten labor market   there are other upsid risk as well  even apart from the level of the nairu and the effect of product gain   for exampl  a stubborn high price of oil could begin to affect inflat expect   the new press statement languag is about longer term risk to meet the fomc   s object   the former languag involv asymmetri concern the probabl of near term action  over the intermeet period and at the next meet or so   even if the committe were of the view that it was unlik to get enough new inform about inflat prospect to justifi a polici action in the next few month  it should still adopt the bias statement languag if it believ that over  e rise inflat pose a greater peril to econom perform than weak in econom activ
question for don
a coupl of question  if i might   i read in the bluebook someplac  though i can   t find it now  and i thought i heard you say it again in your brief  a refer to the declin in real rate as reflect a reduc probabl of the fed tighten and rais the fund rate   so  i look at the data and i say   okay     year yield have come down and other yield have too  but   month rate went up   well  the fed fund rate is a one day rate   so i ask myself   can i   squar those   if we attribut to the market an expect that whatev inflationari impuls is in the    pipelin is veri short term but not longer term  is that how we reconcil those
the   month rate that went up were   month treasuri bill rate   three month commerci paper and cd rate went down   and i think the treasuri bill market  with a reduc suppli  is subject these day to veri idiosyncrat chang   much of the specif reaction relat to like or possibl chang in suppli  as liquid has been impair   and in fact this increas revers a decreas that was difficult to understand and explain over the previous intermeet period   so i wouldn   t put ani weight on a chang in the   month treasuri bill rate given the state of that market right now   i think everi other interest rate that we look at  privat interest rate and even longer term govern interest rate  suggest that expect about fed tighten have certain come down  and that is probabl part some declin in real rate and part some reduct in inflat expect
okay   that lead me to anoth question   some of your remark about the market and what we can read into the market and mayb learn from them  i interpret as say that there is increas credibl in the marketplac attach to our commit to avoid a sustain acceler of inflat   a year or more ago  befor our first rate increas in this seri at midyear last year  we heard a lot of commentari to the effect that inflat can no longer be a problem becaus of the new economi  that the silicon chip prevent inflat   and that went along with stori about the success of ipo and equiti price and price earn ratio and so on   now it seem that if peopl are comfort that inflat is not a problem  it is becaus the fed is on the job  to me there   seem to be  compar to a year ago  a big swing as to the reason given for whi inflat is not a problem   if that   s right and if that is built into what we   re see in the market    financi indic  then what weight would you give to increas credibl of the fomc   the   reason i   m ask is becaus there is this phenomenon  at least theoret  of the friedman surg    effect or the parker   s paradox effect  that with an increas in credibl of the commit to fight inflat  the demand to hold money balanc relat to wealth or perman incom would be higher   so the same money growth would be less expansionari than compar to a lower credibl environ   and if there has been a shift over the last year toward more credibl attach to our commit to resist inflat  what weight would you give that in assess the thrust of polici action
i think the market are look at both their assess of the under suppli and demand for good and servic and the fed   s reaction   i person don   t sens a sea chang in our credibl   i think our credibl has been build gradual for the last    year  some  fa   some  slower   over repeat episod of the committe keep it eye on the longer run price stabil goal and act success and preemptiv to achiev that  we have built credibl   i would think that some more credibl has accru to the committe over the last year becaus of it action   but i also believ that the market don   t see the under inflat risk   if there were increas credibl but they saw an inflat risk or a strong growth risk  they might assum that inflat would be low but that the committe would be tighten interest rate a lot in order to achiev that low inflat   but in fact they don   t have a tighten of interest rate  real interest rate  built in at all   so it   s not just that they see inflat low  they see it low without ani fomc action   draw on the recent experi of the last sever year in which there hasn   t been ani rise in inflat at veri low unemploy rate  and where product growth has continu to hold down cost  they   ve basic project a continu of that experi out ahead   they don   t see a need to tighten polici   so i don   t think it   s just credibl   between the  book and the market  in fact  between mani economist and the market  the under analysi is differ   the   market are put a lot of weight on their experi of the last few year  wherea the economist    are tri to sort through the shock that might have produc that experi and are see some risk that the market don   t see
further question for don   if not  let me get start   i think there is a fair general consensus that we are observ a mark slowdown in the growth of consum demand after a veri strong perform earlier this year   motor vehicl sale clear are down  although the data for august  season adjust  were littl chang from the juli number  chain store sale have been quit weak recent  and the data that came out this morn show signific weak in mid august   and in general we are see signific soft in all the hous relat consum good market  one of the element in our model on which we have veri consider difficulti get a good fix is the inventori of consum good held by household   becaus those inventori tend to behav veri much like the inventori of steel  aluminum  and textil in individu busi establish  we would expect retail demand to soften in the event of a backup in inventori of household good   but  there just is no evid of ani satiat of consum demand  especi take account of the fact that we as consum spend an increas proport of our money on impalp servic   clear  we can clog up our closet with cloth and our driveway with motor vehicl  and our stock of applianc can simpli get out of hand  which i can assur you is my current situat    laughter   nonetheless  i find new thing on which to spend money all the  e   even so  it remain true that to the extent we are still deal to a signific degre with a good relat economi  the excess inventori in household are an import factor that is some  overlook when we evalu the econom outlook       to be sure  our model   have an inventori adjust process  and inde we are see that the stock of consum good  main  of cours  durabl good  has been rise at a fa  pace per capita or per household than in the past   while that is not to say that consum demand has reach a point of satur  histori   suggest the exist of a cyclic adjust process as inventori go up   and as they go up at an excess rapid pace  as they inde have been do for the last number of year  there is a tendenc for the rate of accumul to slow   when that slowdown occur  it work it way back into the type of environ we current are observ in the consum area   clear  the wealth effect is interrel with this process  it is difficult to judg the extent to which the sharp rise in energi price has effect remov purchas power from the marketplac   what we see at the end of the day is a soften consum sector whose growth rate is well below what it was earlier  but growth continu nonetheless   there is no evid of which i am awar that suggest the consum is pull back to an extent that is potenti destabil for the econom outlook   as consum and inde hous expenditur soften  there is a feedback into the intermedi product industri and the slow report by an increas number of such industri  which     mention earlier today  is general what one would expect under those condit  in complet contrast to develop in the consum and hous sector is what is go on in the capit good market   here what we are observ  as we have discuss on mani occas previous  is a continu increas in prospect rate of return on new capit equip  especi high tech   there realli is no low tech equip anymor   there is no old fashion type of capit equip worth it name   as a consequ we are begin to see a spillov from the sic classif  which is how we often design high technolog   in ani event  overal capit invest continu to boom  an indic obvious that the expect rate of return  which had   previous been presum to be on the rise  actual have materi   we can see that in two way     one is that plant manag are continu order an ever increas menu of these type of equip  which mean they are see that it work  we obvious are see the same phenomenon in the product data  which effect are one way to envisag the real return on capit   and inde we are see it in still increas long term earn forecast by secur analyst   as i have mention befor  the latter may not be veri knowledg about what is go on in the busi world  but they are reason good report of what the compani that they follow are say about their longer term outlook  that invari mean that product in the individu compani is show continu and irrevers increas   at some point  perhap not that far down the road  that is go to chang   inde  it invari must chang becaus the histori of these type of technolog surg or shift in technolog s curv show that they lose momentum after a point   for exampl  onc the avail and use of electr becam pervas throughout the economi  it rate of growth slow quit appreci   in fact  it slow to such an extent that new generat plant were not built as need  and we can observ the problem that have result from that  at the moment  howev  what we see is a quit extraordinari surg in capit invest whose direct impact on product involv a fair straightforward relationship with a lag   the analyt problem that exist when we have this type of product driven economi is that it is by no mean clear whether the increas capit invest will creat a larger expans of demand than potenti suppli  there are two element here   one is the  e lag that exist between capit expenditur and the complet of facil and their oper at full potenti   the other is the coeffici that relat increas in capit stock to increas in capac   as larri   point out  the evid   to date suggest that the overal impact of acceler capit invest has been to increas    demand more than potenti suppli   the result  as we all have perceiv  is that we have seen a signific declin in the unemploy rate and a tighten of the labor market   if this process were to persist  it strike me as pretti much inevit that we would have to be continu tighten   this is becaus the excess of demand over suppli of good and servic would reflect itself in an excess of long term credit demand versus long term save   were that the case  real long term interest rate would be continu to rise  but they are not   and the reason they are not is that person consumpt expenditur and spend on hous have moder  and that slow has help to offset the veri strong growth in capit expenditur   we don t know the eventu extent of the slowdown   most of you have indic that even though consum demand has inde slow in your district  there is no evid of ani cumul deterior   consum confid clear has not deterior   so what we are look at may well be a pattern of slower growth in household spend that could continu for a while yet   and so long as it continu  the pressur will be off the market  the acceler of price inflat is essenti still a forecast   ned   s tabl show that the year over year pce core is up onli     percent   the juli over juli number is up a littl more  but most interest the rate of increas of core pce inflat for the last three month is  as i recal  onli slight higher than     percent at an annual rate   this is the lowest three month number that i have seen in the seri go back a number of year   but as bill pool point out  we may be miss the boat here by look exclus at the core rate when clear energi price are move  the electr power shortag is a veri serious problem  as those of you in the west particular know   becaus demand for electr had slip for a while  new power plant   construct came to a virtual halt  abet by environment control or regul and a number of    other obstacl that essenti dissuad util compani from build new power plant   so  we have end up with what is a realli serious potenti crisi  the crude oil market are also tighten up   there is not all that much excess crude product capac in the gulf state  which is where almost all of it exist   saudi arabia has perhap   million barrel a day of addit capac   kuwait has some   iraq has some   but it is by no mean clear what the inclin may be to produc and bring those crude suppli to market   as a consequ  the steadi under growth in crude demand is have an impact on price   opec product is lag becaus it is veri difficult for a countri like saudi arabia  which has veri signific fiscal problem  to increas it oil output know it aggreg revenu could veri well fall as a consequ   accord  as the  book indic  it is not clear that energi price will automat come down   it is true that the explor and develop budget of the major oil compani have gone up veri materi  and experi suggest that newer technolog have enabl the takeout from exist well to improv mark  as a result  addit sourc of non opec crude will becom avail  but not to a substanti extent befor anoth year or two   it is hard to know what is go to happen befor then  natur gas is a disast wait to happen   here again  the earlier slowdown in demand for power left natur gas price at relat modest level   as a consequ drill declin fair materi   and we are now in a posit where the natur gas inventori in storag are about as low as i rememb them  in sum  we have a situat where all three major sourc of power are strain and interact on the price of energi   in the circumst  the notion of look sole at core price may still be comfort but onli up to a veri limit point   the reason is that rise price that   ordinarili bring ad suppli forward clear are work less than adequ to produc that result    in the energi sector current   as a consequ  while inflat has not worsen materi in the sens of a spillov of higher energi price into core price  that outcom is inevit unless energi price start to come down   energi remain a veri fundament part of the cost structur even though admit veri signific less so than it use to be   but it is still signific enough to creat a problem if we sudden get a major acceler in energi price  especi in crude oil price  where all this leav us  obvious  is with a slow economi but clear one that has remark good characterist of stabil   the major excess that we were all concern about for the last coupl of year seem to be diminish   the gap between aggreg suppli and demand is begin to close   and inde  the  book forecast impli that that gap will narrow consider more over the next year and a half   we obvious have a signific amount of monetari polici tighten still in the pipelin stem from the polici move that have been implement sinc june of last year  includ sever move earlier this year   clear  by ani measur those polici action could not yet have work their way fulli through the system   so we are in a situat where a lot of thing could be fair signific wors  but they are not   i conclud from all of this that we ought to stay where we are   there is no need to move at this particular point  at the same  e  it would be high riski in my judgment to depart from the bias that we use to call    asymmetr toward tighten      i still have not learn the languag we are now use to describ our polici bias   in ani event  my cost benefit analysi of where we are at this stage and where we want to be lead me at least for now to a no chang direct and retent of the statement that the risk are toward higher inflat   i would like to put that out on the tabl for discuss   vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i want to talk a bit about the balanc of risk sentenc we have been use in the press statement as   oppos to the asymmetri languag we previous had in the direct  and how much we have    benefit from that chang   i think what we main have accomplish is to convinc the marketplac  and slowli the economist in the marketplac  that we are in fact look over the longer run and not from meet to meet   they are now convinc that the feder reserv is look at monetari polici as it affect the economi over a longer period of  e   therefor  the balanc of risk statement toward either inflat on one side or toward too weak an economi on the other  i believ  has had a veri consider posit effect on our abil to carri out polici   it certain   not chang the need for us to take action when action is appropri  there is  i think  a linger debat within the committe about what we need in order to have high credibl   basic  what i think we need is the reput of have good judgment and courag  the judgment to evalu the risk in a reason way and to decid what is the right cours of action and then the courag to take the action   it is easi to make the right decis if it is perfect obvious what it is   that is never the case with us   we are alway look through a dark glass  think about what is the best thing to do and then act courag to do it   in my view the committe has a veri  veri high reput in that regard and it is someth that is of immens import to us  today i think we clear have to look at the economi in the way you have suggest   i agre that maintain the present stanc of polici is appropri and  certain  we should continu to reflect our view that the balanc of risk is toward rise inflat
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i would say that polici right now is tight and the issu is whether it ought to be tighter  we certain can wait to see whether that is the case   one comment on the bias   as a suggest  i wonder if we should not consid   take out the lone refer to tight labor market as the reason for our bias   i don t know that there    is a one to one map into inflat over the  e horizon we have been talk about   given your comment  as well as those of other here today  it seem to me that we see other risk that are just as import right now in lead us to this bias   i think they also ought to be consid  or certain that tight labor market should not be given more consider in our statement than these other risk
i can   t speak for everybodi   i think we are move in that direct but i don t think we are there yet   i believ the labor market still is the overwhelm problem but clear less so proport than it was  certain at the last meet
in my view it is someth we ought to consid as we go forward
i think that is a valid issu to rais at the next meet  presid pool
mr  chairman  when i went to the airport ye day morn in bozeman  montana to fli back to this meet i was a littl concern about whether the flight would be run on  e  i ask the clerk whether i would be abl to get back to washington for this meet   i   m sure he did not know who i am but he said      tell alan  span to leav the economi alon       laughter   appar you agre and i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i   m comfort with and support your recommend  absent some big surpris  i think we have the luxuri of let this play out   i would just underscor bill   s comment about not do anyth to detract from the notion that we are on watch and are prepar to move when we need to
i support your propos not to chang the fed fund rate and to retain the statement that the balanc of risk is on the side of higher inflat   i think we need more  e to see what is happen with the real economi   nonetheless  the balanc of risk appear to remain on the side of higher inflat over the horizon   if the indic of inflat point consist toward higher inflat  then we should respond  and i think we should remind the market of our resolv in that regard
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend   i think this would be a good  e to leav the fund rate unchang so that we can see how thing unfold befor consid anoth tighten action   i also believ it is import to retain the statement adopt in june that the balanc of risk continu to be toward higher inflat
mr  chairman  i support your recommend for no chang in the fund rate and to maintain the assess that the risk are still unbalanc toward higher inflat   i just want to give a perspect on the unbalanc risk issu  whenev we have an acceler of product growth  we have the follow choic  we can take it for a while in temporarili higher output or we can take it in potenti perman lower inflat   i think so far what we have done is to take it all in the form of higher output   core cpi inflat today is exact the same as it was at the end of      on a methodolog consist basi   that is fine   but i would argu that we have to be particular vigil about an upward creep in inflat go forward becaus onc this product acceler effect dissip  inflat will rise   and it is better if that rise take place from a level closer to our long run inflat object than from a level that has alreadi drift abov it       the second reason is that an acceler of product is the classic opportun for opportunist disinfl   so  it   seem a littl strang to allow an extraordinari experi of an acceler of product to be accompani by an upward creep in inflat   for both those reason  i think we need to stay with the statement on unbalanc risk   i think they are unbalanc and even though inflat perform remain veri favor  i believ we have to be veri vigil about rise inflat go forward
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  especi your recommend to keep the tilt in place   i think it would be prematur to remov it   also  tom hoenig   s suggest reson with me and i hope we will look at that again in the near futur
presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman  includ the bias toward concern about heighten inflat go forward   as i indic earlier  i do think we have some addit  e to assess that situat  and given current real interest rate i believ we are not too far from where we need to be even over the longer run
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   i think larri   made a use caution remark that given the product shock  we are benefit from a littl good luck  if you will  on inflat   it is differ from the good luck we had in      but it is good luck   and we should keep that in mind and be alert   i have alway argu for be as alert as we can possibl be   but luck come in all shape   i don t want to overdo the nostalgia bit  but i can rememb  e when oil price went up about as much as they have in the last coupl of year and the inflat situat was far wors than it is now   i can rememb invest boom like we   are have now and the inflat situat was far wors   so  if we realli take this situat apart  we    might see that we also have some forc work in the direct of high inflat that we may be under appreci   i don t want to push that theme too hard and i think we should remain vigil  but when we talk about luck  it is easi to count the thing on one side of the fenc and not the thing on the other side of the fenc
i am also in agreement with your recommend  mr  chairman   i think we should wait to see more data on how the economi is shape up  slow perhap  and how product trend seem to be develop in the latter part of the year   i  too  think that the balanc of risk statement is vital import   in my view we would send a veri difficult messag for the market to deal with if we did not retain the exist balanc of risk statement   i believ the risk are on the up side   i like the way governor   put the analysi in term of question whi we aren t see inflat move down with such a product surpris and whi we aren t see that when we look ahead with such a product surpris   and that is worrisom to me   i would not like us to be associ with fiddl while rome burn  but i don t think we are   i think this is a  e when we can afford to wait and see
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with both part of your recommend   i think this is a  e to paus and take stock   we have seen slowdown befor that were just temporari and the expans pick up again quit rapid   and there is the question of whether a slow in growth that is more sustain would be enough to cap inflat or whether the economi realli has to grow at rate below trend in order to reliev some of the pressur that has been built up   obvious this is an open question   if the inflat data deterior due to energi as you   discuss  or for other reason  or if demand expand further beyond potenti output  then i think we    have to be prepar to act veri quick   but for now i believ it is appropri to follow your advic  and i certain agre that the balanc of risk clear is tilt toward higher inflat
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
thank you   i agre that leav the fund rate unchang at this point is the right thing to do   i am also sensit to the communic issu involv  it would not be desir to communic the expect that we are not go to rais the fund rate in the forese futur or to impli that the next chang might be down rather than up   but it is a challeng as to how to avoid communic that  regard the languag on the balanc of risk  part of me would like to say that the statement should alway be that an unavoid  perman featur of a fiat money system is a balanc of risk toward higher inflat    laughter   if it ain   t go down it   s go up   but sinc i am not like to win that one  i think we do have to spend a littl more  e here on what it is that lead us to believ that the balanc of risk is toward higher inflat   i say that becaus in some of the discuss today and in previous meet it sound to me as if we worri that higher product through various avenu  through demand increas  wealth effect  higher real interest rate  and liquid inject by the central bank  caus higher inflat   and as governor   suggest  we worri that lower product caus higher inflat   so  until we sort out a littl better whether higher product caus inflat or lower product rais the risk of inflat  we are not quit readi to explain whi we think the risk are toward higher inflat
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend   i feel a bit drawn into the discuss about the communic of the balanc of risk  have spent nine month work with a number of you in tri to sort this out   i probabl shouldn t act on that feel  but i will   first  i certain commend and have alway listen to the wise counsel of our vice chair  and i agre that we actual have succeed to some extent in communic someth here   i am quit sympathet to what jerri jordan just said  though   and what tom hoenig said is also relev   in my view there are a number of thing that are lead us to communic that we think the risk over the forese futur are toward greater inflat   some of the reason have to do with the labor market  and one can say that without necessarili be a firm believ in a particular number with respect to the nairu   so  i am comfort with keep in that refer to the labor market   but like tom hoenig  i do think that what i am hear is a broader rang of concern have to do with other element of the real economi  and in my case  mayb not for other  have a bit to do with some financi condit   i don t at all sens that we should chang our communic tool at this meet   but in my view jerri quit appropri remind us that we work hard to get to this languag  not becaus we thought it was an easi out from a difficult problem but becaus we thought it was go to help the public in it analysi of our policymak   so  as we go forward dure the cours of the year  regardless of what we do with interest rate  i think we have to be clear about what is drive our assess of the risk   i say that becaus do so will give the market a chanc to look at the same thing we are look at   and if we re look past the unemploy number to other factor  we at least ought to signal that to the market as best we can   thank you
i support your recommend
