you are on   where are you
over here  mr  chairman    laughter    there is a packag of chart and text in front of you  which on the first page has a summari of my remark    let me apolog in advanc for the length of my report   i will tri to cut to the chase   also  i should note that all the typo in the written materi are my own  as ye day i engag in the illus that last minut chang result in improv   i will discuss domest market develop with respect to polici expect in short term rate  movement in the euro as a consequ of capit flow lead and lag  and the current shape of u s  yield curv   with respect to domest oper i plan to cover four topic  includ the mix of oper sinc the previous meet  current condit in the treasuri market  and the impact of feder revenu and treasuri refund plan on the flow of new treasuri issuanc and system oper   then i would like to present to the committe a propos for interim system oper that i   d like to discuss with the treasuri   and at the end of my remark i will remind you about some foreign matter on which i sent you a memo   turn to the second page of the packag  which show forward rate  you can see in the top panel that u s  forward rate have risen sharpli sinc mid april  when they had dip a littl follow the releas of the cpi and more import the stock market turmoil around mid month   sinc then they have move up  most brisk on the releas of the eci on april   th and then again a littl on the public of the nonfarm payrol report on may  th   it is interest to note  howev  that compar with the peak of these forward rate just after your last meet  the   month forward   month rate   the top dash line  is onli    basi point higher wherea the   month forward   month rate  the solid red line  is    basi point  higher  there is some    collaps in    of the market   s expect of how far the committe is like to go in tighten  even as more aggress action are be price in over the near term   in the middl panel  you can see that euro forward rate have back up from their low level in essenti three step over the period   first  they move up as the euro broke below    cent  then they rose quit modest after the ecb rais rate    basi point on april   th and rose again after the may  nd releas of euro area m     a copi of the materi use by mr    is append to this transcript    and the purchas manag    index   the market certain has a sens of back up and rais forward rate in europ as the euro has weaken   the bottom panel depict japanes forward rate  which have drift lower over most of the intermeet period and spike down on the releas of the negat household spend number on may  th   it has been my impress dure this period that the bank of japan has been wave it arm in the air  tri to get peopl   s attent and communic that it might actual rais rate at some point   i think the market is under assess the earnest with which the bank of japan is tri to send that signal   it is veri much my sens that bank offici feel somewhat as our chairman did in      and earli       they are tri to warn everyon that a rate increas is come and no one is listen   turn to page    i would like to talk a littl about the euro   s weak  which i see as a function of two factor   the princip factor is the except lead and lag in capit flow  which have been punctuat  if you will  by the extraordinari cyclic develop in the unit state over the last coupl of year   each of the three panel show data for the    month period on either side of the januari         launch of the euro   the top panel depict    and    year u  s  and german swap rate and a    year italian rate up until the launch of the euro  and then the dollar and euro rate after that  e   in the middl panel are the euro yen and euro dollar exchang rate   and the bottom panel show the italian stock market in purpl  the s p     in red  and the german stock market in blue  all index to august           look back over this period  it seem to me that non european investor bought the rumor of the euro befor it launch   you can see that in the ralli in italian and german    year swap rate and also somewhat in the italian and german equiti market in late      and into        and talk to peopl over that  e period  there were anecdot report of a flow of non european capit into the euro zone as investor bought the rumor of the creation of the euro   dure this same period  euro zone busi brace themselv for the launch of the euro by hoard cash   mani of us no doubt rememb governor trichet of the bank of franc complain repeat about how their corpor sector was hang on to high level of cash  build up a war chest for the more competit environ they expect with the launch of the euro  rather than invest   sinc the introduct of the euro  it appear that european busi have actual been diversifi out of the euro area  as fdi   and portfolio flow away from the euro zone have pick up   that seem to me to reflect an effort on their part to catch up with the process of global and diversif that has seen u s  corpor at the forefront   now  inward investor into the euro area  and the intermediari who bought the euro exposur from the outward investor  all hung on  wait for the strong euro to materi around the start of this year and expect final to get the ralli they had been look for   but this was just when u s  cyclic develop gave them the    doubl whammi     if you will   the last quarter of       as investor were anticip the launch of the euro  was just when this committe was eas rate   there was much excit about whether there would be an econom slowdown and there were strain in the market   at that point the spread between    year u s  and german swap rate stood at    basi point and the spread between their   year swap rate stood at     basi point   sinc then those swap spread have doubl   the    year u s  euro swap spread is     basi point and the   year spread is     basi point   while those who were hang on to euro were hope for the euro to ralli and the u s  economi to slow down  just the revers has happen   if you look at the bottom panel and the recent equiti ralli  you can see that the one place from which u s  equiti valu might look cheap would be milan  that is just one of the head fake that occur to the exchang market   everyon expect that the hiccup of the nasdaq in u s  equiti market in april might be the occas to spark a ralli in the euro   on the contrari  it appear that european businessmen  look at their market valuat vis  vis u s  valuat  saw that hiccup as a buy opportun   and from the newspap  which one has to follow to see these develop befor they get pick up in the data  one can read about a continu flow of deal involv european purchas of u s  asset   the euro bounc up at the end of last week amid a hail of discuss and threat of intervent by prime minist and central banker and financ minist from all over europ  but the bounc was not much more than one would have predict even without all of that rhetor   to me  the fact that it got onli that rather margin bounc was again a somewhat bearish sign for the euro   let me briefli cover the materi on domest yield curv on page     these are the chart i have shown you befor on yield curv for u s  treasuri secur  interest rate swap  fanni mae issu  and ford motor compani debt   the yield curv shown are as of the close of the day of your last meet and as of last friday  as you can   see  the u s  treasuri yield curv is a littl higher but also a bit more invert than it was at the  e of your last meet   all three of the non treasuri yield curv have more or less back up by around    basi point  or mayb a littl less   thus credit is more expens than it was at the  e of your last meet   but even with credit spread widen to quit wide level by the standard of the last sever year  my impress is that habitu notion of appropri spread to treasuri are still exert a downward pull at the long end on all non treasuri issu   treasuri are act as somewhat of a magnet  pull the long end of these yield curv down   turn to domest oper  i have outlin on page   some key point regard our mix of oper sinc your march meet  at that meet i spell out my plan to tri to determin what would be a comfort pace of outright purchas of treasuri coupon secur   i said that i thought we could target    percent for our particip in treasuri bill auction but would allow that to go up to    percent in the next month or so  as we expect bill size first to shrink and then to rise again later in the year   i also note that we would use a mix of           and    day repo to meet the balanc of reserv need and that we would not be purchas bill outright until after the treasuri   s refund announc   in respons to view express by committe member and my assess of chang market condit  we in fact purchas      billion in coupon secur on five differ day   the princip constraint were the treasuri   s buy back oper and the novelti of those oper be quit a big deal in the market   the treasuri had a rather big window  a two day notic window   that elimin a number of day when we might have been tempt to oper   we also purchas      billion in bill for system account on april   th   on that occas we conduct oper from which we learn someth by do   on the first day of the quarter   that was not someth i was expect to wake up to that m orn  their request was a consequ of their intervent the prior even  it seem to me that the bill market adjust rather well to that rath r larg effect on suppli   so  on behalf of the committe  we purchas      billion of bill on april   th for our own account   we redeem      billion of secur at auction       million in bill and      million of the last   year note   we now hold    percent of two bill issu   but on two other issu that we anticip   bump up our share to    percent  we end up with a lesser share of the total outstand as a consequ of the larg add on and the treasuri in this case end up with more cash th an they want   occasion we have use    day repo to meet our under reserv need   we now have four separ    day repo on our book for a total valu of      billion   most of our repo oper over this period have been for onli a few day    durat becaus of the great volatil in the treasuri   s account   on the next page of chart i have tri to convey a pictur of the condit in the market in which we oper   my assess is that the bill market has made a reason smooth transit to the new suppli condit it is encount   but i think the long end of the curv is have a harder  e make that adjust  in part becaus of the abrupt chang in suppli and obvious in part becaus of the polici action this committe has been take   the upper left chart depict bid ask spread on   month bill go back to januari        you can see the increas in those spread in januari      when the suppli chang were begin to come through to the bill market and then the dramat spike reflect the chao of octob        but over the last six month or so the spread have about stabil in the bill market   in the bottom left panel are bid ask spread on the    year note   while they seem to be stabil last year at higher level than prior to the crisi period of       the trend now is a continu widen of bid ask spread in the    year note market   on the right hand side of the page are spread of the   month bill to libor and of the    year note to the    year swap rate   i would just note that in the    year area we are still see a widen out of the spread  which is mere anoth reflect of the greater uncertainti the market face at the long end   moreov  even though the spread of the   month bill to libor is volatil  i think it is more or less stay in a modest rang that give the market some comfort   on page    mr  chairman  i have outlin recent develop with respect to feder revenu  surplus es   and the treasuri   s refund plan   these develop obvious have an impact on the flow of new treasuri issu and on system oper    at the end of march  the treasuri   s plan for debt issuanc reflect the administr s forecast for a surplus of      billion in fiscal year        on the basi of april receipt  the administr s current forecast is for a surplus of      billion   at it quarter refund in   earli may the treasuri announc it intent to buy back no more than a total of     billion this calendar year  reiter what it has said previous   howev  i think most knowledg observ expect the treasuri to be buy back more next year   treasuri offici also state at the  e of the may refund that they would maintain the     and    year program   but i think that statement also was about this calendar year   in my view  the    year program is at some risk go forward at least with this administr   they also announc their intent to elimin the   year bill onc congress adopt some technic amend and to trim the size of the   year month note auction  they indic  too  that further increas in revenu would like lead to a switch from month to onli quarter   year note auction   in addit  although this has not been announc  the treasuri has told us that the amount of bill like to be issu each week for the rest of this year will be reduc by more than    percent   that mean the amount auction week will be down to     billion for the rest of the year  not just for the brief period in april and may that we were anticip   these reduct in the treasuri   s issuanc plan obvious have implic for our oper this year   the tabl on the next page  page    show project of the treasuri   s debt issuanc over the remaind of the year  project of the percentag to be purchas by the system  and es  of the system   s net redempt   i won   t go through all of it with you  but i   d highlight the top two row   the first row show the treasuri s issuanc plan by refund quarter  may to juli  august to octob  and novemb to januari   in the left hand box are the figur project in march  that is  what we were look at around the  e of your last meet   go across the page  the next box show what our hold would have been   and the next box indic what our net redempt would have been under the plan of hold up to    percent of ani one issu this quarter but go back down to    percent for the rest of the year   on the right hand side of the page  the next three box show you the current project figur for those same variabl  the treasuri   s issuanc plan  the reduct in our hold under the    percent object  and our impli redempt   but now the impli redempt becom somewhat more materi in maintain the    percent limit   for the   year note  for exampl  the next set of box  which i have put in bold print  the percent of our hold as a consequ of the reduc size of the treasuri s offer would be move up signific  moreov  that still assum month auction and we face the risk go forward of the treasuri cut back to quarter auction      let me go over with the committe a propos for interim system oper that i would like to discuss with the treasuri   the key point are summar on page     at your last meet  i thought we might be abl    comfort    to purchas outright up to     billion in treasuri secur   in light of both committe member    view and the chang in the outlook for new issuanc  i have tri to devis a mean to increas the amount we would be purchas   given the uncertainti the treasuri face in debt manag and the impact of our oper on their primari and secondari market  i would like to inform them in advanc of my plan for manag the system open market account  soma  over the come month  in part to permit them to adjust their strategi   it will also be vital for us to communic clear to market particip ani chang we make in our strategi   in brief  i would like to oper soma on a schedul for particip in treasuri auction that essenti lock in the status quo in the percentag of soma   s hold acquir in the primari market   i would then like to increas the pace of outright purchas of coupon secur  skew our purchas both to the middl and the shorter end of the yield curv   we would also need to reli on    day repo to meet the reserv need that cannot be fill through this process and to serv as a buffer between the  e of redempt and outright purchas   i have provid for your inform a veri rough approxim of just three of the reserv factor we face over the come month  from now until the end of januari   our current under reserv need for this period is     billion   the impli redempt from the    percent bill limit would be     billion   and the new york staff forecast of     percent growth in currenc add     billion  for a total of     billion   i want to be veri clear that this figur take into account onli three reserv factor   we know there will be demonet of sdrs that will add to reserv need  and we face a risk that the treasuri   s cash balanc will be higher and spill over into further reserv need   so this is not a topsid es  of our reserv need   we know other factor will tend to add to those need   turn to the next page  as i have indic there  we face both a stock and a flow problem that we are tri to address    as a number of you note at the last meet  with over    trillion in market treasuri debt outstand it seem clear that we ought to be abl to find suffici asset to grow the soma balanc sheet from the exist stock   howev  the amount of market treasuri secur outstand with remain matur of more than    year     exclus of soma hold  total onli      billion   and that amount will declin as a consequ of both treasuri buyback and system purchas   there is also strong demand for these long durat asset in foreign and domest privat portfolio  as reflect in the invert yield curv   while relat comfort with privat credit risk for shorter durat asset  investor perceiv few accept long term substitut for treasuri secur   thus the stock of such treasuri issu is not larg relat to appar demand and that stock is expect to declin   the total flow of new treasuri reach the secur market has continu to declin  with total issuanc exclus of cash manag bill fall from a littl over    trillion in      to      trillion this year   as i have tri to explain at previous meet  my concern is this   if the growth of the system   s balanc sheet absorb an expand share of both the primari and on the run issu too quick  there is a risk that system oper will come to be seen as a major disturb  even if onli transit  in the price discoveri process   briefli  it seem to me that we have some veri basic portfolio object in that we have a prefer for treasuri as an asset class to grow our balanc sheet   we have over  e had a prefer for the shorter rather than longer matur issu   we have express that prefer princip through our larg hold of bill  whose growth has been relat limit in recent year   but some member of the committe have express frustrat to me that  with the reduct in the size of the bill auction  the averag durat has been creep up rather than go down   the concern center on our interest in maintain suffici short matur asset to provid us with adequ matur liquid   it also strike me that it is not obvious that we have much of an interest in pay a premium for the special liquid of on the run treasuri secur   in the current set  it seem to me that the treasuri has three paramount debt manag object   the first is to reduc the issuanc of debt in line with revenu   the second is to avoid a lengthen of the averag matur of it outstand debt   and the third is to maintain issu size and key benchmark matur to sustain an activ secondari market   in tri to reconcil these interest  it seem to me that we could limit the system   s share of the primari market and on the run issu in order to leav room for privat demand  particular for long durat secur  as investor adjust to the reduct in suppli   we could expand system hold of off the run and shorter durat treasuri secur to meet our balanc sheet need  in the process of acquir as much of the prefer asset class as possibl  and adjust soma to a shorter overal matur that is    closer to our basic prefer   do this will have an impact on the averag matur of privat held treasuri debt outstand   the particular propos i am make is outlin on the next page  let me say in advanc that there is noth magic about these number and percentag   they repres my best seat of the pant judgment at this point and if someon has a better idea  i am all ear   but my suggest is that we maintain rough the status quo of our exist hold as the share of soma particip in upcom auction  that would involv take share of the now anticip size of offer in accord with the percentag shown in the schedul at the top of page      we would tell the u s  treasuri in advanc that soma   s bid at auction would be the lesser amount of soma   s matur hold or the percentag limit from the schedul   this would have onli a veri limit impact on our current forecast rollov   but in the event of further declin in issuanc  this would hold constant the system   s share of the primari market and  therefor  should increas the amount avail for privat demand from what it would have been otherwis   it also should assist the treasuri in forecast and thus manag it cash posit  which is an incident benefit of some consequ to the desk   we would also take the schedul to impli a graduat set of guidelin for soma outright purchas of off the run issu   over  e we would make outright purchas in the primari market under the follow schedul  up to    percent of secur with remain matur between    and    year     to    percent of secur in the    to    year area     to    percent of secur in the    to   year rang  and    to    percent of secur with a remain matur of under   year   also  we could perhap continu to bid as we have been for   percent of inflat index secur at auction  and we might be prepar to bump that up to     percent in the secondari market   page    show in the second row the veri margin impact this would have on net redempt   there would be no chang in the bill redempt and we would have rather modest redempt of the   year note if we appli this schedul to our primari market oper   but we would share in the upsid risk that the market would experi if issu size declin   in that case we would be take smaller nomin amount and our redempt would grow   the chart on the next page tri to depict the opportun we have to implement this plan   this show soma hold as a percent of the size of outstand issu   the blue bar are bill and the other color show coupon in various remain matur bracket   the bold    red line repres the propos guidelin graduat for each and everi issu in the treasuri yield curv   the white area under the red line give you a sens of the size of the opportun we would have to purchas these issu if we skew our demand toward the shorter end of the matur spectrum   turn to page     i have shown that a veri rough calcul of the amount avail for purchas use this schedul would be around      billion   we would continu our current practic of wait to purchas new issu until they are thrice off the run   this compar with a compar reserv need of     billion through the end of januari  which is close to the     billion es  i mention a moment ago plus the      billion in redempt impli on the   year note   again  i want to emphas that these number are veri rough and intend for illustr purpos   the pace of outright purchas could have a strong impact on the treasuri yield curv  tend to produc lower yield  and at least in the short run could be seen as be at cross purpos with the committe s polici action   this could also be seen as a revers oper twist even though it is motiv  in my opinion  by the system   s reason portfolio object   i doubt that we could comfort purchas the full amount of our reserv need for the remaind of the year      billion to     billion  under this schedul within the next six or seven month   but provid we communic clear to market particip about this radic chang in soma s secondari market behavior  i think we could purchas consider more than the     billion i was suggest at your last meet   one of the featur of this plan is that we would be limit our purchas at the long end and leav the market a littl more leeway to express it demand there   final  i would remind you that this is clear just a stop gap measur   it delay the onset of problem meet our reserv need  if treasuri   s suppli were to begin to expand over the come year or so  we would have asset to roll into   howev  if treasuri   s suppli continu to declin over come year  soma s need for new asset would onli have been delay   let me turn now briefli to the recommend i sent to the committe in a memorandum on may   th regard the renew of our swap arrang with mexico and canada and note two chang in our invest practic   the latter do not requir a committe vote   i will need a vote to ratifi our domest oper  mr  chairman  and a separ vote to approv the renew of our swap     arrang   i would be happi to answer ani question and  again  my apolog for take so much of the committe s  e
on the contrari  i thought that was an except worthwhil present   inde  it strike me that you at least have come to grip with the concern that i had at the last meet   what you did not mention is that the on the run off the run spread  which have been a measur of illiquid in the system  are go to be arbitrag down   and that is probabl a valuabl thing to have happen  it is veri clear desir for ani market   whi the spread between riskless asset with the same matur are as larg as they are  wholli on the ground of the degre of liquid   sn   t strike me as someth that is altogeth desir  second  unless i misunderstand the natur of the program  you will be pick up a number of issu   and in the low probabl event that inde we run out of issu for the public by       or sooner the way it is go  the treasuri won   t have to go into the market to bid for those secur   we in effect will have swap them out with the treasuri and there would be no market pressur   effect we are pre retir the issu for the treasuri  and that is not a bad idea   now  no one can forecast with ani degre of accuraci what the feder budget surplus are go to be in the futur   and obvious no one can make a judgment as to whether this program is more than just a stop gap measur on the way to the disappear of the treasuri market  in which case this is all moot    but all in all  i think you have succeed in propos that we do someth that  frank  we probabl ought to have done in the past  which is to emphas off the run issu   essenti  an endeavor to move the liquid premium from on the run to twice or thrice off the run issu with sheer money market mechan strike me as a desir thing to do in ani event   so  while you may have taken a good deal of the committe s  e  i think it was quit worthwhil
thank you   if i could just note      has wise counsel me that the number i quot to you on the administr s surplus of      billion is not for public   that number is embed in what the treasuri has in it cash forecast for the rest of the year  and that is not in the public domain
i think we ought to grow our balanc sheet with real estat   laughter
texa real estat
are you recommend anyth in particular
we could build build and eas     s problem
on a wholli differ issu  let me just quick ask a question   baa tend to sell at somewhat lower interest rate than bbbs   bbbs are    year matur and baa are somewhat longer   is that the differ   in other word  is it the longer matur that s creat the spread or is there a real risk differ between moodi s baa and standard and poor   s bbb
you got me
a rare event    laughter
you are kind to say so
this has noth to do with this particular meet  but if you could give me an answer on that later i   d appreci it
yes  we will look into that   thank you  mr  chairman
presid broaddus   where is he    laughter
he   s to your right    laughter
i want to ask a question  or i guess more accur state an opinion  about the swap   is that propos on the tabl now
what realli worri me is that the continu exist of this facil put us in a posit where we can be drawn into action that we may not want to be drawn into at some point   i question whether that is desir   in my view it is not   i m talk  of cours  specif about mexico   the situat is veri differ now from what it was in      when this swap was origin implement   the mexican economi is consider stronger and the peso is float reason success   so i just wonder whether this would be a good  e to get out of this swap  as we ve gotten out of near all the other
i think you are rais a good point   i wouldn t think  with the mexican elect on the horizon  that this is the right  e   but i do believ it may well be desir to put that issu on the tabl and take it up at a later date   obvious  we would need to consult with the treasuri depart on this   but at the appropri  e i think we ought to rais this issu   these swap  which were put in place in an earlier period  and most of which we have elimin  have had their day and are a true anachron   but they still have a polit valu   and until we can dissip the polit valu  it probabl would be difficult to unwind them   but the notion that they will be implement is as remot as our run out of treasuri secur    laughter   presid jordan
thank you   my comment was go to be along that same line  that this absolut would not be the  e to fail to renew the swap arrang with mexico  that action could be far too easili misinterpret   howev  a year from now we will have a    new administr in mexico and mayb a new minist of financ and central bank head  and a new head of the central bank in canada   so befor we get to this point in       i think it might at least be worth explor with the mexican and canadian an exit strategi from these swap
i have two question for     first  on page    of his handout  what is the differ between the      billion and the       billion   in effect is it a reserv in case the surplus is larger than we think   how do we interpret that gap
the      billion is the product of the sequenc of my think about how one could cap soma temporarili in our primari market behavior and in some way communic that effect to the market   the question is how to communic effect to the market that we were skew our demand in the secondari market toward the short end  the      billion is just the number that was veri crude calcul off a current snapshot  and too much stock shouldn t be put in it   it just give a sens that there is a suffici of secur in the market if we use this formula that could carri us for a while   the     billion  round to     billion  repres the current reserv need we see over the next seven month   now  i m not sure we are go to be comfort buy     billion over the next seven month  but we ll see if we can pick up the pace as we go along
so this realli should be interpret as a measur of how long you can follow the polici you are describ
yes  how long we could tread water in this way
my second question relat to the on the run off the run issu  is there some reason we haven t done that befor   it seem like a logic idea
we do not purchas on the run issu in the secondari market   my point has been that if we let our share of the primari market expand  we would be collaps the market for the on the run issu in nomin term   that s the onli point   we have not been purchas the on the run   howev  we have been suppress our demand  if you will  vis  vis this schedul for decay secur that are way  way off the run   you can see on page    that we ve been tri more or less to work our way up toward    percent all along the coupon curv   in that sens we have been buy issu decay way  way off the run more aggress  issu decay in the   year area and the   year area are way off   so it is in that sens that i m make the distinct here
mr  chairman  i just have a comment   after our march meet  i was not sure that even   would be abl to come up with a formula that would satisfi all the instruct he receiv   i think it is quit extraordinari that he  in fact  has done that   and i believ he should be compliment
i did    laughter
i just want him to know that his boss also compliment him
thank you  both
ani further question for     if not  would somebodi like to move the domest oper
would somebodi like to move the renew of the reciproc swap arrang
i want to dissent on that vote
the feder reserv bank of richmond dissent  let s move on to the econom situat       and vinc reinhart
vinc will begin
the data on foreign econom activ that have come in sinc your march meet have run high relat to our prior expect   we have pass through much of this surpris to the level of foreign output in our project for the first half of      but have not seen as much reason to alter the pace of it subsequ expans   despit the brighter prospect for the level of activ abroad  the dollar appreci       percent relat to the major currenc over the intermeet period   evid the upsid surpris to activ in the unit state outstrip those abroad  and interest rate rose more here  even after take account of this widen of the interest rate advantag to u s  oblig  though  we have been hard press to explain much of the strength of the dollar  especi relat to the euro   true  our econom activ continu to expand more rapid than that in the euro area  and the cacophoni of offici respons to euro weak rais doubt that necessari structur reform will be forthcom   be that as it may  with the strong extern impetus stem from the weak euro and grow momentum to domest spend  the euro area should expand about       percent this year and next   under this forecast is the belief that the european central bank is veri like to tighten in short order and eventu to rais it polici rate a total of       percentag point by the end of        a downsid risk to our outlook for spend  howev  is that european offici    concern about the valu of the euro in the near term will extend beyond the essenti symbol act of  il intervent  should that happen  to a firm monetari polici sooner and by more than we have assum  of cours  that is a risk that could be made more palpabl depend on the action you take today   we are concern as well that japanes offici will fail to deliv the polici stanc appropri to ensur sustain econom expans suffici to work down the consider stockpil of unus resourc  there is littl doubt that near term read on the pace of spend in japan will be on the high side  even abstract from problem with    measur   as the news of this favor first half perform come out  the bank of japan is like to pick short rate off their zero floor  but onli by a small amount    in our view  this near term strength in the economi is a temporari spurt  not much more than a bounc back from the sharp contract in the second half of last year   go forward  household will still be burden by doubt about job secur that will make them reluct consum  the lag effect of the earlier appreci of the yen will cut into net export  and fiscal polici is schedul to shrink it s ulus   as a result  japanes real gdp growth is forecast to settl at below   percent over the last six quarter of the forecast period   becaus the expans of activ among our other trade partner seem more assur  when we add it all up our forecast call for output growth in the foreign economi of       percent this year and   percent next year   of cours  this outlook is shape import by the past and project path of the exchang rate   with respect to flow  the exchang rate act to tilt global spend toward those region where capac pressur are less bind   thus  today   s strong dollar help to direct some u s  spend toward foreign market  make our own substanti pressur on resourc a bit less intens   over  e  though  that same level of the exchang rate contribut to a substanti  and deepen  current account deficit and an increas relianc on foreign investor    willing to hold increas amount of claim on the unit state   we have not been abl to convinc ourselv that those foreign investor will continu voluntarili to hold ever larger stock of debt at the current level of exchang rate indefinit   and so  we   ve written down a path in which the dollar   s valu fall over the forecast period  the sens that return on dollar asset will look less attract over  e to foreign investor also help to explain the rise in longer term yield on dollar denomin asset in     s outlook   as ani forecast is wont to do  we have project a path for the dollar   s declin that is relat smooth   in part  that repres our equivoc on when that process of adjust will start   but when it    it may not be so order or well contain   of perhap most relev for your polici consider  the declin in the dollar impli that the foreign sector will no longer be a forc help to absorb robust domest spend and to restrain domest inflat   rather  less of ani excess domest demand will be satisfi from foreign capac  and import price  and like tradabl price more general  will be ad to domest inflat   the compon of the revis to our outlook have offset implic for net export and the current account go forward   the stronger level of foreign activ rais the world   s demand for good    and servic overal  to the benefit of u s  export   howev  becaus the dollar begin our project path of glide down from a higher altitud  relat price over the forecast period work to favor import and discourag export more than previous   the net of these forc is incorpor arithmet in the staff forecast as a shrink negat contribut of net export to gdp growth this year and next that is rough similar to that in the march  book   we also anticip the current account deficit to deepen to      billion by the fourth quarter of        this deficit repres about   percent of nomin gdp and is     billion more than in our march forecast   to the extent that you agre with the staff assess that the impli accumul of u s  oblig abroad will strain foreign investor    patienc  the likelihood of the dollar depreci we   ve project  and the risk attend to that outlook  would seem just a bit more consider
as you know  two major statist releas came out this morn  hous start and the cpi   we   ve distribut a tabl summar those report   total start were up about   percent in april  reflect a rebound in multifamili unit from march   s low level   that singl famili start were stabl  rather than fall off  run counter to our expect  but the signific of that read is call into question by a   percent declin in permit   thus  the pattern of indic in this sector continu to be ambigu  with just hint that the residenti build cycl is about to turn down   as for the cpi  the overal index was flat and it core compon rose     percent last month   food price increas less than we anticip  but energi and core price were in line with our expect  the latter admit with a surpris jump in the tobacco categori   the    month chang in the core back off to     percent  after spike to     percent last month   that number is the same as a year ago  but still about a quarter point abov the cyclic low   at this stage of our analysi  i don   t see anyth in today   s news that would requir us to make ani fundament chang in our  book forecast   if i were to summar that forecast briefli  given my immin departur  and with apolog to madam de pompadour  it could be apr moi le delug   mayb that   s just a tad over dramat  but the pictur we   ve paint of what lie ahead certain is less attract than the landscap of the past few year   to be sure  our baselin project is that  with onli a moder polici tighten  just a littl more than the market alreadi anticip  aggreg demand growth will slacken appreci and overal pce    inflat will run onli in the low   percent area in        but that result  in our analysi  hing on a flat stock market and a consider declin in oil price  two notion to which the market have proven notabl resist in the few day sinc the  book went to press   and  import  our baselin project indic that  as you exit       you   ll find yourselv confront with still extrem tight labor market and an uptrend in core inflat   we  of cours  offer a simpl solut to the project inflat problem in one of our altern scenario  a bigger rise in short term interest rate   the model simul suggest that  if our baselin is correct  then a sharper elev of the fund rate  to   percent by year end  would check the pickup of core inflat   inde  this scenario might be character as akin to the    revers soft land    that has been mention so often   anoth  perhap less appeal  way to describ it would be a    growth recess      the central point is that we think the sign are clearer now that the labor market have becom unsustain tight and that an appreci rise in the unemploy rate probabl will be requir to hang onto the bulk of the disinfl progress that you   ve made in recent year   if our analysi is correct  even a further escal of product growth will onli postpon the day of reckon   as product acceler  you may get a temporari lower of the effect nairu  but onc wage begin to catch up with the improv in product  the effect nairu will move back up and inflat will tend to rise  to be sure  it   s possibl that the longer rang natur rate has fallen  so that we may not have to see unemploy reach the level we would onc have thought necessari  but our guess is that the increas will have to be notic   this is where an unhappi fact come into the pictur  there isn   t ani preced  at least in our modern econom histori  for realiz a substanti rise in our unemploy rate without a recess  not just a growth recess  but a meaning absolut declin in activ   one may reason ask   are we realli destin to repeat histori  or might there be reason to hope that this  e will be differ   i   m not prepar today to offer you a full exposit of the way in which the cyclic conjunctur or the structur of the economi today might be dissimilar from what it was in past episod   i   ll offer a few  brief comment  howev   first  from the viewpoint of the simpl macro model  there are no logic ground for rule out the possibl of a fair soft land  one can envis a period of relat slow  but continu posit     growth dure which the pressur on resourc are gradual reliev  and inflat is contain and then brought back down   how far abov zero that growth might be on averag would be a function of how larg the current output gap is and how high potenti gdp growth is  combin a low nairu and a high potenti growth rate  and there could be room for a distinct posit expans pace   but  back away from the ether  it   seem as if our formal model and even our judgment analys routin fail to captur the sort of    nonlinear    that come into play onc the economi start to deceler appreci   such phenomena could go a long way in explain whi  when we   ve attempt to appli the brake in past expans  we general end up skid into the ditch   i think that at least part of the problem relat to the fragil that typic develop dure the expans phase of the busi cycl   the chairman has  in effect  been address one sourc of such fragil in his admonit to banker that they need to be more cautious   loan loss and capit impair  their seed have been sown in the enthusiasm of the preced boom  have often creat credit crunch that exacerb the multipli acceler effect damp privat invest   these difficulti can be especi great if bank and other financi institut have financ a construct boom  becaus an overhang of suppli in real estat market  where the asset collater loan are immobil and long live  is not easili absorb  at this point  i   d judg that the problem in this sphere aren   t as great as they have been at some  e in the past   and  if there are latent problem  they may lie this  e relat less in the commerci area and relat more in the residenti  where we haven   t had a cyclic test of the underwrit standard that have made mortgag credit more access in the past decad   i am still less sanguin about anoth asset market  that for corpor equiti   share price clear are suscept to exagger swing as the balanc of greed and fear tilt in a bearish direct  with mark effect on the cost and avail of equiti capit and on household wealth   in the current cycl  there would seem to be a risk of a particular larg declin in the market  given that  by mani convent metric  we   ve experienc a specul bubbl of extraordinari proport   the market correct scenario in the  book  though involv a consider     percent declin from the march peak for the wilshir  may well underst the downsid potenti here   but  even if you vast increas the dimens of the declin  our econometr model would still say you can avoid recess  if you cushion the effect by back off on your tighten      is this realist   mayb yes  mayb no   i certain wouldn   t question your nimbl  but it could be challeng to gaug what is requir to avoid an undu weaken of demand and yet avoid ignit anoth bull run   i person am concern  moreov  that consum sen ent could prove volatil   this hasn   t been much in evid in the past coupl of month  perhap becaus the nasdaq slide revers gain that were enjoy onli briefli  and perhap main by investor who were ride what they must have recogn was a wild wave   but i suspect that in recent year mani household have been lull into complac about the adequaci of their save by the run up in share price and that a major shrinkag of their nest egg would sever dent their spirit   on the other hand  though  it isn   t clear that we have seen outsiz wealth effect on the up side as consum    spirit have soar  so perhap we need not be great concern about the consequ on the down side   i   d be remiss if i did not mention one other like reason that soft land have proven elus   that is that  in part becaus of the lag in the effect of interest rate increas and our foggi crystal ball  we probabl have had a tendenc to tighten too much or too long   this undoubt would be an argument of those who would caution against more aggress tighten action right now  with the effect of your first five polici action still in the pipelin   howev  i would rais the question whether that pipelin has not sprung a leak  drain off some of the restraint  i refer  of cours  to the consider further increas in share price  on net  sinc you began your sequenc   this  to be sure  is not a comprehens assess of the risk that lie ahead   vinc note the potenti ramif of our extern imbal   the interact of all these forc could be complex and certain are imposs to forese   howev  i don   t think this add up to a prescript of hesit in the move toward greater monetari restraint   inde  one might argu that the pattern of too much  too long that i note a moment ago has been a byproduct of do too littl earli enough   the bottom line judgment i would offer is that  if anyth  the news of the intermeet period has highlight the basic imbal in the economi that probabl will becom more serious and more difficult to deal with if aggreg demand is not rein in at least moder  and i don   t think you can depend on the market to do the work without your particip   that conclud our remark  mr  chairman
question for   or vinc
i m struck by your last comment that we ve perhap tend to do too much late in the game becaus we did too littl in the earli stage   but   do too littl in the earli stage justifi in anyon s mind do too much later
it certain wouldn t justifi it  but one would hope that by get ahead of the curv  to use the parlanc
but if we are behind the curv  do we want to overreact in an attempt to correct that
presum you never want to overreact
right   i like that answer
but as one perhap get frustrat in not see the desir respons and as the problem seem to be get wors becaus inflat lag the chang in the output gap  there is probabl alway go to be a risk of overstay on the tight side
presid  n
i have a question about the simul   if you carri these out to      or      and beyond  mayb you did or mayb you didn t  what would you get for inflat   i m particular interest in the baselin case and it flat fund rate scenario after this year
we get inflat continu on up   this is all fine calibr through our judgment forecast and then what the model produc  which is this upward trend in inflat   part of the problem in that scenario is that the fund rate is stabl at       percent and thus it begin to declin in real term   in essenc you begin to have less and less restraint and you re accommod an acceler of inflat   it so happen that run the exercis with our model and hold the fund rate steadi at   percent avoid that problem    and you have a stabl inflat path   in fact  a coupl of year down the road you probabl will find that the unemploy rate is drift up abov the steadi state of the nairu and you will need to begin to eas polici in order to avoid overshoot on the disinfl   but how far you want to go down this road depend in part on where you want to end up   if you want to end up at   percent core pce inflat  then this   percent scenario might fit the bill  if you want to get inflat down closer to what we think is true price stabil  that tighter scenario and relat output gap may need to be there for a while
what i am tri to get a handl on is how much more inflat we ought to anticip in anoth year or two in the baselin case and the flat fund rate   i certain believ you that the tighter polici may produc the kind of reaction you re talk about   but in those other two scenario
well  i ll confess that we did not extend the flat fund rate scenario to the out year  but i certain anticip that it would be a much wors look pictur   the extens of the       percent fund rate in our model extrapol  and this involv some extrapol of the baselin forecast to begin with  result in inflat by      move into the   percent area on core pce
three percent   okay
i have a question about the intern account  the foreign dollar claim   how do we get a sens of the magnitud here   i understand the uneasi about this   but what fraction of dutch asset  for exampl  are now claim on the unit state   or how do these fraction compar with some of these model of op  intern portfolio diversif   i know they may give you some guidanc of how far off we
the model of op  intern portfolio diversif would suggest that there is a long way to run becaus they conclud that there is a signific home bias   that is  household in a domest countri hold far too much of their wealth in their own currenc and not enough intern asset   so  from that perspect  both they and we should be accumul more intern asset relat   as a rough approxim the answer you get is that the asset a countri   s resid should hold ought to be someth on the order of their share of world gdp
shouldn t that depend on expect regard exchang rate   with a fix exchang rate structur  then hold of intern asset gravit toward the distribut of a countri   s foreign trade   but if there are currenc risk  foreign asset hold would tend to fall quit short of such a distribut
sure   i was talk about an environ in which there was an equal of risk adjust return worldwid   in that case the intern portfolio diversif of household would move toward
foreign currenc asset
right   it would move toward those share   but the fact is that household hold fewer foreign asset than our model think they should   howev  counter that is a long histor properti that they don t hold those asset  and we are test the rang of reserv share  now to answer the factual part of your question  we don t have intern flow of fund account that would give us inform about the level of foreign asset and their distribut across countri   we can get it from the perspect of the unit state  in fact    there is a new survey come out on that   but i can t answer your question for the belgian dentist or the dutch broker
thank you  mr  chairman      i was also interest in your comment about    too littl  too late    or    too much  too long    from a coupl of differ perspect   your   percent fund rate scenario as compar with the baselin case of       percent would seem to provid a rang of option   the       percent would give us some protect against the downward phase of the cycl you talk about  where we are unabl to factor in what will realli happen becaus of the nonlinear that are involv when the economi is slow down   i   m just ask whether i m interpret your comment correct in term of the differ between your baselin case and the   percent fund rate scenario  with the   percent altern your model  sn t produc a recess  but then again we don t know how to judg some of the risk associ with the nonlinear that aris   so am i right in assum that at least with regard to the next coupl of year  you d say that there is some kind of cushion between the baselin and the tighter fund polici altern that would absorb some of the risk of the nonlinear
first  i would caution against take ani of these number as serious as we seem to be do here
that   s a caveat i would issu about these long run simul  let alon the shorter run forecast   i guess i d say that as we assess the trend in aggreg demand and take as given certain featur of the extern environ  we don t see       percent as do the job of cap inflat   now  if you were tri to figur out what strategi to    adopt if you had to make a decis today on where to move the fund rate by the end of the year  i d certain character the       percent as a more cautious approach   that strategi lower the risk of so sharp a deceler in the economi that you begin to set off the momentum of these nonlinear   but this conclus is veri specul  and shock could come along that would signific alter the pictur   it is a gentler polici   whether it s kinder in the long run  laughter  depend on how thing evolv   if it mere delay what you feel is go to be need to catch up  thus produc a more violent respons  it would not be kinder in the end
come at it anoth way  though  suppos we start in the next month or so to move the fund rate up as we approach that total increas of     basi point by the end of the year   at this point you don t consid that a descript of too much  too long
no  definit not   that is our thesi   as for whether it is correct or not  i can t provid ani guarante
but if you were go to assess the risk
it is an instal  but we think you are go to need more instal down the road to realli hold the line on inflat   inflat will be tend to drift up as you move through the forecast horizon
what is the risk that it is too littl  too late
well  my concern  particular in light of the develop in the last few day  is that the market are entir too comfort with the polici of gradual increas in the fund rate   we may find that the stock market continu to trend upward and we do not get the negat wealth effect that we have in our forecast  but rather a neutral or    posit wealth effect   that would creat an aggreg demand pictur that was much less compat with hold the line on inflat   so i would identifi that risk   vinc identifi the risk that at some point the dollar could have a more precipit declin  and obvious that would exacerb the pressur on domest resourc   i don t want to paint the pictur as complet asymmetr becaus  as i also suggest  the market might be vulner to a signific revers if the basic  posit psycholog is shaken by some event   who know  in that case the dollar still might look like the place to be   so  there are risk on both side
thank you   first of all     let me say that it realli   look differ from this end of the tabl where you use to sit    laughter
but if i sound a bit disori and confus  rememb that i ve onli been sit here a littl over an hour  wherea you had a lot of year to absorb the vision from here  when i look at the data in the  book for the last four quarter  includ the current quarter and assum that the  book forecast is correct on that quarter  i have to say that the result set of number is realli extraordinari   it   s not onli a set of number that was not forecast  but one that i would consid unforecast   one of the exercis that i like to go through to prepar for an fomc meet is to review how thing look a year ago to me  to the blue chip forecast  and to a lot of other folk   and i reflect on what kind of polici assumpt went into those forecast   some  i review more than a year  but certain i tri to recal how the economi look a year earlier   in view of these number on real gdp for the four quarter period through the current quarter  i was look at some tabl    the staff prepar and how they compar to those done last may   my first thought was   my gosh   the staff got it exact right   and then i realiz i was look at a tabl on nomin gdp for that four quarter period    laughter
we were expect   percent nomin
then i pictur myself in the fourth quarter of       say at the decemb meet  look back and say   my gosh   the staff got it exact right in term of nomin gdp  real gdp  and all of the other variabl in these  book tabl for the six quarter period start in the third quarter of      and run through the fourth quarter of next year   but then if i look at where the fund rate would be  at       or   percent or someth like that  and the associ other yield  i think i would be absolut mystifi  now  i have to admit that  when i reflect on the financi market of the last four quarter  i have a lot of unansw question about their consist with the perform of the economi   certain the treasuri market is difficult to interpret   let   s say that the market have it right  and what is reflect in the financi market is that we have a transitori acceler in nomin spend and real output and then we will glide into the staff   s set of number in the  book   in that scenario  i cannot imagin get into the fourth quarter of      and see the fund rate up there in the   percent rang or more and the associ other interest rate compar higher   in fact  i would say where rate are right now is probabl consist with this set of nomin and real gdp number   your reaction
we   ve made a few mistak in the past    laughter   so we could be make a mistak this  e   we could be make a mistak this  e even if we had been perfect in the past   but in essenc our judgment is that the rise in interest rate has to some extent reflect the pressur of an extraordinari expans in aggreg demand that is in    part a product of the run up in stock price   and  in all likelihood  it   s also part a reflect of an adjust to a higher potenti growth rate that has come with an acceler of product   as we look at what has been an acceler pattern of econom expans  it seem to us that we probabl have not move interest rate up enough to curb that acceler of aggreg demand and real growth   so  we believ that we need to move rate up still further for a period in order to rein in this expans somewhat and restor a balanc between aggreg suppli and demand   whether rate will have to go as high as we forecast and remain that high is difficult to say   fiscal polici develop could play a role in determin that   but this forecast is our best shot   and it s not one that is grossli at odd with what the market seem to be anticip  with one except   and that is that we are look for a signific further rise in nomin bond yield becaus we don t think the market realli has built in this upward trend in inflat that we believ is commenc   so as we look forward  we expect there will be a need for a high real interest rate  and we anticip that inflat expect are go to be deterior somewhat in the environ that we are forecast
thank you  mr  chairman   vinc  begin in      and continu through      the foreign real gdp growth rate are quit strong  especi in the industri countri   would you character this primarili as a cyclic develop or is there an indic that perhap some of the    new economi    develop  which certain have affect us over the last four or five year and have produc forecast that were consist too low  are at work as well
i think a signific fraction of the higher growth for      and      is cyclic becaus by our es  there are output gap to be work down in mani of the industri countri   and the fact that foreign growth in      moder in our forecast realli suggest that we couldn t find the new economi effect work as success abroad as has been the case in the unit state   right now there are some tentat piec in the puzzl that suggest that product growth has probabl pick up in canada   and we have rais our es  of potenti output growth for that countri   rise product is also the case in some of the smaller european countri  particular those that use inform technolog rather heavili   howev  those are the smaller countri and their contribut to total foreign output is relat modest   it won t be until we see someth in the major industri countri that we are go to see foreign econom growth abov the top line of our forecast   and it s in the major industri countri where the structur problem seem most sever   whether those problem will actual be a drag on activ  say  in japan  or just imped the progress necessari toward take full advantag of the new economi  is hard to say
let me just add a footnot   you made the point that we see foreign growth slow  that happen as well in our own forecast for the u s  economi   so it may be that you would not find sign of the new economi in the macro forecast   but look at differ sector in the economi could result in a forecast that is more nontradit in natur  i don t disagre with you  incident  about the limit import of the new economi element  certain in europ   but it is someth that could becom a factor at some point
and one reason we ve been look for it harder in the last coupl of month is that  in fact  equiti price have risen so much in mani part of europ     and the better perform of it sector equiti relat to the major index also has some preced in the u s  data
in a countri like finland  which is presum to have a major rise in and a disproportion share of high tech usag  do we see it in their output per hour figur
that was one of the small countri in europ that i had in mind   there is an oecd studi that look at a few of the peripher countri and argu that the trend in output per hour has pick up in them
what would be the order of magnitud
right now it is relat modest   i don t have the number in front of me  but i think it is on the order of     percentag point
thank you  mr  chairman      i want to ask you about the wealth effect assumpt in the  book   i am particular interest in what you are assum about the carryov effect of the increas in the stock market that we saw in      and in previous year   you are assum a flat stock market in the baselin and you indic that there would be a small negat in term of the wealth effect in the second half of this year and a negat of about     point in        i m just wonder how you are factor in the impact of the increas in the stock market in earlier year in these assumpt
well  that is all fold in there   that is a reflect of the distribut lag of those effect
how power are the increas in previous year on this year s consumpt
were it not for those lag effect we d have a negat effect this year on balanc   but we still have a good part of the effect of the      rise in particular impact the economi this year
whi are they turn negat then
the stabl stock market mean that the ratio of wealth to incom is fall   and that s the indic on which one would base an anticip drag on consumpt
what   s involv is the distinct between the level and the growth of consumpt   there will no longer be an impetus from wealth ad to or boost consumpt growth  although the earlier wealth effect will still be support the level of consumpt   so just from the fact that the stock market level out  we no longer get that kick in consumpt
i understand that  but i would have thought the impact of the previous year would have had a larger impact this year becaus i know the effect don   t occur just within that one year
in the first half of this year we are get a substanti effect   but at this point it is decay and in the second half of this year it will have disappear   we expect to get a veri larg proport of the effect within the first year and a half  and it diminish after that
what was the effect in the first half of this year
rough a percentag point
we got over a percentag point in the first quarter and then  in our forecast  it slip down consider in the second quarter   so  we have a littl over     percentag point effect on the pce growth in the first half  which trail off to about rough down     or     percentag point in the second half   part of the reason  too  is that the stock market actual has  on balanc  flatten out now   it has had it up and down  but the wilshir      has not been rise as rapid as the nasdaq obvious was earlier   so with that lag distribut  we are start to see the posit wealth effect realli   out  even though we do have consider lag in that model that are import
on page   in part i of the  book is a paragraph label    prospect for the suppli side of the economi and inflat      it   s nice to see the suppli side cover there   the first sentenc say      the expans of aggreg suppli has been substanti  but nowher near enough to match the advanc of demand      i m not sure what that mean   presum when you look at the economi you are sort of observ the intersect of suppli and demand and both are advanc     your sentenc just mean that as they have advanc inflat has gone up a littl   is that the evid on which you base that statement
no  basic it s point to level of resourc util   whether we look at the unemploy rate or industri capac util  in both case the level of util has been rise   so  by definit in essenc  the growth of aggreg suppli has been less than the growth of aggreg demand
it look to me as if you ve said that the growth was the same but we are just run out of potenti for further growth in suppli or someth like that  mr     i guess i m more comfort put it the way i did   and as you note  one could also point to evid on the wage and price side that is confirm this increas pressur
anybodi els have a question or comment  would somebodi like to start the discuss   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  the inform we have this month from our district is not veri differ from what it has been for the last sever meet   we ve seen a few sign of a possibl moder in consum spend   the pace of car sale has deceler in sever part of the district  follow the nation pattern to some extent  we ve also had a few report of less robust hous construct and sale most recent  especi in the  ina   and we   ve heard some anecdot report that higher mortgag rate are final begin to bite   but as   said  the evid is still pretti ambigu  such comment are not heard that frequent and our sens is that residenti activ is still remark strong across our region as a whole   inde  broad speak  our district economi across all sector is clear veri strong   we had some sign a coupl of month ago that manufactur activ might be deceler a bit  but our most recent survey suggest that factori activ has reviv   we ve even had a few posit comment from the textil industri  someth we haven t heard for a long  e   just to cite a littl addit inform  the washington metropolitan area can onli be describ as boom  and that includ the district of columbia as well as the out suburb   both commerci and residenti real estat are veri strong here   and final  labor market remain except    tight throughout our district   that is obvious an old stori  but in my experi it s increas becom a preoccup with our busi contact  director  and other   and we do hear more report of wage increas  now  when i look at the nation economi  the question i ask myself is this   is there anyth in the recent inform on the economi that suggest we ought to back off from our current strategi of increment increas the real feder fund rate until we get some sens that the growth of aggreg demand is come back into line with reason es  of the sustain growth in suppli   i just don t see ani such inform at this point   on the contrari  the most recent data on price and on wage in particular seem to me to underscor the need for continu increas in real interest rate to bring the aggreg economi back into better balanc   we got a new cpi number this morn      you mention the    month chang in the core cpi was     percent   i had call richmond and my staff said the number was     percent for the    month period end in april   it may have been       percent and the differ is in the round   in ani event  it is approach a rate that is     point higher than it was just a few month ago   so it seem to me that there is at least some evid that we are at last experienc some increas in actual inflat   and the staff s project that the upward trend is go to persist strike me as both reason and disturb  wage pressur also appear to be pick up  that shouldn t be surpris with labor market as tight as they are   the eci rose veri sharpli in the first quarter   the staff has now revis upward it project for that measur  which again seem reason to me   the  book observ that the various compens measur we use may not be captur the full impact of nontradit action that busi firm are now take  sign bonus     retent bonus  and the like  to attract and retain worker   we don   t realli know how these new action may be affect both the growth of overal labor cost and price behavior by firm   i would just add that that observ is veri consist with mani of the comment we ve heard from our director and other busi contact  what bother me most  though  is the evid  or at least what i see as evid  of higher inflat expect   we see it to some extent in the household survey data  long term interest rate are now rise   to me a reason guess is that at least some of that reflect an increas in inflat expect    the spread between the yield on regular   year treasuri bond and    year tip has increas signific sinc our last meet   i know one can t read inflat expect chang point for point from chang in that spread  but i think the kind of increas we ve had recent is probabl signal that expect of futur inflat have risen at least to some extent and mayb materi   i recogn that temporari factor can explain some of these develop   but it also seem perfect plausibl to me that they are be driven to a larg extent by our persist aggreg demand suppli imbal in the context of ever tighter resourc constraint  and that real interest rate need to continu to rise to contain inflat go forward   that strike me as the most straightforward interpret of the most recent inform we ve seen   and for me at least  the main polici imper face us now is to be sure that real interest rate continu to increas   i would add that this feel on my part is hard diminish by     s comment at the end of his statement  which i thought were veri power   relev to your comment  tom  it seem to me that what we need to do is to avoid get ourselv into a posit where we have to react strong and thus open ourselv up to the charg of overreact
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   growth in new england remain remark strong   employ continu to grow at a rapid rate  just below the pace of the nation   and unemploy rate for the region as a whole  as well as for three of the district   s state  are at all  e low   reflect this and in some way echo al broaddus   s comment  it is just not possibl to have a convers about local econom condit anywher in the district without discuss the near imposs of find labor  whether the need is for high tech personnel or decid low tech blue collar entri level staff  these posit are harder to fill and they are more expens than previous   local firm  larg and small  continu to be invent about make capit invest that replac labor and about use a wide varieti of techniqu intend to moder the cost of hire and retain staff   these includ the use of temporari help and outsourc  even to foreign supplier   but increas these techniqu are not enough   and our contact report that hold the line on wage  and on benefit cost particular  is realli becom a lose battl   ad to this is the fact that non personnel cost are also rise  especi if product input are oil base   manufactur use or produc plastic seem particular hard hit   so  while widespread price increas still are not the norm  such increas seem to be much more feasibl and closer to happen than in prior month  look to the nation scene  incom data sinc our last meet onc again suggest that for most  if not all  of this period growth has been not onli stronger than expect but has been acceler   moreov  the expect pickup in inflat seem to have begun in earnest whether one look at actual price data for good and servic  at wage cost and especi benefit cost  or at expect   i think it s import  howev  to take a measur    respons to this uptick in price   after all  the  book as well as our own forecast have been suggest for some  e now that the rate of price increas would acceler   that s whi we favor a tighter monetari polici   moreov  we may be see the begin of a slowdown  as evidenc by the volatil and downward trend of the stock market  rise capit and debt cost  and the hous and retail sale data  our forecast  howev  like the  book  suggest that in the absenc of sizabl further tighten  this slowdown  if in fact it is real and not the    head fake    that is mention in the  book  will not be enough to forestal deepen price problem   we may or may not be    behind the curv     as some would say   but i do think it is necessari now to be veri focus on a measur forward direct of polici
thank you  mr  chairman   the seventh district economi continu to perform quit well  but the tone of report from our contact has chang recent  as sever note some slow in activ   a grow number of firm

retail headquart in our district told me his compani had seen no sign that sale were slow nation this month   howev  some retail told us that their sale    in the midwest last month were not as strong

the price paid compon from the region pmi report were down onli slight from five year high reach in march  suggest that district firm are face increas cost pressur   inde  sever larg manufactur firm

pleas treat it confidenti  the employ cost index for the midwest has recent been rise fa  than that for the nation as a whole   that is consist with the find of some research our staff has done  which confirm that relat unemploy rate continu to be use predictor of region differ in wage growth   in some case tight labor market are hold back busi expans   for exampl  one auto supplier recent close a michigan plant becaus there weren t enough worker avail to staff it   and    percent of the respond to our    latest survey of michigan retail said custom servic was suffer becaus of worker shortag  on the whole  most firm have been more success in expand employ than the veri low unemploy rate would suggest   increas we have been hear anecdot report that unmeasur immigr may be play a signific role in this employ growth  as you have suggest in recent meet  mr  chairman   of cours  immigr have long had a signific presenc in larg citi like chicago  but offici statist suggest that the immigr share of the labor forc in other part of the district is neither high nor increas   howev  i recent visit columbus  indiana  a manufactur center of about        peopl where cummin engin is locat and where the unemploy rate is     percent   i heard extens report that the town has seen a tremend increas in immigr from latin america in the last few year   it was es  that       to       immigr were now work in area firm   the stori is similar in other small to medium size town in our district   incident                                          told me that he had contact the in becaus of concern that mani immigr were undocu  the in respond that they lack the resourc to investig these case unless they involv troublemak   of cours  the citi   s employ need the immigr to staff their plant and other facil  turn to the nation outlook  recent data have led us to increas our project for growth and for inflat in        gain in employ and hour continu to be impress and the consumpt sector remain red hot through the first quarter   our real gdp growth path is slight stronger than that in the  book   although consum will eventu slow their spend pace  we are expect less slow in the second half of this    year than the  book   the inflat data are begin to show sign of deterior  and our outlook for pce inflat is rough similar to that in the  book over the next    month  so  the key question at this junctur is whether the polici action we have taken to date are suffici to put the economi on a sustain track   consum expect continu to be quit elev and the wealth effect from prior year  equiti gain has probabl not run it cours   we have been wait for a slowdown in aggreg demand for some  e  although this hope has not been realiz  the increas inflationari consequ to date have been minim   but i am not as op ist this  e around   in my view the balanc of risk is clear weight toward higher inflat

mr  chairman  in the eighth district the stori that i hear as i wander around the district are veri much the same as they have been for the last six month or so   i do get a sens that two thing are perhap a littl differ   one is that i hear more report of what peopl are tout as a one shot wage catch up   in other word  employ are not anticip ongo increas of a larger magnitud but are tri to catch up to the market becaus they have a sens that they have fallen behind in one area or anoth   i also believ that more frequent review of compens are take place   firm that tradit in recent year might have review compens and made adjust onc a year are now do it more frequent  review everi six month  for exampl  my up and fedex contact suggest a signific  i don   t want to exagger  but definit increas in the pressur they are see   they see greater pressur in the labor market  greater pressur in u s  demand  and greater level of activ abroad  and in all three area the pressur are abov what they had anticip     on the labor market side                               said they are    struggl    in his word and are go to be ad incent to attract worker   they are short a substanti number of worker  particular at                                  they have miss some of their deliveri  e becaus they don   t have enough manpow   he said and he character the strain as clear more intens than they were a year ago  say that his compani is increas entri level pay by   to    percent plus pay retent bonus   all                    oper are under veri substanti pressur                     lower the minimum score on it basic skill test for qualifi new blue collar worker   my contact also note that his firm is expect health care cost to be up   to   percent this year and    to    percent next year   and he say that in talk to cfos around the countri he has the sens that other expect much the same   this includ all the contact he talk with on a regular basi  in term of demand pressur  my up contact say that domest volum is come in much stronger than anticip   in his word  up is experienc    just unbeliev domest demand      activ abroad is clear veri strong and my contact say that up now expect the volum in europ in      to equal the volum previous anticip for        that is  up has pull forward three year it growth forecast for europ   carrier are absolut max out at capac on the asia to u s  rout and the firm is search for more aircraft to expand capac  anoth interest note from my up contact was that his firm and other in the air transport busi are expect sever problem this summer   that  of cours  is the peak period for travel and there are disrupt becaus of thunderstorm and so forth   but    the expect is that there will be substanti strain on infrastructur in the air transport busi in the unit state  let me make one comment on money growth  a topic that seem to have disappear from our discuss   i   ve look at the data and i believ that money growth has not declin by anywher near the extent we have seen in other recent period of monetari tighten   i will use    month growth rate to illustr my point   look back to earli       after a period of monetari tighten that start in          month m  growth was down to about   percent and mzm growth was at about    percent   by earli       m  growth was below   percent and mzm growth was about    percent   current  m  growth is in the   to   percent rang on a    month basi and mzm growth is   to   percent   i have the veri distinct sens that despit the increas in interest rate  we have just bare stay ahead of the demand pressur   there has been no real restrict of monetari polici take place except possibl around the edg of the hous industri   and  of cours  that would be consist with the number we are see on output    there is no real restraint in place as yet   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the ninth district economi remain veri strong for the most part and  if anyth  we ve seen an intensif of exist trend  employ gain have been sizabl   at the same  e  peopl report that it has becom even harder to find prospect employe across the skill spectrum   help want sign prolifer virtual wherev one goe   discretionari spend continu strong   the most recent anecdot of this has to do with activ in the second home market in the resort and retir area in the district  which are clear thrive   exist home tend to be sell    veri rapid throughout the district at rise price  and inventori of home for sale are low  we are also see some improv in the natur resourc industri  includ mine and agricultur  on the other side of the coin  i am hear of some sign that construct financ is get harder to find for both residenti and commerci construct   i take that to mean that rate have gone up for those kind of deal or that in some case peopl are get turn away   and at least one of the larg develop base in our district has indic that his compani is take a much more cautious stanc now and is cut back on activ in some of the hot market in which it has been oper around the countri  there has also been some anxieti throughout the district about what might happen at this meet   that anxieti is hard to character   it rang from peopl who are afraid we will do too much to peopl who fear we will do too littl   so  there is no tell where the right button may be as far as that audienc is concern  at the nation level  i think prospect for real econom growth continu to look good   the incom data suggest that to me  the  book forecast suggest that  and our own model forecast  which is a bit more conserv than the  book  still has veri accept real growth   on the inflat outlook  i continu to be uncertain  perhap even more uncertain than usual   i  too  have been watch the incom data and listen to talk about pressur here and there   obvious  taken at face valu  those develop all rais concern   on the other hand  we have been do some serious empir work on that issu  and that work suggest veri modest increas in inflat from here on out   i will defer further comment on that perhap until later in the meet     final  i think there is a chanc that we may be see someth signific go on in the stock market   dave   comment on the flatten of the wilshir       obvious  some of the air has gone out of the nasdaq   that mean the ipo market is a lot less recept than it was a coupl of month ago  and that seem to me a potenti signific develop if it persist   i have no convict about whether it will or won   t  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district economi grew at an except pace in the first quarter  but there are scatter sign that growth is moder in the current quarter   price and wage pressur persist  though there are still no clear sign of a broad base acceler in consum price   employ grew at a brisk pace in the first quarter despit persist loss in the manufactur sector  unemploy rate continu to reach new cyclic low   an earli may heat wave appear to have buoy retail sale in recent week follow a sluggish march and april   but it s too earli to gaug the month perform   persist tight in both the residenti and commerci real estat market has push up rent and sell price throughout the new york citi area and has spur increas construct and develop   purchas manag indic that growth in the region s manufactur sector moder in april from it vigor first quarter pace while price pressur persist   and final  bank report stronger demand for consum loan and commerci mortgag but weaker demand for home mortgag   bank also indic further tighten in credit standard and continu improv in delinqu rate   so  all of the speech that we have been give for banker to be prudent may just be have some effect     we believ that recent data make it even clearer that reduc the imbal between the unsustain growth in demand and the capac  though increas  to produc good and servic is essenti   in addit to the data  anecdot report of wage and price pressur are becom much more widespread and  therefor  those pressur will show up in the data even if with some delay   an increas pace of monetari tighten is need for pure domest reason   i don t think our task will be easi   we have all been put a great deal of emphasi on the wealth effect  it   have the advantag of be someth that we can measur and calcul   but i think someth quit differ could show up and make our task even harder as the measur aspect of the wealth effect diminish   the issu is   are we realli in a differ psycholog climat after nine full year of an econom expans and the lowest unemploy rate sinc        are we not in a period where american  whether or not they own stock direct or indirect  are so absolut convinc that this wonder economi will continu that rein in demand will be consider more difficult than we are now predict it to be   in other word  our task could be even greater than we expect  i think the reason for tighten domest are veri clear  but i am increas concern about the intern situat  especi in the emerg market countri   the situat in indonesia has worsen again   thailand is do less well   nobodi know for sure what could be involv in the suicid of the man who manag the veri larg foreign exchang reserv of china   korea   s veri rapid recoveri  a pure v shape one  has stymi much necessari structur reform   in our own hemispher  venezuela and colombia have serious polit problem that are spill over into the econom arena and peru has also slip  with a real question on the forthcom elect   the sever drift in sub saharan    africa in everi aspect  polit  econom  and social  has now carri itself into south africa  dramat by the veri sever weaken of it currenc   so  i think this rather disturb background  which at least compens for some modest improv possibl in japan and in continent europ  put even greater urgenc on the need for us to reduc the imbal in our own economi   i think it is veri import as the world situat get wors that we get our own situat as shipshap as possibl as soon as possibl   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   some member of the committe have discuss our monetari polici in term of real interest rate  that if product shock rais real interest rate  we must rais nomin interest rate a like amount to avoid flood the economi with liquid   while i cannot quarrel with this argument qualit  as a quantit matter i think this line of think can mislead us   if we follow this line  as i work it out we have alreadi rais nomin interest rate more than is necessari to contain inflat   sinc i don t believ that  let me argu against that particular way of ration tighter monetari polici  to see what the real interest rate reason suggest  one need a model of how product shock affect long run real interest rate   it is a bit complic to work that out  and sinc governor   and i are both get a littl old to solv equilibrium growth model  we farm out a request to the staff to investig the matter   the memo the staff prepar in respons show that in a close economi in long run equilibrium there is inde a relationship in theori   the most familiar case is where consum are farsight and ration and can anticip futur incom growth   in these circumst consumpt is sensit both to real interest rate and expect growth rate  and in the long run real interest    rate do in fact rise one for one with the expect growth rate   the ration assumpt in such a case are strong   the memo also work out the model with more simpl mind consum follow either a keynesian consumpt function or that function augment with a net worth term   in these case consumpt is relat inelast with respect to interest rate but the growth shock shift up invest demand and still rais interest rate  this  e slight more than one for one  though in these case the outcom depend on empir es  paramet  while these result seem clear enough  they are long run and assum a close economi   as for the long run  it   take a long  e to establish these equilibria  perhap a decad or more   there could be mani dynam movement upward or downward in the mean    in an open economi  equilibrium real interest rate have to be the same around the world   suppos the product shock is not share around the world  as by and larg it   not seem to be current   in that case  the unit state will just import capit and see it own real interest rate eventu driven back to the relat fix world level  unless the unit state is import enough to rais interest rate throughout the whole world    the result is much less chang in domest real interest rate than in the close economi case  inde  perhap no chang at all and a big import of capit  for what it is worth  actual data seem more consist with the open economi scenario with the import of capit that we have talk about often in these meet  the behavior of current account deficit without the depreci of the dollar is perfect consist with the product shock occur main in the unit state   on the rate side  sinc the begin of the product shock the tip rate has gone up by onli about    basi point  much less than we would be predict in the close economi model   some measur    of inflat correct interest rate have chang more  but i think that is becaus the nomin part of the   equat has respond more than the lag inflat part of the equat  that s irv      laughter  the point of go into all of this is a negat one   as i said abov  i don t think the real interest rate link is a good line of reason for us to use in our present deliber  whatev the case in equilibrium close economi model  the committe is confront with an earlier challeng  that of stabil inflat   if we tri to justifi our action in long run term  some theorist out there would find us out and blow the whistl  especi sinc we have alreadi rais nomin interest rate more than would be predict by these theoret condit   i think we should instead focus on the narrow short term goal of stabil inflat  let nomin and real interest rate eventu find their proper long term level  this line of think lead me back to the inflat target approach i have trumpet for the past few meet and one that you are probabl get sick of hear about   from this point of view  we want to keep the inflat rate stabl and we should just do whatev it take to achiev that   in this regard  i would note that the situat has worsen in the last month becaus inflat may actual be begin to increas  impli that our inflat fight polici will have to be more forc than would otherwis be the case  this reason is reinforc by the  book analysi   becaus of the ampli discuss new momentum in both consumpt and invest  now we have to get the fund rate into the mid   percent area fair quick to stabil inflat   even the baselin forecast where the fund rate is rise to      percent   not quit do that  mani of you have doubt this forecast becaus of skeptic about the  book analysi and forecast   there are ground for such skeptic but other indic are not    much more reassur this  e around   the pipelin measur of inflat  unit labor cost  is now begin to rise part becaus the first quarter product chang was a bit soft and part becaus wage also seem to be grow more rapid   the lack of a further product pickup in the first quarter was mild disappoint  but that might also serv as a realiti check becaus we have been reli on product to rescu us from scatter inflat warn and mayb now we should take these warn a bit more serious  unlik the case at our recent meet  other forecast also have inflat increas at least in the short term   the blue chip forecast are predict a rise in short term inflat and have rais that forecast in recent month   they also get that forecast by assum higher short term interest rate  show that they realli think monetari polici has to be tighten to avoid acceler long term inflat   the michigan consum have recent begun expect higher short term inflat  as have the philadelphia fed forecast and various napm  nfib  and nabe survey   the treasuri bond market has also switch and is now indic somewhat more futur long term inflat as measur by the increas spread between the nomin and real    year treasuri rate   all approach suggest that tighten is need and all have chang from a month ago in the direct of expect higher inflat   i think there is more pressur on us than there was a month ago  last  a strong argument for our polici of gradual has been that it was expect by financi market   now that  too  may be chang   from the fed fund futur market one can comput a two third probabl that we will abandon our gradualist polici at this meet   these result are confirm by direct survey of fed watcher   unlik the recent past  financi market seem to be expect us to move more forc against inflat     which open up a window of opportun for us to do just that   from all of this you can probabl tell where i would come out on polici today   thank you veri much
mr  chairman  the tenth district remain general healthi  employ growth is still run around   percent and we have an unemploy rate of about   percent   but i thought i would take just a minut to convey some anecdot inform on the district  which support what     said in his comment in that to some degre it show a chang in the tone within the district  first on wage and price  there has been a subtl move toward press for higher wage and some effort to rais price   we met last week with both our econom advisori council and our board of director   fair general we heard from labor  includ union  that they are begin to ask for a littl more on the wage front    to   percent   but also they are focus veri heavili on the benefit side  recogn rise health care cost and want to keep those benefit up and recogn  too  that benefit are the nontax portion of incom gain   even among the non union group  there is continu pressur for wage increas and we are hear more about that  on the price side  we are still hear the stori that firm cannot pass on their higher cost through price increas  but we are hear about more attempt to do so   in our area of oklahoma and of colorado there have been attempt to move price up  say    or   percent   of that  mayb   percent will stick  but the fact is that the   percent is stick   so  we do see that take place   nevertheless  we are also hear from the same individu that they sens some slow in their region economi   the obvious case is real estat   we are see a fair signific drop in hous demand in the lincoln  nebraska area  for exampl     and some slow  though not a declin  in kansa citi   denver remain veri strong  and we are also see some carryov of that strength reflect in manufactur  especi if it is relat to the real estat sector  in home improv  say  though there   s just a hint of that  turn to the nation economi  our project is veri similar to that of the  book except for one import differ  which is that the moder in growth in our forecast come with a less aggress interest rate move   have said that  with the inform we are get on wage pressur  i would agre with those who suggest that we will need to continu to move rate up somewhat   one thing i want to caution about  and i hint at it earlier in my question to      is that i think we want to be care not to get    sweati hand  with respect to our polici of gradual in move the fund rate up   from one point of view  we start this tighten when the fund rate was       percent and it is now at   percent   we know that a good portion of the effect of that increas has not yet play out   we know there are lag in polici   we know that the budget surplus is increas  and that has an impact that we have to keep in mind   consid that and the lag  it seem to me that the gradualist approach with quarter point increas is still appropri rather than sudden move forward to a more aggress polici   that is particular noteworthi becaus  while we may not be at the right rate yet  we start at       percent and are now at   percent  which certain make more sens today than it did a year ago   so  while i would readili agre that we need to keep the pressur on the economi  i think there is someth to be said for stay with a gradualist approach   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   on sever recent road trip through the district to host meet for banker  i had the impress that in at least one dimens    there has been a distinct slow   and that is that the spring crop of orang traffic barrel has been the best ever and is come close to the object of block at least one lane of everi major road    laughter   contractor and union leader say that there is enough money to obstruct even more traffic if onli they could find the labor    laughter   one claim i   ve heard is that there are no unemploy construct worker   in think about what is happen  i don t think i want to tell you ani more about the outlook for public sector construct through the forecast horizon becaus there s noth that monetari polici is go to do about that now or for ani  e horizon that we care about   the revenu is there  it will be spent   the stadium are under way  highway program are under way   the money is avail and it is go to be spent   so i am just go to stop talk about that  let me shift to other labor topic   some of this reflect the lag effect of earlier develop   chairman  span has cite herb stein as say that unsustain thing have a habit of end   i will tell you that there is a new definit of overbuild in the retail construct sector   a compani that build veri  veri larg store that sell a varieti of item  groceri  what we would call depart store good  hardwar  and so on  just built a major facil in the north area of columbus  a rapid growth area   the open of the store was set for may  st and they need to hire     peopl   they began advertis for help with a start wage of    an hour   the week befor the schedul may  st open they had onli     applic   they have now delay the open for at least a month and have rais their offer rate to     an hour and have their finger cross that it will attract the worker they need  employe of hospit in the area gave us some startl report   normal there is a cooper relationship between the cleveland fed and the atlanta fed on the payment    system   but that   s not the case in health care   cincinnati area hospit say that their employe are be offer bonus of        by atlanta hospit plus a year s free rent to reloc to atlanta   some cincinnati area hospit are approach employe of other hospit and offer them        just to move across the street or across town   a columbus hospit said that it has shut down three oper room in the face of a     nurs shortag  the lack of labor and the implic of that have led to our hear more stori about compani choos not to expand in our area or choos to reloc or add addit capac in mexico   it is not at all a suck sound but it is a phenomenon of the type of labor market we are see   there are some silver line aspect to it   a union leader was adam that i report to you that they now want a complet and uncondit amnesti for undocu worker   that would help the in problem in indiana and they could concentr on the southern part of jack guynn   s district    laughter   he also want us to be awar that there is a possibl of a nationwid strike against general electr involv five union in a disput over pension   anoth sort of silver line aspect of the tight in labor market is the increas emphasi on labor substitut invest   a contact from a compani that ship out merchandis through internet and     number catalog sale  main gift of it dessert product  said that a year ago their ship cost per gift was         they have had an   percent across the board wage increas and even higher benefit cost increas and have reduc their cost per gift to        so  product still is help us out  and as we head from spring into summer  employ in the servic sector say it is go to be a veri tough season for our amus park   cedar point want to hire       worker for the summer and they expect                                          of those will be foreign student   they are use hire or retent bonus as well as free or heavili subsid    hous to tri to attract them   all of the major amus park in the region are increas price   the smallest increas of     percent is at a park that increas it fee    percent last year   the highest is at cedar point  with a    percent increas in admiss price   we have been told that admiss at six flag in new england will be up    percent for this summer  and increas in park fee are said to averag    percent   we   ve had report of other price increas of note   one was a    percent increas in paper cost   these  of cours  are all relat price increas and you all know that   anoth  which was report in this morn   s wall street journal  was that chubb insur is rais premium  a major worldwid supplier for the motor vehicl and hous industri  said that it supplier are ask for relief from the price cap in their long term contract   he said that with the strength in recent order from europ  asia  and latin america  in his word it is the first  e all global market are come in strong  they expect to be abl to renegoti the price cap and to pass the higher cost on to consum  all of these anecdot report of tight labor market  increas cost pressur  and effort to rais price are the lag effect of the veri strong final demand that we have experienc  with an emphasi on the past tens of the comment   veri recent there are some tentat indic that growth in final demand is moder  perhap in respons to the polici action taken sinc last june   in recent meet with director  advisori council member  and banker we   ve heard mani more suggest that a degre of caution is start to be reflect in the behavior of both busi and consum   certain the combin of higher energi cost and higher debt servic burden is start to have an impact   i look forward to the june meet  our humphrey hawkin meet  when we will get a longer    term perspect on the outlook beyond        that   s becaus the effect of action we have alreadi taken as well as ani action we take today will realli influenc that period much more than the short term  we are now experienc a veri familiar pattern   onc we start rais the feder fund rate  market particip and fed watcher talk about how far we will have to go and they extrapol that to ever higher rate   in februari of      when we had previous increas the fed fund rate to   percent  the futur rate five month out indic a fund rate of       percent   and some comment were talk about a rate over   percent  nevertheless  we stop at   percent   we disappoint them and we were right   in decemb       after the reduct of the fund rate from       to       percent  at least one veri vocal fed watcher said that we would cut the rate to   percent   we did not and we were right   the point is that the one thing that is certain is that we will need to stop rais the fed fund rate long befor the comment and the fed fund futur market say we will   and the question of when to paus cannot be avoid   i think we are now much closer to that point  possibl with an action at this meet  than is suggest by the assumpt behind the baselin forecast  i have one littl comment on the issu of rais the real fed fund rate  which is what some of my staff occasion refer to  or otherwis rais real interest rate  let alon real exchang rate   we don t rais and lower real interest rate   the market do that  fundament forc of all type influenc real interest rate and real exchang rate   the issu is not that but where we are peg the nomin fed fund rate  the overnight interbank rate  relat to market determin rate  nomin as well as real   i now think that even talk about the concept of real interest rate is not onli not use but counterproduct   it is realli    market interest rate more general  both the real and the nomin compon  that matter  the issu is the nomin fed fund rate and whether we have it at the right level to be consist with an expans of central bank liquid that is consist with what   s go on in the economi  i was pleas to hear the vice chairman   s remark and caution to the committe about the intern situat   i think that is veri import   it probabl  sn   t get as much attent as it should  especi in the environ in which we find ourselv   it is alway difficult to make monetari polici in presidenti elect year  includ mexico   s presidenti elect year  as we have seen mani  e in the past  our object  of cours  is stabl purchas power of the dollar for our economi  but increas that mean for a lot of other

overal econom growth in the eleventh district remain quit healthi    howev  a few sign of slower growth in respons to higher interest rate are just begin to appear   at our board of director meet last thursday  we heard more of a mix pictur on the economi than we have in quit some  e   in the dalla area the demand for larg custom home has slow notic in the last month  probabl in respons to the lower and more volatil stock market   in houston the hous market is said to be do well but much less so than a few month ago   throughout texa  with the possibl except of austin  nonresidenti construct of all type  offic  commerci space     road  and other infrastructur  has continu the slide that began in januari   on the other hand  one of our director from the                            industri note that she is see the strongest growth in electron in four year   purchas of pcs by busi have begun to pick up  labor shortag are still the most common anecdot   it has even spread to academia where    raid    parti are tri to recruit away faculti member   in austin  where shortag of high tech labor have persist for a longer  e than in other part of texa  some employ have been give quarter rather than annual salari increas  as bill pool report for his district   in spite of the pressur on wage  there are few exampl of busi pass on higher input price unless the increas are relat to higher energi cost   in that regard  dure my cab ride here ye day i notic a littl sign in the cab that said a    cent surcharg was be ad becaus of higher fuel cost  with date indic the  e period dure which the surcharg would be applic   nevertheless  there are except   in texa competit pressur are keep a lid on chemic price  texa oil and gas employ is final respond to the now fair sustain higher price we have had   oil and gas employ increas in march at a rate of     percent  the rig count is rise  and well permit increas in the first quarter in texa from     to        on the subject of automobil that     was talk about earlier  let me pass on a comment of one of                                                                  who own some car dealership   he was tell me how remark it is that when one part of the countri experi a shift in purchas  the pattern is almost ident all over the countri  it   s    uncanni the way the countri move togeth on that   and he report that in earli may sale drop off quit consider in those dealership with which he is familiar  at the nation level  it is a littl harder to find consist respons to the fed s rate hike   last month s weak in retail sale could be the start of a new trend  but it is too earli to judg   hous demand probabl has begun to deterior  but a rush to buy in anticip of further increas in interest rate may have mask the under deterior   april   s down drift in the stock market could produc a notabl revers wealth effect for the remaind of the year   this morn s cpi number serv as a hope suggest that we may not be guilti of do too littl too late or be behind the curv   our gradualist approach has serv us well and i see no compel reason to depart from that strategi   an upcreep in inflat pressur call for a measur respons and continu vigil   or  as tom hoenig put it  let s not get    sweati hand
thank you  mr  chairman   in light of the  e i will shorten what i otherwis would have said  but i do want to say a coupl of thing   first  i agre with other that the incom data sinc we last met general support our ongo vigil and concern on the inflat front  but to me those data do not indic that the war is lost or that we have fallen behind the curv   i tend to agre that inflat risk have pick up and i  therefor  think that we should continu to act  and probabl with a slight greater sens of urgenc  in order to achiev balanc in our economi  as for the factor that suggest the risk of inflat are  if anyth  perhap a littl stronger  a number of peopl have talk about the role of consum behavior  and i would endors that view   we have also talk about a number of other indic of tighten in the    economi that had been veri quiet and seem to have sudden come awak   let me just put two on the tabl that have not come up thus far   capac util  which had fallen out of favor as a topic of discuss around this tabl in the last two year  appear to be reemerg as an indic of resourc tight   at about      percent that measur has reach it highest read in two year   similar  the labor forc particip rate  which had been my i quiescent  also appear to have return to a slight more normal pattern for a strong economi  edg up to       percent  which is well abov the averag that prevail for the three previous year  to a degre  therefor  i think strong demand led and invest led growth is forc some of the usual indic of resourc tight to return to a more normal pattern  these element of resourc tight i think are start to show through a bit both in cost and possibl in price pressur   employ cost did jump     percent in the first quarter  the fastest pace sinc       which support the notion that strain labor market are start to have an impact  some of the survey data  includ those from small busi  also show that compens cost are increas   i view that as import support data   more broad on the inflat front  the gdp deflat post it largest increas in three year in the first quarter   and as other have indic  short term inflat expect have move up for the public at larg   purchas manag also seem to sens a tighten tone in price  howev  i think all is not lost on the inflat front  and i believ there are some real argument for a less bleak pictur   the cpi number for march was probabl a bit of an anomali  with much of the uptick in price in the lodg compon  which was a replay of april      and was an upsid surpris then as well   similar  if one look at the retail sale    figur  there is a possibl  as presid   has indic  that perhap we are see a bit of a slow but it   s too earli to say for sure   more import in my view  the financi market do not necessarili show a major pickup in inflat expect   i would note that a few other have comment on inflat expect and  contrari to what some have said  i   m not sure that i have seen an increas there   i look at the yield spread on    year treasuri bill versus    year tip   and at least on the chart in front of me the spread seem to have pick up a littl start in octob      until about the middl of      and  with two wobbl  then settl down at around   percent   of cours  one can read a wobbl up or down and either weigh it heavili or not weigh it veri strong at all   but contrari to the staff   s forecast  the market are not suggest a strong increas in inflat expect in my view   needless to say      has put on the tabl the question of whether the market has it right or the forecast have it right   and sinc i am neither a market particip nor a forecast  i will let  e tell on that one  the second point i would note on this front  which again is not statist proven  is that one could reason expect that the recent stock market volatil would in fact damp consum expenditur somewhat   the third point i would note is that we know corpor bond rate have increas notic sinc the start of the year  just as the issuanc of corpor debt has also been cut back   so  both develop in the corpor bond market have the effect  i think  of amplifi our tighten move and forc borrow back to bank  where condit on both loan rate and term or avail do seem to be tighten  so  i believ there are reason to think that some of our action have been notic by the market and will be reinforc by the market     final  i   d underscor a point that first vice presid stone and a coupl of other made  which is that long term inflat expect have not move appreci  given this configur  i believ that perhap we should move a bit more aggress than in the past  but not signal that we are concern that the inflat geni is out of the bottl  while the risk may be somewhat heighten  i do not believ that we are clear behind the curv   i think the market is help us in some way   and i would join with a number of the reserv bank presid and first vice presid stone in suggest  as presid hoenig said  that we not have    sweati palm  here   on the other hand  i think some action today clear will help us to reinforc a market percept   if we can do that without overshoot  i think we can prove that      while he will be miss  has left the institut capabl of make some good judgment    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   the bluebook get to the heart of what has chang and what has not chang sinc our last meet   i quot         incom data suggest both that aggreg demand had continu to grow more rapid than potenti suppli and that wage and price develop were becom more worrisom    so what has not chang is the momentum in demand and product and the imbal between the growth in product and in potenti suppli   but the quot   not make entir clear whether the staff was refer to an imbal in the growth rate between demand and potenti suppli or in the level of actual and potenti output   it occur to me that the ambigu might have been intent to allow each of us to interpret the observ in a way that we could accept   but i believ anoth critic and persist element is a larg imbal between the level of actual and potenti output   this view is veri consist with    the  book and mani other forecast and it   suggest that we have a signific challeng ahead of us   i don t know if we have    sweati palm  or even if i have    sweati palm   but i think the challeng is quit consider   and it is along the line that i think     laid out veri well in his present   by the way  i thought that was a particular insight present  although i should note that i alway tend to find present insight when they tend to confirm my own bias    laughter
i will take half a loaf
but this is a good point for me to say how much i have valu your present to the committe dure my tenur here   and you realli end on a high note today  so  what has chang   well  first of all util rate have increas slight further   there should not be ani surpris about that   as long as demand is grow fa  than potenti suppli  of cours util rate will increas   now  i recogn that monetari polici act with a lag  but my view is that the restraint we have put in place sinc last summer is not suffici   the virtual absenc of sign of slow suggest that if we don t take further step to slow demand growth  util rate will most like increas still further  a second chang is that inflat has becom both more of a realiti and more of a threat   it is more of a threat becaus of still high util rate and continu abov trend growth   but it is more than a threat   we are see  i believ  the begin of a pickup in inflat rate for both compens and core consum price  certain one can find some mix signal  but i view the data on balanc as quit compel   there is a conflict among some of the data on wage and compens  but on the basi of both the eci and the higher frequenc data for averag hour earn i think it    is clear that we are at an inflect point here   to me this assess is veri consist with the report summar in the beigebook and with the anecdot report that i am hear as the various state bank group visit the board  as for inflat  presid parri mention that the core pce was move up   it    month rate is now     percent  which is the highest rate of increas sinc octob       and it has move up     percentag point sinc just the end of last year   in term of the core cpi  of cours  it    month rate is the same as it was a year ago   but if i look at the pattern  i see that begin in septemb the month increas were rather consist higher   i note that of the next four month to be drop out of the    month core cpi  three of them were     percent and one was     percent   so  i think the    month rate is move up from be around   percent to be around       percent  consist with what we are see in the core pce   again  whi should we be surpris   given the prevail util rate and the dissip or revers of favor suppli shock  some deterior in inflat is what most forecast have been expect  i think the third chang is in the natur of the forecast error   for a veri long  e we have been say fa  than expect growth and lower than expect inflat   no more   so far this year there is relat littl surpris about the strength of growth  which remain robust   and some key inflat data are now come in either wors than expect or at least confirm expect of an increas in inflat pressur  particular  as i said  the core pce and cpi measur  the eci  and averag hour earn   this reflect  in my view  the fact that the domin of favor suppli shock is reced   and as a consequ  the implic of the suppli demand imbal are come into clearer focus     at the end of last year there was a bold headlin in the wall street journal      so long suppli and demand      i have been wait for a new headlin     welcom back suppli and demand      and then today in the wall street journal on the front page there is an articl about firm start to rais price   it begin     even in the new economi at least one old rule still appli   if demand exceed suppli for long enough  seller will rais price    our job is clear   we must restor the balanc between suppli and demand   until we do so  the threat and realiti of higher inflat are like to remain with us
thank you  mr  chairman   onc again it seem that the basic condit face the committe are littl chang from those prevail at the  e of the most recent sever meet  except that perhap mani now familiar concern have been escal further   the economi has turn in anoth remark quarter  and recent hard evid has begun to replac earlier percept that compens increas are acceler and some measur of inflat may now be on the move   there is littl point in further recit the factor at work here   it appear clear from this discuss that most  if not all  of those around the tabl see the risk as continu to be heavili on the up side  with further polici move in order   as the bluebook discuss  the oper question is   by how much  there are a number of reason to feel it is unlik that inflat is sudden about to surg   among other factor the dollar remain remark strong   oil price appear to have peak and commod price general have flatten out   product increas continu to hold unit cost increas at bay   and the impact of polici eas in the fall of      should be dissip while the tighten over the past year should increas be kick in   i believ we are still on or perhap still ahead of the curv  although some inflat creep    seem inevit   howev  ani sign of econom slow are scatter at best and quit inadequ in my view to provid confid that the need eas of activ is like to occur without signific addit polici move   it is help that both the real economi and financi market today seem to be present us an unusu window   the more aggress polici path is both expect and by mani consid accept and is thus like to present less risk than the more conserv altern in the near as well as the longer term   i believ we should grasp this opportun   thank you
it is a littl late but let s go for coffe if it s there   it is probabl ice coffe at this point   coffe break
as indic in the bluebook  the issu today would appear to be not whether to continu to tighten monetari polici at this meet but rather by how much   at the march meet  the committe contempl futur firm  and it public statement convey it sens that the balanc of risk was point toward higher inflat   incom data sinc that  e have on balanc strengthen the impress of inflat risk   the most obvious contend for polici action today are increas of either    or    basi point   as   indic  core inflat pick up further next year in the staff forecast   that forecast essenti is consist with continu gradual increas in the fund rate target this year   for exampl  increas of    basi point at this and each of the next four fomc meet  follow by a constant       percent fund rate through next year  would comport reason well with the polici assumpt in the  book  by our read of term premium  the       percent fund rate next year would also be somewhat higher than the expect peak for that rate that appear to be current built into financi asset price   the project result of these financi condit would be a core pce inflat over next year of     percent  after an expect     percent over this year  becaus labor market would still be experienc an unsustain degre of pressur late next year  the process of under price acceler would persist beyond that  e      the case for the    basi point move at today   s meet could rest on the judgment that extend the previous seri of quarter point move today  and perhap continu that pace at later meet  would have a reason chanc of keep core inflat contain  in contrast to the staff view   a support of anoth gradual move might believ that the staff has overes  the ongo strength of aggreg demand   in this view  as a result of the recent greater stringenc in credit market and weaker behavior of the stock market  econom growth may alreadi be pois to slow appreci  perhap by enough to match the expans of potenti suppli   support for a    basi point move also might deriv from the view that the growth of potenti suppli itself probabl will continu to pick up next year  as structur product acceler further   anoth step up in trend product growth could temporarili hold down unit labor cost even if wage gain are trend higher in respons to taut labor market  other thing equal  real privat interest rate eventu would have to reach still higher level at some point  but the need to get there is not urgent  given this near term depress to inflat   and  of cours  continu even a gradual pace of tighten for an extend period would eventu produc larg increas in nomin short term interest rate  and in real short term interest rate as well unless inflat expect rise appreci   the committe could also want ad evid on the level of resourc use that will provok price acceler   the staff may have overes  the extent to which the economi in the longer run is inflat prone   especi if the long run nairu is substanti lower than the staff has es   continu gradual may not be like to allow a continu  under acceler of price   from a long term perspect  the surpris favor inflat and output perform of the u s  economi over the second half of the     s understand has fo  a greater sens of uncertainti about econom relationship   this observ might well be interpret as provid support for stay with the gradual polici approach use by the committe to date   also  this year   s general stronger than expect data on real gdp  employ  and inflat could be perceiv as more nois than signal  but this result rest on a number of demand and suppli forc evolv favor over come month   a less op ist view of the probabl balanc of suppli and demand  for exampl  as seen in the staff forecast  would support adopt the    basi point option today   the committe may be particular concern about the potenti for acceler price under    continu gradual   a    basi point move could be motiv by the view that the more restrict financi condit associ with adopt the aggress polici approach  at least at this meet  would offer a better chanc of contain inflat  while still not serious risk an excess degre of firm   the more aggress strategi would lessen the potenti for polici be    too littl  too late    and for allow a signific increas in inflat that would be hard to revers  in this view  the perceiv expect in a statist sens of the cost of an inflationari outcom  that is  the probabl of it occur  e the welfar cost if it    would be high enough to outweigh the smaller perceiv expect of the cost of a tighter than need polici induc unwant econom weak   the argument for a    basi point move today might seem even more compel to the extent that the committe was persuad by the discuss in the    altern simul    section of part i of the  book  base on the frb us model  which   also allud to  that section suggest that next year   s acceler of core price can onli be short circuit by a substanti steepen of the trajectori of polici tighten   for exampl  if the fomc were to rais the fund rate in four step of    basi point each this year  and were to keep the result   percent level constant through next year  then in the simul core pce inflat would be held to a littl abov   percent in both year   this extent of polici tighten would succeed in cap core inflat in part through it effect on the dollar and on longer term inflat expect  in addit  the slowdown of real gdp growth to onli       percent next year would rais unemploy to a       percent rate by the fourth quarter   labor market would be on a path to reach sustain condit later on   the committe   s choic of the balanc of risk statement with a    basi point move would be somewhat less clear cut than with a    basi point move   in the latter case  a continu tilt toward inflat would seem to be the obvious choic   but as i just indic  even with a    basi point rate hike  the staff believ that further substanti fund rate increas would be need to prevent inflationari pressur from emerg   thus  even with a half point action today  in our view inflat risk would still domin   the committe may agre with this judgment  although you no doubt depart in various way from the point es  of the  book   s project   if the committe instead believ that the sizabl    basi point move has an excel chanc of balanc the risk  it should indic that   the new languag   not refer the futur cours of polici  so if the committe still suspect that the risk are unbalanc but want to paus for a while to weigh the effect of acceler tighten  it would need to indic this intent in a separ sentenc in the announc      the current fund market futur quot for may of      percent impli that the odd that market particip put on a     percentag point move today have move somewhat below ye day   s odd of about two third   anecdot report suggest that they also expect the fomc statement to maintain a sens of unbalanc risk toward inflat   thus  the rate move part of this combin might be enough of a surpris to rais interest rate a littl across the matur spectrum   combin a     point hike with a balanc statement about the risk would repres two surpris in offset direct   and the difficulti of predict the reaction of puzzl market particip make the direct of the immedi interest rate adjust uncertain  although the chang in market rate would probabl be mute   thank you   that conclud my prepar remark
what actual happen  in basi point  to the feder fund futur rate for june as a consequ of the cpi releas
i have the may figur  i do not have the june figur     someon have that
what is the may figur
the may figur as of about    o clock this morn was       for the futur rate
i just want the chang
let me give you ye day s   we had      for may  although that was round
and what do you have now
we have       now   a signific chang that also affect the calcul of odd is not just this futur rate but  believ it or not  today s spot rate   that rate is         or        percent   so those are the two relev new piec of inform that we got today that affect these odd
further question   presid jordan
you start with a refer to the risk at our last meet as we state them but also to the forecast and discuss of the risk around the tabl   but then you end with the focus on the interpret of our statement of the balanc of risk  isn t it the case  as long as there are lag  and mayb long and variabl lag  that there will be a  e when we will stop rais the fund rate when the risk of report inflat are still rise   we cannot wait until we have seen the first break toward a downward trend in inflat or we are go to caus a recess for sure   so there has to be a  e when  in spite of what the futur market project say and in spite of what the forecast and project say  we stop   suppos we rais the fund rate by     basi point today to       percent  wouldn   t the risk still be that inflat in the month ahead would be higher
i   m not sure that the sentenc on the balanc of risk refer to the month ahead or even the next few month
that is whi i am rais the question
exact   in the case you cite  that realli is an issu the committe would have to confront   that is  the committe may expect inflat rate for the next three month to continu on the high side at least  though mayb not rise  and then ebb down   the question the committe would then face is what to indic with respect to the balanc of risk   if i were a member of the committe  i guess i would tend to say that the risk would be balanc   so  even if i thought we might have some disappoint read for a few month  i would be tempt to look even further ahead into the forese futur  which is longer than three month  and make a statement that the risk were general balanc   but i admit it would be a temptat not to say that
let me follow up   suppos my own model had realli long lag  i use to think the lag was about two year  and i think that the stanc of polici today affect the inflat rate in        and my guess is that inflat is go to rise for the next year and a half no matter what we do  just due to good old fashion momentum    then how do i use this balanc of risk statement as a communic devic for peopl out there look at it  how do i handl that communic problem
i may actual wish to turn to other member of the committe to answer that    laughter
let me step into the staff role here   what we ve work hard on in develop this languag is to tri to get in this concept of the    forese futur     which is clear meant to be longer than the intermeet period and longer even than after the next meet   as the work group and the committe talk about this  frank  i think most peopl thought the forese futur encompass someth like the lag that you are discuss   obvious  it would be a judgment call   but if we thought that we had put in enough tighten today that we would slow inflat over a period of let   s say    month or so  it would not be unreason to say in this statement that we think the risk are balanc for the forese futur   it is clear longer than three month   i think most peopl view it as longer than three month and probabl somewher on the order of a year to eighteen month   needless to say  we didn   t tri to tie ourselv down explicit
may i ask from that whether it is intend to be interpret that we could at some point say with this action we now see the risk as balanc
that is intend to be a possibl  yes   it is also quit possibl  though  that we might say we have taken this tighten action but we still do not see    the risk as balanc just yet   howev  the reason we have not tighten further  obvious  is that we are wait for incom data and a varieti of other thing so that we can make a more inform judgment   in fact  sinc we   ve use this formul  we have had the option of both rais rate but also say that the risk were a littl unbalanc   and it is also true  as you made quit clear  that the market  i think appropri  interpret statement that the risk are not balanc or more toward inflat as at least a possibl  though not a certainti  that we will continu to rais rate   so we should not pretend that we have broken that link becaus it is still there  but it is not as strong as it had been befor
if i could just interject to answer the chairman s earlier question  the june feder fund futur rate fell a basi point today   it is now at
further question for     if not  let me focus on the previous convers becaus it realli cover the issu that i think confront us   my own judgment  and what i plan to recommend to the committe  is that we have an opportun now to move the fund rate up    basi point  remain asymmetr  and effect adjust our longer term postur to a better posit than the one we are in at the moment  the reason i am not concern about move the rate up quick at this stage is that i think the evid indic that product  inde perhap under gdp  is still acceler   i recogn that the staff   s es  of product growth for the first quarter  base on the latest publish figur and adjust for the defens spend anomali  is      percent   i don   t believ that es  for a fraction of a second   i don t think it has even a remot possibl of be accur becaus of the evid we are get on profit margin  which clear are still open up at this point   inde  use the avail data on incom and profit  which essenti reflect the unit cost structur of nonfinanci corpor  the    product growth number that fall out of that system accord to staff es  is a   percent annual rate  that number is consist with our unit cost analys and our es  for price  profit  and wage  grant that the es  for wage may be a littl to the weak side  i would submit that what is creat a       percent es  for product growth is the combin of a peculiar statist discrep and some veri dubious data in area of the economi other than nonfinanci corpor  the latter provid our most reliabl under data  the general view of a persist acceler in product is be pick up in a lot of the compani report where shortag of import input report are begin to aris  these are particular acut in the high tech area   intel is in difficulti   cisco is in difficulti   the problem of semiconductor shortag as a consequ of the earthquak in taiwan has left some veri deep pressur in it wake   one reason is that the effect of network extern in the high tech area of our economi are clear begin to show up in an exagger manner   that is  as we are all awar and as i have mention previous  when we go from two at a  e connect to larg network connect  the benefit do not just go up arithmet  they go up exponenti  the network extern effect of our high tech system is creat a major under acceler in the economi  all the problem we have discuss previous  main the pressur on the safeti valv of net import and the labor market  are put substanti pressur on the total system  what is remark at this stage is not that inflationari forc are pick up   it is that there is so littl evid of a pickup   i think  for exampl  that the acceler in wage is unambigu   the one statist nobodi has mention today is the fact that averag hour earn  adjust for the industri mix that bls publish  is up      percent in april  that    increas is far greater than even the eci is suggest   the averag hour earn number has not been a particular good es  of the eci  but it is an indic that the bias is clear on the up side   nonetheless  when we look through the configur of unit cost  the es  we end up with is that unit cost have fallen over the last six month for nonfinanci corpor  inde for nonfarm busi general   if this is inde the case  all of the price acceler we have seen reflect widen profit margin   this is not an indic of the begin of a major acceler in price   inde  the core pce deflat for april rose less than     percent   and over the   month period from januari through april  when most of the inflat is show up in the cpi  the averag rate is      percent month or an annual rate of approxim   percent   while that rate is higher than it was earlier  there is no evid at this stage that we are experienc a real under deterior in inflat of the kind that we typic have seen in the past  i think we are in a quit differ environ than we have seen in the past   in such an environ real long term interest rate have to rise  and inde they have risen veri signific in the last sever week   real long term bbb rate are up over    basi point after gradual edg higher for quit some period of  e   this indic that the market are adjust rapid to the evid that overal demand forc are becom veri strong  driven in larg part by the suppli factor themselv  i mention  i think late last year  that i was concern about our tendenc to get caught up in statist acrophobia and feel the need to make our forecast converg to the mean becaus that is basic what happen in our model   i think we all have a tendenc to do that   i myself think that we will see some slow in the macroeconom data that we usual look at  in part becaus our season adjust are inadequ   that is  it is veri    difficult to season adjust for the type of global warm and relat rise in degre day that we experienc dure the winter month without some impact on the gdp figur   so  it is perfect conceiv that the gdp growth number for the fourth and first quarter were just an exagger   they will slow down in the second quarter  even though no slowdown or in fact major chang may have occur   i think what we have is still the begin  or perhap we are well into it at this stage  of a signific long term chang in the behavior of the economi   this is not to say that we don t have a cyclic element involv in these growth number nor   it mean that higher interest rate  especi real long term rate  are have no effect   inde  the evid is now begin to show that the alleg absenc of ani effect from what we have done to date  or more import what the market have done to date  is a fals notion  as governor   point out  we have seen a veri dramat shift in the borrow of the busi sector   net issuanc at the long end has come down  and the total of busi loan plus commerci paper has sudden surg   what that mean is that a veri larg number of busi firm are move out of the long end of the borrow market to the short end  the reason is not that they are go to get signific lower interest rate  becaus they are not  but that they expect the surg in interest rate to be temporari and they will be abl to refin their recent borrow at lower long term rate in the futur   this is the classic way in which offic of corpor and financi firm behav   as soon as they perceiv that interest rate are not come down  they will begin to adjust their capit expenditur project   this process has the effect of produc a gradual slow  we are see some evid that hous start are slow  but the evid is realli margin   we are get the same type of respons that     got from the    motor vehicl manufactur  which suggest that these two sector of the economi are not do all that outstand well in may   activ is still high in both  but it has come off it recent peak to a consider degre   the problem that we have with interest sensit area of the economi is that if overal econom activ is acceler  then what interest rate do is to alter the relat share of expenditur   and  inde  if motor vehicl and hous are flatten out while the economi is rise rapid  interest rate are do what one would expect them to do   respons are under way  and as far as i can see our polici move have track the long end of the market veri well   if we move    basi point today  we will continu to track it veri well  and i think that is what we want to tri to do  name tri to maintain a polici that is consist with the way market forc in the long end of the market are go   i cannot say that i would person envisag that the inflat pressur are about to eas quick   but jerri jordan is not wrong   i rememb      except well   at one point we decid to sit still while the market were drive forward   we chose not to continu to move and i think correct   now  that  sn t mean we will alway be correct   it may be that we were lucki  and if it was luck  the next  e we may lose  i believ the risk in move    basi point today are not veri larg becaus i think the under momentum in the economi remain veri strong   what is go to happen in the futur is probabl go to be depend on a number of develop that we can t realli forecast   one is crude oil price   those price were declin when   and his colleagu start to put the  book togeth   one of the reason was a surpris slowdown in domest demand for oil   it essenti show up in the form of a signific slippag in the demand for residu fuel oil in the first quarter stem from a major shift throughout the world toward natur gas   i think the slippag amount to         to         barrel a day     in germani there also was a major shift into lighter distil   overal domest demand in the first quarter actual was up onli margin over a year earlier   demand was stronger in april  and that may be the reason whi crude pressur are current rise   but as far as the unit state is concern  the prospect of rise inflat pressur stem from oil may be over  and i say  may  becaus one cannot rule out a big spike   the reason relat to the veri larg retail market margin in gasolin   these occur as a consequ of the sharp increas in crude oil price earlier  which follow a dramat declin in crude inventori  the jump in crude oil price push up retail gasolin price at one point  as i recal  some    to    cent a gallon abov where a histor averag margin would have suggest they should be   those margin have eas back down  but they are still  i believ  someth like   to    cent a gallon abov averag gasolin market margin in the unit state   so even if we have some pickup in crude price  the margin may still fall back to earlier norm  and it strike me that the upsid pressur on gasolin price may no longer be there   the same is true for home heat oil   obvious  if there is a big spike in crude  all bet are off  and that could creat some fair signific problem for the econom forecast  the crucial issu here is what will happen to domest demand and whether the financi market will readjust themselv to higher interest rate and ul  exert a retard influenc on consumpt expenditur  hous  and the stock market   if those forc are essenti in place  as i believ they are  we could end up with an economi that come in at a level below the  book forecast  i think it is too soon to make that judgment   it is conceiv that we will be more inclin to reach that conclus in june  but i think it would be a mistak to do so now    i believ our best bet at this stage is to follow the long end of the market as we have been    do  and that impli    basi point as far as i can see   becaus there is as yet no compel evid that inflationari pressur are eas  i believ it would be a mistak not to stay asymmetr and our press releas should reflect such a decis   that is all i have to say   would anybodi like to comment   vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your conclus  let me address myself to the concern about  sweati palm    we have to rememb that the mission that we have been given by the american peopl is to provid a monetari polici appropri for sustain econom growth through price stabil   the demand in the economi is simpli not sustain   it has worsen signific sinc our last meet and  therefor  it seem to me absolut essenti that we pick up the pace of tighten   that in no way lead me to believ that we are go to end up at           or       percent on the fund rate   i don t have ani idea where we are go to end our tighten   and i think we have to be veri cautious and make these judgment veri care so that we don t overdo the tighten   that   s especi the case given my concern  which i express earlier  that we have such a state of euphoria among the general public in the unit state that it could be subject to a rather rapid and quick chang   in that circumst the likelihood of overdo it on the tighten side is someth we have to keep veri much in mind  but for today if we did not do    basi point with the balanc of risk languag indic a greater concern for inflat  i think we would just feed the euphoria that i believ at the present  e is rather danger   that would be veri inappropri to do   so  i think we are not in the  sweati hand  period but in the  cool head  period  and i believ this is the right action to take
mr  chairman  everyth you said convinc me that a     point seem right   inflat is not take off and in fact a lot of the evid suggest some eas off in the expans   moreov  i don t think we should be valid the market necessarili   i think we should be look at what is in front of us  and     point with asymmetr languag seem most appropri   a year ago when we were at       percent on the fund rate  there was a better case for move more aggress in the sens that we had put in a lot of s ulus   and yet we were veri cautious in move up   it seem to me that we have been on a pretti good track in our polici action and if i had my prefer  i would stay on that track   i ll put that view on the tabl for consider
i strong support your recommend  mr  chairman   i think all of the right argument have alreadi been made   thank you
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i d also like to speak to the issu that tom hoenig rais   i think we want to be care not to confus gradual and predict   while the goal of predict is extrem import  we can t alway make polici predict   some  we are go to have to surpris the market  but i think it is extrem help when we are abl to have the market veri much on the same wavelength as we are   an increas of    basi point  after all  has been in the market for quit some  e   the extra    basi point  if we in fact opt for    basi point today  has onli been in the market sinc the eci releas   so  all the most recent report reflect a polici assumpt in the marketplac that includ the    basi point that we are put in place    today  and then we are say we should put in some more becaus the market believ that addit restraint is necessari  news from this meet will consist of three piec   one piec is the fund rate  and we are match what the market expect  so it s not realli news   the second is the balanc of risk languag and  given what is in the fed fund futur market  i think we will be match what the market anticip   the main news out of this meet will be the statement that accompani our polici announc   to my tast  it is go to be import that our messag somehow say that  given what we know today  we believ that rate are go to have to continu to rise   i don t know how far that process is go to have to go  whether it s more or less than what the  book forecast   and as jerri jordan right emphas  it will be veri import that we not go too far   but in term of what we know now  i don t think we want to give the impress that we see the end of this process   some peopl may read the    basi point  despit what is in the feder fund futur market  as say that we believ we are about at the end of our tighten   in my view  that would be a mistak sinc i don t think that s what the evid suggest today  i would also like to comment briefli on the vulner of the stock market   i think we all know that the stock market is still veri elev by histor standard and that the volatil in the market is realli unpreced   the nasdaq has been more volatil this year than in the entir histori of the index   the market is shaki   it is not go to help us if the market crack   that would caus us a lot of troubl   i don t mean just polit troubl  i mean troubl in carri forward a monetari polici that   what we need it to do   so  i think have a polici that is well in line with what the market expect  while it certain provid no guarante  run much less of a risk than if we surpris the market in a major way
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both halv of your recommend   let me take just one minut to explain whi   i think we are in the busi here of tri to find a mini max solut  if you will  to minim the maximum regret we will have in term of the effect of our action on societi and the economi   one way to do that is to support the market when the market is send us clear signal   as i said in my earlier remark  long term inflat expect have not gone up   i think the reason is that the market is expect us to react today in a way that is consist with the way they are look at the long term   and we have in fact work veri hard dure this intermeet period to make sure we are not look in a mirror  that we are look at the right data and that the market is as well   this might not alway be the case but at this stage the market is send us a veri clear signal that the appropri move is    basi point with a statement of continu concern about inflat risk   to me the wisest cours is to follow that signal   i think  as you point out clear  that real long term interest rate have to go up   in my view we would be in danger territori if we did not in fact support that  becaus otherwis we would be anchor rate in a way that is inconsist with where we realli want to go  i strong support what presid jordan and presid pool said becaus i  too  am not sure how far this tighten process is go to go   but  fortun  we are in a posit where we onli have to make decis one meet at a  e   and for today s meet i think    basi point and a balanc of risk statement tilt toward inflat is the right polici
i support both part of your recommend as well  mr  chairman   i think we have to get rate higher and that aggreg demand and aggreg suppli are just not balanc   there is still tremend momentum on the up side and i think the balanc of risk is still on that side   i do believ that at some point  perhap not far from now  that jerri jordan will be right and the risk will begin to tip toward our overshoot  but if we have to respond to that  we can   for right now  i don t see it   i still think we have to go    basi point  with asymmetr languag
mr  chairman  it seem clear to me that we need to tighten polici further at this meet  and i enthusiast support your recommend for a    basi point increas   i also believ that the balanc of risk remain weight toward higher inflat  and incorpor that view in the press releas is for me an import part of the recommend as well
thank you  mr  chairman   i strong support your recommend for a    basi point increas and for a balanc of risk sentenc tilt toward higher inflat   i recogn that there is some uncertainti about how far we will need to go and i person think we are go to have to do more
mr  chairman  i support your recommend and i do so enthusiast   i would simpli add the point that if in fact inflat expect are now rise  this move of    basi point is realli not that much more aggress than the move we have been take up to this point  while some differ of opinion have been express    around the tabl about whether inflat expect are inde rise  i think there is some evid that that is the case   so  i support both part of your recommend
i fulli support the    basi point move at this meet   my prefer would be to say that with such a move the risk are balanc   but i recogn the risk that such a statement would be misinterpret  and that would be undesir in my view  but to my mind say that the balanc of risk is still tilt toward inflat also can be misinterpret if the market s impress is that the decis at the june meet is a foregon conclus   i think that would be a mistak and it would be miscommun   i m troubl by the concern over surpris the market becaus we do have to disappoint the market at  e by not do what it expect   we know that  we ve done it mani  e befor   i prefer to think of this as a situat where some  we will have to take an action and communic in a way to educ the market and get them to adjust to us rather than have us adjust to the market   so  at least among us  if we are go to say that the balanc of risk is tilt toward inflat and that the fund rate will be move still higher  i wouldn t want to think about that in term of the old tilt languag   that is  i don   t want the presumpt to be that we are go to come back predispos to anoth increas in june   i think it would be desir to take a stronger action at some  e and then be will to give it more  e to have the desir effect
first vice presid stone
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   i think a larger action by the committe today will forestal ani rise in longer term    expect of inflat   and in my view  not move the fund rate up    basi point probabl would lead to long term expect of some increas in inflat
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i do have to admit that i got to this decis by a rather differ rout than you did  but it is nevertheless good to end up with the same conclus   i am concern that our challeng is much more demand than slow the expans to trend   the further increas in util rate and sign of build inflat pressur suggest that we are ul  go to have to slow econom growth to below trend for a while   and until this process is much further along  there s a threat of continu upward pressur on inflat   i think the gradual approach we ve been take so far has been motiv by the possibl that our task might be a more limit one  just slow the economi to trend  and also by the fact that until recent there hasn t been ani sign of rise inflat   moreov  we   ve had concern or uncertainti about sustain util rate   but i think it has alway been clear that there were risk in the gradual approach   and the risk were that dure the  e we were tri to slow the expans  the imbal between actual and potenti output would becom still wors and the threat of inflat would becom more of a realiti  it seem to me that with a more aggress polici action of    basi point today the risk of a polici mistak is much smaller than with a more gradual polici respons   what we re do in some sens today is move forward a rate increas that in ani event we like would have implement in the near term   so  we don t have to have ani larger cumul increas in interest rate than we otherwis would have had  but we put ourselv in a posit to implement a larger cumul rise if it turn out to be justifi   thank you
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  for all of the reason that have been state around the tabl
i  too  support your recommend   i think we may be see some incipi sign of slow in the economi but i don t think it s enough   our own forecast and the  book forecast say that the slow will not be enough   also  i see the    basi point move  while differ from the move we have been make  as consist with them   we have reach a point in  e when that is an appropri action becaus of develop in the market   i disagre a littl with presid pool on the volatil and the downward trend that we ve seen in the market   the fact is that other thing have demonstr not fallen out of bed at the same  e  mayb they will down the road  but i don t get a sens that the volatil and market downturn are have a major impact in a real sens on the economi   so  i think we have some opportun to act without fear of unsettl the market  wherea earlier i was in favor of a gradual approach to tighten becaus of concern about the market and market volatil   now that we ve seen a bit of that and bad thing haven t happen  we have a window of opportun dure which we can move the fund rate up and send a consist messag that the risk are still on the up side  i think we should limit our statement to the usual languag as much as we possibl can  say that the risk are tilt toward inflat in the forese futur  and not give anybodi room to play with the interpret of what we meant by this word or that word   i   d continu with a consist approach toward tighten monetari condit and be alway watch for sign of incipi slow
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i m fulli comfort with your recommend in all it aspect and i share the think that real interest rate should be go up from here   let me just add one other thought  which is that i assum we will be open mind about where we are go to go next and at what pace   one reason i think we want to maintain that stanc is the point i allud to earlier  name my own uncertainti about the inflat outlook   i m not persuad  especi with this action  that we re go to confront a signific acceler of inflat   i say that in part becaus we in minneapoli have been look for the effect of labor market tight and it correl to futur inflat  not onli in the last sever year but we ve taken this back empir for quit some  e  and we can t find evid sinc about      that labor market variabl make a signific contribut to forecast inflat   i m not entir sure what we ought to conclud from that  but one thing we certain ought to conclud is that we should be cautious as we think about what has happen in the economi and it implic for the futur
while i would have prefer     point  i can also agre to      look forward  i would just remind us that this afternoon the prime will go to       percent  and that s get close to that psycholog import doubl digit level
well  we can revis our method of es  and report it to a month basi   the major appear to be in favor of    basi point with the balanc of risk sentenc toward inflationari pressur   would you read the direct that would captur that
i ll be read from the bluebook page that unfortun did not make it way into the bluebook    laughter    the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around       percent  the  balanc of risk  sentenc would be as follow    against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat heighten inflat pressur in the forese futur
