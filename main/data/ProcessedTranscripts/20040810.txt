good morn  everyon   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut of june    and
without object   will somebodi move the elect of scott alvarez to serv as general counsel until the elect of a successor at the first meet of the committe after decemb
is there a second  speaker      second
without object  so order   dino kos  you   re on
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that   low circul a short  e ago   dure the intermeet period  market particip scale back their forecast for u s  econom growth   in part becaus of rise oil price   and the effect were reflect in expect of a more gentl rise trajectori for short term rate  in lower bond yield  and in lower stock price   the top panel graph the three month deposit rate in black and the three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward in the dash red line   the three month cash deposit rate  the black line  had been rise and continu to rise in the intermeet period  as expect solidifi that the committe would tighten polici at this meet   but forward rate  the dash red line  trade in a rang and then declin sharpli on friday  as the employ report led market particip to reassess their expect for the pace of futur tighten beyond today   s meet  the six  and nine month forward rate have both declin about    basi point sinc late juli   the yield on two  and ten year treasuri  shown in the middl panel  both fell in recent week and especi on friday   the two year yield is about    basi point lower than when the committe last met  the ten year yield is about    basi point lower than it was in earli june  and with yield at this level  the market is again discuss the possibl of a mortgag induc wave of buy that would send yield still lower   but i   ll come back to that point short   with the outperform    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix       of the ten year note  the yield curv has continu to flatten  as shown in the bottom panel   sever week ago bond trader were worri that the sharp rise in bond yield might set off a wave of sell by mbs investor face extens risk   with the move down in yield those worri have revers   the top left panel on page   graph the durat of the thirti year mbs index  which has narrow sharpli sinc earli june and now stand at just abov     year   on friday alon that index contract by about six month   the level of mbs relat buy in recent day is hard to track  but anecdot it has not been a promin featur of recent trade   a further move in the mbs yield toward   percent could trigger hedg relat buy by account posit for a new wave of refinanc   as shown in the top right panel  the spread between mbs and treasuri has narrow from    basi point in earli june to about    basi point   part of that outperform by mbs is probabl due to a reach for yield in an environ where the market believ it had comfort about the pace of tighten go forward   an altern way of look at mbs spread is to measur the level of the impli volatil of the embed option   with volatil general low across a rang of secur and instrument  the valu of the short option embed in mbs is worth less  and the mbs itself becom worth more  that vol in mbs are low is a bit puzzl given the shorten of durat  which increas the likelihood that the option will move into the money   a side effect of this narrow of spread is that at least one hous gse has alreadi signal that it will scale back mbs purchas  given the reduc valu it perceiv in current spread   other credit market perform well   spread on invest grade corpor debt were littl chang and appear nonpluss by the june tighten  as shown in the middl left panel   swap spread were also littl chang   the high yield market   shown in the middl right panel   perform well in the aftermath of the tighten but widen more recent as the equiti market sold off   interest  spread on emerg market bond   where there had been perhap the most anxieti about the tighten cycl   also narrow slight   iron  the equiti market hit their recent peak just about the  e of the committe   s last meet and have struggl sinc  as shown in the bottom panel   the list of report ailment for equiti is lengthi   oil price approach      weaker macro data  terror alert  and earn outlook for the next few quarter that are far less favor than the general strong q  result   accord to sever equiti strategist  oper earn growth probabl peak in q  and is expect to deceler in come quarter   given higher oil price and higher short term interest rate  the recent sluggish in equiti price becom perhap a bit more understand   the pictur of moder econom outlook and rang bound market is visibl oversea as well   the top panel on page   graph the euro area three month deposit rate and the three month rate three  six  and nine month forward   forward rate had general fluctuat in a well defin rang  and the ecb was thought to be on hold   for the rest of the year   but forward rate fell in the last two week as the weaker u s  data and continu sluggish data in core europ took a toll   by late last week even the modest tighten for earli next year began to be price out   the euro has trade most in a      to      rang for the past three month  though it appreci sharpli on friday after the employ report  the dollar   yen exchang rate has been similar in a rang buffet by event on both side of the pacif   through the middl of june the yen  in the middl right panel  and jgb yield  in the bottom left panel  both had upward pressur coincid with sever month of strong japanes data  improv busi sen ent  a movement by some price index away from deflat  and general increas op  from investor that the long period of econom underperform in japan was at an end   sinc mid june  howev  the valu of the yen  jgb yield  and japanes stock price have all fallen  as investor have temper their op  with the latest batch of macro number   those number have been almost uniform weaker than investor    expect and have caus some reassess of how strong the japanes recoveri realli is   let me chang gear just a bit   in the past sever month  quit a few trader have bemoan the low level of volatil across a rang of asset market and the absenc of perceiv trade opportun   inde  accord to public report by consult who track the perform of hedg fund  the last few month have been difficult one   page   graph the option impli volatil sinc      for a sampl of the major asset market   the top panel graph the s p     volatil index  the major dollar currenc pair are in the middl panel  and two  and ten year swaption are shown in the bottom panel   in general  impli volatil has been toward the low end of histor averag for these asset  but a quick look at other market not shown here suggest that volatil is low in market as divers as the mexican peso and the korean stock market   given the list of potenti worri out there  includ the upcom elect  high and rise oil price  terrorist threat and other geopolit issu  the onset of a tighten cycl  and the usual concern about the durabl of the recoveri  one could reason make the case that vol are on the low side   sinc option are a form of financi insur  one explan could be that investor are shrug off the list of possibl concern and that there   s no appar mispric of asset that investor want to protect against   a more intrigu explan some have offer center on the suppli side of the volatil market and particular on the behavior of the specul communiti   this explan posit that  with the flood of money move into hedg fund recent  the best trade idea have been pick over pretti well   but the pressur to make absolut return persist  and the suggest is that  in lieu of ad to tradit carri trade  hedg fund have been sell option to generat premium   that flow of sell is in turn put downward pressur on volatil in a rang of market      as long as volatil stay low  that is a win strategi   if volatil should rise  then those with short vol posit would have to rush to cover their posit  data limit do not allow this explan to be valid  but the possibl of larg short vol posit spread out over mani institut cannot be rule out  final  note that sell volatil is in effect veri similar to a tradit carri trade  both need stabil of price or rate or both in order to work   if this strategi is be use in size  then our tradit measur of the size of the carri trade would be underes    mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
is it possibl that the presumpt in the market that the feder fund rate will follow a certain pattern   prior  let   s say  to the market   s move last friday after the employ report   has creat an anchor to the structur of rate that  by it veri natur  delimit the extent of volatil   that could be an explan of the low volatil   the issu realli get down to whether the market believ that is exact what is go to happen and it is take that presum pattern for the fund rate as a given   and they believ that becaus we   re tell them that   that automat will lower the volatil  which rais anoth obvious problem   that the system is less resili to shock from unexpect event   that make me a littl nervous if that is inde the explan  second  on the issu of potenti endeavor to adjust durat in the mortgag market  i have the impress that the last big wave of refinanc took out a veri big chunk of moder interest coupon mortgag   while it may veri well be true that  when interest rate fall or durat fall back  there would be inclin to hedg   essenti buy fix rate mortgag   but if you clean out the whole base  there   s noth left   there   s a veri delimit amount of potenti hedg activ that becom requir  except for the idiosyncrat shift in durat that has noth to do with refinanc   this is not a convex issu so much  it   s more an endeavor to judg where there is potenti for refinanc   do we have a judgment on this
let me answer that in two way   first  guess where convex relat hedg might kick in is as much an art as it is scienc   what some of the dealer are talk about is that at a rate of about   percent we might see some kind of buy or hedg kick in   on the second aspect
the answer is that that   s like   obvious  if the durat is fall  investor would be get increas uncomfort   but that   s not where the big chang is obvious
no   on the second point of where the rate might need to be to trigger a refinanc wave  the univers is pretti limit  as you say   in the spring  when the ten year rate got to about     percent  a good deal of refinanc occur   so  realli  the candid for refinanc are the mortgag that were origin over the last few month at higher rate  those now might becom attract candid for refinanc   as for how mani of those there are outstand  i don   t have the data here  but i agre with you that it   s probabl not a huge number
those are the onli candid
yes  exact   and the number is probabl not huge  it   s nowher near as larg as what we saw  say  in late       and the spring of
home purchas origin have been high  but they haven   t been high long enough to make a big differ
again  might it have some effect   yes   would it have the same kind of effect that we saw in those earlier period   probabl not
anoth way of put it  mr  chairman  is that the wave of refinanc has made the distribut of mortgag more concentr  and it isn   t until rate get down to the level they were a year or so ago that we would realli hit the mass of that distribut   while it is   true that the amount of new financ in the last year hasn   t been all that great  a lot of it has been in arm   and if rate were to declin some  we might see refinanc out of variabl rate and into fix rate product   so  there is some scope for refinanc  with regard to the first point you made about the anchor of the term structur made possibl by the committe   s measur pace of polici action  i   d note   and this is someth you   ve note in the past   that the term structur is also anchor at the long end  the ten year ahead one year forward rate has move in a veri narrow rang  and that has veri power lower the volatil of the longer term instrument that dino show   i think we have other manifest of a sens of lower volatil   perhap also bear on risk avers   the equiti premium is in the middl of it histor rang  and risk neutral bond spread also seem to be in their typic rang   and while volatil is low  the market reaction to news has been rather high  just think of what happen in respons to the employ report and the cpi
that   s true   you know  on the chart where dino has those red dot in the regress  the latest observ was right on the new curv
it realli   look as if that line has rotat   so although volatil are low  that isn   t prevent the market from repric when news come out   that may say someth about market function  and that would be a more favor interpret than the lesson you took away
also it   s a differ between histor observ volatil and the impli volatil
on this same subject though     isn   t it true that the distribut  deriv from option  about the expect for the fed fund path  sn   t appear   to have narrow substanti   there   s still a fair broad distribut in expect  a fair amount of uncertainti still price in around the path   i don   t think it   s true  just look at how that   s chang over the past nine month or so  that the band of uncertainti is narrow
but the slope go forward has not chang
no  that has not chang   i   m just talk about whatev concern some peopl here may have about market particip display excess reassur   if market particip feel reassur  it hasn   t produc substanti more confid around that band   i think that  combin with the fact that expect are move around in respons to the data is  again  good countervail
mr  chairman   in fact  there   s a chart in the bluebook that show that uncertainti about near term polici has risen over the last few month   it has not risen a lot  and the uncertainti is still pretti low  i think  but chart   show that it has gone up  it hasn   t gone down
an interest point is that the impli volatil on the s p     is realli startl   whenev we see thing of that natur  we say  well  what goe down must go up   the invers law of graviti
but that   s much more pronounc in the sustain interest rate
the interest rate is essenti anchor the equiti premium  what we   re realli say is that there can be an element of too much good news   i think that   s where we have to be care   further question for dino   would somebodi like to move approv of the desk   s transact
without object  they are approv   we   re now at the staff report   dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   a lot has chang sinc the june  book forecast was put to bed   unfortun  a lot has chang sinc the august  book was put to bed  too    laughter   in particular  in the june  book  we forecast that payrol employ gain would averag about         per month in the second and third quarter of this year against a backdrop of gdp growth averag about   percent at an annual rate   by the end of this year  we expect that the gdp gap would have narrow to just    percent   by the  e we publish the august  book last week  we had temper our growth assess substanti and had mark up our expect for the gdp gap at the end of this year to a full   percent   but we were still interpret the june employ report essenti as a one  e hiccup and were look for employ gain go forward onli slight smaller than we had project in the june  book   then came last friday   s employ report  with it news of onli a        advanc in privat nonfarm payrol  a downward revis to june employ of         and onli a     hour increas in the averag workweek   our miseri over come up short near         job was onli slight allevi by have so much compani   so  as i said  a lot has chang   on the other hand  i should also underscor that a lot has stay the same   even in the wake of friday   s report  we still see overal macroeconom condit as like to support a return to abov trend growth   in other word  growth that is suffici rapid to narrow the gap in resourc util over the next six quarter  even if onli slowli and incomplet   while we have taken quit a bit out of our forecast for payrol employ increas in august and septemb  we still have those increas track into the neighborhood of         in the fourth quarter of this year   and in respons to the employ report  we trim our forecast for third quarter gdp growth onli     percentag point  from     percent in the  book to     percent current  on the theori that the deficit in hour relat to our expect inform us main about product in the current quarter rather than output   in this connect  i should note there was one bright spot in friday   s report  name that employ in the manufactur sector look  if anyth  a littl better than we had expect   this is particular encourag in light of the fact that manufactur over the decad has been a fair sensit and reliabl bellweth of cyclic condit   if a pronounc cyclic soften truli were under way  we would have expect to see it in manufactur employ  but it simpli was not evid in the number for juli   our outlook for inflat also fall in the categori of    not much chang sinc the june  book      the most recent cpi report was quit reassur that the type of moder we were look for seem to be in train   inde  the news was good enough to caus us to shave our project for core cpi inflat by a tenth both this year and next   becaus the bea pencil in a fa  pace of inflat in the so call non market base price  we did not revis down our forecast for core pce inflat in line with the core cpi   even so  howev  we have core pce inflat slow from    percent this year to     percent next year  reflect smaller contribut   from import  energi  and other commod price and now a slight greater amount of restraint from slack in resourc util   but while a lot is still the same  enough has chang to make it more than fair to ask  what on earth is go on   lest i spark ani hope on your part that i   m about to produc a fulli satisfi explan  let me assur you to the contrari   in point of fact  we do not claim to sudden understand everyth that has happen in the last few month  if we were that smart now  we probabl would have been a littl smarter last week  and if we had been that smart last week  we certain wouldn   t have hid it so well from the committe    laughter   unfortun  the larg scale econometr model that we often consult for insight on such issu share our incomplet understand of the current situat   inde  that model  left to it own devic  would have want to see an addit   percentag point of real gdp growth in the second quarter  with much of it in pce   evid  in order to provid a full account of the recent weak in aggreg demand  we will have to appeal to some factor not captur by our convent model   in light of the weak of consum spend  factor bear on the household sector will have special stand   let me list some of the possibl   hypothesi #    mayb it   s just nois   this hypothesi actual come in two variant   the first variant take the view that the data may simpli be send the wrong signal  not truli repres of macroeconom realiti   i certain cannot rule out this variant  and inde  we had discount the first disappoint report on payrol employ  given the relat encourag recent read on initi claim for unemploy insur and improv household percept of labor market condit   on the other hand  this variant seem less plausibl in light of a second consecut disappoint labor market report as well as the june read on retail sale  motor vehicl sale  and industri product  all suggest that someth real happen toward the end of the second quarter   a second variant of the nois hypothesi accept the accuraci of the incom data but question the persist of the soft   mayb we are just on a temporari detour away from abov trend growth and shrink margin of resourc slack   we put some stock in this variant as well  in part becaus we have been impress by a number of the other relat encourag indic of demand in the third quarter  includ the rebound in motor vehicl sale  the strength in order and shipment of capit good  and the relat upbeat anecdot inform that we continu to receiv from the ism and other busi survey  from the beig book  and from our own busi contact   in addit  we continu to view the fundament determin of growth  especi the stanc of monetari polici   and  in the near term  the stanc of fiscal polici   as consist with abov trend growth   on the other hand  we are oper in an environ of consider uncertainti  and a key possibl that we must entertain is that someth more fundament is go on than just a temporari blip   someth we don   t understand and that may persist   hypothesi #    mayb it   s energi price   sinc june  the spot price of west texa intermedi has increas about    per barrel   moreov  price on long date   futur have undergon a stun near vertic takeoff in the last few week  certain the hypothesi that higher energi price are have a much more pronounc restrain effect on activ than we had anticip has to figur promin on our list of possibl   mayb the second surg in gasolin price in may and june caus household to reassess the outlook for energi price and sudden to take on board a much larger hit to their purchas power   to be sure  the  e of the most recent energi price spike is incrimin   but how much of the recent shortfal in aggreg activ can we realli lay at it doorstep   in a memo that we deliv to the committe just befor the june meet  we es  that  all els be equal  the run up in oil price between decemb and june might lop    percentag point off the growth of gdp this year and a further tenth off growth next year   at that  e  the spot price had risen about     per barrel from it late decemb level   sinc june the spot price has increas anoth    or so  suggest that the total oil relat deduct from the growth of gdp this year might amount to about   percentag point   or rough two third of the total downward revis to our gdp project over that  e   but while the price of oil is crucial for understand the revis sinc the decemb  book to our project for gdp growth this year  can it account for the steep downward revis to gdp growth sinc the june  book   here the answer is murkier   by june  rough two third of the increas in oil price had alreadi occur and so should have been taken on board in the forecast we deliv to the fomc just befor your two day meet   that suggest that the increas in oil price sinc then might account for a downward revis to our es  of growth this year of onli about   percentag point   onli a fraction of the near   percentag point revis that we have put through sinc the june  book   on the other hand  a number of factor counsel against draw sharp conclus   for one  our abil to pinpoint the  e of an adjust to higher oil price probabl is veri limit  for anoth  we may not have suffici adjust the june  book project to the oil price then alreadi in view   and for a third  there is littl doubt that our formal econometr model omit potenti channel of influenc from oil to real activ  and whether we have adequ compens for those omiss in our judgment project is not clear   all that said  the coincid between the spike in oil price and the air pocket in spend seem too strike to write off to mere chanc   so at this point  we are think that energi price almost sure are part of the explan  we   re just not sure how big a part   hypothesi #    falter fiscal s ulus   in the baselin project  we have been assum that the      and      tax cut are still support the growth of consum spend this year but by a gradual diminish amount   on our assumpt  these tax cut boost the growth of real pce   percentag point in the first half of this year but will lift the growth of pce in the second half by less than    percentag point and will be essenti neutral for pce growth in        but here    too  we have onli limit abil to pinpoint the  e of adjust  and this hypothesi suggest the possibl that we should have attribut a larger fraction of the strength in consum spend earlier this year to short live tax induc s ulus and a smaller fraction to an under fundament base thrust   in sum  we think these hypothes contain some of the seed of an explan  whether they constitut a full or onli a partial explan  whether we need to add to our list  or whether we need to subtract from it  all remain to be seen   but as usual  we will have to remain alert in come month for clue that may shed further light on the natur of the recent step down in the growth of real activ     will now continu our present
as   has discuss  it now appear that the pace of u s  econom activ in the second and third quarter has been and like remain somewhat less robust than we thought in june   such a develop natur lead us to question whether we should reduc our forecast for activ abroad  as the strength of demand aris in the unit state is an import factor for mani region of the global economi   howev  the data we have in hand for the second quarter and the indic we have receiv for activ abroad this quarter do not suggest ani major revis to our outlook  and our project for foreign econom growth is littl chang this  e from that in the june  book   the possibl of some spillov from the soft in u s  activ remain a risk  howev   the view that the foreign expans remain moder vigor is consist with the fact that we were surpris on the upsid by real growth of u s  export in the second quarter   although we still lack month nomin trade data for june  stronger than expect export in may and posit revis to april have led us to project that export of real good and servic expand almost      percent at an annual rate in the second quarter   a full   percentag point higher than we were forecast in june   the nomin data show strength across most categori  particular capit good and industri suppli   by destin  they reflect the second quarter weak in econom activ in china  with nomin export to china plus hong kong declin from the first quarter   we expect that real gdp growth abroad  particular in the major foreign industri countri  will moder on averag over the remaind of this year and  accord  that real export will deceler some through next year   our stori is a bit less satisfactori with respect to real import of good and servic   although u s  real gdp growth for the second quarter came in below our expect  real import of good and servic also surpris us on the upsid   a higher figur than anticip for may and an upward revis to april impli second quarter real import growth of about     percent  about   percentag point abov our project in the june  book   the strength in import is widespread across categori   for the second half of this year  when we incorpor the weaker outlook for u s  gdp growth includ the inform from last friday   s employ report  we now expect real import growth to slow some  to an annual rate of     percent  about   percentag point weaker than the figur in the current  book  for       we expect further deceler in import  to an annual growth rate a bit less than   percent   with our outlook for import growth slight diminish  we see the arithmet contribut of net export to real gdp growth as move to about minus  …  percentag point in the second half of this year and averag about that much in        we have also shave a bit off our project for the current account deficit and expect it to averag     percent of gdp next year   in addit to the less posit near term news about the u s  economi  the other major global econom develop over the intermeet period was a further rise in oil price   in line with futur price at the  e  we had expect the spot price of wti to begin move down  and for the few day between the  book releas and the june fomc meet it did just that   howev  sinc june     the spot price has move up near    per barrel  to close abov     ye day   our forecast for the averag spot price of wti this quarter has been revis up    per barrel   although we and the futur market still expect the price of oil to move down over the forecast period  our project path show a declin of onli    per barrel from the current quarter to the fourth quarter of next year   sort the mix of demand and suppli effect is made difficult by the limit avail of veri current data   opec rais it product target   million barrel a day for juli and an addit     million b d for august and has continu to produc abov it announc quota   exclud iraq  opec produc      million b d in june  an increas of about     million b d from april   much of that increas is due to saudi arabia and the emir  and other than iraq  no opec member reduc product signific over the last few month   on august    saudi author announc that they had start product from two new field three month ahead of schedul   nevertheless  there have been some negat suppli factor over the intermeet period   the most import has been the russian govern   s virtual attack on yuko   in the guis of take step to collect unpaid tax  the russian govern has taken action that seem intend to gain control of yuko product asset   both the rapid revers of some decis made in the past sever week and the ambigu of whether product will be disrupt in the near futur have heighten uncertainti in oil market   in iraq  intensifi violenc in recent day has threaten oil export from the southern port on the persian gulf   other sourc of suppli concern have been condit in nigeria and venezuela plus question about refineri capac and short term refineri disrupt   these develop have combin to put upward pressur on price and to increas volatil   with spot price rise even as report suppli has increas  it seem clear that strong global demand for oil has contribut import to the run up in price   in earli juli  the intern energi associ  iea  revis up it es  of   world oil consumpt in the first and second quarter   for the first half of the year  world oil consumpt is es  at    million b d  up   million from the same period last year   global consumpt is expect to rise slight further dure the second half of the year   u s  demand for oil has risen over the past year  but much of the increas in global demand is attribut to china  where demand has move up notic both last year and so far this year   iea es  put global product in excess of global consumpt in the second quarter  impli a consider build in inventori   more than is normal for that quarter   such a develop is onli part evid in data on oecd inventori  which have increas but remain at low level  if iea data are correct and no suppli disrupt emerg  then inventori should build further in the current quarter  with downward pressur on price a like result  this expect seem to be price  at least in part  into the futur market  which  as mention earlier  yet again call for price to move down from their current high  the current iea data may be mislead  howev   recent upward revis to es  of demand rais the possibl that demand is even stronger than now es    the elev level of the entir current path of futur price suggest that  in respons to the intermeet develop such as the yuko event  trader have becom less sanguin that product will meet or exceed consumpt go forward   with strong global demand for oil a major factor in explain the high spot price  the implic of the higher price for our outlook for foreign growth are complex   for individu countri  the consequ of high global oil price might be the same whether those price result from suppli restrict or from demand aris elsewher   but on averag  absent signific disrupt  we judg that onli if global econom expans remain strong will these price be sustain   the data do not suggest that we are reach a global suppli constraint   accord  with no major suppli disrupt yet occur in oil market or assum in our forecast  we have adjust the growth and inflat forecast for individu countri  but we continu to project a sustain expans abroad at a pace close to  but slight below  that experienc in the first half of this year   dave and i will be happi to answer ani question
in evalu the oil price impact in the unit state  we tend to look at the issu from the crude price  essenti a chang in the valu of crude import is view as a tax effect   but i wonder if there is not someth a littl differ go on at the moment  or at least through the spring  with the veri signific rise in refineri and market margin   that drove the gasolin price up the equival of an addit    per barrel on the price of oil   the reason we talk in term of net import onli is the presumpt that domest energi earn are recycl with a propens to spend not signific differ from consum spend    but that clear has not been the case here becaus  despit the huge rise in refineri market margin dure the second quarter and inde part through the first quarter  there has been no evid pickup in capit invest on the part of oil compani base in the unit state   so in a sens  the tax so far as household are concern   or if you want to put it this way  the propens to save   has risen   and henc the multipli have chang   i wonder whether that  sn   t put a slight differ  e configur on this becaus in the last sever week we   ve observ that  as crude price have risen  gasolin price have come down   essenti that gap has now been restor to where it was   if that is inde the case  the impact of the oil effect on the third quarter is not go to parallel the actual chang in the price of crude   but how much differ it will be is hard to judg   also  with respect to the question of the larg inventori accumul go on worldwid  in one sens  i guess we don   t realli care whether there is excess unus capac or capac use to increas inventori abov normal   we add the two of them  it   s the combin of the two that   s realli involv here
but it matter if demand is be underes
yes   and that   s where this miss barrel question come from   it seem extraordinarili odd that after remark flat world consumpt   at a littl over    million barrel a day for a long period   sudden demand has just taken off   we didn   t see that dure the     s  as i recal
that is where all the anecdot about china come in  i think   our inform about what is realli go on in china is poor  at best   we know  for exampl  that the electr grid in that countri is not up to the task of meet current demand  and china   s economi is grow rapid   and we know that  in respons to that  mani manufactur or other produc unit   or for that matter household  for all we know   have purchas generat   but   the use of numer small generat burn kerosen or heavi fuel oil or whatev they burn is a veri ineffici way to suppli electr   their use is lower  if you will  the averag effici of produc electr to support econom growth in china  perhap in an import way
hasn   t their oil consumpt gone from   million to   million barrel a day in a coupl of year  or someth like that
the stori  though  is that to build capac you need to stock it with an origin endow and some of that is happen
it   s the in process inventori that are build up   if that is inde the case  then it   s not consumpt
right  but we don   t know   all these anecdot are out there  but no one has real data
in larg measur they don   t have room to store more oil   in fact  they   re behind schedul on build their strateg reserv becaus they don   t have storag capac   where is it all go   mayb there   s a big hole in the ground that they   re fill in
mr  chairman  anoth uncertainti that i   d highlight with respect to the  e of how this play out is that the sourc of the increas in the price of oil may have a differ profil recent than was the case over the first half of the year   my sens qualit is that strong world demand was perhap more a front load stori in the first part of the year and that suppli concern mayb have emerg as an issu later
well  certain in the intermeet period  not onli the spot price but i think the farther out futur have react enorm to the yuko stori  which is not realli about product today   actual  it might be about product today becaus overnight the russian author seiz control of a big product unit of yuko  which onli ad credenc to the view   that the russian govern was tri to re establish control over those asset or want to gain some perceiv polit benefit by sell them at below true valu to favor purchas
is there ani credibl scenario in which the russian would allow that oil product to declin at these price
it is hard to imagin that they would allow that to happen for ani period of  e  but i   m suffici skeptic about their busi compet that i wouldn   t assum that they can do all this shift and achiev their polit aim and not disrupt suppli temporarili   but there is certain no incent for them to cut back product
i think they have an incent to make believ they are cut back to get the price up but to keep sell the oil
to exert some leverag over the rest of the oil produc or for a host of reason
may i just finish the thought   the consequ for u s  activ could be quit differ  depend on the mix of suppli and demand factor   if that mix chang over the first and second halv of the year  it could add to the uncertainti about the  e that you were highlight in your comment  mr  chairman
i think that   s a good point to make
i also want to follow on this discuss about oil price   it seem that everi  e i   ve look at this futur market for oil   and i don   t look at it on a regular basi   when the spot price is in the   s or   s  the price of oil is alway shown as come down in the futur  now it is project to be come down  but not by veri much   onli about    or    a barrel   by the end of        i was just wonder if you view this market now as typic     it look the way   it alway    or has it chang becaus of terror in russia and all the other thing that are go on   and   it chang at differ level  as the level of the spot price vari
well  you   re ask someon whose expertis in this matter is more limit than i wish it were   it   s normal for this curv to display a downward slope  but it   s not alway the case that it     there have been  e when the front portion of the futur curv has slope up  that would not be consid an unpreced event by ani mean   oil is cost to store   so that figur into the valu of buy now to meet a futur demand versus buy it in the futur  i   ve express to the peopl who studi this market in great detail my frustrat about the fact that this curv slope down all the  e and ride up to the actual spot price   i   ve ask whi it is that the peopl in the futur market alway continu to believ that the oil price is go to start come down    tomorrow    despit six month    worth of evid that that hasn   t happen   those who analyz the oil market confront me with this suppli and demand stori   they say that as best they   and i assum all the peopl trade in the real market   can tell  the data they have avail suggest that the current suppli exceed consumpt   now  we may someday learn that these data were just wholli inaccur  and that may explain what was mislead all of us   but the peopl trade in the futur market have the same data  and they  too  believ that current product exceed consumpt by a comfort margin   so they are alway expect that suppli   demand imbal to show through to the oil price  now  these peopl have becom a bit battl scar   and the curv  at least to my eye  has flatten a littl from some of it previous shape   i think that   s becaus  even though the product data  taken liter  suggest that product exceed global consumpt  peopl are price in either some expect of a russian foul up of one sort or anoth  or a terrorist event  or   the venezuelan situat get ugli  or someth of that sort   so either they are attach some probabl to suppli be below global capac in the futur  or they have come to believ that the data aren   t entir reliabl   someth  howev  has caus them to bid up the far futur more than a straight read of what the market   s knowledg of demand and suppli would creat but not so much as to take away complet this notion that inventori must be build somewhat and that it   s go to show through to price at some point
there   s an interest histori here   incident  there have been signific period of a so call contango curv
pickup  yes
in       for exampl  the curv slope up   someth unusu happen about three to four year ago   prior to then  the far distant six  to seven year futur huddl around     to     a barrel  which appear to be the general judgment of what the margin suppli price was in the long term outsid of opec   and the six  to seven year futur price held in a veri narrow rang as the spot price went up and down veri sharpli   inde  the spot price went well below     a barrel for a while  and at that point the longer term futur were still     to     a barrel  some  just a few year ago the long term futur price start to move up  and it   s now at     a barrel   the argument essenti be made by some   and i think it has some valid   is that  prior to this recent period  the general world price was determin among commerci buyer and seller  or produc and user of oil  larg by the level of world inventori   start first with the intifada and the problem emerg gradual in the middl east  the general assumpt that opec crude suppli was secur began to deterior  and the situat has obvious gotten signific wors   what has happen is that a whole group of noncommerci interest  see   the geopolit arbitrag  have decid that they want inventori of oil and that the best way to get those inventori is to buy long term futur   now  the onli peopl who can sell to noncommerci interest are commerci interest   so those who own all the liquid barrel by definit have been sell net claim to noncommerci interest  therebi reduc their suppli   or anoth way of look at it is that they are increas the demand versus suppli  the way to pick up these data is in the cftc   s net posit on the nymex   the noncommerci interest is now net long  it has been long for some  e and has been rise for quit a while   it has gone up and down recent  but it still is net long   that mean  in effect  that we have a whole new set of buyer out there  but without chang occur in the under general level of the inventori  if this is the case  question are be rais about what would happen if   or   million barrel a day got knock out of the saudi crude suppli becaus of some upris or someth like that   that premium is in the market  and i think it   s a veri interest question as to how rapid it will disappear short of enough inventori actual be accumul worldwid to satisfi the need of both commerci interest and the net specul interest of those who have a sens of geopolit risk that they want to hedg   at some point  the latter group is go to get enough oil  at which  e they will stop their hedg buy   and at that point i think the price will come down
or it will come down just with the passag of  e   if among those purchas are peopl who envis some reason for use oil  they don   t need to buy in the spot market becaus they will have alreadi bought forward   if they are just specul  as it get close to the  e when they   re go to get deliveri of this oil that they don   t realli want  they   re go to sell it spot   ul   it   s onli the peopl who actual consum the oil who can sustain the price    that   s what make this global demand stori have to be the context in which this trade is take place
i think the best way of visual it is this   when what i   d call the opec premium rise  the under ex ant demand to hold inventori worldwid rise  if suppli exceed consumpt  inventori will rise to the level at which that demand is sate  and at some point it will be sate   the onli issu is  where is that number
and somewher out there are altern energi sourc   tar sand  other kind of materi  or whatev   they often use to be cite as put a limit on how high the oil price could be
if oil goe to     a barrel you   ll be surpris at what
even ethanol look good
i guess the staff   s es  are that the suppli of oil is close to unitari elast over the long run in the unit state and that it   s veri inelast in the short run  but with enough  e  we just price ourselv out of the market
but if one imagin that the citizen of india and china  which would total about   billion peopl  rais their per capita consumpt of energi to  say  half the averag of that in industri countri
that   s a veri import point
that would result in an altogeth differ pictur of the long term energi suppli   demand balanc in the world   and the effect of that has to feed back at some point  now  if that were realli what was drive everyth  one might think that invest in the energi sector would just be take off  and i don   t see that either   and part of it is becaus this miser curv slope down all the  e   in the short run it alway seem as if the price of oil is go to fall   ani day and  therefor  that such invest is not realli go to pay off   there   s a certain inconsist in that  i realiz
i don   t want to prolong this discuss too much   the chairman made the point i want to make   that how the margin cost of energi is determin has move from a secur low risk environ to a veri high risk environ   one of the thing i think we   re see with the news regard yuko and other develop that are move the market around is that mani peopl in the market   in a situat where i believ suppli and demand are actual pretti close in balanc now   are look to russia or venezuela or other place as the margin produc and no longer to saudi arabia  for exampl   the latter alway has a lower cost of product but a higher risk profil   is that a possibl explan
it   s certain true that the role of saudi arabia as the swing produc was a deliber and explicit polici adopt by the saudi   they would restrict product or they would expand product in an attempt to set a sort of horizont suppli curv for oil at a specifi price   that has just broken down   it has broken down for a varieti of reason   what i think we   re see is the transit to some new structur pattern in global oil and relat sourc of energi that hasn   t realli settl out yet   and it   s not clear exact how it is go to settl out
further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the two big question face us are whether the recent soft patch in econom activ is temporari and to what degre under inflat has pick up   on the first question  we get a sens from our seventh district contact that their busi is good but appar not robust enough to generat substanti hire   we have receiv   mix report on employ   our contact at temporari help firm say that they are place temporari worker across a wide rang of industri   in addit  they are increas their placement of worker in perman job   some of our more general busi contact even report scatter labor shortag in a few special area   nevertheless  few say that they are perman increas their head count even though busi is pretti good  in term of spend  some sector that had weak activ in june show improv in juli   in particular  retail told us that they saw someth of a bounceback  and look ahead  merchant sound quit bullish about the upcom holiday season and are plan to build their inventori accord   as you know  light vehicl sale also bounc back in juli   so far  report suggest that sale in the first week of august continu to be strong   one manufactur even told us that they are look for sale in the month to be about      million unit
excus me   was that for light vehicl or total sale
light   automak will need a good august and septemb to clear dealer lot of their       model year car  otherwis  they will need to reduc product schedul for their       model   other sector never realli experienc much of a slowdown in june  and their activ remain strong   this pattern has been evid in new order for construct  agricultur  mine  and some it equip as well as in demand for advertis   air travel has continu to move higher dure the summer  with book solid for the fall   in contrast  inform we have heard about it servic suggest weak  on the second question  the outlook for inflat  our district contact continu to talk about cost pressur  but there are few indic of pass through to price so far   there   s not much news on wage  but rise health care cost remain a major concern   and cost for some materi input  notabl construct materi  steel  and energi remain elev   our contact still expect these   cost to eas  but it is take longer than they had anticip   similar  the suppli chain bottleneck that i discuss last  e are also take longer to resolv   capac constraint are particular sever in transport  and there are concern that these could persist and caus substanti problem dure the peak fall ship season   as i note  despit all these cost pressur  we   re hear onli limit report of price increas downstream  turn to the nation outlook  we think that the economi   s soft patch is temporari   the juli employ report make us nervous but  sn   t chang this assess   assum that the recent payrol data are not spurious  what risk do they suggest   one possibl is that we   re back to an environ similar to last year  when uncertainti held back hire even though growth continu   of cours  there are reason to think that uncertainti might have risen  we   ve just talk about the oil price  terrorist threat  and so on   howev  our busi contact have not talk explicit about increas uncertainti hold back their hire  and we know that indic of spend show activ pick up again in juli   moreov  we think the fundament continu to be strong   real incom growth has been maintain despit the weak employ growth and higher energi price  we still have strong under product growth  and monetari polici remain veri accommod   we are concern about the persist high oil price   their movement seem to be driven larg by geopolit concern  as   was discuss  so oil is a wild card both for growth and for inflat   we all know that these sort of suppli shock make for difficult polici decis   still  with regard to price  the data suggest that core inflat remain well contain   so at this  e continu to remov polici accommod at a measur pace seem appropri
thank you  mr  chairman   almost all my contact said that they had noth new to report  essenti the stori was the same as last  e   i would mention two thing that are perhap a littl differ   my wal mart contact said that the pace of sale in august has definit downshift   the wal mart public stori is an expect of   to   percent growth in same store sale  but appar intern es  are much closer to   percent than   percent   wal mart offici were veri reluct to revis their es  public to   to   percent  which is what they might otherwis do  becaus they thought that might give too pessimist a pictur   they are expect some pickup in septemb and octob  more to the   to   percent growth rang  sever of my contact spoke about the rail congest   there seem to be a real bottleneck in u s  railroad these day  and the congest has actual reduc capac   becaus the averag train speed is down  that mean that the capac to move freight is down   my contact expect the problem to continu through this year becaus  of cours  as we move into the fall more good are move on the rail   so the situat realli won   t get straighten out until the earli part of next year  i think the staff outlook for the economi make good sens  i agre that interpret current develop as temporari is right   as for the employ report  the back of the envelop calcul i   ve done on the season factor suggest that  if we had use last year   s season  the number of job creat in juli would have been        higher than report   i   ll just throw that out as someth to think about   obvious  that  sn   t fundament chang the pictur  but if we had gotten         new job instead of         the pictur would have look a littl differ  that   s all i want to report   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the pace of econom activ in the fourth district  although sound  has been slower this summer than in late winter and earli spring   my convers with busi person throughout the district have reinforc my view that the region is still pois for solid econom growth for the remaind of this year  although at a pace somewhat slower than i had expect in the spring   dure the past few month  i had thought that current econom condit in my district were lag those in the rest of the countri   howev  nation econom statist and the beig book report indic that the recent slowdown is more broad base than i had thought   go into our june meet  the busi peopl i talk to were express a grow sens of confid in the economi  and at that point i thought that was help to dispel some of the linger caution about restrain capit invest and hire plan  but those express of confid have dissip somewhat  and this chang in attitud came befor the juli employ report  the balanc of comment from the peopl i talk to has shift from enthusiasm to renew concern about the pace of the expans   and this shift in attitud is not confin to those busi that are under stress   i had a convers with an execut from a global manufactur compani  whose growth in order is match the peak level of the late     s   but despit his strong order book  even this individu confid that this pace of busi would not last  when i press him about the reason he was say that  he couldn   t cite ani specif reason   he just had a gut feel that it could not last  so this return of greater caution about the outlook is reinforc the desir on the part of firm to expand product and to meet the grow order via product gain   and as i have been report for some  e  compani indic that they intend to remain disciplin about their hire   wage pressur don   t appear to be restrain the hire  but high and rise health care   cost are   i   ve been accustom to hear complaint about the rise in health care cost whenev inflat is mention  but late busi person have rais this issu in the context of their hire strategi  from their perspect  labor is becom more expens   and compani that have alreadi enjoy signific product gain continu to assert that there are plenti of opportun to becom even more effici   that might be a factor in the weak demand for labor that we are see in the data  i find the inflat pictur somewhat complic   when we talk about inflat as the twelv month chang in the market base core pce price index  we   re mani step remov from the experi that most peopl have in their local groceri store and at the gas pump   even my director  who have becom accustom to talk about the nuanc of inflat measur  have been veri concern about the steadi stream of big headlin cpi number this year   they point out that peopl might begin to lose their patienc with the idea that these larg increas are transitori   furthermor  a number of my director and other district contact tell me that some of the previous spike in commod and energi price have not been fulli price into final good  some of my contact in the manufactur sector say that they still have contract  especi with steel produc  but those contract will be expir in the fall  so we might see some addit pass through later on this year  fortun  despit these report  i have not been hear anyth that would lead me to believ that substanti inflationari pressur are build across a wide rang of final good price  it still seem to me that the  book inflat project is the most like outcom   headlin inflat rate should start to moder in the next sever quarter  but i do see some risk in the inflat outlook   over the cours of this year  i have thought that domin forc in the economi were produc a higher equilibrium real rate of interest and that monetari polici need to adjust   to that situat in a  e fashion   i still believ that this is so and that we should continu to move the fed fund rate toward a more neutral stanc   at the same  e  i was concern at our last meet that we might be fall behind the curv   but after listen to the grow caution that i am hear from my busi contact and after last friday   s employ report  i   m wonder whether the economi hasn   t shift to a somewhat slower growth track than i expect six week ago   if that is the case  then today   s fed fund rate would be closer to neutral as well   i do not think  howev  that it is so much closer that i would not want to move today   recent develop obvious highlight the difficulti that we face in communic our futur action  and i   d like to have maximum flexibl with respect to polici go forward   i would want the flexibl to gaug the  e of futur action as econom circumst warrant   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in contrast to the nation and my next door neighbor  econom activ in the third district is expand a littl fa  now than it was at the begin of the year   job growth in our region had been lag that in the nation  but it has strengthen in recent month  at least through june  which is the latest month for which we have state employ number   payrol in our three state grew at a     percent rate in the second quarter  after be flat in the first quarter   each of the state had employ gain  and these gain were widespread across industri   job growth in the region was strongest in new jersey  especi the southern part of the state   payrol employ is now abov it pre recess level in new jersey   it remain   percent below the pre recess level in delawar and    percent below in pennsylvania   the tri state unemploy rate edg down to     percent in the second quarter  and we continu to receiv report that some firm are have difficulti find qualifi worker    respons to special question about wage in our busi outlook survey of manufactur and our south jersey busi survey   which includ manufactur  retail  and servic firm   suggest that grow demand for worker is lead to wage increas   thirti eight percent of the bos respond and    percent of the south jersey respond said that they have rais wage to retain or attract worker in the past three month   among those who report rais wage  the modal increas was in the   to   percent rang  and these survey result seem consist with the bls data indic that wage and salari and total worker compens in our region have been rise at a fa  pace than in the nation as a whole  the other sector in our district continu to perform well   although retail sale moder a bit in june  our contact attribut the slower sale to unusu cool weather  and they report some rebound in juli   in addit  retail in our region expect strong back to school sale  although we don   t have hard data on whether that is happen yet   commerci real estat market in the region remain soft   residenti construct activ remain at a high level  although it growth eas back a bit in june   manufactur activ in the region continu to expand and has outperform the nation in recent month   our busi outlook survey index of general activ rose to      in juli  up from      in june  and the index has been in posit territori for the last fourteen month  the more forward look index on new order and shipment improv consider in juli  and a histor larg share of respond also report increas in unfil order and deliveri  e   and some firm comment that they were reach capac   servic sector activ in the region has strengthen  with payrol employ in that sector expand brisk in the past few month   over the first half of the year  profession and busi servic employ grew the fastest among the servic sector industri in our region    we continu to get read of rise price in our region  although the pace of increas is slight less than a few month ago   the price paid index in our manufactur survey declin in the past two month but remain at a high level   firm seem better abl to pass on some of the price increas to their custom   the price receiv index in our survey rose to a fifteen year high in juli   in summari  the outlook in our region is posit   our staff   s lead indic of econom activ are signal steadi growth in all three state in our district over the next three quarter  and our busi contact appear op ist  on the nation level  real gdp growth slow somewhat more than expect in the second quarter   first quarter growth  as report here  was revis up at the same  e   most of the second quarter deceler reflect sharpli lower growth in consum spend  which was not total unexpect  but the size of the declin was greater than most had anticip   at the same  e  most of the new month data have been come in on the posit side   auto sale rebound in juli   hous remain strong  and new order for nondefens capit good continu to trend up  so at least until friday  i tend to agre with the  book   s earlier interpret of the second quarter as a temporari lull in activ  and i expect gdp growth to be somewhat fa  in the third quarter than in the second  then the juli employ report was releas last friday   we know what the job gain were  so i will skip over the detail   still  a number of other indic of the report show improv in the labor market   the unemploy rate fell a tenth to     percent  and the household employ number grew by an implaus larg           i am still puzzl by that latter number   the labor forc particip rate move up   and the averag and median durat of unemploy move down signific  the week hour work held about steadi   in addit  we note that initi claim for unemploy insur have been trend down  and   mani busi survey indic that firm are hire and expect to continu hire   given the weight of all this evid  i continu to expect a rebound in employ growth in the come month  and i   ll be watch these data care  at our last meet  governor bernank remind us of larri     s rule of forecast  i found myself think about those rule over the past few week  as the weaker than expect output was announc and  more recent  last friday when the employ data were releas   i ask myself  is it  e to appli rule   and make a fundament new forecast   my answer is     no  at least not yet      high oil price do pose a risk to the economi  not onli to growth but also to inflat and inflat expect   that said  i note that the core pce has moder in recent month  in my view  the fomc should remain on the cours we began at our last meet and should continu to remov polici accommod at a measur pace   despit the recent soft in output and in the employ data  my outlook for the economi has not chang enough to merit our take a paus   i think the risk of maintain the current degre of polici accommod outweigh the risk of a continu transit to a more neutral stanc   the real fed fund rate will remain negat even after we move today  and thus monetari polici will remain expansionari as we continu to help the economi out of this temporari lull   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani other come into this meet  i have been tri to understand whi some of the wind seem to have gone out of the sail of consum spend and employ   consum spend has been such an import anchor both dure the recess and dure the recoveri  as other sector one by one heal and began to contribut to the expans   of cours  we   ve been count on some solid employ growth    and the new incom and spend power that come with it will offset the individu spend that will wane at the margin as we remov our extraordinari polici accommod   like other  i think i am comfort conclud that some combin of the sap effect of high energi price  heighten concern about a terrorist act associ with our elect season  the olymp  or some other target of opportun serv to chill consum   howev  more recent data such as auto sale  which have alreadi been cite by sever peopl  suggest that consum spend has not dri up  employ develop are also interest  to say the least   i take some comfort in look back at the month data of the boom period of the     s  which remind us of the volatil of month employ data   it is not all that unusu to have two or even three not so strong month within a period of strong employ growth   at the same  e  i certain think the mood among the busi leader i talk with about new hire is still one of squeez out the last ounc from exist staff and of achiev the maximum amount of staff cut possibl from technolog  merger  and acquisit   that mindset seem to argu for the kind of more moder  but still good  job growth reflect in the staff   s latest es    perhap more import  i do not see ani obvious loss of momentum in other sector   by most measur  manufactur seem to be hold it gain   homebuild and sale are hold up remark well   invest spend continu at a good pace   export are grow nice   we   re even see some first sign of a stir in commerci construct  or at least some plan and financ for futur construct  as alway  i   ve tri to ascertain how our region data and anecdot report either confirm or contradict the broader nation develop   sinc our last meet  my region insight suggest that there is still broad and sustain under strength in the expans   report from our region   s tourist destin are quit upbeat   air travel is strong   we   re see some new   commerci construct crane on the horizon and are hear of project in the pipelin   so on the output side  i remain reason confid and encourag that a good expans continu to be in train   even     percent gdp growth es  sound pretti good  unless one had come to believ that we realli had return to the high spot of the     s  on the inflat front  i agre that we do not seem to face ani near term threat of measur higher and uncomfort inflat rate   at the same  e  i am less will than some to conclud that most of the price pressur we have seen and talk about here at our meet are go to turn out to be transitori   while mani of the increas associ with higher oil and other commod price should be revers in  e  i continu to be struck by the degre to which we still are get cost pass through   we   re be remind that  in those area where demand is strong and build  price increas are stick   when one decompos the contribut  posit and negat  to core pce price over recent quarter  it is clear that  were it not for the downward drag of core good price  the increas in core servic price would feel more threaten  our region data and insight continu to remind me that there are continu price pressur and more price power than we have seen in some  e   sinc the last meet  sever truck compani have told us that they are about to announc   to   percent price increas   a senior up execut director report that there is veri littl pushback in fuel surcharg   truck driver wage are on the rise  and sever southeast truck compani say that they have rais start pay twice alreadi in      and are expect anoth increas in the current quarter   a nation temporari employ servic compani report that they have rais their rate for the first  e in a coupl of year   so i am not as readi as some to move inflat concern complet to the back burner    put all this togeth and look ahead just a bit to the polici discuss  i would conclud that  while the error band of confid interv around our forecast are probabl now wider  given recent develop the risk now seem more honest balanc than they were at the  e of our last meet   i think we can and should stay on the path of remov our extraordinari polici accommod   think in olymp term  we should continu to cut back on the dosag of our perform enhanc polici drug    laughter   and final  not know how much opportun we will have to discuss our post meet statement  i would suggest   while i am still among those who wish to have a fundament discuss of our communic practic  perhap at our januari meet   that today is not a good  e to be tinker again with that statement  thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  condit in our district reflect much of what i   ve heard so far around the tabl today  but i think a coupl of develop are worth note   our labor market have shown further sign of improv  actual   employ rose in june for the fourth straight month   major hire announc stay at a high level in june and juli  and local labor market survey indic an increas in hire plan for the rest of this year   layoff announc did turn up a littl in juli but remain lower than the hire announc and were larg confin to our telecommun firm  which are continu to cut staff  manufactur activ in our region continu to grow solid in juli   product and new order rose further  and employ and hire continu to expand accord to all our survey result  firm remain high op ist about futur activ and still plan moder increas in hire and capit spend   consum spend is flat in our area  as other have note for their region  energi activ continu to expand in respons obvious to the price environ   as befor    though  some of the individu we talk with on the produc side say that they are be constrain to some degre by shortag of labor and equip and difficulti in obtain permit for some of the drill activ they would like to pursu  i would say that on the nation level the question we are struggl with is whether this recent news is a paus or a more system issu   i am unabl to tell that for sure  but i   m inclin to suggest that it   s a paus and not someth fundament   but given the uncertainti around energi  i think continu high or rise energi price pose some risk on that front   one thing that   concern me is that  base on my convers with some of our busi peopl   even those in the manufactur sector   the news that has come out recent has surpris them as well   so they are rethink how they are look at the situat go forward  and that is a bit of an issu for us  but i do believ that the economi is fundament strong  and i think our current monetari polici stanc is consist with that move forward  as is fiscal polici as well   so i think that the lull is temporari and that we will see activ continu to increas through the remaind of this year  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   new england seem to be experienc what we hope is the same summer lull as the rest of the countri   the job market didn   t improv from may to june  and some compani   most notabl in the technolog and consum product sector   saw weaker demand than expect   as one director put it     technolog spend stop to take a breath in june and juli      still  overal the region economi continu to expand and in mani area  such as heavi equip  paper and packag  and medic product  growth remain strong   consum and busi confid remain at high level  and coincid indic of econom activ remain posit   high energi price  expect of higher interest rate  not to   mention the secur surround the democrat nation convent  certain took a bite out of local demand  but we think it is a temporari one   so far  no one expect that bite out of demand to derail what continu to appear to be a self sustain recoveri  similar  incom data on the nation economi have been soft late  especi when compar with the growth rate need to eat into excess capac in a signific way over the next year to year and a half   inde  the baselin  book forecast  and our in boston as well  see excess capac remain at the end of       and this was expect prior to the surpris in the employ data of last friday and the latest revis of the  book   despit the relat soft  at least compar with forecast  the absolut state of the economi  sn   t seem that bad  hous market are still strong   inde  as the  book point out  recent read on busi spend and profit remain posit   not ebulli  to be sure  but solid   in particular  i  too  find the increas in spend on nonresidenti structur and the recent impli increas in manufactur activ and manufactur employ interest   it is too earli to draw a conclus on this  i suppos  but it may be that busi took the june falloff in consumpt with a grain of salt in juli   perhap they aren   t hire until thing becom clearer  but they may also be relat comfort in spend as they and the rest of us continu to believ that this lull in activ will be short live  in that regard  outsid of the payrol job data  the consum   seem well equip to continu spend   read on overal confid are good  employ claim are down  hour work are up a littl  layoff are down  and survey both of consum attitud toward the labor market and of busi hire plan are posit   in addit  for whatev reason  job as measur by the household survey have surg late  and the unemploy rate recent drop a bit   it is hard to know exact how to figur in the household survey or what to make of it   it may  in fact  be   nois   as dave suggest  one of the reason for not know how to interpret the latest report is that it may be nois  but my interpret is that at least this is posit nois    laughter  the big question go forward is whether the lull in activ  as most promin repres in the payrol employ pictur and data on june consumpt  will be transient or whether it portend a much slower pace of econom growth go forward   higher oil and gasolin price  higher steel and copper cost  the rise cost of health care  and requir contribut to underfund retir plan probabl have been the proxim caus of the declin in consumpt and the moder in wage growth and in busi spend   some of these factor have begun to eas off   certain  the three month rate of annual chang in overal measur of inflat  whether for the cpi or pce  have subsid from their first quarter surg  core measur have also pull back to a pace of less than   percent   plus or minus depend on the seri one is look at  strong global demand and geopolit uncertainti in russia and the middl east have driven up oil and other commod cost  especi metal   and oil price seem more like than not to stay high   but product growth remain solid  busi profit are healthi  and markup are higher than trend   fiscal polici remain s ul  and monetari polici accommod is signific as well   so it is not a bad bet that growth at a pace of     percent or better will resum and that inflat pressur will continu to ebb   it   s the bet the  book is make  and it   s the bet we are make in boston as well  though i should say that our gdp forecast  particular as it relat to consumpt in the near term  is a bit less op ist than the  book   s   there are risk to that forecast  to be sure  but i still tend to see the risk as relat balanc  is the current level of polici accommod correct for a u s  economi grow at trend  give or take a bit   as i note earlier  both the  book and our boston forecast expect excess   capac to remain by the end of       and if anyth  the anticip level of excess capac has gotten larger sinc our last meet   but a great deal of uncertainti surround that calcul  relat less uncertainti surround the current stanc of polici   real feder fund rate are negat and will remain so even if we make a move of    basi point today   high accommod polici was appropri as we face the recess and the low probabl event of serious deflat   in my view  such accommod is no longer appropri for the u s  economi even as it experi what i assum is a hiccup on an otherwis solid growth path  thus  i believ that  absent sign of a major prolong slowdown  we should continu to adjust polici gradual upward   i   m not sure where we need to paus along the way or even whether such a paus might be help  but i don   t think that   s the question at this meet

thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the district economi recent  that is  a broad base expans is under way and is continu   labor demand appear to be strengthen   manufactur has been a particular bright spot recent  especi for larger firm that oper and sell intern   we have seen the anticip improv in tourism activ   in talk to contact in the hospit industri  includ some peopl who oper a chain of upscal  upper end hotel around the countri  they say they   ve seen steadi improv throughout the year   final  i would reiter bill pool   s comment about bottleneck in the railroad industri and  for that matter  in other form of transport as well  that is someth that was call to my attent some  e ago  and it appar persist today  as far as the nation economi is concern  there are two issu on my mind   one is energi price   the other is equiti price  although my concern about equiti price is offset at least to a degre by the declin in intermedi  and longer term interest rate that we   ve seen   but the   primari question to me is  have recent develop fundament alter the econom outlook  or put anoth way  would i disagre substanti with the  book forecast   my tentat answer to that question is  no  i wouldn   t   i   m fair comfort with the fundament outlook express there  and for reason that have alreadi been cite here   the expansionari stanc of both monetari and fiscal polici  the persist of a signific advanc in product  and improv economi around the world   all those factor continu to give me some confid that the u s  economi will continu to perform reason well  let me make one further comment about energi price   at least accord to the anecdot that i   ve been get  higher oil and gasolin price seem to be have most what i would call    second order    effect   that is  nobodi is say that they have laid off peopl or end a second shift or someth like that becaus of higher energi price   the effect are all show up in either explicit surcharg or  more implicit  through pass through   so whatev effect those higher price are have are come through those channel
thank you  mr  chairman   the twelfth district economi has expand at a solid pace in recent month   after a paus in june and earli juli  district consum appear to have open their wallet again   spend more on entertain  travel  and a rang of servic  even with higher fuel price  district tourist destin are well book  and industri contact say that they are have a good summer   hous market remain vibrant  but higher materi cost and anticip interest rate increas have begun to temper the pace of new build  on the busi side  firm remain focus on contain cost and improv effici  contact note that almost no decis get made without ask how it will affect product over the next five year or so   after the long declin in the district   s it sector  sign of improv are   emerg   product capac is up  employe are work more hour  and firm have begun to add job   in some area  demand for employe with technic train or experi has risen so sharpli that it is outstrip suppli  and busi are respond by poach from other firm  produc sizabl wage payment in these it focus area   so far  howev  rapid product growth has held unit labor cost in check   improv labor market and rise wage have begun to attract job seeker and  after fall for sever year  labor forc particip has pick up somewhat in mani district state and the fraction of the unemploy that were either new or return entrant has increas   turn to the nation outlook  disappoint data for june and the juli employ report have caus us to revis down our real gdp forecast and have elev our concern about downsid risk to the outlook   recent weak in person consumpt expenditur is particular worrisom   growth in consum spend was probabl affect by weather  a temporari dip in auto sale that was revers in juli  and of cours  higher energi price   but as   mention  standard model es  suggest that the quantit impact of the oil price hike we have seen this year should have depress pce by onli a few tenth of a percent   so  in my view we should therefor consid the possibl  as   did  that other factor may also be at work   for exampl  the level of mortgag refinanc in recent month has plummet  and conceiv   i have no evid to this effect  but conceiv   equiti withdraw for cash out refinanc had provid a greater boost to spend than was common recogn  in addit  the save rate is at a veri low level   consum kept up their spend throughout the recess and recoveri despit onli modest incom growth   with interest rate rise and equiti price declin notabl sinc our last meet  household might tri to get their financ in order and bring the save rate up to more normal level   an altern scenario in the    book suggest that an increas in the save rate to   percentag point higher than the baselin would lower real gdp growth about a percentag point  to a sluggish     percent in        and it would be even less given the revis staff forecast   with consum confid strong and dispos incom like grow at a solid rate  even with weak job growth in juli  i agre that the odd are good that the economi will soon rebound from the late spring and earli summer doldrum  i don   t think we should overreact to a brief lull  but the downsid risk to the committe   s forecast of sustain growth has clear risen  in my opinion  turn to inflat  i   ve been encourag by data from may and june show a moder of core consum inflat   recent eci read also reveal that wage and salari growth remain veri well contain  although overal compens growth has been elev by larg increas in health and pension benefit   on balanc  these develop support the view that the recent run up in inflat main reflect temporari factor   i continu to see larg risk to the inflat outlook on both the upsid and downsid   of cours  we have been  as you have  continu surpris by increas in oil price over the past year or so  and the possibl that this pattern will continu repres an upsid risk for inflat at the same  e that it repres a downsid risk to demand   but a downsid risk for inflat is the except high markup of good price over unit labor cost   and if the adjust to a more normal markup is share in a typic way by good price and labor compens  this could depress inflat by a notic amount  look forward to our polici discuss  the recent moder in core consum inflat coupl with doubt about the robust of the expans suggest to me that we should tighten the stanc of polici at this meet in line with market expect of a    basi point increas in the feder fund rate   go forward  my hope is that we will follow a wait and see approach    adjust the pace at which polici accommod is remov to the ebb and flow of data concern both labor market and inflat develop   in view of the recent weak in the econom data and the downgrad of the forecast  i would favor modifi the final sentenc in our statement to indic that we intend to fulfil our oblig to promot both price stabil and sustain growth
for the nation economi  the under pace of growth seem to have moder sinc our last meet  as have inflat risk   on the assumpt that monetari polici follow rough the path now price into market  we forese a somewhat softer path for the expans than we had in june  with growth move back to a pace modest abov potenti    perhap under   percent   for the balanc of       and for       and the core pce stay just under   percent   we view the risk as rough balanc around this trajectori but with a bit more uncertainti and caution about the growth outlook and somewhat more comfort with the inflat outlook  we are broad comfort with the  book forecast   relat to that forecast and with a slight steeper path to monetari polici  we expect somewhat less growth in consumpt than the  book  somewhat stronger product growth  somewhat weaker employ growth  and somewhat less moder in the core pce  but these differ are relat small   we believ the fundament of the expans remain favor even if the breadth of the recent deceler in spend is somewhat troubl   the product number seem to be hold up quit well  incom growth is reason strong   corpor balanc sheet  profit margin  and cash flow are veri strong   these factor combin with reason good confid number among consum and establish suggest that growth should move back to a level somewhat abov potenti   our   forthcom empir survey  for what it   s worth  show a signific moder in the overal outlook   a greater moder than we   ve seen in the nation survey of busi confid   but the overal number are still at a level that suggest continu expans  and the six month ahead number we look at fell by much less than those relat to the present  the risk to this outlook lie princip in the possibl of a shock that caus a veri larg sustain further rise in energi price  a substanti terrorist event in the unit state  or some abrupt chang in the willing of nonresid to acquir u s  asset   but even without those event  we could still see a new wave of caution induc by the threat of their occurr  by concern that demand may stay soft and employ growth remain weak and errat  or by a further rise in the save rate   in a sens  our forecast requir a modest leap of faith that household and enterpris will look through this latest soft and the increas uncertainti  on inflat  with monetari polici move back to neutral  we   re reason confid that the core pce will stay just below   percent   the recent moder in the data help support this view  but we haven   t had that much confirm of a downward trend yet   this follow what had been a sustain larg  unanticip  and still not well understood rise of under inflat that should give us a bit of humil as we go forward   if monetari polici were not to continu to adjust toward a more neutral posit  then we would face the risk that the elev in near term inflat expect would feed through to a higher rate of under inflat   back to our empir survey for a moment  it may be worth note that the respond report some moder in cost pressur and price power and a more substanti reduct in expect price power six month out  i think it is encourag that market expect about the path of the fed fund rate are prove so respons to the data and that  despit concern that we   ve provid too much assur   about that path  there   s a fair amount of uncertainti reflect in those price in term of how far and how fast we will move   i think it is hard to argu with the path now price in   or to put it differ  given the thicker fog surround the near term outlook  i don   t think we know enough to want to use our statement today to tri to induc a chang to that path either by steepen or soften it   nor should we do anyth to alter the presumpt that now exist that we   ll be move toward neutral at an appropri pace and that the pace of that adjust will depend on the data and what they do to our forecast   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet  mani  myself includ  were concern about possibl upsid risk to inflat  even if polici tighten at a measur pace  although the staff forecast for core inflat hasn   t chang materi  i see a number of reason to be less concern about those upsid risk now  despit the further increas in energi price  incom data have shown core inflat to be restrain and labor compens growth to be fair flat  despit rise pension contribut and an expect catch up with past product increas   this should increas our confid in the analysi that suggest that core price increas earlier this year were signific influenc by one  e factor and that appreci slack has been present in labor and product market   inflat expect have been well behav   short term expect and the michigan survey have move lower   the long end survey measur of inflat expect have been virtual constant   the long run inflat compens in the tip market is    basi point below it peak in earli may  which would seem to provid a littl extra assur that  even if rise energi price boost short term inflat expect again  long term expect are like to remain firm anchor   and  final  activ has been softer  and   the output gap has turn out to be larger than anticip  and that should continu to restrain inflat in the futur  smooth through the quarter revis  final sale rose     percentag point less rapid in the first half of the year than was es  in the forecast in late june   the weaken appar was greatest near the end of the period  invest as well as consumpt turn out to grow notic less rapid in the second quarter than had been anticip   the juli employ report rais enough question about the trajectori in the third quarter to caus the staff to write down third quarter growth even further   if the staff is right  the output gap will have close veri littl  if at all  sinc late last year  given the still strong product growth  obvious  rise oil and energi price are play an import role both through the direct import tax effect on domest person incom and profit and by elev uncertainti about the futur   those effect are probabl be accentu by the persist of the higher price and the substanti upward revis to price in more distant month   with inflat expect anchor  rise oil price seem like to affect output more than inflat   that is the interpret that the financi market have put on recent oil price increas  and those increas have tend to be associ with decreas in intermedi term interest rate   nonetheless  it is hard to believ that oil price account for all of the shortfal in output relat to expect and the appar inabl of fiscal and financi s ulus to close the output gap  and it   s not just that model or rule of thumb don   t see that larg an impact   we don   t see the sort of develop  such as the drop in consum confid we saw in       that in the past have been associ with an outsiz respons to oil price   moreov  foreign economi don   t seem to have been affect veri much   i recogn that mani foreign economi are less energi depend than we are   some of them are energi export   but if higher energi price are   damp demand  i still would expect to see some imprint on industri economi  and es  of their growth in the first half of the year have been mark up over the intermeet period  perhap the upward movement in interest rate this spring is have an outsiz but temporari effect  come as it did after such a long period of veri low rate  which encourag peopl to acceler spend   and uncertainti certain has risen on mani front in addit to the energi market   it will be interest to get a read this friday in the michigan survey as to whether terror alert and difficult domest and intern polit situat are take their toll on sen ent   but interest rate have come down   higher level of uncertainti about energi price ought to be primarili affect the level of output  not so much it growth rate  unless oil price or uncertainti rise further  i think the greatest downsid risk to growth is the behavior of the household sector  and the worrisom signal there is the jump in the save rate in the second quarter   a gentl upward inclin in this rate would be consist with good econom perform in the near term as well as over the longer run  as invest and govern spend strengthen   but we are unlik to have enough strength in those other sector if save rise more rapid   the risk is that household are undertak a more fundament evalu of the long run prospect for wealth and incom  react not onli to higher interest rate  energi price  and uncertainti but also to persist sluggish in real wage and salari  a less op ist view of futur equiti price  and shortfal and default in defin benefit plan  still  i see a rapid increas in save as a downsid risk rather than the most like outcom  interest rate remain low  and credit is readili avail   this should support expans abov the growth rate of potenti   household and busi still seem confid enough to respond fair normal to these s uli  with busi have postpon enough invest in recent year to   fill in for a modest flatten in the upward trajectori of household spend   and as mani of you have point out  a number of piec of recent data   initi claim  household percept of improv labor market condit  and various survey   are consist with continu good growth in job and output   if i had a better understand of the recent shortfal  howev  i   d have a lot more confid that stronger growth will resum onc energi price level out  on balanc  i think the incom data have left us with less upward risk on inflat  a larger output gap that is probabl close more slowli than most of us anticip  more uncertainti  and puzzl about the strength of the expans   moreov  those uncertainti are skew at least a littl in the direct of the possibl that the gap might close even more gradual  if at all  in the present configur of expect feder reserv action   and that is due onli in part to the possibl of further increas in energi price   all this probabl is not enough to deflect us from the cours of remov polici accommod   but it would argu for an even more measur approach and a great deal of caution and flexibl in how we think about and character in announc and speech what we might do in the futur   a subject i assum we   ll come back to in the next part of the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i normal speak after the break  so i was intend to pass out a chart    let me quick do that   just when it look as though everyth was on track for a gradual tighten of polici  an energi shock seem to have hit the economi  how   this chang our calculus   we   ve talk a lot about oil this morn alreadi  so let me just hit the high point   the spot price for oil has risen from about     a barrel throughout      to     a barrel now   the far futur price  a better indic of whether this price shock is like to be temporari or perman  has risen from it long term averag of about     a barrel throughout         the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix       to about     a barrel now   similar upward movement are occur in the market for natur gas and gasolin   suppli margin in these market have tighten  and market are now much more suscept to further shock in price increas   all thing togeth  this look pretti much like a perman energi price shock  the first question is  how serious are these energi price shock to the macroeconomi  that   s what the chart i   m distribut address   an analyt approach that focus on reduc form correl  an exampl of which is be pass around  show pretti strong effect   sinc       everi upward spike in real oil price has been follow by a recess  though some of the recess seem far deeper than could be account for by oil price alon and there   not seem to be a symmetr effect for downward price shock   but this result is still pretti impress sinc most of the oil price shock have been temporari  at least as measur by the differ between the spot price and far futur price   presum  the macroeconom impact would have been even more power for perman shock  the staff has analyz both temporari and perman shock through structur model simul  these are allud to briefli in the  book this  e and in more depth in the french  horvath  and mauskopf memo we got for the last meet   if we take the far futur price differ of about     a barrel as our measur of the perman price shock  the implicit energi tax come to about     billion   definit not chicken feed   the model work in empir es  effect of price chang and lag on consum and busi and find effect on next year   s unemploy rate of more than    percentag point   say  for an unemploy rate of     to   percent   the effect on core inflat is  …  percentag point and  in what seem to me to be a separ calcul  that on long run aggreg suppli is about     percent   it is often said that the   reduc form effect that i have circul are bigger than the model effect  and that may be so  it   s hard to compar exact  but even these model effect look pretti big to me  if there are extra model effect  that should be consid   one obvious place to look is consum confid   histor there   seem to be a slight correl between oil price spike and drop in consum confid   but whatev the past correl  this chain of event   not seem to be occur now   consum confid is bump along but hasn   t realli drop sinc the oil market worsen   anoth place to look is in busi scrappag of capit equip that has been made uneconom by the assum perman higher price of energi  understand this chain of event involv a high detail analysi of capit use  which i   m not go to give today   but if such a factor were import  it could have either posit or negat effect on invest demand but presum negat effect on employ demand   possibl that is occur now but  frank  if this factor were import  i think we   d hear more about it anecdot than we are   there are other such uncertainti   one that was mention by the chairman this morn relat to the recycl point   but i tentat conclud that none of these extra model effect seem as though it is particular import right now  assum then that the model   have the basic stori right  what should the fed do in general about a perman energi price shock   to me  the op  strategi   again  laid out in the staff memo for last  e   is to keep the real fund rate constant   keep the real fund rate constant impli permit the nomin fund rate to rise on the order of    basi point for a     perman oil shock   compar with the base case of no shock  unemploy would temporarili increas approxim    point and core inflat about the same amount  for about a year  but both would then revert to their initi valu   there  sn   t seem to be much way to improv on this outcom   a suppli shock will forc us to accept some combin of temporarili   higher unemploy and temporarili higher core inflat   but there is a way to make this outcom dramat wors  and that is by not let the fund rate rise  let inflationari expect becom unmoor  and permit the relat price shock to be translat into perman higher inflat   this is the outcom we should tri to avoid at all cost  turn to our present situat  befor we got into this energi price shock  the plan was to let the nomin fund rate rise gradual to equilibrium as the expans proceed   with the ad bumpi of an energi price shock factor in  there is much market commentari that we might have to chang our approach to polici at this meet or the next   while conced that the expans path is like to be much bumpier than we thought becaus of the energi price shock  it is interest to note that the polici strategi for deal with energi price shock is essenti the same as befor   we should let the nomin fund rate rise now  with or without energi price shock  of cours  noth is certain in life  and there is a scenario under which we ought to suspend our polici of gradual rise in rate   this would be the case if two condit were fulfil   if the present weak in aggreg demand were realli persist and if it were in fact due to some caus other than energi   the obvious candid for fulfil those two condit that we   ve heard about this morn is the consum save rate  though there would be other   howev  at this point  i don   t consid either possibl veri like  but obvious we have to keep our eye open   so even though a lot has chang in the last month  i   m still in favor of go with the program   we are like to be in the midst of an energi price shock   these shock are not pretti  and they are like to worsen econom outcom over the next year or two  but they don   t chang what i think we ought to be do   certain at this meet   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the economi appear to have lost some momentum  and unfortun the recent slowdown may be more pronounc than can be account for by the rise in energi price alon   for exampl  we would normal expect household confront with higher energi price to reduc their save in order to smooth the impact of higher energi cost on non energi consumpt   instead  the household save rate has recent risen  hint perhap at a more urgent felt need to rebuild wealth in the face of a flat or declin stock market   likewis  firm appear to be invest less and  especi  hire less than would seem justifi by their order backlog  rais the possibl that the excess busi caution we saw last year is surfac again   some support for the busi caution hypothesi is provid by the es  of second quarter product growth releas this morn       percent in the nonforeign busi sector and     percent in manufactur   which account for a larg part of second quarter growth and suggest that firm are still focus on cut cost  overal  our plan to tighten at a measur pace look pretti good right now   the gradualist approach move us predict toward rate neutral yet leav the economi some breath space and give us some  e to observ econom develop   one complic for polici  note by presid pianalto  has been the diverg this year between core and headlin measur of inflat   the committe tend to focus on the core measur on the ground that they are better indic of the under inflat trend and more like to influenc long term inflat expect   but committe member have also warn that headlin inflat should not be ignor  i would like to report veri briefli on some work i   ve done with the staff that attempt to address the relat import of core and headlin inflat measur as influenc on long term   inflat expect   we did two exercis   first  staff member jeremi rudd and i ran a batteri of regress relat altern measur of expect inflat to current and lag measur of actual inflat   the idea was to determin which measur of inflat have the greatest influenc on inflat expect   our measur of long term inflat expect includ the ten year inflat forecast from a survey of profession forecast and the median expect of inflat five to ten year out in the michigan survey of consum   for comparison  we also look at the short term year ahead inflat expect from the michigan survey   inflat measur whose predict power was test includ the total cpi  core cpi  total pce inflat  core pce inflat  and market base core pce inflat   we examin a varieti of specif and sampl period and use both quarter and month data  as avail   mani detail asid  the regress analysi suggest that core measur of inflat do seem to be better predictor of long term inflat expect  as anticip  although their advantag is not in all case larg  moreov  in the regress analysi  core inflat measur outperform not onli headlin inflat as predictor but also real side indic such as industri product and payrol employ   in contrast  as expect  short term inflat expect are much better predict by headlin inflat rather than by core inflat  the second exercis  done with refet gurkaynak and andrew levin  use high frequenc data from financi market   here we measur long term inflat expect by tip inflat compens at the five to ten year horizon  and we investig how the market base measur respond within the day to various type of macroeconom news announc   consist with both the regress result and market lore  we found again that news about core inflat has a consider greater effect on long horizon inflat compens than   news about headlin inflat   inde  the noncor part of inflat has a zero or even slight negat effect on long    horizon inflat compens   overal  these result provid support for our focus on core inflat measur in make monetari polici  in contrast to the regress analysi  the tip event studi also found that long horizon inflat compens respond strong not onli to inflat indic but also to real variabl  such as the advanc gdp releas  the ism survey  and new home sale   a result consist with recent work by gurkaynak  sack  and swanson at the board and by kliesen and schmid of the st  loui feder reserv bank   further analysi of all these result would be worthwhil  howev  at face valu  the find that long horizon inflat expect appear to respond to short term econom develop  whether real or nomin  rais the possibl that long term inflat expect in the unit state are not as firm anchor as we would like   this bring me back to the current situat  if inflat expect are  inde  imperfect anchor  it is veri import that we continu to demonstr in word and deed our commit to price stabil   i earlier indic my support for continu with our plan to tighten at a measur pace   if the economi continu to weaken  we may find ourselv consid whether slow or stop this process is warrant  i think we would be best advis not to deviat materi from our current plan unless we are fulli persuad that both core inflat and long term inflat expect are well contain   thank you
the economi of the eleventh district continu to improv  although the paus that was appar at the nation level in june was also evid there   we also saw some deceler of price pressur that had built up   we still expect the texa economi to expand over the cours of the year  and our region economist are forecast job growth of around     percent    which is slight below normal and much below normal for a recoveri period   we   ve seen steadi employ growth in texa sinc last decemb   howev  the employ gain have been uneven distribut  and job growth did slow over the second quarter   sinc the upturn began  educ and health servic have seen the biggest employ gain   our manufactur sector continu to shed job  and there has been no job growth in construct   construct employ fell in june  which was the wettest month on record in texa  as we   ve discuss this morn  the persist of high energi cost is an increas concern for mani industri   and along the line that jack mention  in the truck industri we  too  have seen a few sign that higher energi price are be pass on   not so with airlin  howev   they are be squeez by higher fuel cost offset the boost they   ve been get from solid summer traffic   american airlin recent tri to recoup some of it higher fuel cost with a modest fare increas but had to quick withdraw it   the protract bankruptci of some airlin appear to be delay a much need restructur of the industri   high energi price have not prompt ani increas in drill activ in texa  primarili becaus of limit in state prospect   texa  i think  may have been suck dri by now   nor has there been ani increas in intern drill  as most of the oil prospect at present seem to be concentr in polit unstabl region   and also probabl becaus of     s aw downward slope futur   laughter  final  the mexican economi continu to show sign of strong growth   export to the unit state have risen as the recoveri here gain momentum  but domest consumpt also has been grow  help by strong remitt from the unit state  on the nation economi  i was also surpris by last friday   s employ report  and it make me wonder about the durat of the soft patch   i do take some comfort from the huge gain   of the household survey number   even if it is posit nois   from acceler activ in the economi of mani of our trade partner  and from a continu of the recent strength in busi spend on capit equip   that said  what is go on in energi market merit close attent   all the attent that has been given to the recent volatil of spot price may have distract us from the more worrisom long term develop in the futur market  with disturb implic for the possibl durat of higher energi price  higher oil price have alreadi push headlin inflat number to uncomfort level and are have a detriment effect on consum spend   the recent string of disappoint employ report notwithstand  monetari polici remain veri accommod   inflat risk remain skew toward the upsid in my opinion  and a modest increas in the fund rate today seem warrant
thank you  mr  chairman   at the last meet  i express some concern about the uncertain outlook  and unfortun  most of the incom data have verifi those concern   at this meet  i think presid   open by ask the right two question   the first is  are we wit an emerg of anoth period of subpar growth that is like to last for sever quarter  or are we watch a soft patch that in all probabl has come to an end or will do so veri soon   while obvious the answer is not clear  for this purpos i am will to buy into the most recent staff forecast   howev  i must admit that i put much greater weight on the downsid risk than on the upsid risk   i do that even know that some recent anecdot data  some survey data  and even some high frequenc data suggest that perhap thing are turn    so whi do i put greater emphasi on the downsid risk  even against the new downward revis forecast   there are three reason   first  i find that for this entir year the trend in all of the forecast we look at   both those of the staff and those in the privat sector   has been downward  forecast have been confront a great deal of fog and uncertainti and almost everi  e have been forc to revis down their forecast   if one goe back to the januari  book  the most negat scenario call for growth in the first half of      of     percent  and it end up be almost a full percentag point below that  at around     percent   the staff was  i think  close to correct at the begin of the year on the employ call  project an unemploy rate of     percent at the end of the first half  which was not far off   and as we know  the inflat forecast at that  e call for a core pce inflat rate of about   percent  but we   ve had a number of upsid surpris there   on balanc  i   d say that this has been a veri  veri difficult economi to call  and sinc even some of the more negat outcom have turn out to have underst the downsid  i think we still need to put some weight on the downsid risk  the second reason is that  in period when we have a great deal of uncertainti and difficulti in forecast activ  it   s obvious instruct to look at busi signal and at financi market and credit condit  which are all meant to be forward look   on balanc  i think that busi  and consequ market  are indic at least some skeptic regard the consensus forecast of a pickup that may be emerg now or will emerg short  look backward  as we saw in the staff present here at the board on monday  second quarter earn per share did continu to rise  which should be taken as good news   and it was   howev  the bad news is that momentum in earn growth appear to be slow   in the second quarter  the differ in posit surpris and negat surpris was mark smaller than for earlier quarter   in addit  a number of high profil firm provid a more cautious   outlook for further earn growth than investor had been expect   take all of this on board  financi market have becom less posit for   and i think show less foreshadow of   robust growth   everi major domest stock market index has been down from year end      and from the last fomc meet   the drop rang from about    percent to      percent  financ condit suggest some soft as well   as one exampl  real interest rate for moodi   s a rate corpor bond have fallen  depend on how we adjust them  either to      percent if we use the michigan five  to ten year survey or to about     percent if we use the philadelphia fed   s ten year survey   in either case  those are number that we have not seen for about a decad or so   this suggest to me that there is clear slack demand for financ  as compani    invest need have not kept pace with product enhanc cash flow  it is true on the other side that c i lend has move up somewhat  but that seem to be due as much to easier term and condit as it   to rise financ need for account receiv  inventori  and capit expenditur   reflect the weak in consum spend  the growth of consum credit also slow notic in june  although i   ve receiv some anecdot evid from major credit card issuer that suggest that at least revolv credit demand may have increas at a more rapid pace in juli   on balanc  i see all of these financi market and credit indic  while they are not free from contradict  as suggest of some uncertainti that a near term rebound is in train and perhap more consist with a veri extend soft patch   in fact  a longer period of subpar growth  the final reason i have for side more strong with the downsid scenario is that i find the condit requir for a return to more sustain near term and longer term growth not yet convinc in place   first  the forecast turnaround in the near term outlook is driven heavili by the expect that sale of automobil will support higher product in that key industri  and i   note with interest presid     s commentari on the august motor vehicl number  howev  presid   also point out that auto manufactur have an inventori overhang  and it is quit possibl that incent induc sale may not achiev their goal  the staff also point to brisk ip outsid motor vehicl to support the baselin forecast   but i worri that  as has been the case for capac util  much of that increas in ip will be in so call upstream industri that reflect a few special situat and not a broad gaug pickup that is consist with a fulli self reinforc posit dynam in the economi   the inventori situat and earn guidanc from major high tech firm suggest that some caution is inde in order for industri other than automobil  the longer term outlook depend on an increas in the pace of consum spend  which may well be challeng by a number of factor   first  the energi price that consum face may not declin  as assum in the baselin   second  we may see weaker wealth creation  as the rise both in hous price and in equiti wealth slow   third  and this has been address by other  we may have a return to a more normal save rate   and fourth  the effect of prior tax cut are wane  the longer term outlook for busi invest must also be question  to a degre  by the lack of a veri strong respons to date to the partial expens tax provis  which are due to expir at year end   the ongo increas in product gain and the state of the financ gap both suggest that perhap busi are still find opportun to use more fulli the current stock of capit  without invest heavili in new capit   all these downsid concern are onli intensifi by the interact effect among rapid rise energi price  heighten geopolit turmoil  and cautious consum and busi behavior   we have seen often in the past that the macroeconom implic of that combin can be outsid the smooth adjust process that is built into the model    i realiz that i have spent most of my  e discuss growth   obvious  we have a dual mandat in which keep inflat low and stabl is certain the major compon   the upsid risk to inflationari pressur that we fear earlier   seem to be abat   all scenario in the  book recogn this and point to inflat that remain subdu  and at least in my read  market base indic of inflat and inflat expect corrobor that expect  with econom slack if anyth slight increas and with unit labor cost and product still perform well  it seem to me that a signific upsid outbreak of inflat from this level is unlik   final  we also recogn that the impact of oil price has tend to be somewhat asymmetr   so i think those price are unlik to be the major sourc of an inflationari impact as oppos to an output impact  the implic of all this for polici it seem to me are pretti clear   if a so call measur move was proper at the last meet  it is certain proper at this meet   as to futur meet  i know onli that market expect us to paus at some point   it is far too earli to assum that outcom  but i think it is also far too earli to reject the possibl of a paus go forward  obvious  the data will help us to decid   given the uncertainti that we confront  i hope that at this  e we do not limit  either implicit or explicit  our option
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for today   s meet  i survey a major region bank and two larg communiti bank  one in the southeast and one in the midwest  base on those convers  i have both some general and some specif observ   in general  commerci lend activ has increas  although the reason for the borrow is more for acquisit purpos than for capit purchas   when i probe as to whi increas order would not have generat increas demand for capit loan  one of the reason suggest was that  with   excess capac  the increment sale dollar goe larg to the bottom line and as a result improv both profit and debt servic capac   that  along with the exist liquid of corpor america  has meant that the demand for c i loan hasn   t been as strong as we would see in other environ  demand for mortgag to purchas both new and exist hous remain strong  but one notabl chang in the mortgag market is that there is a flatten of demand for home equiti loan  which i think dovetail with what presid   suggest   given the eas with which homeown can acquir a home equiti loan and the minim cost and oblig that goe with the acquisit  the implic is that the avail of home equiti as collater may have reach a satur point    particular the increas in home equiti result from rise valuat   the other across the board chang i note is that bank appar are cut back on  or at least look much more care at  their commerci real estat lend  in a more specif sens  one of the more interest anecdot came from a banker who is also a director of a major gasolin retail   he said that this compani had found that a price of       per gallon at the pump is the point at which they see a flatten  if not a cutback  in gasolin purchas   in their judgment        is the point at which the price of gasolin trigger chang in drive pattern   for their purpos  of cours  they are look at the elast of demand  so they don   t go beyond that   for our purpos  the question might be whether or not that chang would also suggest a broader chang in consum behavior   but it was interest that that was the cut line they found in their analysi of same store sale   i   m start to hear for the first  e a littl concern among my bank contact about what may be an over extens in consum lend   there was heighten concern about the number of bankruptci and just a slight indic that there might be some soft in that market    overal  i would say that bank activ   not reflect the current soft that we   ve seen elsewher   on the other hand  the inform i   ve receiv over the two year that i   ve been do this kind of survey has often lag the indic we get from other sourc   that would suggest some limit in sight on the consum side that may in turn point to the need for caution  but it would not seem to suggest that we should alter our monetari polici direct at this point   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   mani of you have alreadi talk about this soft patch that we   re go through  and as i prepar my note for today my main concern was how long this soft patch is actual go to last   as presid guynn said earlier  the consum realli has kept the economi move through this overal busi expans  in term of get it back on the right path   one of the question today is what is happen to the consum   i am concern about the soft retail sale we   ve seen in the last few month  though obvious the slow is from elev level   i   m hear  too  that it   s not just energi price that are a concern for consum but food price as well   a coupl of retail mention to me that when the price of a gallon of milk and a gallon of gas both go up  it rais question about how much peopl have left for discretionari spend   if those price start to moder and level off  then we may have reach the end of this soft spot  home sale  which probabl are the most bullish indic of real intent  continu to be veri strong  though   while such sale have plateau  they   ve done so at record level  the purchas of a home is clear a long term commit  and the hous market indic a degre of op  that isn   t evid in the retail sale sector   so base on that  i feel more op ist that the economi will get through this soft patch in the next few month    one other comment that i heard from some retail was a remind to me to be care when i look at year over year comparison of sale in the third quarter   last year  consum were get tax rebat check  and they went out and spent those fund  especi on lower end type of retail sale   so we need to be mind of that unusu boost to sale a year ago  the job number  as mani of you have indic alreadi  clear creat a lot of confus when they came out on friday   that made two veri weak employ report in a row  especi with the revis factor in   as we   ve alway said  these data can be volatil   and if we look at other indic of job  we have differ signal   as was discuss in our board meet ye day  initi claim are fair stabl  which suggest that it   s new job that are not be creat  but the household survey point to more op  on the part of household becaus it indic substanti growth in employ  and usual if the labor forc is grow  that   s anoth signal of consum op    so  again  we have mix inform about what is happen in the employ data  the inflat number  i find  also have moder in the last coupl of month from the veri rapid rate that we saw in the first half  whether we look at the total inflat or the core inflat measur that we use   so both of these factor   the like reason for the soft patch and the moder of inflat   make me want to stay with the    measur pace    languag that we have in our latest statement   and given that the data sinc our last meet have clear provid some surpris  i want to reemphas that our commit to remov polici accommod at a measur pace is depend on the data as they evolv
thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district economi expand at a somewhat slower pace in juli  as manufactur and retail sale soften but servic strengthen    in manufactur  our diffus index for shipment  just releas today  fell last month but remain in posit territori   the manufactur employ index was also in the posit rang  consist with anecdot report from the  ina  where much of our manufactur industri is concentr   job loss due to plant close in textil and furnitur continu but have been offset recent by job gain at new plant and plant expans in other manufactur industri   our new order index for manufactur pick up in juli  though  suggest some improv ahead   and manufactur tell us that price paid acceler in juli  they complain about price increas for raw materi  particular for steel and copper  turn to our index for servic firm  revenu was strong posit again in juli  indic continu strong growth in the fifth district servic sector in recent week   in contrast  our survey indic that retail sale revenu slow  and mani store manag are report slack sale   a senior offic at a larg bank in our district report strong demand for credit in the midlevel corpor market and posit consum credit qualiti trend   contact in the d c  area note that the commerci real estat market here has gone from    good to white hot      an execut at a nation media compani report extrem strong tv ad revenu for the first half of the year  even exclud polit advertis  which is veri strong this year   last week  though  she report a paus in forward momentum for the third quarter  but she said that the industri remain op ist for the fourth quarter  turn to the nation economi  i was disappoint  too  by the weak in the payrol employ report   those data  along with the soft in consum spend  have elev my concern about the downsid risk go forward   at this point  though  i share the  book   s view that these negat develop are like to be revers befor too long  for reason that mani peopl have gone into around the tabl and i won   t repeat here   moreov  the chang in the   corpor profit number due to the annual nipa revis suggest that markup are less elev than we onc thought   as a result  the risk of disinfl due to a more rapid than expect declin in markup now seem lower  furthermor  the moder in core inflat measur of late suggest a diminish risk of a protract rise in inflat   consum inflat has continu to increas  given higher food and energi price  but the fact that inflat expect have fallen somewhat sinc the spring  in spite of the rise in overal inflat  support the view that inflat will remain contain   all in all  i think there   s good reason to believ that the economi will work through this difficult period and move toward a balanc expans in product and labor market with stabl price  on the whole  i still think the most danger risk that we   ve face so far this year has been the apprehens of financi market about the fed   s fall behind in rais the fund rate   i believ the committe was correct last spring to keep financi market calm by communic it intent to lift the fund rate target this year and next   that messag show market that we recogn the risk of inflat and that we would give appropri prioriti to price stabil   i also think that our follow through in rais the fund rate in june and in indic our intent to take anoth step today were necessari to sustain the credibl of that commit  it was alway possibl that we might receiv some disappoint data after we began rais the fund rate  and it turn out we did  but i think we should follow through today for sever reason   first  the market has alreadi eas polici for us by reduc the speed at which it expect us to rais the fund rate   second  not to follow through would risk undermin the credibl against inflat we have been work to maintain   given that credibl  we can alway eas polici quick and substanti   should the weak in the economi develop into someth   more serious   by signal our intent to draw out the pace of the fund rate increas   thank you

the  e of it polici tighten   as shown by the black and blue dash line in the bottom right hand panel  the differ between yield on nomin and index treasuri secur suggest that inflat expect in financi market have revers cours over the past few month  declin signific from their recent peak  while the solid red line indic that household    longer term inflat expect have remain fair stabl at a level just under   percent   at the same  e  though  the committe might find the persist relat high level of inflat expect to be troubl and one of a number of factor that inclin it toward the continu tighten of polici at this meet that is discuss in exhibit     with the econom expans now appar well establish  even if it pace is somewhat below earlier expect  the committe may still believ that the domin polici consider is the need to reduc the exist degre of monetari accommod   as shown by the solid line in the top panel  the real feder fund rate is not onli low but negat  and it has edg down on balanc over the past year as inflat has increas   moreov  it is notic below even the lower edg of a rang of es  of it equilibrium valu   the    basi point firm of altern b would move the real rate toward zero  wherea a    basi point action   would leav it at about zero and just within the rang of es  of it equilibrium  in addit  as shown in the middl panel  a firm would be consist with result from a rang of monetari polici rule that are report in each bluebook   as indic in the bottom left hand panel  the committe may be attract to the    basi point increas in the fund rate at this meet of altern c if it is especi concern about the high accommod postur of monetari polici impli by a negat real feder fund rate   the committe might also feel that the staff has read too much into the recent run of weak econom indic   by mani measur  financi condit remain quit support of growth  and the committe may judg that it is just a matter of  e befor veri low real rate of interest  if maintain much longer  show through in acceler econom growth and  possibl  higher inflationari expect and actual inflat   in view of the spate of soft indic  though  the committe may judg that the    basi point firm of altern b is appropri for this meet   as note previous  inflat expect  for now  appear to be well contain   and while the committe may feel that the exist degre of monetari accommod need to be reduc over  e  it may also believ that incom data have tend to confirm it previous judgment that polici can be tighten at a measur pace   assum a gradual tighten of polici  the staff forecast a moder econom rebound  persist resourc slack  and a resumpt next year of some net downward pressur on core inflat   moreov  market particip have come to believ that polici will be firm at a gradual pace  and a larger move at this  e would like prompt a sharp adjust in market price and could provok consider uncertainti about the committe   s motiv and intend polici path   should the committe choos to move by    basi point at this meet  the remain issu have to do with the languag of your announc   these issu are address in your final exhibit   the third revis of bluebook tabl     laughter   the second revis  which was circul to the committe ye day  respond further to the weak employ report and in particular to the suggest of sever policymak   this third revis is substant similar to the second  with the chang in word intend primarili to simplifi the languag   as shown in row   and   of altern b  the rational section of this version read as follow     in recent month  output growth has moder and the pace of improv in labor market condit has slow   this soft like owe import to the substanti rise in energi price   the economi nevertheless appear pois to resum a stronger pace of expans go forward   inflat has been somewhat elev this year  though a portion of the rise in price seem to reflect transitori factor     here i ask that you note a slight fourth revis      seem to reflect    rather than    evid reflect    transitori factor   as shown in row   and   under altern b  june   s assess of continu balanc risk to both sustain growth and price stabil would be retain today  togeth with the indic of the committe   s judgment that polici accommod can be remov at a measur pace   certain  both upsid and downsid risk to growth as well as inflat can be identifi  and   recent develop would seem to support a continu belief about proceed at a measur pace   in a memorandum distribut to the committe last week    reinhart discuss altern word that could eventu supplant the current risk assess and facilit the delet of the    measur pace    languag   that word is shown in row   of altern c   in brief  it would separ character the risk to sustain growth and to price stabil   and potenti the overal risk   on the explicit assumpt that the stanc of polici was maintain for sever quarter   in current circumst  with the real fund rate es  to be well below equilibrium  those risk would most like be view as to the upsid   that new word could conceiv be use for a  e simultan with the exist    measur pace    sentenc or be substitut for them immedi   although the committe may see advantag to move to the new formul over  e  one consider in a contempl of adopt it today is that ani chang in the form of the risk assess is  at present  complet unanticip by the market   without the abil in the announc to explain in detail the condit of the forecast exercis in the altern word  yield could back up somewhat if an assess of upsid risk were introduc without warn at this  e   by contrast  it seem like that a choic of altern b today  accompani by an announc that includ an assess of balanc risk  that continu to suggest that polici can be firm at a measur pace  and that took note of the recent moder in growth and in the improv in labor market condit would elicit littl immedi reaction in financi market   that conclud my prepar remark
question for     if not  let me get start   i think one of the problem we run into is that month es  of employ have an except wide potenti varianc   rememb  we   re deal with     million worker  and   percent of that is still a huge number   it is readili ascertain that if we have signific volatil  as we also do in the case of chang in product  we can get some remark statist chang in the employ data without all that much chang in the growth pattern of overal econom activ   and  inde  i suspect that   s part of the problem we are run into  there is  howev  a more general question that we have discuss in the past but that is perhap worthwhil reiter   it relat to what is lack in this recoveri   name  a degre of enthusiasm on the part of the busi communiti to move in advanc of the number and expand   capit spend and hire employe befor they are need in an endeavor to be posit to accommod anticip growth in demand and perhap improv market share at that  e   in the past  anticipatori busi spend was reinforc by the fact that recess were not as shallow as the most recent recess or the one befor that   as a consequ  the current cyclic rebound   not have the momentum that one typic see in an econom upsw  especi in term of an inventori turnaround that feed on itself and induc a degre of aggress activ on the part of the busi communiti   the latter show up in surg in new order  further inventori accumul  increas product  veri signific hire  and a slowdown in output per hour if not in under structur product  what we are see in the data  as has been comment on previous  is a level of capit invest and inventori invest that is fall signific short of cash flow  a high untyp develop   whi that is occur is not all that difficult to hypothes   clear  it stem from the shallow of the recent recess and the limit momentum of the result rebound   but as we can perceiv in detail at the micro level  we are also wit an unusu type of concern that is not classifi as busi op  or pessim   it take the form of a high degre of caution stem from the corpor scandal  the consequ avers to risk take by board of director  and the veri clear rise in the hurdl rate of return in the last coupl of year   we can   t measur that readili on a macro level  but we can do so by listen to corpor execut who say  with some exagger admit  that they spend a disproportion amount of their  e with their general counsel   that mean that when they go into the boardroom for a decis on a capit project  which in the past typic use to be a pro forma activ  there is consider trepid as to whether the final resolut will be that somebodi will ask for the resign of the ceo    now  all this may seem in some degre apocryph  but in one sens it is not   to the extent that we find a good deal more sluggish in this recoveri than can be account for by rise energi price  there have to be other reason asid from the shallow of the recent recess  human concern  if i may put it that way  do explain some of the sluggish   in ani event  what i hear in talk to busi execut is that the absenc of the veri signific surg in busi hire and other spend that we ordinarili see is associ with widespread effort to get the last modicum of effici out of a compani befor a singl new worker is hire   that   s what   s happen   and  clear  this has been an extraordinari period becaus  in all the histori that i can rememb  we have not been through a surg in product of this natur in an environ of consider soft   this make the job number a high unstabl number   it also make it a far less signific indic of econom activ than i think we tend to regard it  we are usual of the view that the employ data releas on the first friday of everi month are the first real indic of econom activ that we see in that month   that was larg true when product growth was     percent and it didn   t vari all that much   inde  the hour figur was as good a proxi for real gdp as we could get   but when we have the wide varianc of output per hour that we have been observ  we have to ask ourselv what  in fact  the employ data contribut to our es  of actual gdp   in a technic sens  the answer is noth   that   s the denomin of the product number   it   s not the numer  if we assum that we alreadi have data on gdp for juli  which we have built up from the product side  would we even advert to the employ figur to determin the gdp number   the onli reason we do it is that we believ product growth is relat stabl   that was the case in the past  but it   s high question whether that   s the case today   what we do know is that what determin the level of consumpt is effect incom  and incom is the mirror imag of the   nomin gdp or of cash flow if you want to put it that way   to be sure  it   matter whether consum expenditur are be made by peopl who are employ or unemploy  but not all that much   the propens to spend out of cash flow is not evid that differ between the employ and the unemploy   therefor  the particular rate of product growth that distribut incom between the employ and the unemploy is not as critic an issu as i think analyst tend to think it ought to be   this mean that it  sn   t matter all that much what employ is   what matter is incom   and incom in and of itself is a function of gdp  now  we obvious use the employ data becaus they are so current  but we use them in the context of the presumpt that for ani particular quarter there is a limit to gdp growth  how we behav with regard to the nth revis of the  book forecast when new employ data becom avail is that much of the chang in employ end up  as inde it should  in the product number and not in the level of gdp   therefor  the emphasi we are put on these month employ chang is misplac in my view  in ani event  there   appear to be some pickup in the data for the third quarter  fragmentari as they are   we clear saw a signific rise in motor vehicl sale in juli   moreov        s contact at some of the motor vehicl compani are report that earli august sale suggest  if anyth  an increas from the signific elev level of light vehicl sale in juli   if that turn out to be the case  we may start to get more widespread spend surpris on the upsid   the latter might not have an immedi effect on gdp  larg becaus they would be offset by inventori reduct  but they would have such an effect down the road   we also have seen chain store sale move up fair consist for the last number of week  the hesit in corpor borrow  which has been associ in part with the excess cash flow of recent quarter  may be come to an end   corpor borrow has clear pick up   in recent week   we   ve seen the largest number in some  e on the issuanc of bond  extens of short term debt  and even equiti offer   as a consequ  what we probabl are observ is a flatten of profit margin  and perhap even some retrench  but clear we are see the begin of the type of pressur consist with the financ gap exhibit in the  book for the fourth quarter   rememb  we are onli about seven week away from the fourth quarter  and someth seem to be in the process of chang  in sum  it strike me that the soft that was veri evid in may and june is difficult to find in the juli number   i must admit that i find initi claim to be an import statist becaus the error rate varianc in those number is veri low   to be sure  the data on new hire implicit in the payrol figur  if you take them at face valu  show a fair pronounc declin in the rate of new hire   that seem odd becaus other data for recent month point to a signific pickup in the turnov of job in that the number of employ peopl who are shift job has gone up quit signific  at least in the household data   that is usual indic of increas confid in the job market   in addit  no one has mention the quit strong consum survey indic that job are becom increas plenti   the confer board   s latest measur show continu strength in that regard   i have a healthi skeptic about the         employ increas in the household data for juli  but if we put june and juli togeth the averag is still quit larg   the varianc  unfortun  is also veri larg   while we have to be cautious about the employ data  the market in my judgment respond far more negat to the releas of the latest number on friday than i thought the under evid warrant  this lead me to what i think polici ought to be  which   if you   ll excus the express   i   ve term    opportunist disaccommod       laughter
it has a nice ring
what that essenti mean is that  given an unbias balanc of risk at this stage  we should be choos to rais rate  and we should endeavor to get back to a neutral polici stanc as quick as we can   the more success we are in do so  the better polici will be   i am a littl concern about leav gap in the  e of our move larg becaus that assum that we can see into the futur with some degre of accuraci   we have been veri fortun with our announc and our guidanc to the market in the last year or so   it   s not someth that we can repeat consist   we will not be abl to make statement that somehow impli that we have great discret on what it is we can choos to do  even as we say we will be guid by the data   the problem is that we may be overwhelm by the data and our polici discret may be complet lost in the process  consequ  the sooner we can get back to neutral  the better posit we will be   we were requir to eas veri aggress to offset the event of      and       and we took the fund rate down to extraordinarili low level with the thought in the back of our mind  and often said around this tabl  that we could alway revers our action   well  revers is not all that easi  that   s the reason whi  when we have a chanc to revers as i think we do in this period  we should take advantag of it   moreov  anyth other than move at everi meet strike me as someth that requir a hurdl of evid greater than usual   i don   t deni that  if we sudden are confront with except weak data or oil price spike to     a barrel and we begin to see some signific weaken in the economi  continu to increas the feder fund rate in the face of such develop would be a riski oper  even though i agre with governor    who said that persist tighten would in general be the appropri cours for polici   i can conceiv of develop that may argu against rais rate further at some point   in my judgment  they would have to be veri signific to stop us from get back to a neutral polici   posit and in a posit to move in either direct   at that point  our balanc of risk assess will truli guid the direct in which we will ul  go  we   ve often discuss that ideal we   d like to be in a posit where  when we move as we did on june    and i hope today  the market respond with a shrug  what that mean is that the adjust process is gradual and   not creat discontinu problem with respect to balanc sheet and asset valu   that is not someth we   re go to be abl to accomplish veri often   i think we are abl to do it in this period  and we should tri as best we can to continu the tighten process until we reach our object   that would be the op  outcom   but i frank don   t anticip that we are go to be abl to wend our way back to neutral  wherev that end up be  without have ani market disrupt as a consequ of move that we make at meet  this is an except difficult thing to do   yet it   s the type of thing we ought to reach for and see whether we can manag it  recogn that if we succeed we should not say     well  we have now solv the problem of monetari polici      all we will have succeed in do is to have work our way out of a veri difficult polici scenario that occur as a consequ of the bubbl economi that emerg in the latter part of the last decad and the subsequ event   therefor  what i   d like to put on the tabl is that we move    basi point and make a statement equival to whatev version is the revis that   was talk about   would somebodi like to comment   presid pool
mr  chairman  i support your recommend complet   i think  as ben put it  that we need to stay on track   the onli suggest i would have in term of the statement is that i think there a number of thing besid energi price that may be respons for what we   re see in the data   i have a whole list of them written down here   therefor  i would strike the sentenc that say    this soft like owe import to the substanti rise in energi price      in   my view there   s a laundri list of thing includ  for exampl  uncertainti about the situat in iraq   of cours  that   s tie up with energi price  but it goe beyond just energi   my onli other comment would be that it wasn   t clear to me from what you said what happen to the languag under the assess of risk in altern a  which add the phrase    and sustain econom growth    at the end of the last sentenc   were you propos to includ that
i would argu against it
okay   i have a prefer for includ it on the ground that  if we get anoth employ report and perhap other data of the sort that we   ve alreadi had  we might want to paus in septemb
there   s noth that prevent us from do that
i understand that   but my prefer would be to condit the market to that possibl and read that as it stand   i don   t feel strong about it  but i   m explain my prefer
well  it   s anoth side  but there is an interest reason for my posit   if we   re go to make the statement that accommod can be remov at a measur pace and then we say     nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need     that is clear relat to price stabil on the upsid   it make no sens to talk about put both price stabil and maximum sustain growth in that particular context   if you   re go to do that  you might as well just take that sentenc out complet   the intern coher of that  in my judgment  is question  in ani event  to be sure  there are lot of differ thing that could be caus the soft  but at least in my judgment  the major one is veri clear energi   not to acknowledg energi as an issu in this statement  with all the event that are go on  suggest that we   re work on a   differ planet than the one on which we live   that is not to say  though  that there aren   t other factor involv   in fact  the word    import    qualifi the role of energi price  the statement  sn   t say they are the    sole    reason for the soft we   re see   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   number one  i support your approach   i agre also with the notion that  at least this  e  we should not fiddl with this statement veri much   we are on track to have a more thorough discuss of the languag in our statement in the near futur  and i think the minor adjust approach is the right decis for this meet  second  i agre with you veri much in that i  too  would be reluct to leav gap in our move toward polici neutral   i think almost method rais the fund rate is the right thing to do  if we do it at some meet and not at other meet  that   s just go to caus a lot of attent  of cours we have to look at the data  but as long as we   re in a posit where the level of the fund rate is so high accommod  in general i would lean toward the method approach of take babi step at each meet unless we get some jar new inform   third  i would keep in the refer to energi price  as my remark indic   i think they are import   in my view you are right that  if we don   t mention them at all  it will look as if we   re vagu out of touch  on the statement itself  you may be right on the employ side   essenti  the way i   m interpret what you say is that you   re critic employ in the first differ sens becaus the        is a number that is es  with error on the base of million of peopl be employ   i still look at employ a lot for output gap purpos  just to see how far the expans has to run   our statement focus on the first differ part of employ  not on the level   mayb we ought to commiss our draft committe to think about a differ way of refer to the employ pictur   i wouldn   t do it this  e  but in general we might want the statement to focus more on level of employ and not so much on recent chang  for the reason   you suggest   that   s one of the thing i   d put on the agenda to deal with in the statement as  e goe on  but for this meet i would go right down the line with altern b
i certain agre that your propos is the right thing to do at this  e   i like your concept of    opportunist disaccommod      i don   t know exact what it mean  but i like that concept   we are in a posit to move now  and a move today will be well understood  it   s well price into the market   it won   t have a big market effect  and it take us in the direct we want to go   you mention toward the end of your remark    go to neutral     wherev that might be   that   s a realli interest question right now   where is neutral   i find the chart in the bluebook  with the wigg shade area that goe up and down again on the es  rang of equilibrium rate of interest  somewhat of a puzzl   i know i need to think about that more  but it  sn   t affect how i feel about the polici decis today   i think a   point increas in the fund rate target is the right thing to do  i don   t know what to do about the statement   i have some sympathi for tri to get out of give the market too much confid about what we   re do   you seem to reflect a bit of concern about that in your question earlier   i   m worri about that becaus i think we need to look at the data as they come in and we need to have some flexibl in how we assess condit move forward   i worri about the market continu believ that it know exact how we   re go to act   but at this stage of the game  mayb it   s okay that the market know what to expect in term of our polici   so i guess i   d go with your recommend on the altern b formul  i certain hope that we can get ourselv to a situat in which     s recommend languag  or someth like it  is where we end our statement   i   d prefer to leav peopl hang a littl as   we go forward and not be quit so confid about what we   re go to do   but for now this approach is good
mr  chairman  i agre complet with your recommend   i think the sooner we get back to neutral  the better off we are  and i agre that we should have a high hurdl for not rais rate at meet while we   re in this period of remov accommod at a measur pace   and i think it   s import not to leav gap in the  e of our polici move  also  i believ it   s import for us to mention energi price in this statement  there is one point that i just want to mention   i agre with the statement as written  but in section   of     s tabl  the rational sentenc say     the economi nevertheless appear pois to resum a stronger pace of expans go forward      that is a littl differ from what we   ve done befor   i agre with the sentenc  but it is forward look  and i don   t think we   ve had forward look sentenc befor in the rational section of the statement   i don   t disagre with it  but i think we should recogn that
well  that thought is implicit   if we don   t believ that  whi are we move the fund rate up    basi point   so  essenti  it is implicit in our action
as i said  i don   t disagre with it  but i think it is differ from what we have been say in the past
oh  absolut  it is   and one of the thing that i think we are find with the statement is that the increas flexibl we have creat for ourselv by work through the phraseolog in the bluebook give us greater latitud to do these statement in way in which each meet is handl idiosyncrat   from an exposit point of view  i think that is essenti
mr  chairman  i might just point out that the sentenc befor that   where we say that a portion of the rise in inflat is transitori   is itself predict   so  it isn   t unpreced to be give some sens of an outlook in the rational part of the statement
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i think we might encount circumst under which we   d want to skip a meet in our measur pace of remov polici accommod   perhap to    undisaccommod       laughter   but i agre with governor   that a moder rise in energi price would not be a rational for do that  that   s a circumst in which it   s import to maintain the anti inflationari dimens of this committe   s polici
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i like the basic strategi of keep the pressur on to tri to get us back to neutral   in answer to presid     s question of where is neutral  my answer has alway been    north of here     so i   d keep go in that direct   neutral may not mean a singl number  and the definit of neutral may not be fix   but as long as we   re move north of where we are current  i think it   s a good idea  on the word  i know four version of this matrix have been hand out   ordinarili  that would be problemat   i think each actual improv the statement   i like the word of the last version and the refer to energi   the way it is pose here actual fit better my way of see the situat  so i   m comfort with the word as it is present
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i think it is appropri that we maintain a high hurdl as we go forward befor skip a beat   i believ this measur   approach is import  as governor bernank said  to maintain the credibl of our commit against inflat   even with a few more soft patch as we go forward  i think that   s go to be the ever present danger in the near term  i also share your opposit to includ the phrase    sustain growth    in the last sentenc  but for a slight differ reason   the way it is word there make it sort of a twin pillar of our oblig   we have move over the last few year to recogn a differ between our desir for price stabil and our desir for sustain growth  and i wouldn   t like that differ to be erod or fuzz up in the public   s mind
mr  chairman  i think we should move toward neutral  and i find the rational for do so as state here pretti good  so i   m fine with that   i would like to leav in the sentenc about energi price becaus energi is the eleph in the room and i think we should acknowledg it   and i don   t think we need to modifi the statement ani further than that   thank you
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i have one question and one observ   i think i got confus in the cours of your exchang with bill pool   is the last phrase under the assess of risk in or out   i thought there was some question about put a period after    need      what is the proposit on the tabl     the word remain as written here  risk
do you mean the veri last statement under    assess of
it read     nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
okay   now for my observ   i may have not follow your discuss about the labor market and how we deal with it   and mayb this is what ned was talk about   as i read the statement  it seem to me that we may have contribut to the emphasi that peopl are put on our judgment about labor market condit by have point to the employ situat in almost all of our recent statement  includ this one   i don   t know how to translat what you said into better word  but mayb i misunderstood what you were say
no  there   s noth wrong with discuss the condit of labor market   it is part of our overal evalu of what is go on in the economi   but the argument that i was make is that we are overemphas the import of employ as an econom activ issu   in other word  one often hear that the purpos of the economi is to creat job   well  everi economi creat job  and the economi that creat them more often than not are subsist economi   where the incent to work in one way or anoth is complet   you don   t have unemploy in subsist economi   so  it is a question of get a notion of the sequenc of event in term of what caus what   that   s the onli issu that i was address
that   s help   thank you  sir
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support the   point increas in the fund rate at this stage   also  i think that the    measur pace    languag and the condit claus have serv us remark well so far   i believ that peopl in the marketplac pretti much understand what we   re tri to do and where we   re go   the question for me was whether we want to expand that last condit phrase   there may be some valu to do it  but i agre that it isn   t   essenti   i don   t think it unduli constrain us   my guess is that we would paus onli if the economi seem to be go substanti off cours
i agre with your propos  includ no diddl with the languag
i agre with your propos  mr  chairman  in all it particular  includ the languag   i think it is most like that econom growth will pick up and that the output gap will begin to close again  and therefor  we should continu with our measur pace of tighten   i do think that i would put a littl more emphasi on the employ data than you seem to be do   i agre that  when product is move around  employ is not a good indic of econom activ
it   s not as good an indic as when product is not move around
right  but it is someth of an indic of whether we   re put peopl back to work   in fact  it   s a veri good indic of that    laughter   and there is slack in the economi  so i wouldn   t ignor it entir   i agre that we need to get back to neutral as soon as we can  but i would say as soon as we can consist with achiev maximum employ  which is a direct in the feder reserv act along with keep price stabl   i agre that the default option is to keep move toward neutral  but my sens is that i   d be a littl more data depend on how fast we can get there than i think you were suggest   the import thing is not so much the current feder fund rate but what peopl in the market expect   it may be that  if econom activ keep soften  we will need to chang expect in the market by skip an action at a   meet at some point   so i agre with the general tenor of what you say  i   m tri to chang it just a bit around the edg
actual  you   re rais the issu that governor   rais  which is the level of employ as distinct from the chang and the level of the unemploy rate   these are other indic and goal of polici   i   m talk main about work off the employ statist in our analyt evalu of how the economi is do as distinct from rais the question of whether full employ  howev we defin it  is a desir goal in the same sens that full util of resourc is a desir goal   i should hope it is  inde  that   s what we are mandat by statut to adher to as a goal   but that is not the first differ question  which i think governor   veri appropri point out   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend for this meet and with your defens of the statement as outlin in altern b   i won   t go into all the issu about energi price  et cetera  to some extent i am both follow governor kohn in sequenc and agre in intellectu approach here   i agre with you that the principl should be a desir to move toward neutral  but i worri about set up a hurdl that is uniform higher now base on noth in particular other than the desir to move to neutral   i do think  as you said at one point  that each meet should be handl idiosyncrat   and to me that mean that we realli have to continu to be driven by the data and forecast   from my perspect  given the unusu natur of the slowdown   the rang of shock that the economi has face and may continu to face and the fact that the forc hold back consist abov potenti growth that will close the output gap are all rather my i to us   i   d be a littl cautious about a willi nilli declar that the hurdl rate for a paus in   remov polici accommod has becom much higher   and as i note in my earlier statement  whether or not we paus at some point has to depend veri much on the data  but i think the market also has given us some signal that a paus would not be complet unexpect  so we shouldn   t worri too much  final  without pile it on  i don   t think it   s appropri for us at this meet just to decid that part of our dual mandat is unimport   i   m not sure we have the right or the author to do that  and i   m not sure that
are we do that
no  i   m not suggest that we are   i   m say that a few member have suggest that perhap we are   but i know you would not toler that    laughter   i am do what a board member should do  which is support the chairman in reinforc the law  peopl have laugh about it  but to me it   s pretti clear that we have to be relat symmetr in our concern about both side of the mandat   thank you
i   m comfort with the statement and with your recommend   i just want to rais a question about your    no surpris    rule   that   s not quit the way you frame it   i   m a littl uncomfort be in a regim where we never surpris
that   s not what i said
no  no  i   m not tri to say that you did
in fact  we purpos surpris the market in januari       we structur our announc so that the market would truli be surpris  as you may recal  by move the date up on when we actual made a move   so i   m not argu that surpris has no   valu   i   m basic say that  if we have to surpris the market  by definit we are behind the curv
well  with that qualif  i   m fine   i just say this becaus we   re in a situat where the market is now price in move of somewhat less than    basi point a meet for the next two quarter  but we want to make sure that we have the capac to move at that pace  if not fa   without creat the risk of advers surpris   we have the tension of that   mayb the data will save us from that problem becaus the market may react to the data by price in a somewhat steeper path than is price in now   but we shouldn   t be in a posit  if on the eve of the next meet we have a somewhat greater distribut of view about the outcom for that meet and there has been some fundament chang in our forecast  where we   re constrain to move anoth    basi point   so i just offer that slight qualif on an extrem version of the no surpris doctrin   i support your recommend
we have on occas run into situat where there was a    percent probabl of our move one way or the other  which meant that no matter what we did  it would be a signific surpris  that has not been the case recent   but i   m not sure we know how to avoid that   governor bie
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  and i do like the word in the third revis version better than that in the previous draft   i think the chang were posit  that   s all i have to say
mr  chairman  i agre with the propos to rais the fund rate    basi point today and the idea that the default go forward should be to continu do this on a regular   schedul   but i agre with governor kohn and   that our decis should be data depend   i am concern about the downsid risk and think that we might need to paus  i prefer to includ sustain growth along with price stabil in the final sentenc   first of all  i believ veri strong that we have a dual mandat  and that languag reflect it   but beyond that we have the sentenc in line   that say     the economi nevertheless appear pois to resum a stronger pace of expans go forward     which is a rather confid statement that we feel we   ll be abl to continu on the path of rais rate   and i think the refer to sustain growth simpli acknowledg that there is a slight downsid risk to that forecast  i understand the desir also to shift back to more formula languag concern risk and away from the kind of explicit statement we   ve had about futur polici  though i person think the latter approach has work quit well   i was struck  howev  by the difficulti of describ the risk as i read the languag in altern c   i dislik the languag in altern c intens  i won   t go into the reason right now   but as governor   mention last  e  the committe has thought about this issu quit thorough and has studi the option  and there are mani problem with the kind of dual risk assess that is shown in altern c   i can   t see go back to that kind of languag easili without a thorough discuss of the problem involv
i happen to agre with you on that   i think it   s a veri difficult issu  and it   s one that   will discuss for a few minut a littl later   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support your recommend for a    basi point increas in the fed fund rate target   and along with other i  too  like this version of the languag better than the origin   i also like the fact that we   re not introduc a lot of chang to   the languag sinc everi word we chang is scrutin in the market   so i am comfort with this propos
would you read the appropri languag  mr  secretari
first  with regard to the direct word  which is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth and output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around     percent     i will also read the sentenc regard the assess of risk  which the committe is also vote on   but befor i get to that  i was ask to note that in box   under altern b   and this  i guess  would be the fourth revis   the end of that sentenc which say    price evid reflect transitori factor    should read    price seem to reflect transitori factor      what i will be read now is the languag shown under june fomc in box   and        the committe perceiv the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil for the next few quarter are rough equal   with under inflat still expect to be relat low  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
