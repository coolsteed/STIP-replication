good morn  everyon   i   d like to point out befor we get start that today is the last fomc meet for gari gillum  who as you may know has been a member of the secretariat for the past fifteen year and is complet forti year of servic in govern  twenti three of them at the board   i was inform veri late in the game that he is the onli economist in the feder reserv with a degre in metallurgi    laughter   and when i think of all of the question i   ve had on metallurgi    laughter   i   m actual not joke   i had this big fat book on the shape and make of steel  it was so larg that if you could lift it  you   d win a prize   and here we had a resourc of which i was never even awar   the feder reserv  i think  is startl in all respect   in ani event  gari  we wish you well in your new endeavor   applaus   if you get back into metallurgi  let me know  the first item on the agenda is the minut   this is usual boilerpl  as somebodi said last night  but it isn   t this morn   we have to discuss a propos addit to the minut  which relat to the special session that we had last even   i call upon presid parri
mr  chairman  with regard to the first sentenc of the propos addit  it seem to me that in the past we   ve refer to the object of fo  econom growth and price stabil as long term   so it would make some sens to stay with languag that refer to our object as be long term
i know our object are for sustain long term econom growth and price stabil  but is either object itself onli long term   i think each goal is ongo      long term    may mean we   re not alway focus on our object but onli in the longer term   is that what you mean
no   i don   t think that   s what we meant in the past when we   ve use that languag   i think we knew that we couldn   t achiev our object in everi instanc  but they were set out as long term object
well  mayb i   m split hair   but an object is by it natur someth that one seek   we   re alway seek long term sustain growth
mr  chairman     long term    could be move to the end of the sentenc
that   s what i   m tri to get at   i   m just be a nitpick
no  that   s fine
there   s languag in the bluebook on page    that we   ve use for a long  e
well  it could be wrong    laughter
there   s someth to be said for consist
but is it a virtu to be consist wrong
the languag in the bluebook on page    under    direct word    is actual broken into two part   the second sentenc start    to further it long run object     which refer to the object specifi in the first sentenc
well  i   m go to appoint a committe to relook at those two sentenc    laughter     anyon disagre with what i just said
well  are you propos to put econom growth and price stabil in the long run at the end of the sentenc or are you propos not to have it at all
i think our ongo  unchang object is to seek long term stabil  defin in term of price and other thing
right  so i think what you   re propos is    a fo  of sustain econom growth and price stabil in the long run     which as presid pool point out is not the languag we   ve use up until now
it   s not standard   i know exact what it is that we want to do   i   m not so sure what the appropri english terminolog is
is    fo     use in the sens that we are tri to creat a movement toward an object  such as in the case of fo  parent
yes   the substant point is that an object is an absolut and invari to the issu of  e   and that object is to seek sustain econom growth over the long run   now  i don   t know what the appropri word
mr  chairman
i could complic thing further by read the feder reserv act   laughter   that say that we should keep long run growth of monetari and credit aggreg commensur with the economi   s long run potenti to increas product so as to promot effect the goal of maximum employ  stabl price  and moder long term interest rate   it  sn   t say to promot those goal over the long run   it just say to promot those goal
no  i admit that there is a problem in the word of the feder reserv act as well
mr  chairman  i would suggest  given this discuss  that we not chang the word
i think for the moment the answer is that we should review it but not chang it here   it  sn   t add to anyth except the level of confus   is that accept   presid
i actual didn   t rais my hand  and i   m certain not go to now   laughter   but i think this is proof posit that edit by nineteen peopl is realli too hard to do   so i   m happi with this  mr  chairman
may i rais my hand in lieu of presid
well  what do you want to do by rais your hand
i know i   m not be veri help   and i agre that we can   t edit as a group   but i have a slight concern with the last sentenc becaus of the word    member recogn that go forward they should consid some chang      i   d like to propos that we say that the committe    may well consid some chang      if we tell the public that we should consid some chang  my expect is that michell   s phone will ring a lot  we   ll be question almost incess on exact what chang we are consid  when we are go to introduc them  and whether we creat anoth subcommitte to look at this
there   s also anoth consider   suppos we conclud that we don   t think ani chang are necessari
right   so i would chang that to    may well consid    becaus we may well do that   we   re a live  vibrant group
anybodi object to that
just on that point  mr  chairman   anoth way of phrase that sentenc would be not to commit to anyth but to say that on an ongo basi we would consid chang   that way it  sn   t appear as if there   s one distinct  e when we   re go to be recommend some chang
michell has given me some word here that may help   it read     nonetheless  member recogn that go forward they could consid chang that might improv the committe   s communic of it assess of the econom situat      it   s the same sort of concept   i don   t have a strong view about the precis word   michell   s word seem absolut fine to me
that seem adequ to you
say it again
michell  would you read it
okay      nonetheless  member recogn that go forward they could consid chang that might improv the committe   s communic of it assess of the econom situat
i think    may    would be better
yes  i think    may    is a littl better
but i rather like presid     s approach that we should be reassess our communic polici as part of our normal procedur   that   s what i read in his suggest word   we talk about a wide rang of possibl last night  and we may not come out with all the chang at onc   i like that approach
i agre with that
whi don   t we say    may from  e to  e consid     which convey that point
yes  sever   that would be good
so it   s michell   s sentenc with    may from  e to  e consid chang     etc
on this same point  i   d like to throw out an option to consid  though i   m not sure that i   m even in favor of it   i think it   s go to becom general known that we   re go to continu our discuss of communic issu in januari   what i worri about is that this paragraph come out in the minut releas on thursday is go to generat a whole lot of question   when are they go to do it   what are they think about   whi is this here
that   s what keep michell employ
i understand that   the question i   d rais is whether we couldn   t diffus some of the sens of immediaci   the expect that we might make some chang at the next meet or some  e relat soon   by simpli say that the committe agre to continu this discuss at it januari meet   that would take the immediaci out of it
well  that may restrict us   we may actual want to make chang befor januari  so i   m not sure your propos is a good idea   look  press question do not strike me as an insurmount barrier for us to move forward in what we   re tri to say on this issu   if there were no question  that would mean peopl were not interest in what we are do   so let   s take it as a posit if they ask a lot of question   let   s use this particular discuss as a definit exampl of whi it is not in fact possibl  as cathi   say  to edit anyth serious with nineteen peopl   the length of this is mayb one twentieth of a communiqu©   it   s scari   let me ask if what we have work out here is accept     anyon want it reread   what is the committe   s wish
yes   could you reread it with roger   s final edit
whi don   t we just read the final sentenc
nonetheless  member recogn that go forward they may from  e to  e consid chang that might improv the committe   s communic of it assess of the econom situat
there   s a general nod of head
that   s a good solut
okay  whi don   t we wrap it up   would somebodi  therefor  like to move approv of the minut
i   ll move approv of the minut
without object   dino  you   re on
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that are on the tabl in front of you   dure the intermeet period  fix incom and equiti price were first driven by grow expect of a strong pickup

even until the general elect that are expect to follow later this fall   turn to page    the treasuri and mortgag market have been grappl with the problem of chronic settlement fail  a subject you   ve heard about in recent week  let me spend a few minut on this issu   as a start point  fail are a routin featur of the landscap and are usual caus by miscommun about the detail of a trade in the confirm and settlement process   typic a fail to deliv is cure after a day or two   the parti that has been fail to has use of it cash an extra day   a fail that last longer than a few day can lead to credit exposur if the price of the secur has move in the interim   for that reason  the sec appli capit charg to age fail   elev and chronic fail have the potenti to diminish liquid in the market if market particip step back from trade becaus of uncertainti about settlement  concern about credit exposur  or concern about the capit that they may need to alloc for age fail   the top panel on the page graph aggreg fail in treasuri and treasuri onli for trade clear through the fix incom clear corpor  or ficc   mani of you will know that organ by it predecessor name  the gscc   although the level of fail vari  it was relat low until may  that level rose sharpli as the short base grew   particular in the ten year on the run   given the backup in yield and the demand to hedg other instrument with the ten year treasuri   typic  dealer will short treasuri and deliv by borrow that secur from custodian and other secur lender  includ the feder reserv   fail have been most concentr in the ten year note matur in may       as shown by the red bar in the top panel   that secur continu to trade consist at the fail rate in the special market   chronic fail in that ten year issu reflect a sizabl short base that has accumul dure it on the run life   the persist of fail reflect  in part  the minim cost of failur in the current interest rate environ and the correspond low incent for holder of that secur to make their suppli avail for lend   although this situat has creat disrupt in the back offic  to date there has been no spillov that we can see into the front offic   recent week have wit reduct in fail in the aggreg and in the may ten year issu   the trend is in the right direct but fail volum remain high by histor standard and continu to be a matter of consider market attent   the tight across the special market has result in a notic increas in borrow from the soma secur lend program  as can be seen in the bottom panel   unfortun  soma   s hold of the may ten year note in particular are meager  at onli      million  prevent the program from provid the relief that it might if our hold were more sizabl   let me turn briefli to the function of the fed fund market dure the blackout in the northeast on august    and      all in all  the fed fund market continu to function reason well for clear purpos  but disrupt to payment flow caus by wire transfer problem at individu institut were a sourc of some disloc  primarili among foreign institut   the top panel on page   graph total fed balanc   as shown by the top red bar  on august    there was some borrow at the discount window  most by one foreign institut that was short at the close of the wire   on friday august    the desk did a larg     billion rp and provid a veri high level of excess reserv   but these reserv had a surpris limit effect on reduc rate pressur in the fund market   again  as it turn out  primarili becaus of a few foreign bank that were experienc system problem that prevent them from make payment   this can be seen in the shade inset of the top panel  which show the distribut of end of day fed balanc between foreign bank in red and all depositori institut in blue   typic foreign bank have virtual no balanc  given that the vast portion of their liabil is nonreserv   on august     howev  foreign bank as a group end up with       billion in fed balanc   more than     billion of that was held by just two moder size foreign branch that were not abl to make payment until late in the day  or not at all  and henc they absorb much of the liquid that the desk inject that day   with that background  it is not surpris that the fund market on friday was elev  but rate never exceed the primari credit rate that day despit all of these problem   two institut did borrow fund in the market at rate abov the primari credit rate on thursday   they paid about     percent for a total of      billion   one was a foreign institut that did not have collater elig for borrow at the discount window  the other was a domest institut that we heard did not want to borrow from the window   perhap more signific for evalu the effect of the new primari credit facil  howev  over    billion was trade in the fund market at   percent on thursday  indic that the primari credit facil was act as a ceil for most institut   final  let me go back to a subject we look at last  e   currenc growth   on which sever committe member had question at the august meet   the bottom panel updat the same chart shown last month and  as indic  currenc growth slow sharpli and sudden this summer   it has shown a bit of a rebound late  howev   i should note that the last bar for august   es  on the chart   has been final  and in that month currenc actual grew at a     percent rate   get back to the reason for the dramat downward shift in currenc growth  it was depress in june and juli becaus of except high foreign reflow on top of weak domest demand   foreign reflow have been fair persist for mani month now from latin american countri  act as a partial offset to domest demand  but this was compound by larg reflow from the middl east despit the currenc shipment to iraq follow the end of the major combat oper there in april  again  that sourc of reflow has abat   in addit  our contact among note dealer in europ suggest that consum in some countri   russia  in particular   are more will to hold domest currenc note   as i mention a littl while ago  domest demand has shown a pickup in august from it recent sluggish pace and seem to have coincid with some sign of strength in consum spend   as a result of the pickup in currenc growth  we have return to the market  purchas secur on an outright basi recent for the first  e sinc mid may   mr  chairman  in this period onc again there were no foreign oper   in fact  this come monday  septemb     will mark exact three year sinc the last u s  intervent in foreign exchang market and will extend what is alreadi for this countri the longest period of non intervent in the float rate era   i will need a vote to approv the desk   s domest oper  and i   d be happi to take ani question
on the chart show the european ten year govern yield  whi are the u k  yield so persist higher than those on the contin
i don   t know that i can give you a singl answer   in part it may be that the general econom perform of the unit kingdom has been better  so real yield are higher  anoth possibl is that becaus there seem to be a    to    basi point differ
it   s a remark stabl spread
yes  and the fact that the unit kingdom has a     percent inflat target wherea the ecb has a target of   percent or less may also account for the differ in yield
i doubt it
i   m offer various explan  you may think of them as a menu from which you can pick the one you like
may i have a choic   the unit kingdom is run a current account deficit   as the u k  economi has outperform the contin  it has come to be a bit like the unit state in worri about it extern situat and it extern deficit   if a risk premium is built into the market for the possibl that the exchang rate will have to depreci  that would push the long term interest rate up
it can   t be the heavi mortgag borrow becaus that   s all float  as i recal
i like     s explan better than your   your may be true  but i don   t
i   m happi to have assist where i can get it
further question   yes
i have a question about your comment on borrow at the window dure the blackout and the one institut that didn   t want to come to the window   do you have a sens that we learn anyth in term of communic to bank about the window   are you comfort that our system work as plan
i   m pretti comfort with the way it work   i   m comfort given that on thursday   and for that matter on friday   we didn   t have a spike beyond   percent for the most part  again except in the limit instanc i cite   and we had a lot of trade that took place at   percent or just below   percent  so the primari credit rate did seem to act as a ceil  obvious  for whatev idiosyncrat reason  some individu institut may have decid either that they couldn   t or didn   t want to come to the window   but that   s just one of those data point that we may have to live with   on the whole  i think the discount facil did it job in cap the fund rate   over  e  as institut get use to the new facil  we hope that the residu stigma on borrow will fade even more
further question   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest open market transact
i   ll move to ratifi the open market transact
without object  they are approv   dave   and    son  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   the data that we have receiv sinc the august  book support our view that an acceler of activ is under way   a pickup in the second half of this year has been a featur of our forecast sinc last januari   but for the first  e we can say that the expect improv in the economi is base on some fact and is not just forecast   if anyth  the data have  on net  been stronger than we had expect   look back  the economi was not so weak in the second quarter as was previous es   and look forward  surpris strong read on privat spend have led us to revis up project growth of real gdp in the second half of this year from   percent to     percent  even the compon of the project step up in activ are rough in line with our stori   consum appear to be spend out of the consider slug of dispos incom that has been deliv through person tax cut  low interest rate are provid support to hous activ  and capit spend is pois to post a second larg quarter increas   the skeptic among you could certain be forgiven for ask     haven   t we heard this befor   is this ani differ from           but there is an import differ   near half the growth of real gdp that we experienc over the first three quarter of      result from effort by firm to stem the rapid liquid of their inventori  improv in the pace of final sale in that period was minim  by contrast  the acceler of activ this year has been more than account for by larger increas in final sale   inde  inventori have been drawn down sharpli as spend has pick up   needless to say  this is a more auspici configur for futur activ than occur in        obvious  the congruenc of recent develop with our long stand forecast of a second half acceler is hearten   but we aren   t declar victori yet   it   s more like be pleas that your luggag has arriv with you on the plane to katmandu for your trip to climb mt  everest   to be sure  the trip is off to a good start  but you probabl shouldn   t conclud yet that you will reach the summit   we are simpli too earli in the process to know whether we are on the front edg of a power expans that will begin to erod the margin of excess product capac that has built up in the economi over the past three year   there are basic four element central to our project that we will achiev and sustain abov trend growth over the next two year   first  monetari and fiscal polici provid a posit impuls to the growth of spend   second  that impuls to spend boost incom  which feed back to more spend through the multipli effect   third  the combin of more spend and higher output rais the demand for capit and  through the acceler effect  boost the growth of invest spend   fourth  as the sign of sustain growth becom more convinc  there is a gradual improv of busi sen ent and some lift of the restraint that we have seen on hire and spend   becaus all these factor oper simultan  no simpl account of these influenc is possibl   but let me offer some impress   as i note earlier  we are see clear sign that fiscal and monetari polici are provid a boost to growth   although the pattern has been choppi  defens spend has contribut import to the growth of real gdp this year   reduct in margin incom tax rate and advanc refund check for the child tax credit no doubt help to explain the strength of consum spend   meanwhil  favor financ condit and improv balanc sheet have support interest sensit outlay in the household and busi sector   but move beyond this polici induc push on spend  the pictur is consider murkier   for exampl  gaug current busi sen ent is not easi  judg from report in the beig book and from our busi contact  the mood seem to have improv margin   in       mani busi peopl said that they simpli didn   t see ani sign of improv in under econom condit  and they were quit emphat in state that the economist were crazi   while i wouldn   t want to endors that particular psychiatr evalu of the profess  i   d have to admit that they were right about busi condit   the preval mood now seem to run between skeptic and guard op   with less outright hostil to the view that condit are improv   still  it is clear that busi remain cautious and are behav accord   inventori are under tight control  and firm have continu to be reluct to add to their payrol   we may  howev  be see some evid of a greater willing to engag in capit spend   real spend on equip and softwar was up about   percent at an annual rate in the second quarter  and the data in hand suggest to us an even stronger    percent gain in the current quarter   this may reflect some brighten of sen ent  but the fundament have been improv as well   in addit to the drop in borrow rate  the partial expens provis is hold down the cost of capit   moreov  busi output  final sale  and cash flow have acceler this year  and that also is like support capit outlay   howev  to move more firm onto a sustain path of abov trend growth  we will eventu need some help from the labor market   in our forecast  as the impetus to incom from tax cut fade  fa  growth of employ and labor incom more than fill the gap  sustain relat rapid growth of consum spend   this part of the process is not yet in evid   the biggest surpris we have experienc over the intermeet period has been the weak of the labor market   privat payrol declin again in august  and initi claim for unemploy insur have edg back up over         dure the past two week   as a consequ  we have push off again the  e at which we expect to see an upturn in hire   one should be care not to exagger the extent to which the multipli process depend on job growth   larg gain in output by definit result in larg gain in incom   to date  those gain are come from fa  growth of labor product and the incom is flow heavili to profit   corpor earn are boost cash flow and like are help to financ some of the increas in capit spend   moreov  heighten corpor profit has provid a lift to equiti price  which in turn support busi spend through a lower cost of capit and household spend through the wealth effect   inde  take all of these channel into account  the propens to spend out of capit incom is onli margin smaller than

product for the next two year   with the upward adjust we made to aggreg suppli exceed those we made to aggreg demand  we are forecast both stronger growth of real gdp and a slight higher output gap than in our august forecast  a gap that is not expect to be elimin by the end of        as you know  current market expect  as well as those of mani profession forecast  are that you will begin to tighten by the middl of next year   in contrast  we have assum that the feder fund rate is held at it current level until the middl of        on the surfac  it might appear that the staff is assum not onli that the punch bowl will be left on the tabl after two year of parti but also that the central bank will be ladl out punch fa  than fratern brother on pledg night  needless to say  that is not how we view our polici assumpt   in our forecast  we expect the pressur on inflat over the next two year as more like to be down than up  and thus there will be littl urgenc to begin the tighten process   the margin of slack in labor and product market is expect to reced onli slowli over the next two year   this reflect both our relat op ist outlook for the growth of potenti output and our forecast that growth of real gdp will slow in       when fiscal polici swing from a posit of consider s ulus to one of slight restraint   slack in labor market should help to keep downward pressur on labor compens   at the same  e  the sustain strong uptrend in structur product should then translat those modest gain in labor compens into minim increas in structur unit labor cost   bar some exogen

this year to about   percent in      and        core inflat edg lower over the next two year  and energi price declin in line with expect embed in current futur price   we believ the risk are comfort balanc around that project   the mean blue chip forecast has an unemploy rate of    percent by the fourth quarter  veri similar to our but with cpi inflat remain at   percent next year   obvious  it is difficult for us to take a firm stand on the wisdom of our forecast relat to that of the blue chip   their   percent cpi forecast is at the upper end of the    percent confid interv around the staff project   so their forecast is clear a credibl one   of cours  i   d also note that the lower end of the    percent confid interv around our forecast includ a small declin in headlin price in

sinc the  book forecast was complet  we have receiv addit data about the u s  extern sector   the figur for juli nomin trade  august price for intern trade good  and second quarter balanc of payment statist   the nomin trade deficit in juli was a bit smaller than we had anticip  main owe to stronger export   we were pleas to be a littl surpris in the posit direct by export  and we read the juli data as consist with our forecast that real export of good and servic will rebound dure the second half of this year after a veri weak perform sinc the fourth quarter of last year   in juli  both export and import of servic continu their recoveri from the contract in spend on travel and relat categori that we saw in the second quarter as a consequ of the war in iraq and then the sar outbreak   all in all  the chang to our forecast suggest by the juli data are small and onli slight alter our view of real net export in the near term   the price of non oil merchandis import and merchandis export both declin margin in august   the declin in the price of natur gas from it previous elev level continu to hold down price for import good   the balanc of payment data for the second quarter were also close to our  book project   privat portfolio inflow remain veri strong in the second quarter  with especi strong demand for treasuri and corpor debt secur   nonetheless  offici inflow pick up from their extraordinari first quarter pace as intervent purchas of dollar increas   the one relat weak spot on the financ front has been direct invest inflow  which have languish with the dearth of merger activ   these data  along with those that becam avail over the intermeet period  increas our confid that the pace of econom activ abroad is acceler and led us to revis upward somewhat our outlook for the second half of this year and for next year   we see foreign financi condit as reflect posit develop across a rang of countri and as contribut to the condit that will support further strengthen of busi and consum spend   stock price move up notic in most foreign countri sinc the august fomc meet  particular in japan and in some emerg market economi   these price increas should eas some financi sector vulner by strengthen the balanc sheet of japanes bank and lessen somewhat problem at pension fund and insur compani abroad   higher share price should lend support to domest demand through household wealth effect and busi willing to invest   yield spread of emerg market sovereign bond narrow as well  reflect an improv access to capit more general in sever of these economi   market particip have interpret the stronger signal of recoveri as impli no likelihood of further monetari eas by the major foreign central bank   for exampl  near term futur curv have price out expect of addit cut that  in some case  were there earlier in the summer   we general agre with this infer and have incorpor into the septemb baselin forecast a prolong period of unchang offici rate   nevertheless  market particip may be expect tighter condit to emerg sooner than we   or the relev central bank   now envis   the bank of japan has taken action with respect to the tenor of some of it discount and repo oper in an effort to reinforc the view that it will not be rais the overnight rate any  soon   although the more op ist tone of financi market is share by some improv in confid read and survey result  hard data on actual product and spend rebound remain limit   some third quarter figur for product in emerg asia are encourag  and we have revis up our forecast for develop asia from     percent to about     percent for the second half of this year  to be honest  that revis reflect in part the fact that second quarter declin in those economi most damag by the sar outbreak exceed our expect and set the stage for a somewhat stronger rebound   the emerg market economi in asia should also benefit from gain in the global high tech sector and from the recoveri project for the u s  economi   they stand to benefit as well from the strength of domest demand in china and from spillov from china to it trade partner  as china has increas becom a sourc of net trade s ulus to it asian trade partner  includ japan   we see the latin american emerg economi  particular mexico  and the other industri countri as pois to recov as well  although less vigor than emerg asia   broad support monetari condit and fiscal s ulus in a few case should support some acceler in domest demand   the strength of activ in the unit state will be particular import for canada and mexico   although we have project onli a gradual acceler in euro area real gdp to rate of about     percent by the second half of next year  we expect euro area domest demand to grow somewhat fa   reach near   percent in      h    overal we see a global recoveri that is somewhat unbalanc  with momentum concentr in the unit state and the asian emerg market economi   but most of the major region of the global economi should benefit from the spillov from these region and from more favor global market condit   of cours  one consequ of relat strong incom growth in the unit state is a further widen of our extern deficit  with the current account deficit on track to reach about     percent of gdp by the end of the forecast period   in addit to the data alreadi mention  sinc the  book was distribut we have learn about some progress with respect to argentina   s negoti with the imf   an agreement was reach and argentina eventu made the payment that was due on septemb    therebi avoid the problem that would have follow from a technic default   the program includ a commit to a primari fiscal surplus of   percent of gdp in      and greater independ in the implement of monetari polici go forward   howev  sever of the contenti issu that had delay the negoti were resolv onli in general term  with specif to be determin later   that conclud our prepar remark   we   ll be happi to take question
i notic that consum spend in the first part of septemb seem to have sag from the august level   we know that motor vehicl sale came off their hyper high of the latter part of last month  and while the data releas this morn on chain store sale are not weak  sale clear slow recent   sinc we have fair explicit feder govern tax adjust day by day through the month of juli and august and into septemb  do we have enough inform at this stage to infer the margin propens to spend from the reduc withhold and the two larg payment  the childcar credit and the refund
i think the answer to that is    no    in the sens that  while we could do a numer calcul  i don   t think it would convinc anybodi that what we were es  was necessarili the margin propens to consum out of those moni
what would you call the relationship between the tax reduct and spend
what we   ve seen  obvious  is a veri signific jump in dispos incom that  as one would expect  was not match fulli by an increas in consum spend of the same magnitud in juli   but just becaus the amount spent of that increas dispos incom was    percent or a bit more  i don   t think we   d say that it is a measur of the margin propens to consum out of those tax cut   as you know  mr  chairman  in the research on the      tax cut and even the tax chang in          there is still some academ controversi regard the propens to consum   we took a stand in      that the tax cut would be spent  i don   t know whether they were or weren   t  but we think the data line up pretti well with our forecast in that period   we took a stand onc again this year that the tax rebat and the addit to dispos incom would show up as increas consum spend  and that has been the case thus far   so we   re take from that experi the belief that the broad construct of our stori is in the right ballpark   some peopl argu that the bulk of the tax check would just go straight into save and would not realli show up as spend   we didn   t think that was go to happen  and we don   t think it has happen   though given the nois in the data  one can   t necessarili be sure
it is true  howev  that the big cash flow effect from the tax cut was in juli and august and not in septemb   is that correct
the rebat check were mail in juli and august
i   m realli rais the question of whether the weaken in sale in septemb is a coincid or possibl a reflect of that phenomenon
i think that would be someth to monitor   the chain store sale have soften a littl  but the indic content of those sale is not huge   you   re right that motor vehicl sale through the first ten day of the month appear to have drop back from the august pace  but they   re stronger than the es  we had written down in this forecast and still seem to us to be suggest quit good number
we were get sale at a      million annual rate in juli  that   s the total of auto and light truck   they were      in the previous coupl of month
right  and we had pencil in        so we   re take that recent higher sale pace as potenti a posit innov to our forecast
so what you   re basic say is that there has to have been a big increas in person save for juli  if i can put it that way  and that obscur whatev effect one can pick up from the tax cut
on the point you   re rais about whether or not the effect of the higher cash flow from the tax cut begin to   out  i think we   re go to have to watch spend care to see   as i indic in my remark  while we don   t realli expect ani signific strength in the labor market to occur until next year  we do expect to go from declin in employ to some small increas by the end of this year
dave  you said one thing about product that puzzl me a littl  you were talk about the appar huge burst in product recent   the argument was that there are some incent to rais product  so firm have been do it   compar now with the late      s  labor was imposs to find   accord to everybodi who came and talk to us   in the late      s   there was a chronic labor shortag   now the revers seem to be true   so it would be a littl puzzl to me if a shortag of worker were the reason product would rise now   one would think product would have risen in the     s  when firm couldn   t find worker and had to make do   now there are worker all over the place   have your peopl thought about this issu at all
there are worker all over the place now   but perhap in the late     s firm were simpli spend a lot to increas their capit stock in order to overcom that labor shortag   invest in comput equip  network equip  and so forth   without fundament reorgan their product process or the way they did busi   the pressur in that period were on expans and sale  so compani may have been more focus on those effort than on use the technolog to reshap their busi process   with the lower opportun cost of undertak more fundament reorgan measur in a period of slack demand such as we   ve had the last coupl of year  it could well be that firm are begin to integr more fulli the technolog they   ve acquir   peopl talk a lot about that happen in the second half of the      s  but mani compani may not actual have been do it   i   m throw out a few hypothes   obvious  there   s still a huge puzzl here about product  and i wouldn   t begin to argu that we fulli understand what has been go on
dave  the  book project that the bond rate will fall as market learn that the economi can grow at abov potenti rate without stoke inflationari pressur   as you note  the es  of structur product growth has been revis up signific  that  of cours  should rais equilibrium real rate   do you think the market will begin to incorpor the higher equilibrium real rate at some point   wouldn   t that counteract the tendenc for bond rate to fall in respons to chang market expect for the fund rate
it would certain work to offset that effect   as we look further down the road beyond the  book horizon  we do see the equilibrium real rate rise in part becaus of the stronger product that we   re project and in part becaus of the deterior in the fiscal situat   over the period of this forecast  we still have an elev equiti premium and some linger weak in total busi fix invest   it   s true that equip spend is pick up  but in our forecast we still have quit weak spend on structur and a relat elev level of the dollar   those thing are work in the opposit direct to hold down the equilibrium real rate over the next few year   so i think you   re right  certain a recognit that the economi is go to grow much fa  in the long term would tend to keep real interest rate high in order to ration current product to meet rise demand   but we don   t think that the surpris  if you will  on the fund rate that will occur if our forecast come to fruition will be larg enough to offset that tendenc for the real rate to rise over the longer term
thank you  mr  chairman   the discrep between the market assumpt and the  book assumpt for the fund rate path is as larg as it has been in a long  e   so i would like to come back to a point that i   ve argu befor  which is that the  book baselin ought to be condit on the market   s expect of the feder fund rate path   i say that becaus the market   s expect is consist with the term structur of interest rate and all sort of other data that are incorpor in the start point  so to speak  for the forecast   use the market assumpt would seem to me also to have the advantag of get the board staff out of the busi of make an assumpt regard the path of the fund rate  which i understand is necessarili awkward   the altern simul could then be built around that market base expect   the staff could say  for exampl  that if one think the committe is go to stay with a lower feder fund rate longer than the market anticip  these are the consequ for the outlook   with perhap symmetr consequ on the other side   in ani event  we current have one of the largest discrep between the market   s view and the  book baselin that we   ve seen for a long  e  there   s also a covari here across the various thing that might happen   i   m guess   just guess   that the reason for the market   s expect could be a stronger baselin outlook for invest   that would be a reason that credit demand would be grow and the economi would be strong  and it would be a logic basi for the expect that the committe would like respond by rais the feder fund rate   i know we   ve talk about this issu befor  we   ve actual had some correspond about it   nevertheless  i would put in a plea for you to reconsid the baselin that you use for the  book assumpt
just to reiter some of the discuss we   ve had on that point  i certain agre with you that my life would be much simpler if i could just pick off that market base fund rate path and plug it into the forecast   but as i think about what has transpir over the last sever year  mani  e that procedur would have had us write down a forecast that i think would have look quit absurd to you   in      and       for exampl  the market kept expect a much sharper turnaround in the fund rate than in fact was consist with our view about the under strength in aggreg spend   so we would have been show a forecast that would have had as it baselin polici assumpt your take action to further rais the unemploy rate and to drive inflat down even lower   one can see that even in the altern simul  which we do includ in the  book  use the market base fund rate  if we had built in the market fund rate path this  e  we would have been suggest   given the rate increas that the market are current anticip to begin in the middl of        that the committe would drive the growth rate of gdp well below it potenti in       that would effect stall out ani improv in the unemploy rate   with the rate at a level we view as consider abov the natur rate   and further drive down inflat   so i   m not sure whether that   s the appropri point of departur for us to take   we think it   s more help to put out our stori and tri to be as transpar as possibl about what we   re assum and then let you decid where the various weak are in our analysi   i   d leav it to the committe to decid which method is better   i don   t think it would be ani more difficult to base the forecast on the market   s expect path for the fund rate   it might be a littl more awkward to write that stori occasion  use polici assumpt that would in essenc be fo  disequilibrium in the economi rather than move over the longer run toward equilibrium  howev  we think   we hope   that we   re put on the tabl someth that is use to your discuss
i   m certain not argu against receiv your best judgment   i   m just say that i think your best judgment would be better display by take the market assumpt as your baselin  then you could show that the consequ go forward are as you suggest in this case and that   s the reason you don   t think the economi is like to evolv that way   i believ that would be an easier way of structur that argument   that would be my prefer
you know  these actual are two separ way of look at a forecast   incident  my recollect is that in      or      the forward fund rate was extrem high   well abov   percent   so that would have been an even more import differenti factor then   there is no doubt that use the approach presid pool is suggest result in a consist between the forecast and the yield curv as it goe out to two year rate  four year rate  and ten year rate   becaus of the anomali of those rate be embodi in intermedi interest rate now  our assumpt that we will keep the fund rate flat for a veri protract period of  e lead one to the conclus of necess that the long term rate have to come down   so we have this odd problem of choos between two path  both of which are uncomfort   i   m uncomfort make a forecast out a year from now about what long term rate are go to do   that   s a loser   s game  i think   but there is the other side  as dave point out  in that there have been fair signific period when the forward feder fund rate was way beyond ani level i ever would have anticip go toward   and inde in the end we didn   t  these are two differ type of way of look at the outlook   in one we have to adjust the long term rate becaus they are inconsist   in the other we get a futur level of short term rate that no one in this room has ani interest in implement   so i don   t think there   s a solut here  and there are argument for both side  i think
i   d just note that i   d be happi to solicit the view of the committe on this point   we   re tri to produc a product that will be help to your discuss   that   s the object of the  book   we like to be right  but what we are realli look for is to have some valu ad in term of the qualiti of your polici discuss   i   m skeptic that make this chang would be a move in that direct  but i   m not stubborn   so if there is a signific sen ent otherwis  we would obvious want to respond to that
histor  the usual issu was whether the staff should make a forecast with an unchang fund rate  give the committe the evalu of what would happen if we didn   t chang anyth   so i think this procedur of do sever separ simul probabl is the onli way out   i   ve notic that nobodi has rais the question in recent meet of hold the fund rate unchang throughout the forecast period to give the committe a sens of where the pressur lie   we decid that that isn   t veri help   in ani case  i think there is no real solut to this  and i   m not sure that it matter all that much so long as we know the premis under the feder fund rate forecast
there would be a way  in principl at least  of get some evid on this   i don   t know how far back in the past we could look at the  book assumpt for the fund rate and compar it systemat with the contemporan market assumpt to see which one turn out to be closer to the way thing evolv   certain  if the evid on that is decis  to me that would help to make the case that at least the baselin outlook should be structur one way rather than the other way   i know that in the earlier  book the assumpt wasn   t display explicit   there was obvious some assumpt there   it may have been more convent  i don   t know   but in principl one could get a handl on which method is like to be more use
in some of the work that we did for you a year and a half ago   i will have to dig it out   we look at that question  and it turn out that the  book assumpt were a littl better than the market forecast   howev  we didn   t want to draw from that the conclus that we do better than the market   first  becaus it was an assumpt and not necessarili a forecast and  second  becaus anyth could happen in a small sampl   but the evid certain wasn   t decis against the  book type assumpt   we can updat that work  although if we updat it for the past year and a half  i think if anyth we   ve been closer than the market in anticip that there was not go to be a need for ani immedi tighten
dave  an element of this forecast that interest me a lot is that  even though you   ve revis upward the output gap  you still have some margin further disinfl go forward   i think i would benefit from a littl more understand of how you arriv at the inflat forecast   i know you look at output gap and labor market gap  and i know the two are relat  but what i   m realli tri to get at is the confid interv around this forecast   in particular  what is the risk of a signific greater disinfl in the context of the way you arriv at this project
use the error pattern of past  book forecast  a    percent confid interv on our inflat forecast for      was rough plus or minus   percentag point   that mean that    percent of the  e the error will be larger   as i indic in my remark  there is a    percent chanc that we   ll get someth at or abov the blue chip   s   percent forecast if our error histori hold go forward   but there is also a    percent chanc that the cpi could be at or below zero in        so the confid interv is wide  and it would includ both headlin inflat that show no deceler and headlin inflat that show consider deceler  now  as to the logic behind our forecast  one of the thing that we talk about a year ago in juli  when we had this convers about phillip curv and gap in output  is just how flat the aggreg suppli curv or the phillip curv has gotten in recent year   in our view  that reflect in part the fact that the committe had done a good job of tie down inflat expect when those expect were move  but it also did not rule out the possibl that structur chang could be occur as well   in period of low inflat  there may be more of a tendenc to commit longer term to price contract and so forth and that might actual flatten out the phillip curv   so with the gap especi larg and diminish over the project period  we still see the pressur as down but not sharpli so   especi in light of veri littl evid that inflat expect are move dramat one way or the other   in fact  i think implicit in our forecast we assum that there actual will be a littl further declin in inflat expect   so we think the chang in inflat is go to be modest but more like to be down than up
mr  chairman  ned   ask a good portion of my question  so i   ll pass now
this is come at the same question we   ve been bounc around here from a littl differ angl   compar with most forecast  you are still right up there with genetski com in term of your growth expect  but you have diminish inflat and less progress on the unemploy side   clear  it seem to me that you have a higher product number embed in your forecast than the market     that fundament differ that we   re talk about here seem to be drive the market   s expect for when we   re go to rais interest rate   i   m wonder when a better share sens of that will occur  if it happen at all  what kind of  e frame do you think we might be work with here
i think you   re absolut right that one of the biggest differ between our forecast and the consensus forecast is a more op ist outlook on aggreg suppli   a number of you  in fact  have remark on how op ist our forecast is   i realli don   t view it as all that op ist becaus the gap is larg and it diminish onli veri slowli  now  we could be wrong about that   but if we   re wrong  our product assumpt  sn   t necessarili mean that we will be wrong signific about the output gap go forward  too   it could veri well be that  if we   re wrong about under product  we   ll see fa  employ growth but also less demand go forward becaus the economi will be generat less potenti incom expect go forward   so to be honest  we think we have the risk reason balanc around our product forecast   but i must say that our statist filter model are chomp at the bit to have us move our forecast higher   our recent pattern of error would suggest the same thing   we thought we had solv this problem  but we   ve been make consist error in underforecast the strength of product
to anybodi who has watch the economi over the last sever decad  it   s hard to say that the forecast is for   percent gdp growth on the one side and an increas output gap  inflat go down  and a need for accommod monetari polici on the other side   there   s someth about it that just  sn   t go togeth
obvious  the first possibl is that we could be wrong
the market could be wrong
the second possibl is that the market and mayb the policymak  too  have to adjust their sight regard what the economi is go to be capabl of do   you can do that onli on the fli   as the chairman indic again  to my chagrin  we realli can   t forecast veri well   it   s not possibl to look veri far ahead   the committe will have to be grope it way toward learn how much of these recent gain in product can persist go forward   whether the level will persist and whether the higher growth rate that we are forecast will persist   but we don   t think there is anyth inconsist between a period of   percent gdp growth and a fund rate that remain at   percent   there is consider slack in the economi   the under growth of the potenti of the economi is relat rapid  but that growth can occur in the context of a declin in the inflat rate   a lot of peopl in the earli     s thought that  onc the economi came out of the recess  inflat was bound to rise to   or   percent   the realiti was that the economi could grow quit rapid in that period becaus so much slack had built up   we know that there are a number of uncertainti and risk surround our forecast   we realiz that you know that as well   so i don   t want to make too strong a case   but the simpl notion is that a pickup in the economi   s growth or even a sustain period of relat strong gain  sn   t necessarili preclud inflat pressur remain diminish
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the roundtabl   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   to begin with the region  our tenth district economi actual has shown further improv sinc our last meet  although district firm remain reluct to hire strong or to spend a lot of money on capit   at the same  e  manufactur activ has expand  retail sale were solid head into the fall  and residenti construct and sale rose to new level   i would also note that we   ve had report that state and local tax revenu are now start to come in abov project  layoff announc for district firm are continu to trend downward  although we haven   t seen a pickup in employ  as i mention   while larg firm we contact indic that they are not plan much in the way of new hire  it is interest that a substanti number of small to midsiz manufactur said that they do expect to add to payrol in the come month   the pictur for capit spend is similar  it   s sluggish overal but with a few sign of a possibl turnaround  especi among small and midsiz firm   this includ a pickup in nonresidenti construct due to some plant expans now be talk about  also  there is some increas interest among manufactur in the new invest tax incent  as for inflat in our area  raw materi price and benefit cost have continu to rise signific   also  in keep with the stronger econom pictur  there has been less evid of price cut on finish good  turn to the nation pictur  i agre with the staff   s assess that the econom forc are in place for a sustain recoveri  with growth abov trend this year and next year the most like outcom   as has been note  we have an accommod monetari polici  s ul fiscal polici  strong product  and a healthi financi system that can support the credit need of busi when those need materi   in addit  econom data releas sinc our june meet have been consist with stronger growth this year and next   more specif  i expect growth over the rest of this year to be at least at the     percent mark   i would note also that i know of more peopl now expect growth to be north of   percent in the third quarter and i   ve seen project here and there of   percent growth  of cours  i am awar that there are downsid risk to the outlook as well   obvious i remain concern  as do other  about foreign econom growth   as the  book note  the foreign outlook has been revis upward  but that   s primarili becaus the forecast for the u s  economi has been revis upward   so to some extent we   re look at one anoth and say that we each should get a better econom outcom  and i think we have to be sensit to that  i   m also concern that while ceo confid is improv  it   s not take off strong   though we   ve seen some increas in capit spend  we do not yet have a clear    self sustain    recoveri  as they say  on the busi fix invest side   without that  we all are concern about the continu or the sustain of the recoveri itself   the largest question mark remain the labor market   i realiz that employ is a lag indic  but the lag seem to be especi long this  e   strong product is affect this situat  obvious  nevertheless  i expect that we will be see an increas in employ  as the  book project  by the end of the year if not befor and then a declin in unemploy begin next year  let me speak veri briefli about the inflat outlook   i expect core inflat to remain relat stabl at it current level  which i think is a good thing   while the output gap may put some downward pressur on inflat  i am cautious about put too much weight on the output gap as a predictor of inflat trend   for one  there   s the issu of level and speed effect and so forth  which i believ dave mention also   in addit  market economist are expect somewhat higher inflat  not lower  and i think that   s becaus they also question the role of the output gap or it chang in determin the cours of inflat   my own view is that the near term inflat risk are about balanc   inflat may move higher or lower but probabl not much in either direct if it   move   given the outlook  i think the risk of an unwelcom declin in inflat   one caus by a collaps in aggreg demand   is in fact neglig   i do recogn  as i note  that with continu strong product growth we could get a reduct in inflat   but i would be hesit to call such a develop an unwelcom event   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc the  e of our last fomc meet  the tone of our district   s meet and much of the recent data have been provid more tangibl evid that econom activ in our region is pick up   this   not reflect an abrupt acceler but rather the cumul effect of posit read sinc late juli   in particular  retail contact were more posit about sale activ  and the manufactur sector has display some welcom sign of improv  despit the recent run up in mortgag rate  singl famili construct and sale in our area remain flat to up slight   we particular attempt to determin from our director and their contact whether the continu strength in hous was sole a pipelin effect that pre date the recent rise in mortgag rate or if it was reflect of continu activ   the sens was that  while there was a bit of a    get it while it last    attitud among borrow  rate were still low and should not depress residenti construct unless they move signific higher  there are still few sign of busi willing to invest except to cut cost   the stori we are hear suggest that firm will continu to constrain invest spend until they are more convinc that the pickup in activ is perman   we also ask our contact about job creation   consist with a reluct to invest  district firm remain extrem cautious about ad job   in florida  busi have continu to squeez more out of less  and some of this was attribut to the abil to better util exist technolog  the other point made by mani of the peopl we talk with was that  while output was increas  they were skeptic that it was due to true increas in under product in the sens that we usual think about product   final  as for inventori invest  our contact suggest that they can make do with less and will not rush to replenish inventori let alon increas inventori to histor ratio even as activ rise   all of this support the view that the acceler ahead could be somewhat more subdu than some anticip  as for the nation outlook  there is littl need to repeat the posit and encourag develop that were well document in the  book   while a signific pickup in gdp is look more and more like  i too remain frustrat by the lack of job creation   that said  my discuss with busi peopl in our district suggest that the loss of manufactur job  for exampl  is structur and not cyclic   most of these job have been lost perman  they will not come back even as demand pick up   restructur is the major explan offer by other type of firm for employ declin   again  i don   t see mani of the job that have been shed come back quick even as the economi improv   for this reason i remain somewhat skeptic about the relat near term and strong pickup in employ that is forecast in the  book   regardless  it   s also the case that further decreas in interest rate will not induc firm to add job becaus expand demand is not there   my sens is that monetari polici remain appropri accommod   fiscal polici is support   and it seem to me that there is less reason to be concern about deflat at the moment   i   m pretti comfort with where we are at the present  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district have improv slight in the five week sinc our last meet   region manufactur output continu to firm   in august our busi outlook survey index of general activ advanc sharpli to      percent  up from     percent in june   in our septemb survey  which is confidenti until thursday  the index will post it fourth consecut posit read  at      percent   down somewhat from august but still clear in posit territori   the index of new order and shipment have improv over the past three month  show strong posit  manufactur employ  on the other hand  has not yet shown an increas   in respons to a special question     percent of the firm report that they have revis up their plan for fourth quarter product over the past sever month  wherea onli    percent have revis down their plan   of those firm expect to increas product in the fourth quarter  most expect a   to    percent rise  after improv in the second quarter  our labor market show a slight weaken at the start of the current quarter   payrol employ in our three state declin slight in juli  and the unemploy rate edg up to     percent  but it remain below the nation averag   retail sale in our region have improv modest in recent month   sale of general merchandis rose in august compar with juli   some merchant indic that they   ve seen a pickup in sale due to the first round of the feder incom tax rebat check   so i found the discuss we had just a moment ago interest   but other say that consum continu to be cautious in their spend  although retail expect the pace of sale to improv in the autumn  they have note the tendenc for consum to delay purchas a product until they feel they realli need it   as a result  retail plan to introduc cold weather merchandis later than usual this year and to keep inventori limit  although the residenti real estat sector in our region is not as strong as a year ago  it continu to perform well  with construct up somewhat from the first quarter   real estat agent and builder indic that sale of new and exist home acceler becaus of the recent upturn in mortgag rate   that goe back to what presid guynn was say   that homebuy appar are tri to make purchas befor rate advanc even further   builder report that they expect sale to remain strong  although some indic that the backlog appear to have peak   in contrast  commerci real estat continu to be soft  and offic vacanc rate remain elev   howev  we   ve seen some pickup in the valu of nonresidenti construct contract in our region in recent month  in summari  the econom outlook for the district is posit  and the region   s busi communiti remain op ist that condit will continu to improv   howev  the rate of expans is expect to be modest  econom condit in the nation have general improv as well sinc our august meet  as sever other have mention here today   the recent releas data lend credenc to the staff forecast that a substanti increas in the pace of econom activ is under way   the data indic that manufactur output is firm  and the order data suggest that busi invest in equip and softwar  after grow in the second quarter  is like to strengthen further   ye day   s industri product report show that factori output continu to rise at least margin   at the same  e  corpor profit are up  which should buoy busi spend   growth in consum spend pick up in the second quarter  and that strength appear to have carri into the current quarter   howev  we must keep in mind that some of the acceler may prove to be temporari  so i found the discuss about the tax rebat check and how they work their way through the system particular relev  the improv in the data has led mani forecast  includ the board staff  to revis up their project for the second half of the year   for the moment  the possibl of substanti deflat appear to have subsid  at least in my opinion   still  most forecast do not expect econom growth to becom strong enough to generat robust job growth until next year   in fact  the labor market remain the economi   s biggest troubl spot   payrol continu to shrink  and new claim for unemploy insur remain near          which point to further employ cut at least in the near term   moreov  the rate of job loss is not slow  instead  firm cut payrol at a fa  pace in juli and august than they did in the second quarter  and the loss in august was relat widespread across sector  i general agre with the  book forecast that the weak in the labor market will continu through the end of the year   howev  the board staff project a strong rebound next year  with payrol rise by over         per month in the first quarter and by         per month in the fourth quarter   i think that may be op ist   nonetheless  i share the view of most forecast that econom growth will strengthen over the next sever quarter   recent data support that project   financi market indic point to such a resurg   in fact  market are now expect polici to tighten sooner  as presid pool indic  than is incorpor in the  book forecast   they may be right   nonetheless  at this point i believ that monetari polici can and should remain accommod for a substanti period of  e  that said  we have to be care onc again about how we couch today   s decis in our press releas   this obvious harken back to ye day   s discuss and what   reinhart refer to as the communic channel   i look forward to see the propos word of the press statement later in the meet   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   ever so gradual  thing seem to be turn around in the first district   to be sure  labor market remain weak  and confid about current condit is uneven   but there is a sens that the region economi may have bottom out  and forward look indic of both busi and consum confid are posit   contact in the busi servic area   it and softwar provid and temporari help firm    report more upbeat condit   ventur capit financ for softwar and internet firm has increas  and the market for this financ has becom competit   sale cycl have shorten  advertis by it firm is up  and the number of softwar compani is rise after a sharp declin over the past sever year  the head of a larg semiconductor manufactur locat in new hampshir comment earlier this year that demand show sign of increas and  absent ani further shock this summer  product would follow   nation data seem to reflect the accuraci of that remark  still  job post remain at record low relat to total posit in the softwar and it industri  indic that job growth in this area is still veri slow   similar  although vacanc rate in major metropolitan and suburban area remain high  contact report that these market have stabil though they may not be grow overal   in fact  more vacant space is expect to come on the market  but some posit absorpt has been regist  and the rate of deterior is slow   obvious  the employ situat has to brighten to signific reduc vacanc rate  and industri contact clear see the current situat as requir a long  slow workout   still the overal sens seem to be more posit  at least compar with recent month  other area of the district   s economi also seem to be come along   residenti real estat sale remain strong  and the price of repeat sale home are rise consider fa  in the region than in the nation as a whole   retail contact were more upbeat than they have been  and after a veri slow  raini midsumm  tourism seem to have pick up in august  bring need incom to mani area in the region   final  new england remain relat more defens industri intens than the rest of the nation despit mani base close and downsiz over the last sever year   each of our district state saw healthi increas in defens contract in       and we expect that to be the case in      as well   this has not halt layoff by defens contractor  the increas in busi is import nonetheless  turn to the nation  i have been pleas to see that the acceler in econom activ we expect at the  e of our last meet is begin to appear in earnest   consum are increas confid and continu to be will to buy big ticket item such as hous and car   busi have begun to spend more  and their laser like focus on cost has prompt a product boom   profit growth has acceler  and analyst are now write up project for the third and fourth quarter rather than write them down   financi market have been posit as well  with narrow credit spread  growth in equiti market  and some flatten of the yield curv   moreov  the extern world seem to be on the mend  though domest demand growth in most of our trade partner remain slow   the major continu issu is the strength of u s  labor market  it must be said  howev  that the pace of this econom acceler is due a lot to the aggress of both monetari and fiscal polici   even with the rise in ten year yield sinc our june meet  mortgag rate continu to be at the low end of decad of experi   the drop off in refinanc activ may simpli be a temporari lull until credit market stabil further and yield retreat  as they have begun to do  tax cut and invest tax credit have buoy both the consum and busi  without tax chang  dispos person incom growth would have been near flat   instead it jump     percent dure the month of juli alon  allow   in my view anyway   both growth in expenditur and a small pickup in the save rate   it   s not clear from either the data or anecdot report that tax credit by themselv are boost busi spend on equip and softwar right now  but certain grow consumpt play a role here   in the high tech world in particular  spend plan seem stronger than they were  though caution is still the byword  that take me to what i believ continu to be the primari challeng face this economi  name an excess of busi caution and uncertainti that bring into question the durabl of the current acceler in growth beyond the come two quarter   will busi increas spend even after consum    incom growth and their desir to spend is no longer bol  by tax cut   will consum continu to spend if labor market prospect don   t brighten  the forecast we   ve done at the boston fed for the period between now and the end of        as we   ve talk about  mani other privat forecast for that period as well   differ a bit from the  book project   the  book see real gdp growth in      at   percent on a q  over q  basi   in boston  our forecast for gdp is a bit abov our es  of potenti  somewher in the upper  s   the  book see consumpt stay particular strong after outsiz increas in feder spend this year and has growth in privat domest final purchas near doubl our project by the second half of next year   this growth in      is stronger than the staff project at our last meet  even despit a forecast   compar  book to  book   of about         fewer job   as dave note  rise equiti market and product growth act not onli to buoy demand but also to increas potenti  result in littl progress in reduc the output gap or increas employ  at least in        not surpris  inflat trend downward   thus  the  book see what could be term veri strong gdp growth  especi in a larg develop countri like our  but in the end excess capac remain until        in our bank   s forecast we reach much the same conclus although on a lower growth path  it seem to me that this is a veri interest  e from a polici perspect   condit are improv   but even with the  book   s op   the improv is not enough to close the output gap for a consider period of  e   if one think the risk are that growth will be slower than in the  book but product will still be healthi  the gap grow even wider  so there is support for remain accommod for some period  as we   ve been say  or mayb becom even more so   but as logic and defens as that approach is  i think it is right to be a bit agnost now that the momentum in the economi seem to have shift  certain the market is agnost about this   i think we need to be humbl  as dave has clear said  about our abil to see out to      and       given this uniqu confluenc of veri high product growth and an increas output gap in the context   at least histor speak   of high demand and high gdp growth  in particular  i take note of the surg in profit growth   absent ani further major corpor govern issu or geopolit event  i think this profit growth could give busi an incent to hire fa  than even the  book is predict   obvious the initi effect would be reduc product but increas employ and a flatten inflationari pattern   so i think there is some balanc out there in term of the possibl   i   m a littl agnost about the growth of potenti that the staff has in it forecast   but i   m also a bit agnost on the issu of whether the output gap will grow as fast as project   in ani event  i think we have some  e to consid the possibl here

thank you  mr  chairman   overal  the data on the district economi and the anecdot that have come in indic that  as usual  it is track quit close with the nation economi   so the region economi is improv   consum spend is strengthen pretti much across the board  and some auto dealer report that this clear will be their best year ever   residenti construct spend remain strong   commerci construct for the most part remain rather soft  and i   d say the leader of the larg commerci construct firm in the district continu to be concern about the outlook  although there has been a pickup of construct activ in some of the midsiz citi in the district   manufactur activ is improv overal  particular for firm that make product relat to hous   there are some sign of improv in employ there as well   although i   d say that overal employ is probabl stabl in the district  there are sign of some net hire under way   perhap the onli reserv i   d note about the sign of improv we   ve seen late is that overal busi attitud still appear to be veri cautious  as far as the nation outlook is concern  the general contour of the  book forecast   name  reason rapid growth over the next two plus year and subdu inflat   seem to me to be fair well ground and justifi at this point   if i have ani reserv about the forecast  it relat to the product employ split   clear there will be a cyclic improv in the labor market at some point   but the gain in employ forecast for a good chunk of next year and into      strike me at this stage as somewhat unlik  in part becaus i think the product improv we   re see is go to prove to be longer live than the  book forecast appar anticip   as far as manufactur is concern  i think that at some point there will be a cyclic improv in employ in that sector as well  but i believ it   s worth bear in mind that manufactur employ in this countri actual peak in      and it hasn   t surpass that peak sinc
thank you  mr  chairman   my wal mart contact was at pain to tell me that busi isn   t as good as it look  same store sale seem better becaus of weak year ago data   wal mart had been anticip a   to   percent gain in august  and the actual increas was     percent   so it was a littl better   but he indic that the under improv  abstract from weak year ago data  was more in the    to    basi point rang   he made a number of specif observ suggest that wal mart   s clientel  at least  continu to suffer a lot from liquid strain   he date the pickup in sale as begin in juli  which he attribut to the cut in incom tax withhold   he didn   t think the child tax rebat check had done veri much for retail sale   when wal mart cash those check for it custom  onli about    percent of the money was be spent at the store   some of it was spent on typic big ticket item   say  a down payment on a tv or someth like that   but surpris  the second most frequent purchas item on their sale ticket was a money order   appar peopl were buy money order in order to pay other bill   that was his interpret   he said that a lot of small item  such as cereal and prepaid phone card and so forth  were also on the sale ticket  my wal mart contact report that survey data suggest that consum are still quit concern about econom issu   in a survey taken in juli          percent of the respond note concern that had someth to do with the economi as oppos to  say  the war on terror   in juli       a higher proport      percent   cite econom worri   in term of the more detail answer  fear of job loss was cite by     percent of the respond in juli      and by      percent in juli       the compar figur for concern about person financi stabil  were      percent and      percent  respect   so these econom concern continu and inde were higher than they had been in the past  my contact also report that peopl are still shop at the open price point   they buy the cheapest item in a line of shirt  for exampl   and focus group inform suggest that peopl are increas shop at what he call the dollar store   moreov  shopper are buy smaller packag of item such as diaper   i don   t know how mani diaper there are in a pack    laughter   i haven   t shop for those for a long  e   but appar peopl are becom more hard press financi  so instead of buy a regular size packag they buy one with few diaper even though the cost per diaper might be higher   they don   t want to make the outlay for the packag that cost more   his general messag in cite these type of anecdot was that a lot of consum are constrain by liquid pressur  my up contact report that noth much has chang   in particular  up is not see  as it some     special charter out of asia where a compani will hire an entir plane to bring in garment  comput equip  leather good  or item like that   on the other hand  my fedex contact said that busi veri clear is pick up   he note that for the first  e in eleven quarter there is now posit growth  year over year  in the domest express busi  and he said that activ in the pipelin is robust   fedex has just finish review inform on     account  and    percent of them are project increas in shipment in the come period   the ground busi is also pick up   he said that he see some sign that custom are rebuild inventori   he use the term    a signific pickup     which is a rather differ messag than the one convey by the other respond i mention   in the truck busi  my contact at j b  hunt report that he see a small but definit pickup      a littl breez in the air    was the way he put it   so thing are look better there as well  let me make just a few other veri brief comment   i want to reinforc a point that jami stewart made about whether the economi is like to stall out if we don   t see employ growth   obvious  we all want to see employ growth   but if employ remain about where it is  let   s say  i don   t understand whi that should lead to the economi stall out   we will have continu incom growth through wage growth   and with product increas we should see veri good profit growth  which should certain support expans of capit spend   i note that money growth as measur by both m  and mzm remain healthi  at about   percent in the last twelv month and    percent in the last six month   so it growth is rise   as i look ahead  it seem  to me anyway  that the  e is eventu go to come when this pervas air of caution is go to give way to a fear of miss the boom   i don   t know how long that transit is go to take  but at some point i think we   re go to see that switch in attitud   in such circumst  the busi environ could chang relat rapid

thank you  mr  chairman   i want to spend most of my  e today on the nation economi   i won   t say veri much about the district becaus not a lot has chang in our region   activ appear to be pick up in sever sector such as textil and apparel  furnitur manufactur in the southern corridor of the district are still lay off peopl   i agre with jack and jami that a lot of the job loss is structur  but i think some of it at this point is probabl still cyclic as well   the comment we hear from our busi contact  as other around this tabl have said about their district  are general more op ist than two or three month ago   but i would character busi peopl as still quit cautious and wari   of cours  speak of wari  we have a hurrican bear down on our district   so we   ll see what that   to us   it may reduc excess capac in the district    laughter
in the boat industri
i was just say that hurrican usual destroy thing and that the reconstruct  when it take place  add to the gdp
that   s right   it probabl will reduc the disinfl pressur on our district   s economi  with respect to the nation economi  to me the most strike featur of the current  book is that  even though the project path of gdp has been revis up   actual fair substanti   in accord with the stronger econom data  the path for potenti gdp has been revis up even more   that impli that the output gap is even greater now than it was at the  e of the august meet   the  book project that aggreg demand growth will acceler from here  overtak the growth of potenti output  and begin to close the gap next year  with onli margin further disinfl   i think that   s a plausibl scenario  and i would agre that it is the most like particular outcom among the array of possibl outcom  but i still believ  as i did at the august meet  that there   s a signific downsid risk in the outlook  especi a risk of greater disinfl or conceiv even deflat go forward   the weak august job report seem to me to highlight the need to remain alert at least to this risk   in this regard  i think it   s help to tri to understand as clear as possibl the process that has produc the disinfl we   ve experienc recent   as we all know  in the mid     s product growth also acceler sharpli and that held down increas in unit labor cost and inflat   but that realli was not disinflationari becaus labor market in that period were tight   consequ  the upward pull of higher product growth on real wage show up to a signific degre as increas competit by firm for worker  and nomin wage increas were reason high in that period   of cours  product growth again is increas strong in the current recoveri  but this  e it   s accompani by veri weak labor market   as a result  the upward pull of rise product on real wage hasn   t led to as much nomin wage growth   instead it has shown up main in increas competit in product market  and actual declin in unit labor cost have been pass along to household through lower price for both good and servic but to a larg extent in price for good  especi manufactur good  for me at least this background is help in understand and appreci the disinfl risk in the period ahead   the  book forecast is predic on the view that firm have been reluct to hire to meet rise demand becaus they   re worri that the expans is not go to be sustain   the  book assum that  as  e pass  firm will becom more confid and that by next year they will be hire at a remark robust rate   at least accord to the project   in this situat  measur product growth goe down from     percent this year to     percent next year despit the upward revis of project structur product growth   with demand forecast to grow   percent next year  the output gap close relat quick   not immedi  but relat quick and steadili   and there   s onli a littl further disinfl   again  i think this is all plausibl  but there   s an altern outcom  which may have a lower probabl  that i would argu is also quit plausibl   in this altern scenario  structur product growth is even higher than in the upward revis project in the  book  which as i recal is     percent for next year   that   s a lot higher than the averag product growth rate over the period between the mid     s and the mid     s  but it   s not terribl differ from the averag rate of product growth in the u s  economi over the last centuri or so   if structur product   turn out to be higher than project and if demand growth in the current subdu   and i would argu  still cautious and distinct nonexuber   economi come in a littl weaker than anticip  the output gap would close more slowli or possibl widen even further  and disinfl could continu or conceiv even acceler   this outcom may have a lower probabl than the  book scenario  but in some contrast to you  tom  i would argu that it would be an unwelcom outcom   so in the spirit of your jackson hole speech  mr  chairman  i think it is a risk that need to be manag care
thank you  mr  chairman   as we   ve been discuss this morn  the staff project contempl a veri good busi environ for the next coupl of year  aggreg demand and real gdp are expect to expand veri rapid  and an amaz   million net new job are creat   the busi fix invest climat improv consider  and by the end of      the economi is produc near it potenti output level and expand at about the same rate as potenti   and  of cours  inflat is even lower than it is today   i think most peopl would be pleas to see that project becom actual experi   i know i would  howev  i   ve been confront almost daili dure this intermeet period with a dichotomi between the economi describ in the  book and the economi as it is character in the report of the busi peopl i talk with in the fourth district   i   ve been hear a rather consist stori dure this period from ceo   mani of whom are head of compani that oper intern   across a wide spectrum of manufactur and servic industri   their stori goe someth like this   we invest heavili in equip and softwar dure the latter half of the     s  and it has taken us a while to figur out how to use all of this in a product manner   we   ve learn that  in addit to put in the new technolog  we have to develop differ busi practic and retrain our employe   which is similar to a comment dave   made this morn   we found out that in the late      s we expand our capac too rapid  and therefor we   re plan to expand more slowli this  e around   at the moment we find that we can generat addit output from our current payrol and capit stock more readili than we thought we could   we need to take step to avoid increas cost  and we don   t have to add to capit as much as we thought  allow for some occasion variat  that   s the stori i hear   so i conclud from my busi contact that they remain guard in their willing to take on new employe and to invest domest   their concern  sn   t appear to be a lack of demand for their product but rather how much risk they   re will to take on to meet that demand   the lack of hire  as we   ve been talk about this morn  is amaz widespread   onli about one third of u s  industri are ad to domest payrol today as compar with near two third of our industri at a compar stage of the so call jobless recoveri of a decad ago  my busi contact are confirm that a great deal of industri restructur is occur  as presid guynn and first vice presid stewart have note   mani firm are continu to reevalu the econom valu of their current employ base and their fix invest as they develop their hire and invest plan for the next year   some of that labor and capit may simpli be less valuabl to them now than they had previous thought to be the case   now  the usual process of realloc physic capit is for the ownership to chang through a sale of the asset without a need to move the build or equip   but the intern steel group  which just acquir asset from both ltv and bethlehem steel  announc that it   s sell two of it quarter mile long strip roll mill to a chines compani and will reloc those mill to china   one news account es  that it   s go to take sever year to dismantl  ship  and reassembl these mill   it   s a transact that provid a vivid illustr of a differ way to realloc resourc that is evolv in this global economi  as i said at the outset  i would welcom the  book baselin project   howev  it   s not the pictur of the outlook that my busi contact are paint   they seem to be harbor a fair amount of uncertainti about the environ in which they   re oper  as mani other have said is the case in their district   if the  book project prove to be accur  it   s go to be fascin to watch the percept and action of these busi peopl as they chang their behavior to converg in the direct of the scenario in the  book   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   presid pianalto highlight the difficulti and problem the economi has encount in work through the excess that built up in the late     s   in my view we   ve had some further evid over the intermeet period that the economi may final be work through these adjust and that  absent further negat shock  it is pois for sustain robust growth under the ad impetus of high s ul fiscal and monetari polici   not onli   the pickup in activ that began in the second quarter look as if it has gather momentum in the third quarter  but also the sourc of the momentum has been a strengthen in privat final demand   as dave note  this is veri differ from earli       when the pickup came import from an abat of inventori runoff   persist reduct in invest sinc      have been the main drag on the economi  and it   s especi encourag to see the pickup under way in order and shipment over a wide rang of capit equip and the eb weak in nonresidenti structur  as mani of you have note  busi are still veri cautious   the astound product number indic that firm continu to find way to expand output without increas either labor or capit   so it   s quit like that much of the invest is for replac and modern  not expans   but the veri fact that busi no longer seem to be stretch out replac cycl and are take step to upgrad capit stock indic their greater comfort that they have work off mani of the excess   it suggest that the capac they have will be need over  e and that they have increas confid about the futur  invest fundament  which have been favor for some  e  are becom even more so   includ the staff forecast for the third quarter  busi have seen two quarter of substanti acceler in output and three quarter of larg increas in profit and cash flow  they have seen an unusu low cost of capit for non high tech equip even after the recent backup in long term rate and an acceler declin in the cost of capit for high tech equip   and this is all befor take into account the temporari expens provis in the tax code   against this background  if busi are more comfort with the present and more confid about the futur  the pickup in invest spend should continu  the shift in attitud is reflect in financi market  and the adjust from the overexuber of the     s also seem larg behind us   yield spread have retrac all the run up sinc        fortun  they have not return to the unsustain low level of the middl     s   the slight posit tilt to earn surpris after a long string of shortfal suggest a more realist set of expect in equiti market   at the same  e  the equiti premium remain unusu wide  indic still cautious price relat to those expect and a lower of the odd that anoth collaps in stock price will undercut household spend  despit the posit prospect for growth  develop on the disinfl front have been more mix   the immedi news has been encourag in that the pace of disinfl has been a bit slower than we might have fear   consum price have turn up   and a bit more than expect   i don   t know if that   s the case in this morn   s cpi report  which was somewhat damp  but at least the previous few read were up   inflat expect have been fall but by some measur are still higher than a few month ago  provid an anchor against substanti decreas in actual inflat  at the same  e  howev  the staff has interpret recent data on product as suggest that the growth of potenti output has been higher and the output gap larger than previous es    so that gap is now like to close more slowli despit a more rapid expans of activ   while precis es  of potenti output need to be taken with a veri larg grain of salt  we do know that employ has continu to fall and that capac util remain stuck at a veri low level   so we can be confid that slack isn   t declin and probabl has increas in recent month   that slack will continu to put some downward pressur on inflat  as it   in the staff forecast   my concern about the level of inflat and it path isn   t so much about the current and the next few quarter   it   s about a longer  e horizon  includ where inflat might be when the economi eventu   approach full util   as presid hoenig note  lower inflat can be consist with rapid growth when product rise quick   but the low inflat and low nomin interest rate will leav the economi and polici with less of a cushion against negat shock in the futur  in this regard  develop over the intermeet period  such as the appar pickup in activ and price  have reliev my concern onli a littl   until wane busi caution togeth with fiscal and monetari eas show through definit to increas in activ that begin to eat into margin of slack  the juri will be out on whether growth is abov the growth rate of potenti   given the uncertainti about the pace of structur product growth  i suspect we will want to see sustain and substanti growth in employ to make this judgment   moreov  the economi will need to grow at a pace in excess of the growth rate of it potenti for a  e befor we can be confid that the risk of further unwelcom disinfl have materi diminish   until we can see this sort of growth firm in prospect  the inadequaci of demand and the associ risk of disinfl should continu to be our primari focus and polici should remain quit accommod   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the key question at this meet is whether the incom data from the real economi  market develop  and ul  the outlook are suffici chang from our last meet to warrant a chang in either our polici or our tactic   i   ll discuss each of these in turn but   not to be my i   have conclud that no midcours correct seem call for at this meet  first  from the data  one see that sign of econom acceler are inde more widespread and probabl firmer than at our last meet  but with some import except  household continu to be the basi of this expans   sale of consum durabl and retail sale in the control categori are both consist with a grow economi   this is import becaus mani had thought that the household sector might eventu falter   in that regard  i do take note of the convers that dave   and the chairman had with respect to question about the impact of the recent tax cut   but given the basic strength of the economi  i also believ that we   re like to see increas in incom that will be suffici to support the expans go forward  howev  the import question has been when  if at all  the handoff will take place between household and the busi sector   i would say at this stage that the household sector still is the bulwark  but busi may be in the initi stage of pick up their portion of the burden   order and shipment for capit good have firm  and anecdot report and survey have both becom a bit more upbeat   howev  thus far the particip of busi in the turnaround is veri uneven   anecdot evid suggest that we   re see onli replac invest and not yet expans   similar  busi invest in inventori has yet to pick up  and one is hard press  i think  to support the notion that all the drag from inventori is due to improv in suppli chain manag and some perman lower of the desir inventori   sale ratio   i believ that busi still face some linger uncertainti about sale that seem to be weigh on their decis with respect to rebuild inventori  final  and alreadi much discuss  labor market condit are clear not consist with the kind of well establish firm of activ that our economi has experienc tradit   of cours  the issu in this regard is that labor market condit may be like to firm onli slowli in this environ of improv structur product and that the past may not necessarili be prologu  so if the data indic ongo but still uneven firm  what can we take from the financi market   i conclud that financi market are certain support of a continu and more rapid expans of the u s  economi   sever indic   includ bond issuanc  flow to mutual fund  risk spread  price of credit default swap  and valuat of high tech stock   indic that risk appetit have increas somewhat   addit  the much discuss backup in long rate   not seem to be a limit factor in the turnaround   inde  i think it is realli more a signal of an expect of a turnaround   howev  the absenc of truli robust expans plan on the part of busi is clear seen in the relat lax demand for c i loan   the commentari from bank sector contact such as fac member indic that  at most  banker expect onli demand for replac invest and not expans just yet   as with the data on the real economi  therefor  i think the financi market are paint a pictur of an improv but still uneven econom backdrop and outlook  final  let me turn to the outlook itself   i have no strong quibbl with the baselin forecast   howev  i note   as did presid broaddus in the q a session after the staff report   that sinc the previous  book the staff has mark up real gdp growth for the forecast period while also mark up the unemploy rate for the next five quarter   at the same  e  they   ve left the inflat rate basic unchang or actual down slight  this clear is a reflect of the fact that they have taken some of the product surpris into structur product increas   i also note  howev  that the output gap remain an import element of this forecast into       suggest to me at least that deflationari pressur have not lessen and are not like to do so quick  while i have no major quibbl with the staff forecast per se  i must say that i do see some risk on both side with respect to the growth outlook   first  as i think a few other have mention  there   s the fact that our staff   s forecast seem to be somewhat abov the blue chip forecast but still below the most op ist of the outsid forecast   i think we should give at least some weight to the view of those more op ist individu   but i   d also observ that there might be some downsid risk around the staff   s current forecast   first  i fear that the inventori   sale stori is not fulli understood and that the ratio of inventori to sale might not be as out of line with busi desir as the staff seem to think   if that   s the case  the bounceback in inventori might not be as strong as in the baselin   i also have some concern that the fix invest stori  which depend veri much on the so call lift of gloom that also play an import part in the equip and softwar stori  might not emerg as quick as the staff assum   this issu obvious should be resolv in the near term becaus we   re in the period when busi are plan their budget for next year  so we should have some better sens of equip and softwar plan by the  e we meet again   given that configur  this seem to me to be a good  e  as i said in my open remark  to maintain as unchang a polici postur as possibl
thank you  mr  chairman   as far as spend demand go  everyth look good   the recoveri seem to be proceed in a healthi and balanc manner  consumpt has continu to be strong  person save rate have been fair steadi at around   percent  hous is strong   although it will be clip some by the rise in mortgag rate    invest in equip and softwar has final start to move  foreign economi and export are recov  and inventori are lean   we all know what   s go on with feder govern spend   virtual everi forecast seem to be revis upward these day  and near all of the forecast project healthi growth rate for the next year or so  so what   s our problem   two that i   ve worri about for the long run are the persist current account deficit and the grow budget deficit   both in their separ way could sever burden or disloc the economi down the road   but in the short run  the biggest puzzl is the strang perform of employ   there has been much press commentari that  of cours  employ is a lag indic   in fact  that   s not true   until the     s  employ was consid a coincid indic  and by normal postwar standard  employ growth should have turn up sever quarter ago   employ did lag output in the recoveri of the earli     s but not by near as much as today  as the evid that sandi gave earlier support  as long as employ   lag  we can   t fulli rest easi   lag employ could threaten the sustain of consumpt  though as mani of you point out  that argument is debat  what i think is less debat is that the impli output gap could also pull inflat down below our target rang    the proverbi unwelcom fall in inflat  there   s both an op ist and a pessimist explan for this unusu behavior of employ   the op ist explan  which is more or less implicit in what most of you have said today  is that the lag reflect a huge burst in product  which will benefit the economi great down the road   the displac worker will get back to work  output will rise  and trend rate of product and econom growth should be higher  a potenti more pessimist explan has been featur recent in a j p morgan newslett   the explan focus on high and rise labor cost   basic  real wage rate have grown at near normal rate  but benefit cost for health and retir program   notabl includ payment to reduc the huge actuari deficit that have sprung up in mani firm defin benefit program   have been rise sharpli in real term   coupl with the general high level of the dollar  labor cost have also risen signific relat to those of our trade partner in tradabl good sector   these rise in labor cost have damp hire and have in effect induc the high level of labor product   if one look at the pictur this way  the forc rise in product may not translat to such higher futur product growth   but that   s exact what i ask dave earlier  and he gave a more op ist answer on that issu   some data from recent articl by staff member at both the new york and the kansa citi feder reserv bank shed some light on this issu   the author find that  in contrast to earlier recess  a larg share of the employ chang in this recess is structur not cyclic  temporari layoff were not high in the downturn  and job loss from nontemporari layoff are high now   new hire is sluggish  and longer term unemploy is still rise this late in the recoveri period  i person don   t know how much weight to put on this pessimist interpret   at this point all we can realli say is that hire hasn   t pick up yet   the weight of past evid and virtual all forecast  includ our own  are predict strong employ gain throughout        in this sens the smart money   seem to be on the fact that the so call jobless recoveri of      will eventu becom a fleet phenomenon   but central banker are paid to worri  and persist employ reduct in the context of strong output gain do provid at least one thing to worri about   is there someth differ about this recoveri   how long will hire remain sluggish   will this sluggish hire eventu translat to a rise in nairu   what   it realli mean for product in the long run   this set of worri can tide us over until the twin deficit realli give us someth to worri about    laughter   thank you
the economi in the eleventh district is begin to show more widespread sign of improv   employ data for june and juli were on the weak side  but the anecdot report from our beig book contact and from last week   s meet of our board of director and our advisori council on small busi and agricultur are becom more op ist   manufactur  of cours  remain the except  the hous sector has strengthen as buyer have rush to buy befor mortgag rate move higher   on the commerci side  leas activ has improv  and vacanc rate have stabil instead of rise further   even two of our weakest sector  airlin and truck  have strengthen somewhat   the demand for comput and semiconductor has continu to improv   our director from a larg specialti semiconductor manufactur gave the most posit report she has given in sever year   semiconductor price have stabil  and capac util is run at    percent   with inventori veri low  she   s hope that capac util will reach    percent soon  which is where price power can be regain   she   s anticip output growth of between    and    percent in       depend on the type of chip  with no new capac come on stream befor       she   s op ist about the improv outlook   her compani recent announc plan for a new chip manufactur plant in dalla in        meanwhil  even though thing are look up  she report that for her firm the unit state is still the weakest market in the world  anoth anecdot is that the volum of diesel fuel be sold in texa has risen about   percent over the last month  a sign that more good are be move to market   each of the member of our small busi council provid a long and detail analysi about how his or her busi was show definit sign of turn up in the last sever month  depend on the industri   that was the good news   they were concern  howev  that the posit direct might last for onli six month or so   they all fear that larger compani would remain cautious about capit spend and hire and that a continu recoveri was far from certain   their worri echo the concern i heard at a coupl of ceo breakfast that i   ve host sinc our last meet   from those meet it was clear that ceo hesit regard new invest or hire hasn   t abat veri much  and a lot of those who did have expans plan mention that they were plan for expans abroad   one of our newer el paso director  who was at our board meet last week  run a maquiladora plant in juarez   she live in el paso and is veri activ in maquiladora and mexican industri associ  and she has been worri about the movement of job from mexico to china   she announc last week that her firm was move oper to china as well  on the nation economi  i must say that my outlook is similar in broad outlin to that suggest in the  book   at the june meet i was a littl skeptic about the strength of the resurg that was be forecast  but the data avail sinc then seem to substanti it   the forecast growth should begin to generat employ growth despit continu cautious among ceo   i   m op ist that the product growth we have go and the substanti slack we have in capac util and in labor market will give us the rapid growth with diminish inflat over the next coupl of year that is forecast in the  book   i hope with better progress toward reduc unemploy
i want to mention two addit data point that support much of what we have alreadi talk about   first  from banker we   re get increas anecdot evid of renew interest in either expans or acquisit but still onli a limit number of actual deal   the chang from the last meet is onli slight  the chang from six month ago is quit strike   use dave     s continuum on the psycholog   rang from skeptic to guard op    i would say that banker are fair far out on the op ist side of that continuum   addit  to the extent that they have survey their custom inform  banker are report that they detect a signific more op ist outlook for expans than had been the case in recent month   in part i think that support bill pool   s comment on inventori   not his remark about just in  e inventori order for diaper but his observ about the risk that busi could miss this expans by delay action too long   that is a real concern  and it may in fact be reflect in a more rapid move by busi at some point in the near futur  on fiscal polici  you may rememb that at the last two meet it has been report that there is more fiscal s ulus in the pipelin at this point than at ani  e in the post   world war ii era  includ the reagan era   and that s ulus is about to increas signific as the congress will within the next month approv the addit     billion defens author and appropri   that   s good news for the short run   as for the longer term  i share governor     s concern becaus there is no indic from the congress of ani inclin to reappli fiscal disciplin to the system   i find the long term consider of that almost appal   the two data point i   ve note suggest more op  for an improv economi but no indic yet of a chang in price power or ani other inflationari pressur
thank you   let me start by ad to what mr    and sever other have said about the forecast in the  book compar with the forecast in the privat sector  as i look at the compon of the forecast  i focus again on product   i must say that the more i talk to busi peopl  the more i realli believ that we are at a sea chang in product  so i   m veri comfort with the  book forecast   not to duplic the comment of other  i would like to talk in particular about one aspect of the current situat  my remark may be similar to what governor   mention earlier about inventori manag  but they may give a littl differ perspect base on what i   m hear from some of my busi contact   obvious  the pessim about earn growth among ceo and busi peopl general stem from their concern about the inabl to rais price in order to increas revenu   they still feel veri constrain in that regard becaus of excess capac and the competit environ that have caus them to realli focus on cost   so reengin work process and use resourc more effect than befor are concept that continu to drive busi decis and  from what i   m hear as busi plan their budget and strategi for next year  that will continu in       we   ve talk a bit about how much inventori   sale ratio have drop   one of the comment i heard from sever folk i talk to in servic industri relat to the way we measur inventori   we look at the ratio of inventori to sale  which tend to involv the manufactur  wholesal  and retail part of the distribut process   but we realli don   t have good data on the inventori that sit insid servic compani  which is where the major of the worker are and where most of our product and incom growth is generat in this countri  mani servic compani have just gotten around in the last coupl of year to develop the same kind of procur polici that the manufactur  wholesal  and retail have been use sinc the      s   my contact point out that  in the old day  individu depart all had big suppli cabinet or suppli room  and each depart order it own suppli and tend to have on hand an excess suppli of everyth from fax machin to server to paper and everyth els   what has happen   and accord to my contact it   s one of the reason busi have been buy fewer suppli   is that  in their reengin effort  larg corpor have been central procur   offic depot has becom their suppli cabinet  and basic firm are make do with less   anoth chang  in term of equip  is that mani compani no longer have backup forklift and other equip sit around  they wait and get the equip when they need it   there   s no way to measur this but compani say that     chairman  span briefli left the room  and mr    was act chairman at this point  inventori within servic busi also have been decreas and are still be work down as a way to improv effici   the fewer  e they now have to handl item in inventori creat big effici in their cost structur  too  let me shift to the second point i want to talk about  which is the employ pictur  my comment may reflect my natur op ist viewpoint in tri to find someth good in these dismal employ number that we   re see   i   ve talk to some peopl in leadership role in the nfib  the small busi group  and one of the thing they   re focus on is the continu dichotomi between the establish data and the household data on employ  as we know  the two seri have diverg for a long  e   but as my contact point out to me  a lot more  e  energi  and peopl are be employ in sole proprietorship than previous  in fact  as shown in a  book chart  the latest month survey show that hire plan of small busi   bear in mind that it   s a veri recent  e seri   are back to the level record in the mid     s expans   as these outsid contact like to remind me  most new job are creat by small busi   so for the first  e in sever year they are op ist that small busi are go to be the sourc of growth  while the structur kind of layoff we   re see in big busi will be a drag   in ani event  they are see some sign that small busi are begin to grow and to hire peopl other than famili member   who work extraordinarili long hour   and there is some op  that real employ gain will be occur in that sector go forward
thank you  mr  chairman   some  soon we   ll be approach a critic junctur in this polici cycl   output appear to be grow rapid  but employ has not yet begun to recov and inflat so far is quiescent   the crucial question is  at what point should we begin to tighten   there are import risk in both direct   we don   t want to tighten too soon and short circuit the recoveri  risk further disinfl or even deflat   on the other hand  we certain don   t want to let inflat and inflat expect get too high  the key element of our decis will be the view we take about the like behavior of inflat over the next year to year and a half   we don   t have much evid to guid us on this  but let me offer a littl from the onli other jobless recoveri of recent year   and the recess that seem broad most like the recent one   the downturn in          it is interest that initi employ and inflat follow veri similar pattern  in      and        both recess last eight month accord to the nber   employ kept fall after the trough in both recess wherea labor product rose sharpli   in the earlier case  twelv month growth in nonfarm payrol employ hit it minimum valu  minus     percent  in may       two month after the nber trough date   in the more recent episod  employ growth hit it minimum valu in februari        also at minus     percent   three rather than two month after the trough date   in both case also  core inflat was virtual flat dure the recess itself  the close parallel evolut of the         and the      episod end  howev  short after the recess trough   in particular  the rebound in employ growth was much stronger in the earlier episod   in          employ growth stabil eleven month after the trough date  and by eighteen month after the trough  employ growth had reach   percent annual   in contrast  eighteen month after the trough in the current episod  employ growth was still negat   by three year after the      trough  in march       employ growth was   percent at an annual rate   in short  the         and the      episod look veri similar initi  but the recoveri of the labor market after the trough was consider fa  in      than it has been recent  what happen to inflat subsequ to the trough   this is the critic point   dure the three year follow the march      trough  core cpi inflat fell from     percent to     percent  and core pce inflat fell from     percent to     percent   both inflat measur declin further subsequ   that is  inflat fell more than   percentag point dure the three year follow the      trough   moreov  most of this declin occur after employ growth had turn posit   for comparison  in the current episod core cpi inflat has fallen about     percent sinc the novemb      trough  and core pce inflat has fallen about     percent   becaus the post trough recoveri in the labor market has been so much slower this  e around  the inflat experi in the earlier episod suggest to me that further disinfl or at least stabl inflat may be on the horizon  i realiz this is a crude comparison   inflat was more volatil in the earlier episod  reflect less anchor expect   polici were differ  and it   s onli one data point   but it is at least a littl evid that a jobless recoveri is like to be associ with veri weak upward pressur on inflat even dure the initi period after employ growth turn posit   all els be equal  that suggest a strategi of vigil patienc for monetari polici  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that were distribut dure your break  which may seem as if it was a long  e ago   laughter
do you want to revis these chart       the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix
i guess i could updat the financi market quot by now   as dino has alreadi relat  the messag from financi market about today   s meet is fair straightforward   as indic by the path of the expect feder fund rate in the top left panel  investor appar anticip that the committe will stay with the current level of the intend feder fund rate for about one year   as to other aspect of today   s decis  the domest desk   s survey of the twenti two primari dealer report in the top right panel reveal that virtual all are bet that the risk assess to be announc this afternoon will be the same as that in august  inde  the probabl that the nomin fund rate will touch a veri low level in the next five month   infer from eurodollar option   has reced consider from it height of earli summer  although it has tick up sinc the august employ report   on balanc  recent quot on option produc a probabl distribut for the expect fund rate   the red bar in the middl right panel   not much differ from that prevail just befor the august meet   two other aspect of recent financi market experi that are shown in the bottom panel are worth highlight   first  the chart at the left depict a measur of the volatil of expect feder fund rate   the averag of the absolut valu of daili chang in futur rate   across matur measur on the horizont scale  the averag chang in futur rate over the past four month  the red bar  have been much smaller at short matur than has been the norm over the prior decad  the blue bar    second  as shown by the bar at the bottom right  expect about the fund rate across the matur structur have tend to move less on averag in respons to the last four month surpris in the unemploy rate than was the histor experi   taken togeth  this suggest that the committe has been abl to anchor expect about the veri near term cours of polici   in effect make them less volatil and less sensit to revis to the expect path of the economi   the case for contradict those prevail expect by eas polici    basi point at this meet is present in your second exhibit   as has been a featur of the past few  book forecast  consider resourc slack is seen linger over the next few year   inde  as shown in the middl left panel  the expans of aggreg suppli is now anticip to be suffici vigor that the unemploy rate run notic abov the path project by the staff in june  when the committe last eas polici   while monetari polici no doubt work with a lag  action today should help to fo  a quicker work down of resourc slack in      and        anoth way of make this point is shown in the bottom panel   given the staff   s assess of the forc imping on the economi  the actual real feder fund rate is not obvious below some es  of it equilibrium valu   the committe may harbor doubt that the expans of aggreg demand will have as much vigor as in the  book forecast that under this analysi   for exampl  if your own assess of the prospect for capit spend is more similar to the    weak invest    altern in the  book than to the baselin  includ the financi market repercuss   a   point eas at this  e may be view as desir   as can be seen by compar the black bar of the baselin with the red bar depict the altern in the middl right panel  the unemploy rate would be more than   percentag point higher on averag over the next two year if you held polici steadi in the face of invest expand   percentag point less than in the baselin  at least accord to the staff model   this scenario  howev  is an altern  not the baselin   as outlin at the top of your next exhibit  the committe may be will to keep polici unchang at this meet if it find both plausibl and attract the forecast in that baselin that inflat will hold fair steadi at around   percent  which might be seen as consist with a work definit of price stabil   the committe may be especi inclin to keep polici unchang  at least for now  if it think that there are other sourc of impetus to econom growth that may make it difficult to restrain inflat to it current pace   in particular  as shown in the middl panel  the term structur of nomin yield is unusu steepli slope  at least by the experi of the past twenti five year   as was discuss earlier  in the staff   s view this unusu configur will not persist becaus longer term yield edg lower as market particip come to see that inflat pressur remain mute and monetari polici can remain on hold for some  e   but you may feel that the staff went onli part way in anticip the market respons should event in come quarter convinc investor that both inflat and the polici rate will stay on hold   a more substanti ralli in the bond market in those circumst would probabl provid consider addit financi impetus to support capit spend and the hous market   the other way the yield curv could shift to a more typic configur over  e is by it short end rise   as note by the third bullet in the top panel  this altern seem part of the think of mani market particip  who are appar expect that build pressur on inflat next year will lead you to tighten polici sooner than foreseen in the  book   some concern in that regard may be rais by the    basi point runup sinc june in inflat compens deriv from the treasuri market  which is plot in your bottom left panel   as shown in the bottom right panel  the recent inflat forecast of major invest bank   list in the second column   are general higher than the  book project  wherea their gdp growth project  shown in the first column  are uniform weaker than the  book   an observ sever you have alreadi made   this appar less appeal mix of output growth and inflat on wall street might aris becaus market particip project either slower growth of aggreg suppli go forward or a less benign phillip curv   either of which would make hold steadi seem more appropri   in addit to it rate decis  the committe face nettlesom question regard it assess of risk to the outlook go forward  the subject of your final exhibit   with three potenti character of risk   downsid  balanc  and upsid   to two object  price stabil  shown along the horizont dimens  and sustain econom growth  shown along the vertic dimens  the current polici announc allow nine combin   the committe end it august meet in the blue box  in which balanc risk to the growth object and downsid risk to the inflat object reduc to an overal assess that the risk were tilt to the downsid   as was discuss last night  the mean of word   matter   if you take the phrase    sustain econom growth    to stand in for the growth rate of potenti output  then you well may envis a transit from that blue box to the yellow box direct below   in that case  the risk are individu character as upsid to sustain econom growth and downsid to inflat  reveal the implicit judgment that the level of output probabl remain below that of it potenti   the result balanc of those two risk depend on the welfar weight attach to those outcom and span from upsid to downsid   while it seem a stretch to consid such a chang at this meet  that shift seem more like in the near term than to either of the box highlight in red associ with balanc risk toward inflat  absent surpris develop   a more immedi concern is whether to retain the last sentenc of the august statement  which  as shown in the box at the lower left  held  that    the committe believ that polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period      in last night   s meet  most member express discomfort with extend some form of commit about the futur path of the polici rate   at the same  e  some note that  in unusu circumst  guidanc offer to market particip about near term intent could amplifi the effect of polici   it is probabl the case that the sentenc about    a consider period    help to anchor near term expect about polici in a manner reflect in the unusu behavior of futur rate i report on at the start of my brief   but if you see the need for tighten closer down the road than  say  in staff forecast  you may want to begin think at this  e about an exit strategi from this part of the statement   market attent to those word and the like reaction were they to be excis  howev  may make you hesit to head for that exit too abrupt   there is one aspect of the current sentenc and one potenti word chang that might blunt a tendenc for market particip to view the statement as a hard promis to keep the fund rate at it current level   the notion so mani of you object to last night   the first appli as a matter of mean onc again   the committe has indic it expect that polici can be kept accommod for a consider period   determin whether the stanc of polici is accommod is a matter of judgment in set the real fund rate some distanc below an es  of it equilibrium valu   in circumst in which econom fundament are improv  the stanc of polici can be kept accommod  even with increas in the nomin polici rate  as long as the associ rise real rate   not move up fa  than the rise equilibrium real rate   it is instruct that  as shown in the lower right panel  the committe has been describ it polici as accommod sinc januari       short after the fund rate move down to    percent and befor two addit polici eas   that said  market particip seem to have rebas their view on what is accommod to the current set of polici   to avoid disappoint in financi market at some later date  it will be import that public statement as a rule do not equat accommod polici with the current level of the nomin short rate   second  the committe might want to shade it current implicit commit away from be base on a period measur in chronolog  e to one determin by econom event   for instanc  the committe could assert that it judgment was that polici could stay accommod for the consider period it current assess will be requir to fo  the contain of disinflationari pressur   that conclud my prepar remark
question for     if not  let me proceed   as i listen to the comment around the tabl  i note someth that is self evid in a way but that we realli ought to think about   i observ that the correl between the region report at the previous meet and those at this meet is extraordinarili high and virtual everyon   s assess of region econom condit move to about the same extent   in effect  that is tell us that we have a truli nation market   that was not the case fifti year ago   back then  mortgag interest rate were    basi point higher on the west coast than on the east coast  and if we go back even further to the earli year of the feder reserv system  we find differ discount rate at the feder reserv bank around the countri   it is import to recogn that we have a unifi nation market  even though we may take it for grant   the reason it matter is the same as the reason that the increas in global matter  over the last decad or so we have seen a fair dramat rise in global  that develop coupl with signific deregul and major technolog advanc in the unit state  as i   ve comment previous  has led to a mark increas in competit  that increas has been slow but persist and more and more evid as the year have pass   this growth in competit and the relat evid on disinfl are clear a global  not a nation  phenomenon   inflat has been fall everywher   so it is not idiosyncrat to the unit state but is occur increas throughout the global world economi  in my view we are see a differ type of phenomenon with respect to the inflat and disinfl process than we saw in previous cyclic period   i don   t know at what point the acceler pace of global began to occur  but i do think it emerg bear critic on the reason we favor maintain our accommod polici postur for a signific period of  e   all this is unlik what we would have done in previous cyclic period  when the first sign of acceler econom activ would have led us to move aggress to tighten monetari polici  we are not like to tighten quick   inde  the evid in support of that conclus is clear even among those of you who are question  and probabl correct so  how much weight we should place on the gap analysi and on expect that inflat will stay near it current low level   i think our general view is that inflat is probabl go to stay down   there is no evid of a break in the disinflationari forc   those forc may be diminish  and inde they may be in the process of be gradual contain  but if so this process clear is a fair lengthi one  this rais the obvious question of whether we are observ an ongo trend   i suspect the answer to that is    no      we   re get all sort of indic  regrett includ an import one just ye day  that the process of global is slow down   we had a breakdown ye day in the wto negoti   protection is emerg in this countri in area where it was not evid previous   recent develop indic that the polit of protection  which were fair well contain as the economi move through the whole deregul technolog period  are begin to surfac in a varieti of place   if inde this polit trend continu to strengthen  then the competit that has been hold down the price level will begin to weaken   as that occur  we can expect inflationari pressur to reemerg  i think it   s import for us to recogn that we may be go through what i suspect is a uniqu period   i think polici has been adjust to that develop over the year and veri specif in the most recent year   my own judgment is that the current situat is not perman   it is a transit phase that has led us away from a fair high degre of regul and control and has fo  a veri signific shift away from the old view regard the regulatori structur   mani observ onc perceiv that structur to be appropri  though i exclud myself from that judgment  the bottom line in all of this   and what i think emerg in our discuss last even   is the recognit of the need to begin to think about where we should go from here   the next step is clear either to confront serious disinfl  which has been our concern through most of this year or  what i see as far more like  to move away from that concern   as   mention  we ought to think about an exit strategi that will let us find our way back to a more convent feder reserv polici  in retrospect  i think it was a mistak to includ a sentenc in our press statement in august indic that an accommod polici can be maintain for a consider period   it may not have creat an immedi problem  but i don   t think we should be judg polici in term of ani fix  e frame   instead  it should be judg with respect to the process of implement our object   as   just suggest  we need to begin to consid how we will work our way out of this   rephras the sentenc in the press statement  as he put it  is a way out becaus we could readili translat    consider period    into the notion of a    process    that involv a chang in the disinflationari outlook   if we decid to introduc the notion of such a process in our statement today by ad a refer to the contain of disinflationari forc  we could drop the    consider period    from our statement at the next meet but retain the new refer   we would then be in a posit to drop that new refer at a later  e when we perceiv that disinfl is no longer a signific concern   in fact  initi that approach is what i would like to recommend today  name to retain the balanc of risk statement exact as we had them in august  with the sole except of ad to the    consider period    statement a refer to it process equival relat to our effort to contain disinfl  in sum  what i would like to put on the tabl for a vote is hold the fund rate unchang and retain the balanc of risk languag we had the last  e  with this minor chang   the statement  if you go along with this  would be exact the same as our last statement apart from some updat of the econom refer and the addit of a refer to the contain of disinflationari forc to the exist sentenc relat to the mainten of polici accommod for a    consider period      befor we vote  i would like to distribut the draft of the statement so you can see what it look like   governor
i   m about   for    in suggest chang
that   s not true   you had a singl the last  e
i   m   for      in the last sentenc  i don   t think we need the word    consider      i think the sentenc could be written more simpli with someth like this      in these circumst  the committe believ that polici accommod can be maintain until disinflationari forc are contain
but that   s differ from this draft in the sens that i   m use the term    consider period    so it   s not chang and then redefin it   what you   re do involv move fa  than i think is wise to do
okay   i see your point   the complic is that this is a veri ungain sentenc  but i do see your point
we   ve use such sentenc befor   is that okay
i still like my sentenc better  but i see your point   i   m not go to make a big issu of that
but who   s count
let me continu the usual tradit by comment first on your three part recommend and then i   ll talk about the statement   first  i think you   re right that we shouldn   t move the fund rate   while i am alway influenc by the chart that show the current fund rate versus the real equilibrium rate  i think financi condit actual have been rather accommod   also  a chang in the fund rate would surpris the market   i don   t think we should move the rate   with respect to the balanc of risk  i support your recommend to stay pretti much with our tri partit statement   in my view it has work well   you ad anoth compon to your recommend for the press statement  and i want to focus on that next   i think it is import  as   suggest and as you also impli  that we move from chronolog  e to econom  e becaus what is go to drive our polici decis is not the passag of month but what we see happen  then we get to the question of what we want to see happen   obvious  it seem right to talk about that in term of contain disinflationari forc   that is a key econom issu that worri us  and it will be the issu that we will continu to focus on   i rather like your addit of this concept of fo  the contain of disinflationari forc   my son   s seventh grade english teacher probabl would not be ecstat happi with the result sentenc  but then he   s not in this room   i like what you   ve propos here becaus it give a sens of an ongo process  and i think it will give us some flexibl when we start to see thing come togeth  that is  when we feel we have succeed in fo  the contain of disinfl  that might be the  e to make a polici move  and we can all decid when that point has been reach   so while this is not necessarili beauti english  to me it is a good descript of when a respons committe might think about chang it polici   that   s realli all i want to tri to signal this  e   so  in light of my view that nineteen peopl can   t redraft a press statement veri readili and my sens that we want to move from chronolog toward econom  e in our statement  i can support all three part of your tripartit recommend
i   m obvious in agreement with your recommend on the fund rate   actual  i don   t see ani altern to keep the languag on the risk   the risk to sustain econom growth  the risk of inflat  and the balanc of risk   the same as the last  e   not enough has chang   growth is clear a littl stronger  but we have labor market constraint   so i think it would be difficult to chang that word  even though it bring to mind last night   s discuss about how none of this languag is particular satisfactori right now  nevertheless  i don   t see a case for chang it at this  e  which was one of my basic point last night   the last sentenc in the draft is ungain  there   s no question about it   but i follow your logic that this approach is a way  over a meet or two  to back away from prescrib a  e period and move toward mention a set of circumst   or howev we want to character it   that would affect our futur polici cours   i think this sentenc is probabl a good way of do that   so i   m in agreement with all three part of your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain support the recommend that we keep the fund rate where it is   let me tri not to get into the word issu but discuss what in my view is the substanc   first  i want to talk about the probabl distribut rather than just the word    risk    for the moment   on the inflat rate my own view is that the probabl go forward are rough symmetr around the averag inflat experi of the last six to twelv month   i believ the situat is differ from what we had in the spring becaus there is a notic pickup in activ   on growth  i think the distribut is rough symmetr around the consensus forecast   but i also believ that growth modest abov the consensus forecast is both desir and sustain   i don   t think that would caus us ani problem  in my view the economi has room to run at a fa  rate   so i don   t regard an upsid surpris   provid it   s not an outsiz surpris   as a risk to the sustain of the econom advanc  i agre that it   s import to tri not to rock the boat but to attempt to evolv this languag   my prefer would be to work at this by go in a slight differ direct  given my view of the probabl  i would go for balanc risk on inflat becaus with the price stabil outlook my view is that the probabl are more or less balanc   i do believ that  go forward  the risk to price stabil on both side are relat mute   so in the last sentenc  i would say someth along the line that we can    maintain an accommod polici for the consider period in which we expect the risk to price stabil to remain mute      that make the accommod polici condit on the mainten of low risk to price stabil
may i make a suggest   you know  that   s not bad phraseolog for our statement two meet from now   that   s where we are go   i just don   t think we gain veri much by move in that direct too soon   in fact  i   m sure that we probabl lose someth   but keep that phraseolog in mind   that   s not a bad way to say what we mean
i won   t destroy my note as i usual do after each meet
mr  chairman  given the strength of the economi that we see  at least on the basi of the most recent data  i support leav the fund rate at   percent   howev  even with the expect pickup in growth  there   s an uncomfort high risk that inflat may move lower than would be desir   certain in the  book  with the revis to product  it   s clear that the gap is probabl greater today than we thought was the case in the past  i favor retain our current risk assess  with the risk be balanc for growth and weight toward the downsid for inflat   but i do want to make a parenthet point  when i read the bluebook and heard     s present  i was struck by the case that was made for an eas   in particular  one or two scenario seem to indic that an eas might be appropri as someth of an insur polici   and one that i can   t see as have ani cost  so i would suggest that  if inde there is a percept lull in the economi  we ought to jump on the chanc to eas and the exit strategi will not be an issu
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your fed fund target and the balanc of risk   the risk assess  if you will   as state   frank  if i had my druther i would wait one more meet befor i would chang anyth in the word about polici accommod be maintain for a consider period of  e   i   d come back next  e and chang that sentenc   at the moment we   re see sign of growth and some posit develop in the economi   i agre that eventu we   re go to have to chang these word and start to exit from this strategi of describ our polici expect for a    consider period      i just think that    eventu    should be next  e
thank you  mr  chairman   i support all the piec of your recommend   on the balanc of risk statement  i agre to a larg extent  though not entir  with what presid santomero said  which was to chang as littl as possibl in that statement   i would reserv these chang until we agre on what we mean by the word we use  i think it would be a big mistak to start chang them at this meet befor we go through the stress test that presid   suggest last night   so in my view we ought to keep the balanc of risk word exact as it is now until we have  e to think about it more thorough  as for the balanc itself  i happen to agre with the current assess   i think the risk are balanc even on my definit of sustain growth  which isn   t everybodi   s  given that we have strong demand but veri weak labor market   so whether the output gap will close over the next few quarter is a veri open question   in that sens the risk are balanc  as state in the first sentenc of that paragraph   i do think we have persist risk of disinfl  so i agre with the second sentenc and also the sentenc that sum up our assess of the risk  on the    consider period    sentenc  i think we need to set ourselv up sooner rather than later to get to the exit strategi   this is where i part forc with presid santomero a littl  i believ this word is move toward an econom rational  and i   d prefer to get go in that direct   we can   t be sure where the economi is go to be in come month and when we   re go to need that rational  so the sooner we get there the better   with regard to governor     s suggest that we drop    consider period     i believ it   s go to be a big deal when we do that   get to that point veri rapid would have market repercuss   i think it would be interpret as a signal that we were get readi to do someth that we   re not get readi to do   so i agre that we have to move in a more gradual fashion toward this exit strategi  as you suggest
mr  chairman  i agre with leav the fund rate target unchang at this meet   my own view is that we are in an environ where we   re close to price stabil  with low and stabl inflat  and i think the risk are balanc   i will tell you that tri to figur out what to say in this statement right now make the earli releas of the minut seem more appeal to me than it did last night   in ani event  i don   t think we can do much to chang this statement given the current circumst  so i   m not go to argu ani further   i   ll live with this languag  but i hope we do develop a veri care craft exit strategi fair soon   thank you
first vice presid stewart
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   in my view the recoveri still is fragil in term of employ and the busi psycholog   i think it   s too earli to start an exit strategi from our statement about our accommod polici be maintain for a consider period of  e   i have no regret about have made that statement  and i think it   s still relev to repeat it
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain support leav the feder fund rate target at   percent   as for the other issu  the overrid concern in my mind is the potenti reaction in the marketplac   i will say a bit more about that in a minut   becaus of that i feel rather constrain as to what we can or should do at this meet   so i will certain accept your recommend on the balanc of risk statement  although my instinct is to agre with those who feel that the risk on the inflat side are move in the direct of balanc   if they   re not balanc yet  i think they may well be short   also becaus i feel constrain  the languag you   re propos here on fo  the contain of disinflationari forc is okay with me   but presum the reason we want to tread slowli and care here is that we   re concern about creat all sort of turmoil in the financi market   the likelihood of that is hard to gaug   i   m certain prepar to go along with this  but i do think that concern is the reason to proceed cautious   and it   s not just the question of the reaction of the financi market but what that reaction could do to what we think is a gather momentum in the economi
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend on the feder fund rate target and your recommend on retain the balanc of risk statement as it is current   as i said last night  though  i am uncomfort about signal our futur polici action in our statement and  therefor  at the august meet i was not in favor of the consider period of  e sentenc   but i also agre with your assess that drop it at this meet would confus the market   so i support the statement as written
mr  chairman i support no chang in the fund rate target   i remain concern about strike a better balanc of risk statement  but that   s not someth we can deal with today   i hope we will keep in mind a fundament review of that  i also like the idea of tri to find an exit strategi   i   ve read the new final sentenc three or four  e  and i wish i could be more comfort that i know how peopl are go to interpret it   i   m not sure it   s go to get us where we   re tri to go   roger said he was worri about the peopl in this room understand it  i   m worri about the peopl outsid understand that last sentenc   i think a lot is go to depend on what we say in subsequ day and week about disinfl as we speak on the economi   the fact is that in this paragraph we refer to disinfl three  e   my suspicion is that at least some of us will continu to talk about disinfl  so i   m not sure this statement realli get us unstuck from what we did at the last meet   on balanc  i think i   d be more comfort leav the languag as we had it in our statement last  e and tri to find some better word for use at anoth meet   but i   ll accept this chang in the languag if that   s the consensus of the committe
i must tell you that i   m listen to all of this  and i agre that it is an awkward statement   essenti there are realli two choic   one  we can liter stay with exact what we had in our previous statement and tri to figur out anoth form of exit strategi   or two  we can go with the propos new languag   but if there are ani doubt about the clariti of this new sentenc   and i quick acknowledg that there are   i think there   s a valid point to be rais here about use the new sentenc   presid
mr  chairman  i support no chang in the fund rate  and i support the balanc of risk recommend   on the last sentenc  i do think we need an exit strategi  and in my view this is a reason one   but i don   t see the urgenc to do it today that governor kohn   and other may   i would be veri comfort just leav the sentenc as it was
you weren   t rais an urgenc of do it today  were you  don
no  i was just say that i support the addit word becaus it set us up for a futur meet   so i   m not urg
you   re support the sentenc as propos
right  that   s what i thought you said   but what i   m say is that i would leav the sentenc as it was last  e  that would be my prefer at this point   i think this kind of word might provid the exit strategi we will want to use  but i don   t see ani urgenc to adopt it at this meet   i would prefer to wait and think a littl more care about the best way to phrase this   that   s my person prefer  i would like to make a comment on your remark about the pace of global and the possibl that it might be slow down   i toil in these vineyard for a bit in anoth posit   and i have a lot of scar on my back from it  too   i come out with a littl more op ist view of the situat than you do   first  i would say that i believ protection   becom more preval when the economi is weak or sluggish   as the economi improv  i hope that some of these protectionist sen ent will subsid   second  on the breakdown in the trade talk  this breakdown was differ from those in previous trade talk   which often occur  by the way   and that   s becaus the develop countri were play a larger role this  e   in ani event  these global talk are alway difficult   in my view the       deadlin was veri op ist when it was set up  and i think the parti probabl will not meet it now   certain  if they did meet the       deadlin  it would be counter to all of our experi in previous global trade talk   so i guess i   m a bit more op ist than you are on that side
well  i hope you   re right   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  i   m fine on the fund rate target and on the substant aspect of the balanc of risk   but on the press releas statement i   m veri much in jack guynn   s camp   he express my concern veri well   i just don   t know how this addit languag is go to be interpret   i   ve been tri to think about that   in my view  the addit refer to disinflationari forc may well lead peopl to think that we are more concern about further disinfl now than we in fact are as a group   actual  that languag fit my own person view  but i don   t know that it match the sen ent i   ve heard around this tabl   more broad  this new word is anoth ad hoc chang  and that   s what is go to get the attent in the marketplac  and i don   t know how market particip are go to interpret it   so while i understand the logic  in term of the reason that you want to put those word in  i think it may be expect more than is reason of the abil of market to pars this languag  the bottom line here is that sooner or later  as other have said  we   re go to have to take the word    consider    out   that   s go to be the key point  and in my view it   s go to be veri difficult for us to smooth that transit veri much   i think that is just go to have to be face at the right  e   so my prefer is to leav the word unchang from last month
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend to keep the fed fund target rate at   percent   at this  e i still am quit concern about the downsid risk on inflat  main becaus of the forecast in the  book and my belief that the product stori is still be written   howev  like other who have just comment  i would prefer to leav the last sentenc of the statement as it was last  e   in that last sentenc  i think we   re tri to say whi we want to remain accommod   but the sentenc befor  which relat to the balanc of risk  say it alreadi   it state that the predomin concern continu to be the risk of inflat becom undesir low   so  i don   t think we need to say it again at the end of the next sentenc   again  i   m just worri about chang too mani word   i could accept this languag but sinc the sentenc is rather awkward i   d realli prefer to leav the word as it was
i support both part of the recommend   regard the last sentenc  i think the phrase that it is import to retain is    consider period      the phrase that i think is go to get a lot of attent is    to fo  the contain of       it will like be the focus of attent just becaus it is awkward   it would be less awkward if we drop the participl and just said    to contain disinflationari forc      but to do so would be to promis more than monetari polici can probabl deliv   so on balanc  i   ll accept the statement as it is
i   m okay with your recommend
i accept the polici recommend   on the last sentenc of the press statement  my prefer would be for this meet to leav it as it was befor   becaus i think that   s the safest thing to do   and to chang it next  e   i   d like to add my voic to presid   s pool   s suggest of word that was someth to the effect of remain accommod for the consider period that we expect the risk to inflat to remain mute  the distinct is that we would be accommod as long as inflat remain under control as oppos to as long as inflat is actual fall   you can see the distinct   to contain disinflationari forc mean as long as inflat stop fall  presid pool   s word about the risk to inflat remain mute suggest that as long as inflat stay where it is  which is actual veri low  we have no reason to begin to tighten
when we eventu get to that point  i think that   s where we   ll be in term of convey our assess of the situat
in ani event  i think that might be a good way to go
yes  we start by get the first differ  and then when we get to zero  we meld into it the concept of mute risk to inflat
well  if you start with the first differ then you might get an expect in the market that we   re go to begin tighten at some earli point  say  just when the differ chang
well  that depend in part on how we chang the statement as we go forward   that is the reason i thought the issu of the stress test that     was rais last night was the right one   governor
let me just propos anoth strategi here   it   s quit possibl that by next month we   re go to have balanc risk   if that is the case  then we   re go to have to do a lot with this paragraph   this sentenc could just drop by the waysid at that point  and it would be one of mani chang in the statement   so  we could leav the sentenc alon today   have it the same as it was last month   and then just drop it next month   also  the point that jack first made and that other have also express is that mention disinflationari forc actual rais the issu that you talk about last night   that is  the more we say    remot    possibl  the less it is believ to be remot  and the more we say    disinflationari forc
that is a good argument   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  listen to this discuss  i want to say that i veri much agre with those who say we should leav this word absolut the same as it was last  e
that   s where i   m come out as well  i must tell you
keep it the same tell the market someth right there   it mean that we don   t want to chang anyth  and market observ will begin to think about the fact that we   ll be back off in the futur   i think that will take us a step forward in an exit strategi
on this issu i think the argument for do noth has won the day   there   s also anoth margin issu here   the data for the last week or two are not incorpor in the forecast present in the  book   there   s a somewhat edgi element in those data  which i will grant you is more consist with leav the statement alon on the ground that we will have anoth month to play with the word   so as far as i   m concern  the argument for leav the statement unchang win  and i would make that recommend  incident  for the next meet we ought to make sure that the statement on the balanc of risk in the draft press releas is the same as in the bluebook   we don   t have  e to fix that today  so you   ll have to bear with me on this temporari problem   but we   ll get rid the inconsist   would you read the inappropri languag
it   s on page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent      for the risk assess sentenc      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ the risk to it outlook for sustain econom growth over the next sever quarter are balanc   the risk to it outlook for inflat over the next sever quarter are weight toward the downsid   and taken togeth  the balanc of risk to it object are weight toward the downsid in the forese futur
i want to make sure that the chang in the second paragraph in the statement are accept   is that correct   nobodi has comment on them  also  in the third paragraph we have said    remain    the predomin concern rather than    is like to be    the predomin concern   is that accept to everybodi     everyon know what i   m refer to   the    remain    is about three line up from the bottom in the mark up version of the draft   okay  i will assum that there are no object to those chang   pleas call the roll

our next meet is octob      let me just say that i will be appear befor the hous budget committe befor then   if it turn out that there is a need for us to communic someth offici  i could do it then  have preced it with a telephon confer of the committe   i don   t think that will be necessari  but i want to note that condit in the economi might be chang fa  than we anticip and  if that   s the case  we have a vehicl that could be use to put a committe view out on the tabl   let   s go to lunch  end of meet
