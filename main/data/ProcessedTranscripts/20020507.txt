good morn  everyon   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut
without object  they are approv   dino  you   re on
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were just circul   the top panel on the first page give two snapshot of the eurodollar deposit futur strip  as of march    and as of noon ye day  repres contract out to septemb        the entir curv has move sharpli lower by between    and    basi point dure that period as the market has scale back expect of rise rate that had been built into the term structur   among the reason for the shift are that the macro data moder  corpor profit report turn soggi  equiti price exhibit weak  forecast for spend by busi were revis down  and tension rose in the middl east   and there were comment by member of this committe that were interpret as suggest that a tighten of polici would not come as soon as had been built into the forward rate structur   the same price out of tighten expect can be observ in treasuri yield  the middl left panel show two year treasuri yield down about    basi point sinc the middl of march  wherea ten year yield are down a bit less   about    basi point from their peak   over rough the same period   treasuri yield began to declin in mid to late march  as tension in the middl east increas and as the equiti market began to sag and then continu to fall after the chairman   s tes oni to the joint econom committe on april      as shown in the bottom panel  the ten year tip spread   which had widen in februari and earli march  stabil as expect of a strong recoveri moder and as commod price stabil after rise earlier this year   support comment by the treasuri about the tip program and the announc of plan to increas the frequenc of tip auction may also have play a role   the general declin in nomin treasuri yield has occur despit the more bearish factor for treasuri that the market have had to contend with in recent month  name the shift fiscal pictur   the most recent event highlight the chang in the outlook was the treasuri   s announc that it now anticip    billion in net financ need for the second quarter rather than the     billion paydown that it had forecast onli three month ago   the top panel on page   show one way of look at the higher financ need   this chart compar the averag issuanc by matur of the various benchmark issu this year relat to last year   in the bill sector  issuanc is twice as larg as it was last year   this year   s month two year auction have been run at a record     billion in size compar with about    materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix           billion last year   today   s five year auction will be a record     billion  and the size of the ten year auction also has increas from last year   the thirti year bond has been elimin  of cours  but that was be issu semiannu and made up onli a veri small portion of total issuanc   after complaint about a shrink suppli of treasuri in the last sever year  the market has absorb this higher level of issuanc so far without ani evid strain   despit the increas in suppli  as i note earlier yield have fallen in recent week  suggest that the higher level of suppli have not affect nomin rate  but higher level of suppli may be show up in spread relationship   the bottom  panel graph the u s  ten year swap spread sinc januari           the swap spread has narrow about    basi point sinc the last meet and current is rough at level not seen sinc the summer of       just befor the russian default   the reason for both the widen and the narrow are complex  includ the level of corpor issuanc that is swap  the stanc of monetari polici  demand for hedg by mortgag and other account  and other short term technic factor   thus one can   t ascrib movement to ani singl factor   still  it   s noteworthi that spread widen dure the period of higher budget surplus and then began to narrow as the surplus first began to shrink in fiscal      and as the forecast turn to deficit in fiscal        this may suggest that at least part of the widen of spread repres a repric of govern credit risk relat to other risk asset   spread of other debt instrument such as agenc and corpor show a similar pattern  though not as pronounc   these spread have not fulli retrac their climb and return to the veri low level seen in the summer of        the corpor bond market was affect by issuer specif and sector specif news in the past few week  with the backdrop of continu worri about event risk eman from account relat concern   despit the constant drumbeat of headlin about earn shortfal  sec investig  and continu pressur on some compani   especi those in the telecom area   to refin their  commerci paper  there appear to have been no general tier in the corpor sector   spread in that sector are depict on page     the top panel graph spread relat to aa industri corpor   as can be seen in the top left panel  among invest grade borrow bbb spread have risen modest while a spread have narrow   meanwhil  in the high yield sector  bb credit spread have narrow as well   look at the broad spectrum of corpor relat to treasuri  the spread has been relat stabl  as seen in the red line of the lower graph   howev  the telecom sub index  which is where the problem are most acut and where a larg proport of the borrow was concentr in the late     s and earli       widen dramat   turn to page    the veri busi graph in the top panel show chang in the valu of a number of foreign currenc   the euro  the yen  the swiss franc  the british pound  the australian dollar  and the mexican peso   against the dollar sinc januari     the valu abov     repres appreci of the foreign currenc relat to the dollar   in recent week  most foreign currenc have been   ppreciat against the dollar  rais concern about a sustain period of dollar weak   the mexican peso is an except to this trend  it has fallen in recent week due both to local factor and to the percept that a slower u s  recoveri will delay the recoveri in mexico   despit the dollar   s recent depreci  we should not exagger the movement   it has move onli modest lower sinc the begin of the year  and by most measur the effect valu of the dollar is at level last seen dure the strong dollar period of the mid     s   still  sen ent toward the dollar has deterior in recent week   market talk has focus much more on the potenti advers effect of the current account deficit than it has in quit some  e   what has taken the market aback in recent week was that the dollar   s fall was as broad as it was and that it occur despit the strong first quarter gdp number   particular surpris was that the dollar   s weak spread even to the dollar yen exchang rate  wherea expect onli a few week ago were that the dollar would rise against the yen   one argument that some analyst have made in recent year is that the higher expect return in the unit state relat to return in other countri have support a higher dollar   in recent week the dollar skeptic have use the same  logic and point to the underperform of return in the unit state to explain the dollar   s weak   the equal busi middl panel on page   show the perform of select major equiti market relat to the s p      take into account exchang rate move   so a line abov the zero axi   not necessarili impli that a particular equiti market had posit return   rather  it measur how much better that market did than the s p       ad up both equiti market chang and exchang rate shift  each of these market outperform the s p     sinc januari  some by doubl digit amount   the bottom left panel depict three month interest rate differenti between the dollar and the euro   these differenti have been at about     basi point in favor of the euro for some  e now   at the long end  shown in the right panel  the u s  dollar ten year swap now yield about    basi point more than the euro swap  but that differenti has narrow from     basi point in januari   so at least dure this relat short period of about four month  foreign investor in develop market general would have done better at home than in the u s  market   should this trend continu  the dollar   s exchang rate could come under further pressur   look at japan a bit more close  the top panel of page   graph the bank of japan   s month end current account balanc sinc januari        the target has been    trillion to    trillion yen sinc decemb  but in practic    trillion has been the floor recent   and in the run up to the end of the fiscal half year  the current account balanc temporarili top out at more than    trillion yen   the middl panel depict japan   s monetari base over the same period  from januari      through april        despit the reduct in short term interest rate to near zero and the increas in the current account balanc over       the monetari base did not begin to grow until late in        that growth occur as the bank of japan step up it acquisit of asset and target ever higher level of current account balanc   that the monetari base has been grow at annual rate of near    percent in recent month has caught the attent of some market particip   it is taken by some as either a posit sign about the near term outlook for the economi or as a signal that the bank    f japan will hold the financi system togeth  or both   whatev the direct caus   this sen ent toward japan for the near term  while not posit  is at least less negat   the yen had been depreci in earli      along with a declin in japanes equiti   and to a lesser extent  japanes bond   dure the    sell japan    phase   with the step taken by the author to prop up equiti in late march and the realiz that the japanes would muddl through the fiscal year end without a major crisi  equiti began to rise  the yen began to appreci  and jgb yield began to declin   in short  the    sell japan    phase was replac by a    buy japan    phase  yield on jgbs have declin despit their downgrad to doubl a minus by standard   poor   s and their possibl downgrad by moodi   s in the next few week to the high singl a level   with respect to domest reserv  the desk at  e face challeng in the intermeet period becaus of uncertainti about the treasuri   s balanc  given the shortfal in tax revenu   overal  howev  this tax season was less event than in some other recent year when the treasuri was run up against it tt l  treasuri tax and loan account  constraint   that was not an issu this year   final  i want to note two item regard the desk   s oper   first  the desk began buy french bond as part of soma   s foreign portfolio diversif and also on behalf of the esf  exchang stabil fund    the committe had previous approv this diversif of the euro portfolio   second  the desk announc a modest chang to it secur lend program  effect may     as was describ in a memo to the committe date april      mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv our domest oper  and i   d be happi to take ani question
you gave two reason to be op ist relev to the acceler of the monetari base in japan   there are probabl sever reason   perhap three or four   that suggest that noth will happen as a consequ   so  it  sn   t necessarili mean that the acceler in growth of the monetari base in and of itself is go to work or is go to alter what is realli a deep structur problem in their bank system
dino  on the ten year swap spread on page    what   the spread between the aaa corpor and the ten year treasuri swap look like   in other word  what is the aaa corpor yield minus the ten year treasuri rate     r  kos   i don   t know   i haven   t look at that specif
the reason i   m rais the question  obvious  is that i wonder if we   re look at a situat where the suppli side of treasuri note issuanc is rais interest rate   that  of cours  is the implic of this chart as you interpret it   if that is inde the case  you may have found the smoke gun as to the relationship between budget deficit and interest rate  which economist have been endeavor to unearth for year   so  that   s whi i rais the question as to how the ten year swap rate would look relat to the aaa or aa corpor yield
yes  i think that is worth look into
in term of the fact  the ten year swap over the ten year aaa in the latest observ is a differenti of about minus    basi point
oh no  it   s the trend that   s relev  speaker      the trend  yes
at the  e of the last meet it was minus     so it has widen by    basi point
that   s not the trend i   m refer to   i   m refer to this trend
okay   the other point to make  just in term of intermeet develop  is that we haven   t focus as much on the aaa rate becaus it has been somewhat distort by the problem of ge
well  then do the aa
okay   we can do that    r  kos   i was not tri to impli that this was necessarili drive interest rate   my point was that it was a factor  along with mani other factor  that may have been affect these spread in
i have a deep seat bias that budget deficit do creat higher interest rate   so i   m look for ani straw that you can give me    laughter
well  this is one of mani   but i wouldn   t claim that it   s the onli one or even the primari one  onli that it is one
just a comment  mr  chairman   we run into the trap of    all other thing equal    and that   s so hard to figur out
to be sure   it   s a tyranni  which we never seem abl to overcom   no further question   mr  vice chair  would you like to move
move approv of the domest oper
thank you   without object  they are approv   we   re now on the renew of reciproc currenc arrang with canada and mexico   dino  would you outlin where we are in that process and give us a short histori
sure   i think most of the peopl around this tabl will rememb that last year at this  e forc were align where there was a possibl that it might be in everybodi   s  interest to do away with these swap line   among the forc that made that a possibl were the new leadership in policymak posit in all three countri and some event occur in mexico   main the negoti of a conting credit line  ccl  that the mexican were work on with the imf   as it happen that piec has not work out   for various reason  the mexican have not been abl to agre with the imf on a ccl  and that has made them less   ill to give up the swap line   they veri strong would like to maintain the status quo  at least for the  e be   so  my recommend to the committe is that the swap line be renew   of cours  we   d look for opportun in the futur   should they aris and if the committe so desir   to do away with the swap line   but my recommend at this  e is that they be renew for a year
question for dino   are there object to the recommend   if none  we will proceed on the assumpt of an affirm vote   we turn now to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   if you   ve been read the busi press  watch televis  or perus market newslett over the past seven week  you probabl have been subject to a fair steadi stream of downbeat news   capit good order move lower  sale of new and exist home declin  and consum confid dip again   even posit develop seem to be view as contain seed of doubt about the strength and durabl of the econom expans   it was wide note that  while real gdp advanc at a    percent annual rate in the first quarter  more than   percentag point of the increas reflect less rapid liquid of inventori   corpor earn rough met expect  but the guidanc about profit for the remaind of the year was seen as disappoint   in reaction  the broader stock market was off   percent over the intermeet period  and the tech heavi nasdaq drop an even larger    percent   you could be forgiven then if  upon open the may  book  you suffer some cognit disson  the staff project for real gdp this year is about unchang  and our forecast for next year was strengthen a bit   moreov  the project growth of final sale was rais both this year and next   we boost again the growth of labor product and lower our forecast for inflat   more growth and less inflat would look like a pretti favor combin from the perspect of the central bank   so how do we reconcil the market   s appar reaction to the  incom inform and our   in brief  we believ that there has been a consider converg in econom outlook  with  at least in this case  the market have move a long way toward our view about the near term economi   at the  e of the march meet  market appar read econom develop as like to requir a much more substanti tighten of monetari polici than we had assum   the recent news has led them to remov a substanti fraction of that tighten   and  while fed fund futur continu to price in more tighten than we have assum  the gap between us has  narrow consider over the past seven week    est you interpret these remark as signal some new found confid on our part that event are unfold exact as expect  i should quick turn to the    percent annual rate increas in real gdp now es  for the first quarter   that figur is about   percentag point stronger than we had anticip in march  with most of the surpris account for by the more rapid taper off of inventori liquid that i mention earlier   in broad term  the recent read on industri product support the view that the inventori correct under way for more than a year is wind down   last week   s labor market report and avail physic product data point to an increas in ip of about   percentag point in april   after a year and a half of near steadi declin  output has increas everi month this year  and read on new order from purchas manag and report from our busi contact all seem consist with a recoveri of modest dimens in the manufactur sector   but our upward surpris on first quarter gdp was not limit to inventori invest  final demand increas     percent at an annual rate  about    percentag point fa  than we had anticip   stronger growth of consum outlay and residenti construct more than offset somewhat weaker busi invest   despit these general posit develop  we believ there are reason for anticip a sharp slow in real gdp growth in the current quarter   with firm have appar move product into closer align with sale alreadi  we see less upward impetus to activ from inventori invest go forward   moreov  some of the strength we have seen in final sale most like was borrow from the futur   warm and dri weather allow some homebuild to be shift into the winter  and we expect hous start to slip somewhat dure the spring   a similar weather relat shift probabl occur in state and local construct   last  defens spend was ramp up sharpli in the first quarter   about    percent at an annual rate   and while we don   t expect that to be revers  we are not look for such larg increas to be repeat   all told  we expect growth of real gdp to drop back to a   percent annual pace in the current quarter   perhap the biggest news for our forecast was not the spend data themselv but their implic for the recent perform of product   my one small consol for the error that we have made of late is that  if we had come to you last fall with a forecast that labor product would increas at annual rate of      percent and     percent  respect  in the fourth and first quarter  you like would not have allow me and my colleagu to keep our job long enough to see these recent figur   of cours  now that these increas have come to pass  i recogn that our job secur may rest on an abil to explain them    laughter   to give you a hint about my view of our success in this endeavor  i can report that neither i nor my colleagu have undertaken ani substanti financi commit in recent month   let me frame the discuss by consid two possibl altern   one explan for the jump in product is that surpris at the strength of demand and linger caution concern the durabl of the expans have led busi to be   eluct to boost payrol   as a consequ  they have respond to the recent strength in demand by squeez more out of their exist workforc   temporarili boost product well abov it sustain level   accord to this stori  there are limit to how long firm can sustain these demand on their exist workforc without suffer a deterior in moral  a reduct in the qualiti of output  or slippag in normal mainten activ   at some point  firm will need to add to payrol   an altern hypothesi is that all of the recent surg repres an improv in structur product  if not in growth rate term at least in level term   perhap even if firm were at first surpris by the strength of demand  they now may have found that they can do more with less  without experienc some of the drawback i just mention   accord  there will be no necessari catch up of hire down the road   unfortun  the avail evid simpli isn   t clear on these hypothes   on the first proposit  a survey conduct by the nation associ of busi economist report that busi were inde surpris by the recent strength of demand and they respond by extract more product from their exist workforc rather than rais employ   howev  the result of a similar quizz of beig book contact can be read as consider more ambigu on this proposit  and neither of these report shed much light on the sustain of the recent gain in product   with respect to the second hypothesi  while a statist examin of the recent behavior of product find evid in favor of an improv in structur product  it view the probabl as exceed low that all of the increas in actual product in the past two quarter has been structur   inde  such a two quarter increas in structur product would be unpreced accord to the model   as you know from read the  book  we onc again took the middl ground   we have interpret the surpris perform as signal that growth in structur labor product has been and will be stronger than we had assum earlier   but we did not revis up our es  to the full extent suggest by a mechan read of our statist model  in larg measur becaus we think the recent read on product need to be view with some caution until they have  been through an annual revis or two   as a consequ  even with the upward revis that we have made  actual labor product is es  to have risen abov it structur level  impli that  if our output forecast is correct  busi will need to do some hire in the period ahead   last friday   s employ report for april provid tentat evid that an improv in labor market condit has been under way   privat payrol increas        in april  and declin in the preced month were much smaller than occur last fall   in addit  more industri ad worker than cut them last month for the first  e in over a year   help suppli employ rose sharpli for a second month  and job loss in manufactur have taper off consider   still  despit those favor develop  aggreg hour work came in a bit below our expect   becaus we would be inclin at this point to hold to our   percent   dp forecast for the current quarter  those weaker hour will show through yet again  to fa  product growth   our updat es  call for an increas of about     percent at an annual rate   about   percentag point more than in the  book   look ahead  our forecast of the growth in real gdp for the second half of the year is about unchang at     percent  and we have rais project growth to    percent in          percentag point more than in our previous forecast   taken alon  the revis that we made to structur product suggest an even larger upward adjust to real gdp   but there were some import offset   a lower trajectori for the stock market   about   percent across the board    impli greater save and less consumpt  all els be equal   in addit  we have read the incom data and industri report as suggest that the recoveri in capit spend for high tech equip will take slight longer to develop than we had earlier anticip   and higher vacanc rate and softer rent impli that nonresidenti build face an even greater retrench this year   with the upward revis we have made to the suppli side of our forecast exceed those made to the demand side  we es  that the economi has had and will have a larger margin of excess capac than previous project   as a consequ  we have revis down a bit our forecast for inflat over the next year and a half   core pce price are expect to increas    percent both this year and next   virtual all of the major measur of total and core inflat have move lower over the past year   and with structur product improv and hour labor compens deceler  we see few sign of ani notabl inflat pressur develop dure the forecast period   lower inflat and a larger output gap in this forecast led us to push off and nudg down our path for the feder fund rate   but our basic stori hasn   t chang much   with real rate set at veri accommod level and with anoth dose of fiscal s ulus be appli to the economi this year  we continu to expect that the recent inventori led strengthen of activ will give way to a percept strengthen of final sale by the fourth quarter of this year   we still project that a gradual tighten of monetari polici will be necessari at that point to prevent the economi from overshoot and thus preserv low inflat beyond the forecast horizon   qualit  the downsid risk to the project seem much the same as they have been for over a year   will the consum continu to spend  and will corpor profit pick up enough to make busi comfort with expand their capit spend   with respect to household  there are no sign that consum are about to give out   sen ent remain high  and consum continu to spend on new vehicl  mani other type of durabl good  and home   the job pictur is begin to improv  and by our forecast the unemploy rate is near a peak   so  while this is a concern and warrant monitor  the household sector seem less vulner than it was four or five month ago   larger concern remain about the condit of the busi sector   profit have turn up  and capit spend appear to have   tabil  but whether they will improv to the extent that we have project is still an open question   even the modest rebound we have project for corpor profit could be seen as a disappoint to market and to firm  with negat feedback for household and busi spend   but there are upsid risk  too   busi sen ent has not been a veri inform lead indic over the past coupl of year   busi fail to anticip the sharp slow of activ that took place over the past year and a half  find themselv caught with excess inventori and an overhang of capit   and after the attack of septemb     they slash employ and product in anticip of a slowdown in demand that never occur   it seem possibl that  with the current level of profit remain so depress  they are look back more than forward   invest often lag in a recoveri  and it recent lacklust perform is not atyp   s ul macro polici and the natur tendenc of the economi to restor it equilibrium may provid more of a kick to activ than either we or busi peopl current recogn   i   ll now turn the floor over to   to continu our present
as we report in the  book  we have revis up slight sinc march the outlook for real output growth abroad over the remaind of this year   for some of our foreign trade partner  we were react to the most recent  evid that had surpris us on the posit side   for other  we interpret the chang made in the outlook for the u s  economi as like to pass through to fa  growth abroad over the forecast period   in our analysi  the rebound in the global economi hing on the project strength in u s  econom activ   past eas of monetari polici abroad is also an import support factor   in a few case  with canada be the most import exampl  foreign central bank have start to withdraw some of this s ulus as the pace of activ improv   with somewhat mix feel and a good deal of worri  we found the courag to lower our project path for the exchang valu of the dollar from that in the march  book   we continu our recent practic of a    straight line    approach for the dollar path from current valu as again we see rough offset upsid and downsid potenti for the dollar over the forecast period  but a review of the factor that led us to adjust down the dollar about   percent for the weight averag and against sever of the major currenc should convinc you that we did consid altern    first  market develop sinc the march fomc meet have vari across differ currenc but have general been in the downward direct for the dollar  the nomin index for the major currenc has fallen about     percent   within that set of currenc  the dollar has depreci the most  about   percent  against the swiss franc  which seem to be attract safe haven flow  and the euro  more than     percent    it has declin least against the canadian dollar  less than     percent   despit strong econom data for the first quarter in canada   in term of our broad index  which includ our other import trade partner  the dollar has depreci   uch less  but that result includ a veri sharp drop in the nomin valu of the argentin peso   in addit  the dollar has risen more than   percent vis  vis the mexican peso over the intermeet period   revis down the project path of the dollar fit a    random walk    strategi and is consist with the long  sad histori of analyst  includ ourselv  fail to find structur explan for exchang rate determin that outperform a random  walk   but i think we were react to more than just the actual market move   in recent week  a tone in the market has surfac that perhap the dollar has turn a corner and that investor are now less will to add to their dollar hold than they  have been over the past few year   perceiv pressur from the u s  manufactur sector and the decis on protect for the steel industri have rais doubt about the administr   s commit to the so call strong dollar polici   secretari o   neill   s tes oni last week was the occas of addit market reaction and downward pressur on the dollar   the larg u s  extern imbal seem to be draw renew attent  although market particip have not been react to the trade data per se   inde  the employ report of last friday and the implic that the u s  economi is less robust than previous thought was a greater caus for dollar weak than the latest trade releas had been   after year of rais warn sign about the unsustain of the u s  current account deficit  it would be easi for those of us in the divis of intern financ to exagger the signific of these recent market develop  howev  we have tri to guard against do that as experi has made us wari  the intermeet movement of the dollar have general onli retrac it gain sinc about novemb in term of nomin valu against other industri countri currenc   our forecast call for u s  real output growth to exceed averag foreign growth substanti   if u s  product growth remain high and asset valu are sustain  global investor could continu to regard invest opportun here as superior to those elsewher   last  we have troubl write down a signific depreci in the dollar becaus we have a hard  e identifi against which currenc the dollar might move sharpli   a    percent appreci of the yen in term of the dollar would  move it beyond the level at which japanes author not long ago indic their concern by interven   in our view  the present state of the japanes economi is not consist with signific yen appreci as it would remov the scope for some  stabil and then improv of product in the japanes economi   we  cannot pictur how market forc would come togeth to push the yen up under current circumst   the upsid potenti that we see in the dollar is import in term of the yen  the unresolv problem within the japanes economi could well lead to a return of yen depreci   there would seem to be scope for appreci of the euro   but there have not been mani posit surpris come from the euro area recent   demand from  labor in germani and itali seem to be worri market   and there are still no sign   f an acceler in product similar to what we have seen in the unit state  so we believ that the euro could equal well move up or move down from it current valu   on balanc  we have taken a cautious approach   it would seem foolish not to acknowledg the recent market move  but it would seem rash to extrapol them  into the futur   we remain convinc that an adjust of the u s  extern balanc will becom necessari at some point   the capit inflow need to financ prospect deficit cannot continu to expand forev   it seem probabl that an extern adjust will entail some declin in the valu of the dollar   but whether we are now see the begin of that process  we do not know   let me conclud by briefli updat you on develop in argentina  negoti with the imf are effect at a standstil  although presid duhald has again appeal for intern assist   the argentin polit process has been unabl to date to resolv the major

this to uncertainti aris from it upcom presidenti elect   that complet our remark   we   d be happi to answer question
do you construct a major currenc forward index on the basi of the futur market
we don   t  but we could   the interest differenti is avail  i think  for all the piec   we look at the forward euro  and we look at the forward yen  i think we could do that for the other major currenc
what i was think about is that if you   re go to make a project of an extend move in the dollar  as you say  it has to be in individu currenc   if we   re come into a period of dollar eros  i think it probabl would be use to see what an ongo index of that natur would look like   there are enough currenc for which extend forward market exist to be abl to creat such an index   most of the rate are actual avail to us
so it might not be a bad idea just to keep an eye on that becaus if the market begin to deterior  especi the forward market  it would be use to know where the deterior is and where the pressur are  just sort of audit
but as you well know  the yen is go to be an issu becaus the interest differenti is go to say that the market expect the yen to appreci a lot
i   m sorri  what   the interest rate differenti have to do with this calcul
i thought you ask me for forward rate    hairman  span   yes  forward   this is for currenc
but there   s an interest arbitrag condit
no  there   s a forward market out there
but it   s ident at the horizon of the interest rate differenti
onli to the extent that it is fulli cover   the point is that we have a futur market
we can use the futur market  yes
well  that   s what i   m talk about   i   m not talk about interest rate differenti   i   m talk about the futur market   so the interest rate differenti are automat built in
but there   s no way that the arbitrag opportun of trade in the futur market and then long end and short end bond
no  forget arbitrag   i   m just tri to get a simpl weight averag of futur price in currenc
we   ll construct one
it   s a weight price index   what am i miss here
mr  chairman  i think the evid is that the interest arbitrag condit hold veri close for these currenc where you have free capit movement
i understand that   but that   s automat built into the forward rate
that   s my point   if we know the interest differenti  we know the forward rate    hairman  span   that   s true   but if you know how to get from here to across the street direct  whi would you go around the block   i don   t get it   whi go through an extra calcul when you   ve got the number
we can take that number  but what i   m say is that the exist of the arbitrag opportun would lead some peopl to go around the block if that were profit  so i think you can be certain
i don   t want to make a profit  i just want to see a number   laughter
i understand that  too  what i   m say to you  though  is that other peopl do want to make a profit and therefor we can assum
i   m not go to show them this index    laughter
might i suggest that until we construct the index the chairman want we don   t realli know whether it   s go to tell us veri much   so whi don   t we construct it and see if it   s use
yes   basic it will pick up by implic the averag interest rate differenti   but the question is about convert it into individu currenc  which is what we want to find out
we will map the forward rate and futur rate and look at them
i didn   t think it was go to be a struggl   i thought i was ask a rhetor question      i notic that in discuss the product issu you rais a question about it current level   is that relat to the issu of the disrupt effect of capit expenditur on the product level   in other word  are you argu that  with capit expenditur go down  the associ adjust cost diminish and  therefor you   re   ndicat where the structur level of product would be after take account of the lower level of capit invest
that could be one interpret of how we got to the higher product level that we   re show in this forecast   what i was realli refer to was an argument about whether or not the current level of product that busi have reach are sustain just by dint of firm continu to push their exist workforc as hard as they are do current   at least in some firm where signific layoff have occur over the last year  peopl have pick up the work of the person who had been sit in the cubicl next to them but disappear in the layoff   it   s conceiv that this is sustain  as i indic   but it   s also conceiv that there could be advers effect on moral over  e   and in the case of retail establish  for exampl  it could veri well mean fewer cashier and longer checkout line   a store might get away with do that for a while  but over  e the qualiti of the servic  be provid might go down   or in some case  when firm push product higher they might also be put off some kind of mainten activ that they might normal undertak   they can do that for a while  but they also can   t necessarili sustain that
we are now approxim seven month into this process  are we get anecdot evid that peopl are stress  that they   re work too hard   i don   t see that in the newspap   we usual pick up that kind of stori
actual  there was an articl in busi week last week on exact that issu   there were some anecdot in that articl indic that this was go on   larri   point out to me ye day that in the beig book there was a report from our colleagu in atlanta  use home depot as an exampl  that the firm had been surpris by the consequ of their workforc reduct   they had realli cut back on the number of worker   hey had go into the winter season and then suffer in the sens that they thought they were lose busi becaus checkout line had increas signific   so there are shred of evid
but shred are not conclus
i agre   but what we   re struggl with at this point is  as i said  that it   s veri difficult to hypothes that all of this increas in product we have seen has been structur
well  i think it   s imposs
that would be a veri signific increas   so what we   ve done in the forecast is to assum that under product has been better over the past sever year and will continu to be better over the forecast period than we had previous expect   but even with that upward shift in the level and the trend of product  we still can   t get around the fact that the actual level of product appear to be exceed even that more op ist trend  we think that mean that there is go to be a slow improv in overal labor market condit   some modest pickup in hire   and i believ we   ve actual seen that over the last six or seven month   we   ve gone from veri steep declin in payrol employ to a situat now that look like stabil  with a few lead indic suggest that condit might be improv go forward   but even there  the evid is veri slim   the current level of initi claim for unemploy insur would be consist with at best veri small posit increas in payrol employ   so unless we see some improv there  that would cast further doubt upon the stori of how quick the labor market might begin to improv
and it   s veri difficult to find signific indic that  the data are themselv a problem   in fact  we have three independ sourc of hour   we   bviousli have the formal hour that we creat out of the payrol system   we have the household hour number  which look veri much the same or if anyth impli even a higher degre of product   and of cours  the initi claim   a system that is wholli independ    again indic similar data on the lack of labor input
i would note that in addit to that we also have measur of output from the product side  from the incom side  and from industri product
no matter how we put those data togeth  in whatev combin  we look at them we see a signific acceler in product over the last coupl of quarter
yes   there is no evid that the statist discrep is a big issu   part of the gdp data  as you point out  are hard data   for exampl  we have full coverag of the motor vehicl industri for all practic purpos   the data would have to be tortur to alter the path signific   so this is a veri fascin dilemma  which may get resolv  as you say  by later revis   but it can   t get resolv veri great unless there are revis in some of the data that don   t strike me as revis   and i gather that  if anyth  the hour figur for the most recent histor period will be revis downward becaus of the  unemploy insur benchmark number   minus         was it
yes  rough speak   it was a small revis  but still a downward revis
that   s still a direct   so  it   s realli an extraordinari dilemma   further question   presid parri
dave  in the baselin forecast you assum that the price of equiti would increas through the end of next year   in view of the concern about corpor earn   nd also the fact that almost everi valuat model suggest that equiti market are overvalu  i wonder if you could elabor a bit on the reason whi that assumpt was chosen
well  as you know  over  e we have struggl with what a neutral assumpt mean for the stock market   at  e when we were more confid in our view that the market was overvalu  we just project a flat nomin rate   with the equiti premium have move back up some distanc and with forward price earn ratio   at least in our forecast   have come down some  we were in the territori where we thought a neutral assumpt at this point would be more in line with the risk adjust return on equiti equal to that on bond  we calcul that increas in equiti price to be about   percent   it may be  say  a     percent ten year bond rate and a    percent equiti premium built into this forecast   take off about     percentag point from that for the dividend yield  and that now give us an equiti price increas of rough   percent   we   re just put that down as a kind of neutral assumpt  and obvious we   ve had surpris on both side of our stock market forecast over the last sever forecast   some up and now some down   so  i feel comfort with that   if we were to show someth like a flat stock market in this forecast rather than the gradual increas that we have  we   d probabl be knock about   of a percentag point off of gdp growth next year  which would be anoth tenth on the unemploy rate
this is a question that stem from a comment my wal mart contact made to me ye day   appar there   s a longshoremen   s contract on the west coast that expir  on june    and i didn   t know whether you were awar of that or not   he said that wal mart feel there   s a       chanc of a strike by those longshoremen some  in june and in anticip of   hat they plan some accumul of inventori of import good   they bring in a lot of their merchandis from asia   that would obvious affect some of the short run dynam of both inventori and import   i thought that might be go on  and i wonder if you knew anyth about that situat
i don   t  and we haven   t incorpor it in this forecast   so obvious that   s someth we   ll want to take a look at
we do know what wal mart   s inventori level are  or at least i presum that we could es  them reason well
this wouldn   t necessarili be a top line gdp figur   it may be someth that   would need to take account of in her import forecast
all i   m say is that it could distort the number that we   re look at in term of both inventori and import   and if that is happen  we need to know that
further question   if not  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the stori from the seventh district is veri much the same as in march   our economi is recov  but i   m hear a lot of mix messag from my contact   there   s a good deal of concern as to whether the rebound will have leg  manufactur in the district continu to improv  led by inventori rebuild   the chicago fed   s midwest manufactur index has been rise sinc novemb   the under demand for construct materi is strong  and inventori rebuild is boost product in the steel and auto sector   inde  automak continu to be bullish   most have rais their       forecast onc again and are current look for a strong year  with sale in the neighborhood of      million to      million for light vehicl   despit these posit develop  we   re still hear onli a few scatter report of increas in capit spend  in fact  capit spend plan by firm in the district are best describ as weak  in march i report that consum spend in our region appear to be lag the rest of the nation   some of our retail sector contact indic that sinc then activ in the midwest has outperform other region   but read from our tourism and entertain sector are still mix   the head of a specialti retail furnitur and home furnish chain who is typic quit pessimist report that over the last two month busi was roar   on the other hand  apparel and depart store sale have been veri weak dure this period   construct activ is hold up well in our region   residenti construct is report to have soften modest  but this  sn   t appear to be surpris anyon  given the earlier strength   nonresidenti vacanc rate appear to be stabil  in part becaus some firm that had been plan to subleas their space now find that they need it after all  labor market are behav as we would expect at the outset of an econom expans  firm are still hesit to hire new perman worker  but layoff announc are slow  and some plan layoff have been put on hold   the two major temporari help firm headquart in our district are see fair robust demand  particular from manufactur  moreov  preliminari result from the soon to be releas manpow survey show a signific increas in hire intent for the third quarter   this is true for the midwest and for the nation as a whole   that inform is confidenti until may     when the final survey result are releas    urn to the nation outlook  we   re still face with balanc the short term concern over how much momentum there is in final demand against the long run inflationari consequ of prolong the current accommod stanc of monetari polici   gdp growth in the first quarter was fa  than we had expect in march   we   re all quit familiar with the special factor that rais gdp growth  but the good news was the strength in household spend  as   mention in his brief   howev  i still do not feel that the uncertainti regard the strength of final demand has been resolv   on the upsid  the possibl that deterior labor market could spill over and depress household spend appear to be less of a risk   and the product news continu to be impress   on the downsid  the outlook for capit spend has not improv   in that regard it still look like a lacklust year   there appear to be littl op  about demand in the recent earn report from high tech firm   and  as i mention earlier  our busi contact remain cautious about undertak new invest   in addit  the run up in oil price is a negat for household purchas power and busi profit  on balanc  the most like outcom is for real gdp growth averag close to it potenti rate over the remaind of the year  although this is by no mean certain   given this scenario  the issu of when to becom somewhat less accommod requir particular care thought   although we do not have to move today  the well known lag of monetari polici requir that we begin move soon   we know that as the expans take hold  busi will be turn around at somewhat differ rate and differ  e   busi peopl are see the recoveri from a varieti of sector perspect  and that explain the mix tone of the messag that i mention earlier   given the mild recess and the moder expans that   e anticip  these anecdot probabl will continu to be mix for some  e  even as we start to rais rate   we put in a good deal of insur against the potenti econom fallout from  septemb  l   so in contrast with some earlier interest rate cycl  it may be relat easi to explain and undertak the first tranch of rate hike

thank you  mr  chairman   probabl the best indic that econom activ in the region continu to improv gradual  yet busi peopl remain veri cautious  is the widespread increas in the demand for temporari worker   like      we have heard more about that recent  especi from advisori council member and from other contact  than we had prior to this  e   the temp agenc report that start in march they experienc a signific pickup in both work order and inquiri about temporari worker  some report of recal of previous laid off worker by truck and ship compani also   uggest that this year will be better at least for that industri than last year  which wouldn   t be veri hard at all becaus they realli had a bad year last year  i   ll relat one good news bad news stori about employ in the bank sector   one of the region   s largest bank announc plan to hire       peopl this year in the greater cleveland metropolitan area alon  that sound good to everyon except to the rest of us in the bank industri in the area who are all wonder where that bank is go to be abl to get the peopl it claim to want   i   ll be watch my turnov number  at our april board of director meet  a director report that a larg furnitur retail said that march had been the best month on record  after a dismal year last year and a dismal januari and februari  that   s similar to what     was hear in his district   our contact said that the improv main reflect an increas in sale of offic furnitur to commerci custom   we follow up on that by contact a number of offic furnitur manufactur in the region  and most report the same pattern   januari and februari sale were dismal  continu the declin that had start in the fall of       howev  in march and earli april they saw the first uptick in order in almost a year and a half for some of them  we also contact applianc manufactur who most produc for the residenti market   first quarter sale and earn were up sharpli  and sale forecast for the year have now been rais   one firm report that effort were alreadi under way to add full  e worker in order to cut back on over    a manufactur of high end tool  not necessarili high technolog equip but the high end tool that labor worldwid use for all sort of purpos  report that throughout the second half of       even befor septemb     their year to year sale were off veri sharpli in north america   so what they character as a slight increas in year over year sale in the first quarter was encourag   nevertheless  all   apit spend plan for this year will be in foreign countri   and that   s foreign product for foreign market  not for re import into the unit state  at a recent meet of our small busi advisori council  none of the particip had plan to invest to    increas capac      that was the way they character it   most complain of be in industri with excess capac   becaus their competitor are all over invest  i guess   yet a major plan to invest in equip that will increas their own product and effici  allow them to increas their own output with the same or even fewer product worker   what we were hear in part was that some of them were say they had surpris themselv at how much output they were abl to produc   they simpli didn   t know how product the capit they had previous put in place was until the demand spurt hit them  on the subject of compens  all who spoke to the issu claim that product increas continu to be greater than wage increas   agricultur is one exampl of a sector that i don   t normal have in mind when think about major chang in product or technolog   but the head of a larg hog rais oper in northwest ohio told us that becaus of the advanc technic skill now requir in the ag sector   and he describ some of the veri sophist equip that they use   all their recent hire have been colleg graduat  he now has a full  e recruit visit colleg campus to get farm worker   and he recent has been give wage increas of up to    percent in order to retain employe  on the nation economi  everyth i   m see and hear is consist with a pictur of an economi that is expand  although with neither the boom condit impli in the commerc depart   s first quarter preliminari number nor the slowdown shown in the  book   s second quarter project   my belief that growth is somewher between those two number lead me to the conclus that the natur rate of interest is rise  even though i would   ot be abl to pinpoint it with ani degre of accuraci   and in my view a    percent overnight  interbank rate is not consist with a nonacceler rate of inflat   in a situat with compet paradigm  where one is the observ unemploy rate or some measur of the output gap versus some notion of the natur rate of unemploy and the other is the observ structur of nomin interest rate versus some notion of the natur rate of interest  i   m much more comfort with the latter   it say that a posit product surpris   not reduc inflat potenti   it   s quit the opposit becaus of the endogen element of what happen to the stanc of monetari polici  as policymak we must choos between those paradigm  at least implicit  and i would like to do so explicit   the measur unemploy rate versus the es  of the natur rate say we   re still in a disinflationari environ   i don   t believ that   the observ nomin interest rate versus various es  of the natur rate   or what some peopl like to call the real rate of interest   say that the current stanc of polici is reinflationari   one has to choos   listen to my director and advisori council member  i have the impress that busi peopl view the current stanc of monetari polici as high expansionari and fulli expect that it will becom less so in the month ahead   for them it   s onli a question of when we start a seri of action to increas the overnight rate   for mani it will be a relief onc we final get start  and it will reduc a sourc of current uncertainti   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet in march i report that econom recoveri was take shape in the third district   that recoveri continu  albeit at  a moder pace   i spent the last month travel around our district to a seri of meet with banker and busi peopl   most of these contact told me that they have seen increas   emand in their market and that they believ the worst is over   this was true even in area that tradit have been among the weakest in our district   accord to our busi outlook survey  the region   s manufactur sector improv for the fourth consecut month in april  our index of general activ  new order  and shipment move up   the current inventori index for the last two survey has been close to the two decad averag   this suggest that the  cyclic inventori reduct has like run it cours   inde  the futur inventori index from our april survey rose to the highest read sinc       suggest that firm expect to be rebuild inventori over the next six month   consist with this  the ceo of a larg chemic compani report increas demand for his product  which are input into the product of mani consum durabl  in answer to a special question in our recent busi outlook survey  one third of our respond said that they plan to increas capit spend from current level   the plan increas are modest  and most are expect to occur in the second half of the year   howev  it is worthi of note that onli a few suggest that they were increas spend in respons to the capit expens provis of the newli enact econom s ulus packag   the improv in the region   s manufactur sector has not spur firm to add to their payrol  yet  although the employ declin are less than we   ve seen in the past   overal  employ in each of our three state fell in the first quarter  and the state unemploy rate rose   this weak is like to continu over the next few month  consist with april   s nation employ report releas last friday   but firm are begin to report that they plan to add to their payrol to meet increas demand   mani will be perman hire   this is especi true of retail and servic firm    onsum demand in the district has held up  but pennsylvania sale tax collect indic that retail sale are larg be support by auto sale   hous sale and residenti construct have shown gain in the past few quarter  and strong demand has push up hous price   this has also meant brisk sale for home furnish  as you   ve heard around the tabl  sale of other type of merchandis have been slower to recov   on the other hand  our first quarter south jersey busi survey of retail  servic firm  and manufactur post it first posit read in over a year   and the index of futur sale is at high level  an indic that we may expect a pickup in sale over the next few month  price in a few sector in our region have shown sizabl increas from year ago level  these includ hous and medic cost  as we all know   nevertheless  overal consum inflat remain moder  temper by product gain and weak in demand dure the downturn   core cpi inflat in the philadelphia region for the most recent twelv month is  about    percent  just slight abov the nation averag   howev  we have begun to see some sign of rise industri price   the price index from our busi outlook survey are rise after a period of negat read  and the price paid index in our south jersey busi survey has also return to posit territori   i don   t want to overemphas these sign of firm price   nevertheless  they do serv as a remind that  as the recoveri gain momentum  the committe will need to take step to prevent an acceler in inflat next year and beyond  my view on the nation economi are consist with what i   ve seen in the district   the econom data we have receiv dure the intermeet period show that the econom recoveri is under way   earlier indic from our busi outlook survey that manufactur activ was begin to recov are now reflect in both the ism and the industri product number   the  e of the inventori correct push up first quarter growth at some expens   o second quarter growth  but under demand has strengthen sinc our last meet  inde  final sale came in stronger than expect in the first quarter  and i   m not convinc that we will see much chang this quarter   the  book forecast of final sale growth of less than   percent seem a bit too low to me  one upsid risk in the near term concern import   if the dollar continu to depreci  import growth could be weaker and domest product stronger than assum by the  book   the april employ report came in below expect  but the weak in labor market should come as no big surpris   cyclic compon of both employ and unemploy typic lag gdp by a quarter or two   note that the rapid product growth we have seen mean slower growth in employ  but it also mean a more rapid recoveri in profit   i don   t think the rise in oil price we   ve seen over the last two month is suffici in magnitud to affect our outlook  although i believ recoveri is under way  i do have some concern   at our last meet a major question was the outlook for capit spend   it remain uncertain   the march data on nondefens capit good were a disappoint  and the capac util rate are still at low level  so firm might delay capit spend if sale and earn slow   this could  in fact  stall the recoveri   on the posit side  our survey data suggest some improv in the outlook for capit spend   anoth hope sign is that capac util has been rise sinc decemb  and the chang in util is associ with futur spend on equip and softwar  with a one quarter ahead correl of     by our es   my feel is that we   re in a transit and that the next few month will be t i  employ growth was low this month  and gdp growth is like to be weaker this quarter than last   still  the ul  polici question   not concern what the economi   over the   ext quarter but where the economi is head by the end of the year   the tradeoff between short run and long run concern will determin when the committe must take the first and inevit step on the path toward neutral   weak in the labor market and a benign inflat outlook give the committe some  e to wait   howev  histor forecast have typic underes  the effect of polici on the economi   this bear rememb  given our current veri accommod polici stanc   thank you  mr  chairman
excus me  what was the     correl between
the     was a one quarter ahead correl between the chang in capac util and futur spend on equip and softwar
in manufactur capit expenditur
yes  spend on equip and softwar
yes  the cyclic compon

mr  chairman  econom condit in the southeast are improv margin but at the same  e remain quit mix   sever sector began the second quarter with modest growth or sign of improv  wherea some other area continu to display signific weak   for exampl  retail sale rose modest in march  but region auto sale continu to disappoint relat to nation sale  with the except of foreign maker  who report healthi gain   while the overal residenti hous market remain strong in most part of our district  most of the builder and realtor report sign of soften in select price segment and select geograph region   commerci real estat market continu to suffer from weak demand  and there are few sign that that will chang any  soon   in atlanta the   ffice vacanc rate is now at    percent   as a consequ  rental rate are fall  and substanti incent are be offer in the form of free rent and higher build out allow  the tourism and hospit industri continu to improv   the outlook for the summer is posit and resort and theme park are have troubl fill both season and nonseason job such as wait staff  secur worker  and housekeep   disney has open for some      posit  and royal pacif resort in orlando is set to hire about       worker   busi travel  howev  has yet to come back   report to us from delta airlin indic that load factor on the high margin tradit busi rout remain well below those for tourist destin   as an asid  the effect of septemb    and the declin in travel to florida help to explain the lag perform of district domest auto sale that i note earlier   the lag sale turn out to be concentr in florida and are driven by lower fleet sale of rental car  manufactur and manufactur employ remain weak   there are meager sign of improv on the manufactur employ side  as some laid off worker at some plant are be recal and the pace of job cut has slow   our grow southern auto industri  which consist main of foreign produc  has been a sourc of employ strength   but this  reflect more secular rather than cyclic factor   our contact at nissan report that it hire for a new plant a number of mainten engin recent laid off at nearbi paper mill  the grow popular of nissan   s al a model has requir the addit of an extra hour to each day shift at the assembl plant in smyrna  tennesse  dure april   in may that assembl line is schedul to go from work one to two saturday a month to keep up with order   similar  reflect increas demand by truck compani   built motor compani in tennesse is rehir about     worker and more than doubl product at it heavi truck plant  thus revers a seri of layoff and product cut dure        this demand  howev  is   pparent relat to an attempt to avoid the impact of tighter epa regul slate to go into effect octob   that would increas the cost of tractor by   to    percent   as a result of all this auto and truck assembl activ  part supplier in the region are also expand their output and employ   overal  howev  district employ remain flat   and consist with the most recent nation labor market report  which came out last friday  our firm report that what new hire is take place involv most ad more temporari worker and increas hour  a pattern other have alreadi report  we also receiv report that firm are econom on labor by spread out it project  which have previous been done simultan with a larger workforc   not onli are firm manag their workforc care  there   s grow evid that it wage are becom more flexibl downward   some contract it firm have indic that they are eas out higher paid technic peopl by encourag them to take lower pay from custom rather than face be laid off   have said that  district unemploy remain below that of the nation and in march was about     percent  on the nation front  the puzzl remain as to what the path of the recoveri will look like and the speed with which growth will return to potenti   i find myself about where i was in march on this point and my concern are virtual ident to those i express at that  e  will the strength in hous and consum demand continu to support the economi until the inventori liquid cycl end   when will busi invest turn around   and how much s ulus from previous eas of monetari polici and increas in govern spend last year remain in the system   furthermor  i find few clue in the recent gdp number to answer these question   it provid littl hint of forward momentum in the economi and  in fact  probabl rais more question than it answer   the boost from inventori  reflect a slower   ace of liquid  tell us veri littl about when busi will actual begin to rebuild inventori   consist with this  our contact suggest that at least some firm are cut order from abroad and continu to move toward greater relianc on just in  e inventori manag by place smaller order more frequent with domest supplier   consumpt spend was off signific from the     percent pace of the fourth quarter   the   percent declin in durabl was near offset by the increas in nondur spend   so the net on the consumpt side was account for by a     percent increas in servic     this portend less  support from consumpt go forward  it   s also still my view that we should expect onli a modest contribut from residenti construct   the recent slow that we   re see in some segment of that market rais question about how much growth can come from that sector   final  with state govern feel more and more fiscal pressur and have alreadi drawn heavili on their raini day fund  and revenu windfal  can we count on addit to aggreg demand from that sector  as for polici concern  sinc we can   t do anyth to chang the near term outlook  we must by necess be more forward look   i was among those who note last  e that rate current are unsustain low and that they will soon need to begin to rise   the question is whether now is the  e   i have two worri  but when i balanc them out i would argu that it is not   first  i   m concern about our extens polici eas last year when combin with the recent rise in energi price   if polici is too easi and if energi price were to continu to increas  is there a risk that we won   t act to tighten polici becaus of perceiv risk to the real economi   is there a risk that by not tighten in such circumst we would unintent convert a relat energi price increas into an across the board increas in price more general   that is what happen in the     s   the onli differ is that energi price rose   nd we then eas polici wherea this  e polici was eas  admit for other reason  and then energi price rose   given the lag in polici  i see littl differ in the ul  consequ for inflat  my second concern  though  is that  if we tighten polici preemptiv  there is the risk that we could damag prospect in the key segment of the real economi we   re count on to move the economi forward  name hous  invest  and consum spend  all of which  are interest rate sensit   the altern simul we   ve investig  includ those from our own model and those in the  book  are still fair op ist   howev  they may look less so if we get a combin of the flatter invest spend and lower product growth scenario that are in the  book  which i think is certain possibl   that   s not a scenario we would want to help materi   so at this  e i think preemptiv tighten would be a riski strategi   as other have said  we seem to have  e to let thing play out a bit more and get the situat in better focus befor we begin the inevit polici revers   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the inform we   re get on the fifth district economi current is quit consist with the nation pictur paint in the  book   growth at the nation level for now is be driven primarili by diminish  liquid of good inventori  and the same seem clear to be true in our region   in some contrast to your region  cathi  manufactur is realli the strongest sector in our district  factori order and shipment have been rise for sever month   and like jerri  we   ve seen signific strength in the last sever week in the furnitur industri   i   ve been more or less attach that to the strength in hous  but other forc along the line of what you talk about may be at   ork as well   most manufactur we   re in contact with are reason op ist that their product will continu to increas over the near term   elsewher in the district economi the pictur is much more mix   retail sale soften in april   we don   t see ani signific upsw in busi capit spend   on the other hand  new home construct and sale are still quit solid   so again  what we   re see in the fifth district i would say basic reinforc the  book   s overal portray of nation condit and   not in ani way present a realli diverg view  with respect to the nation economi  the  book project a steadi increas in the growth of final demand   at least as measur by the growth of privat final domest purchas    through the project period   i think that   s a reason point forecast   after all  real pce grew at a healthi rate of     percent in the first quarter   and while busi fix  invest did contract again  the rate of contract was the smallest sinc the first quarter of last year   so again  a moder but steadi acceler of final demand is certain a plausibl project  but as alway there are risk in ani forecast  and i think there are risk in this forecast   in particular  job growth remain weak in april   payrol employ grew by onli        job last month  well below the trend growth in the labor forc   earlier report of increas in job in both februari and march have subsequ been revis away  and the index of aggreg hour work appear like to fall again in the current quarter as it did in the first quarter   even as job growth stay sluggish in april  the labor forc expand signific  drive the unemploy rate up to   percent   and not surpris in this situat  the soften labor compens that we saw begin last year continu in april    ow for me these labor market develop pose at least two signific downsid risk   first  obvious  rise unemploy could undermin consum confid by creat doubt about job secur   you mention job secur  dave  i actual think the downsid risk  from rise unemploy could be broader than that if it constrain real wage and incom growth   second  labor market slack may fo  disinfl  which would increas the real fund rate   inde  there is alreadi evid of disinfl in the work   for exampl  in the data for the core pce   between novemb      and novemb       the core pce increas     percent  over the period sinc then  which is about six month  it has risen at a rate of onli     percent   if that   percentag point disinfl were to persist  it would eventu translat into a   percentag point increas in the real fund rate  other thing be equal   moreov  the interplay of slack labor market and rise product compound the disinfl risk in my view   product grew at a     percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and appar at an extraordinari     percent rate in the first quarter   much of that  as we   ve discuss  undoubt was cyclic and won   t persist   nonetheless  such strong growth in measur product suggest that the under trend may be at or abov the     to   percent averag annual rate achiev back in the late     s   consequ  given the weak in labor market  we may be face a situat where product growth remain high enough in relat to wage growth to caus unit labor cost to fall persist go forward  which again in my view would compound the risk of disinfl   to avoid this outcom  aggreg demand would need to grow at least as rapid as product on averag in come quarter to stabil labor market and contain the declin in unit labor cost   but obvious that won   t happen if the current weak in busi invest persist or consum spend soften or both   if aggreg   emand growth did fall behind product growth  labor market condit would continu to deterior  and the disinfl risk would intensifi  i   m well awar  as a number of peopl have said  that our current fund rate target may be as much as   percentag point below the rate consist with long term sustain noninflationari growth when trend product growth may be as high as     or   percent or even higher   as i think jerri mention  if the recoveri gain momentum and household and firm becom more confid that the expans will continu  firm at that point may rush to hire worker and rebuild stock in a way that could threaten inflat   but given our current credibl for low inflat and our demonstr willing sinc the mid     s to tighten  polici prompt and signific when we need to  i think we have leeway to wait until that need aris much more clear than it has to date   so in short  i can accept the risk of be insuffici preemptiv on inflat to address what strike me as substanti downsid risk in the current recoveri   don   t misunderstand me   i   m not argu for a shift in the bias back to eas  but i do think we definit should not make ani move toward a tighter polici today

thank you  mr  chairman   overal the tenor of the anecdot in the ninth district has improv recent   let me just give you a quick rundown of that   hous and residenti construct  which has been a bright spot  remain a bright spot   activ is strong  and sale of upper end home  which had slow for a  e  have pick up dramat recent   auto sale remain healthi   consum spend overal seem reason strong  and peopl are quit op ist about the outlook for the upcom tourist season   report in the mine and energi sector are mix  but report in manufactur have improv recent   and there are some sign of a modest amount of hire go on throughout the district   in respons   o the issu that aros earlier  i have heard no anecdot whatsoev about stress stem from  demand by employ on those current employ to work longer hour or whatev   that kind of anecdot just  sn   t seem to be around   i would say that there is littl anticip of an acceler of inflat   but there are lot of concern about some price  particular insur premium   and final  i   d say that the outlook for nonresidenti construct has in general deterior  on the other hand  this will probabl be a record year for highway construct activ and some relat transport construct  as far as the nation economi is concern  i think we are at the point   we   re alreadi  see this   where we   re go to hear a lot about the fragil of the recoveri   this tend to go with the territori  in my recollect   part of it is just a respons to the natur of the incom data   and part  of cours  it reflect the fundament fact that not all sector of the economi pick up or pick up robust in the same period of  e   i think we should recal that the economi tend to be veri resili  as demonstr by the length and persist and durabl of the last two expans despit some signific shock along the way   have said that  i think the  book forecast is a pretti good place to start as far as the outlook is concern   if i had to make a bet  i might reduc the second half of this year and take a bit off the first half of next year just becaus my instinct is that capit spend will be a littl slower to come along than is anticip in the  book   but i wouldn   t make a big deal of that   in my view the outlook for growth is satisfactori as is the near term outlook for inflat
mr  chairman  earlier you had a dialogu with   about what was the best way to get across the street   sinc my prepar remark are veri brief this morn  let me tell you a joke about that   i heard it as a blond joke  but in defer to cathi i   m go to   hang it to an aggi joke   aggi number one saw his buddi across the street and he yell over     how do you get across the street      aggi number two said     whi do you want to know   you   re alreadi across the street       laughter
i think next  e you better lengthen your remark   laughter
the eleventh district economi is show more sign of strength than were appar at the last meet   in march growth was tepid and tentat  now busi condit overal are a littl stronger   there are fewer sign of backtrack  and prospect for a sustain recoveri seem to have improv   the tone of our beig book respond has definit improv  which give me encourag that the employ gain we   ve seen over the last three month will not get revis away   as i mention last  e  we thought employ in our region was much better than it turn out to be  the preliminari report were wrong becaus of major report error   we had declin employ for three quarter  but in the latest quarter  employ has turn up  have said all this  i must admit that there is no sector in our district economi that is show substanti strength   manufactur has not complet turn the corner   energi price increas are deem to be temporari  so they have not s ul increas drill activ  mexico seem to be readi to resum posit growth   outsid of the telecom industri  the high tech sector has like bottom out   most other sector  notabl construct and servic  are stabl or grow   all in all the movement is in the right direct  but there   s not a lot of momentum  turn to the nation economi  i   m inclin to believ the  book forecast  and i hope it turn out to be correct   i   ve been say for a long  e now that we can get the kind of   rowth contain in the staff forecast with low and stabl or even fall inflat   the staff forecast is align with our  and the risk to the forecast seem to be fair even balanc in my opinion   down the road we may have an iron dilemma regard our bias statement   if greater inflationari pressur is the risk on the other end of the bias seesaw from the risk of econom weak  we could well come to the point of need to tighten polici a bit befor we reach the stage where an inflationari bias statement is justifi   while the recoveri will like be sustain  it   appear to me to be more fragil at this  e than it seem at the last meet  that push our like bias dilemma into the futur   in my opinion  we don   t have it today
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi is show clear sign of improv  although the recoveri still is a bit sluggish in colorado   i would also say that the manufactur sector is show clear sign of a turnaround   our latest manufactur survey found that product and shipment strengthen in april  move closer to year ago level   also  for the second month in a row  op  about futur activ was close to survey high   reflect this increas op   more firm are expect to increas employ and capit spend in come month  although the capit spend is further out in  e in the opinion of mani respond   most of these sign of a turnaround come from durabl good manufactur who  after have suffer a veri steep declin  appear to be enjoy a stronger recoveri than other firm  retail spend and hous activ have been hold up fair well in our region  retail are cautious op ist about futur sale as well   and homebuild is higher than a year ago except in colorado   but even there  home sale in denver firm a bit in april  and realtor continu to report strong demand for entri level price home   commerci real estat    n the other hand  remain in a slump  with veri few sign of an immin turnaround in that sector   offic vacanc continu to climb  and they climb rather rapid in the first quarter  although we are hear scatter report of a pickup in leas activ especi for smaller busi   public construct has help make up for the slowdown in commerci construct for much of the region   energi activ also remain relat sluggish in our area  although oil price have risen  our oil industri folk seem to be hold back and are more concern about reduc debt than expand   the labor market are general slack  but they appear to be stabil   and as i report last  e  temporari employ is show a steadi increas  as report by one of our director who has a nation firm in that busi   he feel there is a veri clear and strong upward trend in such employ   price pressur in the region are subdu   there is talk  though  in the manufactur sector about tri to increas price to get profit move   but  of cours  those manufactur also say that right now they don   t have the price power to do that   the farm economi is wholli depend upon the recent farm bill  which i don   t need to talk about here  turn to the nation economi  recent data releas continu to point to a recoveri  as we   ve describ here   the recoveri probabl will be modest by histor standard just as the recess was modest by histor standard   i continu to expect the economi to grow at about     to   percent for the year as a whole   as i think about it  one thing that is help  at least to me  is to break econom develop down into their structur and cyclic compon  structur  the u s  economi remain strong   with remark strength in product dure this recess  we can be more confid in an assess of fa  long term product growth  which was talk about earlier   we have seen onc again the remark resili and flexibl of the u s  economi from last autumn into the spring   final  our long term   ommit to low and stabl inflat has serv us well in term of push up the potenti of the economi   cyclic  it appear that the u s  economi is in fact recov   the slower   than normal recoveri  as i said  i think reflect a relat mild recess   i would submit that a slower than normal recoveri is not necessarili a surpris  given that the slowdown was also mild   the factor behind the recoveri are  of cours  that monetari polici remain s ul and fiscal polici was s ul  especi with recent enact program   moreov  the continu inventori adjust should at least contribut somewhat to growth as we move forward  although perhap not as much as we   ve seen recent   of cours  i do understand the  risk   i would in fact suggest that they are about balanc   the continu pessim of ceo is a downsid risk  and it   rais question about capit spend go forward  which is a concern to me   but there are also upsid risk   in particular  stronger foreign growth  stronger product  and our resili u s  economi   turn to the inflat outlook for the immedi futur  i think the most like outcom is for stabl or even slight lower core inflat this year   most measur of core inflat are stabl or down   the median cpi is the one except  and that is up fair notic  nonetheless  i do want to say a coupl of thing relat to the risk on this side   with polici where it is today  i think we do have some risk of inflat and also some financi excess  which in my view we need to keep in mind   let me give you my three reason for say this  first  monetari polici is current quit s ul   no matter how one measur it  the real fed fund rate is near zero or at zero   second  monetari polici is like to remain accommod for an extend period   if we decid today to leav the fed fund rate at it current level  the real fed fund rate will remain near zero or at zero for anoth seven week   if rate follow the path  suggest by futur market  the real fed fund rate will like remain below it equilibrium   evel for the rest of this year and perhap through earli next year   and use the  book   s forecast  includ it assumpt of maintain the fund rate at    percent through the third quarter befor gradual rais it  the real fund rate is like to remain below equilibrium for at least anoth year   thus  accord to the  book  polici will still be accommod in the middl of next year  even though real gdp will have risen for seven quarter and the unemploy rate will have fallen for perhap three quarter  if those project are correct   third  while a fund rate below it equilibrium level is appropri when the economi is in recess  we must consid the risk of maintain such an accommod polici dure the econom recoveri   with such a small output gap and a low real fed fund rate  we should not dismiss the risk of higher inflat longer term as we get into next year   thank
mr  chairman  i   ve talk with a varieti of busi peopl all around the eighth district in the last six week   the overal tone of their comment is that the econom situat just  sn   t feel as posit as impli by the gdp number report for the first quarter  it just  sn   t seem to fit   in my view what probabl is go on here is that growth of final sale after all was modest  and an environ in which inventori are still be liquid  though at a slower rate than in the fourth quarter  is hard one that feel veri buoyant   so i think that   s the way to reconcil the gdp number with the tone in the busi communiti  my fedex  up  and j b  hunt contact in the transport industri all report that in veri recent week   and i talk to sever of these peopl ye day   the tone was much softer than in the earli part of the year   my contact at hunt  the truck compani  mention scatter exampl of compani such as home depot  wal mart  and anheus busch scrambl for capac to ship good   the last  for exampl  need a rush shipment of bottl   rom a plant in florida to it breweri in st  loui   he attribut those type of capac problem to the signific declin in truck capac becaus of all the bankruptci in the industri last year and i suppos continu this year   my sourc at fedex and up both note the ongo shift of demand from express product to ground transport   their express product are not do well  a fact they attribut to ongo effort by compani to save money in light of profit pressur   interest  fedex and up both are see signific growth in their busi in europ and in asia   some of the number they cite i thought were interest  fedex asian busi   and it   s driven by busi within asia  not between the unit state and asia   grew    percent year over year  for it european busi  growth was    percent year over year   and up had an increas in intra europ busi of    percent year over year  so they   re both see some strength in europ   as i note  both up and fedex have seen their custom shift to ground shipment rather than express shipment  primarili in respons to profit pressur   in the same vein  everi one of my contact   not onli in the eighth district  but also at veri big nation compani   comment about the pressur on the cost side from health insur and casualti insur premium   they have seen cost increas in the neighborhood of    percent for both type of insur   on the capit spend front  wal mart is continu to increas it capit expenditur  which are up   percent from last year   the  compani is increas squar footag in it store   percent and anticip total sale growth of    percent this year   about   to   percent of that year over year sale growth is expect to be in same store sale   so i think the overal view is that busi condit are improv  but my contact don   t see ani sign of realli signific improv until later in the year   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s economi has been give mix signal sinc the last report  which is what we   ve been hear from around the countri   there are scatter sign of increas price pressur  main in manufactur input and shelter cost   but overal  inflat remain relat subdu   retail sale were on or close to plan in april  and price were steadi   consum confid was littl chang in april  while labor market condit were mix but also general steadi   hous market show some strength  though price of co op and condo have retreat from their recent peak   offic market in and around new york citi have remain weak but have stabil   busi at manhattan hotel has been improv and continu to improv in march even though room rate are down about    percent from a year ago   which mean that they   re still expens    laughter   survey of manufactur and purchas manag suggest continu improv in the region   s manufactur sector in april   and banker report stronger demand for nonresidenti mortgag  tighter credit standard  and steadi to lower delinqu rate  i   d just like to make a few comment on the nation economi   the level of gloom in new york busi circl  which was profound at the begin of the year and lessen slight about a month ago  is now even greater than befor   the explan for whi busi peopl are so gloomi even though profit are begin to improv is that the profit improv come onli from cost cut not from revenu increas   and they will not believ that they should move on busi fix invest until revenu increas improv as well   on the inventori side  as i think all of us have been say  the rundown of inventori actual did continu   though much more slowli   in the first quarter   that continu liquid now has inventori level well below where it would seem busi had want   hem  base on the trend line in busi inventori go back to the mid     s through the first three quarter of last year   clear  the inventori drop in the last two quarter leav busi in general with the choic of adjust their view of the appropri inventori sale ratio to a lower level and decid it is possibl to run the busi that way or of bring it back up to the trend line   if the latter is the choic  then of cours we could get a bigger push from inventori rebuild than i believ is in ani of our forecast  the mood on wall street is veri grim  inde   there is much comment about the investig by the new york state attorney general and the sec of what may be a dichotomi between what analyst were think and what they were say public   also  the cover articl in busi week is make them feel that this onslaught on wall street is  broaden to a popular cri   one might argu that that   s their problem and they should resolv it  which of cours is my view   howev  becaus of all this  there   s a skittish  nervous feel about financi market  which i think has to be a concern to us   and if the brokerag firm get into the bomb shelter suffici and are not make market to the same degre that they have been  that would advers affect liquid   liquid problem are bad enough in normal  e  but if we were to have anyth like a crisi from  say  some geo polit event   which is entir possibl given the situat in the middl east   i   m concern about whether we could have exagger market reaction simpli becaus of the constraint on liquid   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have alreadi note  the data and anecdot inform are send veri mix signal about the strength of the recoveri   i would like to bring anoth topic into the rang of our discuss   this has been a particular   et spring here in washington   and sinc this committe deal with liquid  i will discuss the various liquid outlook if you will   one i would describ as the baselin forecast  which i think of as a nice run water faucet   we have in the baselin an economi that gradual return to trend  inflat stay well contain and  if i   ve got it right  the unemploy rate gradual return to the staff   s expect of the nairu   in that scenario no one get too wet  then we have what i would describ as the water tortur scenario  which is the downsid risk that a number of us have alreadi talk about   in this scenario   and the vice chairman recent touch on these point   busi attempt to increas product and to increas profit   and they do so by continu to hold down hour and onli gradual bring furlough worker back to work   while increas product should eventu lead to a higher incom for those worker  the fact that unemploy stay stubborn high and profit return onli slowli limit the need and the willing of busi to share the  benefit of increas product through higher wage   this in turn discourag worker from spend ani expect incom gain  and we get a veri  veri gradual water tortur kind of turnaround in which final demand is veri slow to pick up   that   s clear the downsid risk  the upsid risk that we   ve alreadi talk about is what i would describ as the water hose scenario   in this model  what we have is high s ul fiscal polici  a monetari polici that is also quit s ul  and the product surpris that we   ve enjoy all lead to a much stronger turnaround than is current built into the baselin  so when face with a gradual run faucet  water tortur  or a water hose  we have  the question  which of these altern scenario do we expect to materi   the unfortun problem is that at today   s meet we aren   t realli sure   but sinc we   re not face with an   mmediat waterfal of rapid increas inflat  i would suggest that we sit tight in the boat and stay exact where we are   thank you  mr  chairman
i   m glad presid   is not go next    laughter  governor
you took the word right out of my mouth    laughter   i   m go to be brief  too  and i have no metaphor or aggi joke or anyth of that sort   in some sens  veri littl has chang sinc our last meet   there is still the tension between consumpt and invest  still the tension between the ceo and their busi economist  and still the delic question of whether to rais rate quick and risk snuf out the recoveri or belat and risk inflat   a short  e ago i was actual think about argu for a posit bias on the ground that the fund rate will have to rise at some point   but the run of weak or uncertain real output data in the mean  has pretti much scare me off   i   m awar of lag in monetari polici  but i feel that we can still deal with the  e and path of rate increas later on  when the recoveri look more firm entrench  the most interest piec of news sinc our last meet is the eye pop product number for the first quarter  now peg at     percent   in the long run  the fact that product has surviv the slowdown so well is  of cours  veri good news   the best singl piec of econom news a countri can have   in the short run  the remark product number    rais sever question   one question for the staff is the forecast issu   the level of product is now well abov their trend es    they have elimin about a third of this  gap by rais the trend es   but they wouldn   t want to determin the trend complet from one or two quarter    data   so they still leav a substanti gap and a question of how quick the economi revert to the product trend   in this revers period  product growth will be   nevit quit slow    perhap implaus so   with implic for employ  for profit  for unit labor cost  and possibl even for demand growth  anoth question that may engag us short involv monetari polici   this is similar to a scenario that has been laid out by sever presid and also by governor    who call it the water tortur approach  though i didn   t think it was quit that bad   if product continu at high rate and there is not a full adjust of spend on the demand side  we could soon have a situat where demand growth is healthi  the fund rate is well below equilibrium  and yet the unemploy rate stay high and perhap even rise   what we should do then is   well  it   s rather complic  howev all this play out on the forecast side and on the polici side  for today i think our choic is clear   the economi is recov   we shouldn   t be lower rate   but it   s not recov all that rapid  so we shouldn   t be rais rate either   thank you
thank you  i think we can take a break and complet the roundtabl after the break   we   re run well ahead of ani histor schedul  so we can have a littl longer break than usual if we choos to   coffe break
at this meet i continu to believ that the consum is the mainstay of the economi   and with dispos incom back near pre septemb    level  i expect the consum to continu to be the mainstay even though  as we said earlier in the day  consum confid could be veri fragil given the news on the polit front and on unemploy   for real gdp growth  i agre with the forecast of much slower growth in the second quarter  as inventori reduct appear to be end and the recov economi widen our trade deficit    inal sale growth will also slow somewhat in the second quarter  as increas feder govern spend remain at it higher level and state and local govern continu to restrain spend to meet fall revenu   in the last half of the year  gdp will advanc at a fa  pace  i expect  as continu growth in final sale requir busi to meet demand from product rather than inventori liquid   and the fact that manufactur product has now risen for three month  for the first  e sinc late in the year       has me expect to see more product growth ahead  given the level of excess capac and the lack of price power by busi  expens control will still be the driver of profit recoveri   this will continu to keep product high  and employ growth will lag until busi confid is restor   as a result  wage cost should advanc veri slowli  and inflat should remain well under   percent for the rest of the  year   so for the  e be  i don   t feel that we need to make a chang in our polici stanc from the past meet  i do have a longer term concern  though  that i   m becom increas worri about  we have seen a lack of busi invest for over eighteen month now   and much of the product growth that we   re enjoy current is due to the innov invest cycl associ with the extrem high level of invest in the late     s and at the begin of the year        the lack of current invest is go to slow the innov invest cycl and that  in turn  will harm sale growth that is relat to product innov and introduct   it also will set the stage for a slowdown in product due to busi process improv  these type of invest cycl take mani year to becom effect   they go from plan  to invest  to implement  and then to enjoy the full fruit of that invest   i am pessimist in that i believ the caution that ceo are express about their profit will continu   o limit their abil and willing to make these long term invest   in turn  that mean that sever year from now we aren   t go to have the abil to harvest the product gain becaus we will not have had growth in busi invest for an extend period   at some  point the recent high level of product growth  i fear  will drop substanti  closer to histor trend   given how accommod our monetari polici is at the moment  with real  fund rate at zero  i have a worri that at some point we are go to have to rais interest rate becaus product will slow
the discuss in the  book and the discuss today have focus on the conclus that the economi is expand but that there has been a lack of busi particip through capit spend   the issu has not been whether but when the busi communiti might particip to a greater extent   in other meet  i have look at public polici issu to tri to determin the extent to which a public polici initi might affect either the economi or the psycholog   at the last meet we were pleasant surpris by the natur of the fiscal s ulus packag that the congress had pass   this  e we still have the overhang issu of market disciplin  corpor govern  and transpar question that vice chairman   address   but anoth issu has emerg  and it is one that i think will continu to concern us  for the last decad at least  we have had a period of fiscal disciplin in the congress   a process has been observ wherebi ani increas in expenditur need to be match by the identif of the revenu sourc to pay for it   and in other elect year  there has been a  bipartisan effort to demonstr at least some adher to that concept   the budget disciplin start to disappear in late      when it was clear that we were run signific surplus    hat issu was aliv as a high level public polici issu up until septemb      but i think among the casualti of the event of septemb    was support for budgetari disciplin  evid of that is probabl as appar this week as it ever has been  with the manner in which the congress is approach the farm bill   one of the thing that we had accomplish in the past decad  in the context of greater fiscal disciplin  was a move away from the subsidi support of agricultur   we see today that some  this week the congress will pass a bill where all of that disciplin is gone  we are move back at least a decad in term of wean agricultur from that kind of support   so  to the extent that the busi communiti correl prosper with fiscal disciplin  i   m afraid these develop will not be posit and will not be reassur
thank you veri much   don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman  at the  e of your march meet  you had just receiv a string of surpris strong read on demand and activ   the tone of that inform motiv the decis to shift the balanc of risk statement to neutral  and mani of you express concern that the momentum of econom expans would begin to erod margin of unutil capit and labor resourc befor long   that prospect suggest that you soon would need to consid start the process of move to a more sustain polici stanc   howev  the data receiv over the intermeet period suggest appreci moder in the pace of expans  leav open the question of when demand will be strong enough to generat increas in output capabl of reduc those excess resourc margin   in the staff forecast  littl progress is made on reduc the unemploy rate over come month  and capac util just edg higher  as growth is restrain by continu declin in net export and by onli a gradual recoveri of invest   as   discuss  it appear that foreign economi  although pick up  are still on the receiv end of impetus from the u s  economi  rather than a net sourc of strength to the unit state   moreov  the dollar   s fall over the intermeet period seem at least part a respons to disappoint in the vigor of the u s  expans  limit the extent to which it will be a net plus for the pace of growth here   for busi  capit spend  order data  persist downbeat busi attitud  and the ongo drag from excess capac all suggest that the strengthen of invest is like to be damp for a  e   one indic of the weaker near     erm outlook for capit spend is the appreci declin in equiti price over the intermeet period  which was trigger in part by pessimist assess of sale prospect by technolog firm  indic that seller of high tech equip and softwar are not see an immin reviv of demand   measur of under price and labor cost increas becom avail over the intermeet period drop further from alreadi low level   in the staff forecast  inflat remain quit damp   and slight lower than in the previous forecast  reflect a reassess of potenti output  as dave explain   the higher current level of potenti output now seen in the wake of the upward revis to es  of structur product growth in recent year mean that the shortfal of actual output relat to it potenti now is larger than previous thought   this larger gap therebi exert greater downward pressur on compens and price increas   the greater growth of structur product go forward keep the unemploy rate from  fall as fast and damp cost increas   by itself  an upward revis in the product growth rate would tend to boost the equilibrium real interest rate   howev  the staff assum that higher structur product growth is not news to financi market particip and the earn implic of fa  growth have alreadi been incorpor into equiti price  cut off one channel through which stronger product rais interest rate  moreov  with the upward revis to the level of potenti output in the past  in retrospect a lower interest rate now appear to have been need all along to spur spend enough to keep the economi produc at this elev potenti   this result downward revis in the level of the equilibrium rate carri forward from histori more than offset ani remain tendenc for higher growth in structur product to rais the equilibrium rate   thus  r  was revis down  move closer to the current real fund rate   but the narrow of the es  interest rate gap occur just as you might otherwis desir to widen the spread of r below r  to counter the larger perceiv shortfal of actual output from it potenti   this reduc degre of effect polici s ulus relat to the output gap mean that  as in the staff forecast  the feder fund rate can remain at it current level for longer without an increas in inflationari pressur   with the strength of econom activ still in doubt and inflat head down and with the output gap perhap larger and polici not quit as accommod as you had thought  the committe would seem to have a strong rational for leav polici unchang at this meet   even if you suspect that the expans will be stronger and price pressur less damp than in the staff forecast  slack in resourc util should still be suffici to hold inflat in check for some  e  suggest littl potenti cost to wait befor begin your tighten until some of the current uncertainti about final demand begin to be resolv   moreov  the potenti benefit from postpon action could be consider should the firm of demand  in fact  turn out to be more gradual than you expect     hese uncertainti and revis support the current stanc of polici  howev  do not alter the basic polici issu you are like to face later this year   that is  the  e and trajectori of a rise in the fund rate from it current unsustain low level   a relat issu you face today is how to communic your intent to the public to fo  realist and construct expect   these are complex issu  and i   ll offer comment on onli two aspect this morn   the use of benchmark to measur and discuss progress toward a more sustain polici stanc and the balanc of risk assess for this meet   one such benchmark cite by some committe member at recent meet   and even more frequent by financi market comment   is take back the so call insur cut made after the septemb    attack as a first set of step in the tighten process   whether this construct will be help to guid your action or  market expect is question in my view   it is imposs to know what the fund rate would have been absent the attack   condit in the week lead up to septemb    arguabl were alreadi develop in such a way as to call for more polici eas  and much has chang or been learn about the economi in the eight month sinc then that ought to influenc polici   as a consequ  the pace of tighten and the desir of a paus at some point probabl will need to be decid at each meet by evalu the exist stanc of polici relat to your goal and expect for the economi and price  regardless of how that polici stanc was arriv at   a second benchmark  cite for the ul  level of the feder fund rate  is it es  equilibrium valu   this too need to be use with caution   this is an abstract construct  which like it close relat  the level of potenti output  can never be observ but onli infer imprecis from the behavior of other variabl and es  relationship   this movabl target can be expect to vari over  e with anticip chang in under econom condit   and as we have just discuss  it es  valu at ani given point in  e fluctuat with new assess of the last influenc on demand and potenti suppli   it is thus necessarili onli a rough approxim of the sustain stanc of polici over a number of year   and one that the committe has deviat from in the past for long period in the interest of stabil output and price   still  the real feder fund rate is far enough below a reason rang of es  of it equilibrium valu to indic that polici will have to be tighten at some point to forestal increas inflat pressur   the balanc of risk statement is one way you have of inform the public and the market about how you are weigh your concern about this longer run inflat risk of the exist polici stanc against the nearer term prospect for growth and inflat   with the fund rate well below ani plausibl notion of it equilibrium  as  e pass and if data are reason close to expect  the risk of rise inflat pressur should come  closer and increas  while concern about shortfal in growth should reced and diminish   adopt a statement of unbalanc risk toward heighten inflat pressur at this meet would convey that the committe believ that this   rogress is occur and has gone far enough to caus you to shift the major focus  of your concern   although near term growth forecast have been mark down  the  first quarter surpris mean that the level of gdp and final demand are expect to be at least as high in the second quarter as the staff had previous project  moreov  some develop over the intermeet period   includ further indic of fa  increas in health care cost  higher oil price  and the declin in the dollar   will be put greater pressur on cost and price than had been expect   in addit  as dave emphas  disentangl the signal about ongo structur product increas from the nois of one off level chang in the recent data has been especi difficult   if more of the recent gain turn out to be of the one  e varieti than the staff has infer  increas in unit labor cost may not be as well contain as in the staff forecast   a statement of inflat risk would have particular appeal to the committe if you thought that follow the recent declin in interest rate market had not price in adequ tighten soon enough   the announc of your heighten inflat concern would tend to elev rate appreci and well out the yield curv   in fact  both the market and the staff have seen the inflat risk reced a bit over the intermeet period  with expect tighten push out by at least one meet   if you share this assess that potenti inflat pressur were  at worst  no closer or stronger than in march  retent of the statement that risk were balanc would seem to be appropri   to be sure  near term expect about polici in the financi market are heavili influenc by your speech and statement   but interest rate have fallen appreci all the way out to ten year  and survey tend to confirm that the public   s long term inflat expect remain damp  despit the gentler and later trajectori for polici tighten and the rise in energi price   as i alreadi discuss  the staff has mark down it forecast of inflat pressur becaus of an assess that output is further below it potenti than previous es    but as the  book note  a mechan read of recent product would have justifi rais structur product even further   if you saw the incom price  wage  and product data as suggest that the level and growth rate of potenti output were more like to be higher than es  by the staff than lower  inflat pressur would be even less than in the  book forecast and the turnaround in price push out even further   inde  you might be concern that the possibl of higher potenti output carri with it a risk that inflat could run for a while at level that would not provid an adequ cushion for polici to oper against downsid output shock if they occur   such a concern would reinforc the assess that  for the forese futur  the threat to your object from the longer term risk of heighten inflat pressur were at least balanc by the shorter term risk of rise output gap and declin inflat rate   the market expect you to view the risk as balanc  and so such a statement should have minim effect on expect interest rate   as the bluebook note  from    he perspect of market particip  such a statement would not limit your futur flexibl inasmuch as mani observ who anticip a tighten in june or august do not expect that you will first move to unbalanc risk to signal your intent
thank you veri much   question for don   presid parri
don  i have a question about the perfect foresight polici   i think that   s a veri use exercis  and one thing that   s interest to me is that there is an assumpt that the valu of the dollar depreci at a rate of   percent per year   that certain is reason  but our experi of recent year suggest that other outcom are possibl   so i think it would be interest to know what the effect of differ assumpt for the dollar would be   for exampl  if the dollar didn   t depreci or even appreci at   percent per year  i have a feel that the perfect foresight polici would be veri differ   it probabl would indic relat to the baselin that we would have a lot more leeway in term of when polici would have to chang and also how rapid rate would have to increas in the futur
vinc can comment on this sinc he did the bluebook  but i believ the dollar depreci occur after the  book forecast period   so it   s after        but you   re right that after that point presum a higher dollar would tend to damp the growth of output in the unit state  would damp inflat  and   other thing be equal   would suggest a lower path for the feder fund rate to achiev the same inflat outcom
and that assum dollar depreci beyond the  book forecast horizon is realli captur the tension that   note in her assumpt that the dollar remain flat   there are conflict tension  of cours  with the most notabl one be that if we didn   t have that assum dollar depreci  the current account deficit would continu to head south    here would be an accumul of u s  debt abroad  and that would pose problem  particular when consid veri long term simul of our model
well  it would be interest to know the degre of sensit of that on the perfect foresight polici discuss
that is someth we could easili incorpor in futur bluebook  subject to our abil to solv the model when the current account deficit begin to grind even lower
okay   thank you
bob   s question was about chart    and i   m on chart     if you told us a priori that you were go to get the equilibrium real rate by various kind of simul of model and use the tip rate  i think we all would have said fine  that   s the way to do it   but one thing i   ve been observ   it has been true for a while now and has becom more so this  e   is that all of the equilibrium fund rate in the model simul are on the order of   percent   and the tip rate is     percent   there   s an increas gap there   do you have ani  wise thing to say about that   laughter  or should we just view that as a random event
i can talk about it  i   m not sure i   ll necessarili be wise   i would note that we see a substanti uptick in the upper bound to the equilibrium fund rate around the end of       the begin of        that correspond with the introduct of the tip base measur becaus that   s when we had a fulli articul term structur   the observ you   re make could be translat into a differ puzzl  and that is whi the real rate that come out of the index debt market are so high or the correspond inflat compens measur we get are so low   it   s one of the reason we do spend some  e talk about liquid in the   arket   but to an import extent  it is a puzzl   there is a term premium that we can t identifi   there   s a liquid risk premium and an inflat risk premium   all those thing might be enter the calcul of  say  inflat compens   that shouldn   t necessarili be distort   except the liquid premium   our es  of the equilibrium   but the main reason we track it is that it   s the onli market base measur we have   and perhap it give us paus in overinterpret our model
i think the problem is even broader in the sens that the inflat compens is realli not that   it   s a forecast of the cpi   and if the cpi has an upward bias relat to true inflat  then that pose an even more difficult problem   that the real rate is still higher ten year and out
especi when there are signific chang in energi price  which could have a bigger effect on the index debt real rate
i think this is also a manifest of a linger differ between the staff   s assess of the strength of demand and the market   s assess   dave   note that the market and the staff had come perhap closer togeth as the market revis it assess down   but i think there is still some differ there   market particip still have a stronger increas in interest rate and probabl implicit a higher equilibrium rate built in than we do  particular after the downward revis in our equilibrium rate over the last intermeet period
yes  the fact is that the further ahead futur rate from the eurodollar term structur are much higher than we would have in the  book forecast and would impli real rate in the neighborhood   if you believ our inflat forecast   as high as these index read    hairman  span   presid broaddus
i   d just like to make a quick pitch  mr  chairman  to have this    perfect foresight    simul in everi bluebook   i find that veri help becaus it allow us to consid short run polici altern in the context of a longer run strategi that realli is focus on our goal   if we have more discuss of it along the line of bob   s comment  i think that   s all to the good   but if we could have someth like that in everi bluebook  that would be veri use
ani further question for don   if not  let me comment  i   ll be brief  as all of you said  too   but then you revis and extend your remark    laughter  this is probabl a rather easi monetari polici decis   i sens from virtual everybodi a desir to stay where we are with respect to the balanc of risk statement and the feder fund rate   there   s an uneasi that i think pervad this group in the sens that the economi is do what gari  n say it alway   at this stage of the busi cycl   inde  what we see current is exact what we see happen in the annal of busi cycl histori go as far back as they exist   so there should be noth surpris here   moreov  in the annal we often see in the earli stage of a recoveri a few month with a negat gdp growth rate   what we   re talk about may last three month  so it   s not necessarili a short period  i think we are now in one of those paus   there is a question as to whether or not the capit good market can lift final demand  which is alreadi at a relat high level but obvious is go to have difficulti increas further   person consumpt expenditur are high  and inde they are hold up   the troubl is that  becaus they are high  the prospect rate of growth cannot be veri larg   much the same can be said of hous   clear  nonresidenti construct is not a sector that seem about to turn around and move up   so we   re realli focus  at least in the privat sector of the economi  on the uncertain outlook for capit good  in that regard we are confront with the extraordinari gloom that the vice chair  mention is appar in new york   in one way or anoth  we have all run into gloomi sen ent in our contact with busi group whose basic focus is what i would call    profit trauma      busi peopl just have not recov from what has happen to their outlook for profit   they don   t know what to do about it or how to handl it   they perceiv an utter inabl to rais price   price power  if anyth  may be erod  not expand  and it   s a  veri disturb phenomenon for them   it has them think in peculiar way  notabl in the way the vice chair indic with respect to cost cut versus anticip revenu  that is realli not the way an economist would look at this  if there are opportun for cost cut  that   s the type of invest a firm will make sinc the varianc of prospect return on such invest is much smaller than varianc base on revenu project or other indic of potenti return over long period of  e  a firm know it under cost   and if a way can be found to reduc cost in one form or anoth through a capit expenditur  the varianc of the prospect return over the use life of the new equip is veri signific less than on broader revenu enhanc type of capit outlay   as a result  the hurdl rate on cost cut replac equip is much less than it is on other type of capit outlay   obvious  almost by definit  it is onli the cost cut type of invest that is the driver of product growth by reduc unit cost  we   ve seen a good deal of that sort of invest  and we   re go to see consider more  but there is no question that  if firm don   t invest to expand capac  or at least for a combin of cost reduct and increas capac  which most equip outlay actual   chiev  then the result is a lower level of overal outlay   inde  that   s what we   re observ at this particular stage  there is the question that governor bie rais with respect to the quit consider  declin in capit invest over the past year   that issu is relev to our previous discuss as to whether or not there is a lag between a capit expenditur and it effect on product and rate of return  which there almost sure is   if we are deal with that sort of thing  we need to be veri much concern about the declin in capit invest over quit a long period and about the relat outlook for product and profit   we do have to be a littl care in this analysi becaus  when we disaggreg the data and look at the factor that engend increas in labor product  the effect on labor product of a given dollar invest in tradit capit equip is actual declin in import   we   re see a signific impact from the so call composit effect of what the invest dollar are spent on   that effect has been increas in import in recent year as more invest are direct to high tech equip  where the valu ad is veri signific higher than it is for tradit capit outlay   so  on the basi of the actual dollar amount of capit invest  one cannot explain or come even close to explain what is current happen to product  on top of that  of cours  multifactor product is explain a veri signific proport of the growth in labor product   so actual level of plant and equip technic do not explain a larg part of labor product   that is quit fortun becaus  if it were otherwis  i think we would be in a posit of worri about where product in fact is go in the period ahead  in my view the econom outlook general is pretti much as describ in the  book   and from the comment around the tabl about the individu district  i   ve   bserv veri littl that deviat in ani signific way from the  book or at least the general thrust of the  book forecast   there are obvious a signific number of risk to our forecast   governor olson put his finger on one about which i am becom increas concern  name the breakdown in fiscal control   the fact that the senat has not pass a budget resolut   and this is the first  e sinc when  mark
three year probabl
oh  it   s more than three year  isn   t it
a budget resolut
no  i mean that this far into the season the senat has not pass a budget resolut
i don   t know the  e
i think it has been a long  e sinc that last happen  the eros in fiscal control is becom veri evid   without a budget resolut there is no real cap on appropri committe  and when we   re in a polit year who know what will happen   nevertheless  the budget is an ul  threat out there  though not one that i think we need to worri about immedi   inde  one might believ that fiscal s ulus could prove help at this point   it   s the longer term implic that are more disturb   obvious  if we end up with an     percent trend in structur product growth  we won   t need to worri about the budget deficit  it will take care of itself   but i would not count on that  i think the oil issu is a relev concern  but let   s rememb that the ratio of oil consumpt to gdp in this countri has been go down steadili sinc the earli     s  and there is no evid of a slowdown in the rate of declin   so the intens of oil use in our economi   and i might add that this extend to a slight lesser extent to energi use overal      uggest that energi shock don   t have the clout that they did twenti to thirti year ago   but we are still confront with an extraordinari anomali  even though our model don   t show ani particular need for concern about an oil price increas  histori nonetheless tell us that everi  e there   s an oil price spike the economi take a swoon a short  e later   now  we may have too few observ and we have the small sampl problem  but that outcom   get one   s attent when one look at it on a chart  one issu that has not been rais today  and i think we have to keep it in mind becaus it can happen  is terrorist act two   if that should happen  it is especi import to realiz that  it would be occur in a context that differ from that in the aftermath of the septemb    attack   after septemb     most peopl and inde the market had factor in a follow up attack   that expect has been gradual disappear   it   s disappear from the rhetor  we see the effect of that disappear show up in a return of partisan polit   while peopl still talk about the possibl of such an event  ani relat concern clear is not be captur in ani risk premium that we can observ   if anyth  the latter are go in the other direct  therefor  when an event or situat is be discount in anoth direct and it materi  it then has a veri disrupt impact on the economi   i would have said  and i think i probabl did say at our meet short after septemb     that it would take a terrorist attack of a greater order of magnitud than that of septemb      either a nuclear or biolog or chemic type of attack   to scare peopl to the extent that our economi would not be abl to function  these type of event induc a pull back  disengag  fear  and retrench   and almost by definit that mean  a declin in gdp   if nobodi trade with anybodi becaus they   ve all retreat into their closet  there is no market output   and we did inde  i might say parenthet  see a fair signific drop in gdp in the week immedi subsequ to   eptemb      the economi came back fair quick  but that retrench phenomenon was there  in my judgment  that is the biggest risk in the outlook in the sens that if the nation were continu to factor in anoth attack  then the economi could absorb it to some extent   but when it is not be factor in  i would say that it risk adjust level  if i can creat a new level of elev concern  would be at the top of the list   that   not mean that the probabl of anoth terrorist attack has not been go down  inde it probabl is still go down   but we have no idea what that probabl is   none of us has knowledg of that from our day by day read of the daili newspap  and our intellig agenc do not at this stage have that knowledg   they know a lot about the terrorist structur but veri littl about pend event  so there   s a lot of uncertainti  understand   and i am certain that when we all read our transcript five year from now we probabl will look back on this period and say that we were unduli concern   that in fact the under economi was realli improv and that the  product increas were reflect of develop that we had not realli understood   we are like to see that the economi was much better than we thought and that it flexibl was greater  to be sure  price power was nonexist  but nobodi care becaus unit cost were in check and everyth was basic fine and we shouldn   t have worri   but i   m still worri  my recommend  which i suspect is pretti much what everyon has in mind at this stage  is that we stay at    percent on the fund rate and retain the statement that we view the risk as balanc   vice chair
