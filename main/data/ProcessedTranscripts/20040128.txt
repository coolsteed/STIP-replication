mr  chairman  i have a question and a comment
i didn   t see a refer in the memo to a wareh limit  but mayb i miss it   is there a dollar limit on wareh that this committe vote on
there is a    billion wareh limit  which is a part of the packag of author and instruct under which we oper   that limit was mention in the memo
that   s in there   so there   s a    billion limit
that   s right   the committe vote to revert to a limit of    billion in      after it had been rais from    billion to     billion in      to facilit u s  particip in the program to aid mexico
if i may  mr  chairman  talk just a littl about that
i spent a lot of  e dig into the histori of this  read the memorandum of discuss from the earli     s and the transcript   i think from        when wareh was discuss at length by the committe   i want to discuss the wisdom of our have that wareh author   if we look at the domest portfolio  the feder reserv act prohibit the feder reserv from buy oblig direct from the treasuri  though there is a    billion emerg line  if you will  that the treasuri can call on to sell oblig direct to us   and i think that that   s a sound provis   we do not have an oblig to buy   and in fact  we cannot under the feder reserv act   unlimit amount from the treasuri   the problem on the wareh side   given the histori on this and given that the treasuri clear has the lead respons on intern issu   is that  when the treasuri come to us and say it want anoth    billion  we can find ourselv in a box under present circumst   i think it put us in a veri awkward posit  in my view there   s someth to be said for make the wareh limit    billion  which would correspond to the    billion emerg amount avail on the domest side   i think that would send the right messag   that the treasuri   not have an unlimit line on the feder reserv   my goal would be to tri to prevent our be in the situat where  becaus the treasuri take the lead on the intern side  somehow the view is that we   re suppos to ant up whenev the treasuri ask us to   that   s the awkward that i see in this situat
yes  there are a number of awkward relationship that we have in our role as fiscal agent  none of which to my knowledg has ever trigger ani event that would be of concern to us   i would assum that we could batten down a lot of differ hole here and there   i   m not certain that that would serv a use purpos   but that   s a judgment of the committe  and i open up the floor for ani comment anyon would like to make at this particular stage   rememb we had a veri extens discuss of the wareh issu  as you point out  in
which was onli fourteen year ago    laughter
i   m not propos that we redo that by the way   that was a veri long discuss  and it took a good deal of  e just to read it
what i would suggest you do  if you would like  is to write a memorandum on this  advert to the comment and conclus of the      discuss  and we will circul it   if there is signific interest in do someth of the natur that you are propos  i would suggest that those who agre with that view make that known to   reinhart   he can then creat whatev vehicl would be requir to put that issu befor the committe for consider   is that satisfactori
that   s fine
the next item on the agenda is
the committe need to take a vote on this item
i   m sorri  i beg your pardon   do you object to a vote be taken at this point
no  not at all
without object   i assum that the vote is in the affirm on the recommend in this memorandum   we also have a memorandum from   reinhart on the program for secur of fomc inform   do you want to go beyond what you said in the memo
i have noth to add
next is item   on the agenda   dino kos has provid an evalu of the use of gnmas in outright transact for the system open market account  soma    do you have comment on that  i was just go to summar briefli some of the point that were
made in the memo and discuss the one page set of graph that i circul today   the committe will rememb that this topic goe back to the  e when we were worri about the stock of treasuri shrink rather than expand and we were look at altern asset for the soma   the committe in novemb      direct the staff to continu to look at gnmas as a possibl and to come back with a propos about how we might use them in transact for the soma if the committe decid to do so   the memo describ how we might do that   we would propos to have the desk do the front offic task in hous but to outsourc the back offic work   the clear  settlement  custodi  and associ task as well as the prepay es    i think we learn some interest inform in the cours of this exercis  clear  this is an import market  and it has becom more import   the top chart in the page that i circul today show the growth of the mortgag back market in total and the fact that it has outstrip the treasuri market over the last few year  howev  the gnma market itself actual has been shrink both on an absolut basi  as can be seen in the middl panel  and on a relat basi compar with fanni mae and freddi mac  as depict in the bottom panel   despit the growth in the mortgag back market  ginni mae has had troubl compet  given that fanni mae and freddi mac have specif lower their standard in an attempt to build up their asset of lower incom hous  which they   ve been veri success in do  but that has had a cost in term of ginni mae   s success in compet  and that   s someth the committe may want to think about   the point that i made in my cover memo was that  on the one hand  the committe may want to approv go ahead with this if it see the benefit of transact in this market to be of suffici valu   inde  there may be some valu in the central bank   s be in this market   on the other hand  it would take about three year to implement this program  and there is some expens involv   moreov  the fiscal situat has chang quit a bit sinc the committe last talk about this   at that  e the forecast for fiscal year      was a surplus of about      billion   ye day the cbo came out with an es  deficit of      billion for this fiscal year   so  to the extent that this was seen as a hedg against the possibl that the treasuri market might begin to shrink  that reason has gone away  again  there is the issu of the shrinkag of the ginni mae market itself   even in the most favor scenario  it   s hard to see how gnmas would make up more than   to   the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix       percent of the system open market account   i   d be happi to answer ani easi question   bob elsass is here to answer ani difficult question
it certain strike me that the reason we move in this direct was for conting purpos   and necessarili so   but it turn out in retrospect to have been unnecessari in that respect   i think we should not move forward and expend addit effort or fund on this   i would put asid the work that has been done  and in the extraordinarili unlik event that concern about the avail of treasuri secur reemerg  there   s more than enough  e to readdress the issu
by that  e  the ginni mae market may have disappear total   laughter
that   s what i was go to say
dino  i thought this memo was superb  and i learn a lot from it   but i want to mention two argument not discuss in the memo for whi be in the gnma market might be attract to us   i realiz that we certain don   t need gnmas for the origin reason that we embark on the studi   first of all  develop and maintain in hous expertis in this market may be help in carri out other part of our respons  particular in the bank supervis area becaus bank hold a lot of this paper   it   s obvious a veri huge market and a complic one  so i think there is a case on that ground for have expertis in that market  the other thing that strike me is that we may end up in a somewhat adversari relationship with the gses in regard to the hous issu   so from that perspect  there may be someth to be said for be involv in support hous through a ginni mae portfolio
on the first point  our focus in the memo was on what it would take to get the program go   clear  there are some broader polici question that we didn   t think were for the staff to be opin on   but if the committe feel that it   s import to be in this market for whatev reason  the committe can direct us to do so
that issu is independ of this memorandum and inde just came up   but it   s an interest issu to keep in the back of our mind depend on how the discuss relat to gses evolv   it could move in the direct where it might be a reason sensibl u s  govern polici to enhanc gnma as an oper agenc  in which case we may or may not decid at that point to do anyth about it
i have a comment on presid pool   s comment   i saw an advantag in go this rout in term of our be consist across secur  we would buy everyth that was back by the full faith and credit of the u s  govern   but i also saw it as ad in some sens to the adversari relationship with the gses becaus it accentu that differ among them   and we   re address that in other way   given that do this is a lot of troubl and we don   t need to do it becaus of the volum of treasuri  i wonder if it   s more troubl than it   s worth   so even though ad ginni mae to the soma would leav us in a littl purer posit on the full faith and credit principl  i think i would follow the chairman   s advic and drop it for now   dino  the market know we   re look at this   do they expect anyth   will they be surpris
no  i don   t think they will be surpris   i think this veer off their radar screen mayb twelv to eighteen month ago
i think the cost of this are high and the benefit are veri  veri slight  we have been taught to make decis use these comparison   i would say  along with the chairman and my colleagu on the right  let   s put it on the shelf for now
i   d like to speak to presid pool   s first point becaus i do agre that these are veri import market and that understand how they oper is import   we onli have to look at what was go on last spring to realiz the import of understand how the mortgag back secur market work   but i think that   s differ from actual oper in those secur   yes  we would learn a littl from some hand on experi  but we would have to outsourc a good deal of the work  buy forecast  and do a lot of thing that we realli don   t need to do to understand the market   i   m sure there are peopl at the new york feder reserv bank who do understand this market   the fact that we had these memo is proof of it  so i would think that we could keep up with this and be on top of the situat without be in that market
i agre with those who have suggest that we put this on the shelf for now   the origin purpos is be dealt with in other way  and the cost seem to be sizabl for this particular veri narrow dimens   if we need to  we can bring it up at anoth  e   i think it   s better shelv for now
anybodi object to that as a conclus of the committe   if not  we   ll assum that is the decis   now we go into our regular meet agenda   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut for our decemb   meet  speaker       so move
hear no object  they are approv   now we turn to the work group on communic   governor   and   reinhart
thank you   i   ll be veri brief     is go to do most of the heavi lift in term of describ a number of differ option and conclus   both on issu that the work group look at and on a number of issu that i ask the staff to address in the memo they prepar   in my introductori remark i   d onli point out that as we go into this it would be nice   of cours  if we were to find a consensus   but frank  if at the end of our discuss today there is no obvious consensus  then by definit the committe can decid to come back and think about this topic further   or as someon said to me befor the meet start  the subject of communic is probabl go to be on our agenda in some way  formal or inform  for a long  e to come   if we can resolv some of the issu today  that would be great   but if we can   t  then we   ll move on   i will tri to be sensit to the fact that we also want to move on to other element of the agenda   so at some point i   m go to suggest a go around   i don   t know how long it   s go to take   but ask that we leav  e for dino   s present on the desk   s activ that goe with the discuss for tomorrow      whi don   t you pick up from here with this document that was distribut  thank you  governor     i   ll be refer to the
materi call    the committe   s communic strategi    that was hand out to you befor the start of the meet   next week mark the tenth anniversari of the committe   s first public explic of a chang in it intend feder fund rate not associ with a chang in the discount rate   but increas open has not been a u s  phenomenon alon  across the industri world and in mani emerg market economi  monetari polici maker now provid real  e inform on their forecast  the risk to those forecast  and their goal and object  often accompani by narrat explain their strategi   these come in the form of statement  polici  often call inflat  report  and regular press confer   the committe has been ride that wave of increas communic   in some way  it has been ahead of other central bank   for exampl  no other policymak bodi immedi releas the vote talli at it meet   howev  in other way  the committe has not been at the lead edg   on page   of your handout  i provid a reason whi you may have felt it import to be measur in chang your inform polici   your word matter   the bar plot the market respons   as measur by the chang in the two year treasuri yield in narrow window surround the event   around the releas of the committe   s statement  the top   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     left panel   it minut  the bottom left panel   and the chairman   s semiannu tes oni  the top right panel  sinc         the reason i describ the top left panel as exclus the respons to the statement is that i have use feder fund futur rate to strip out the portion of ani market surpris about the level of the fund rate   the respons both to statement and to tes oni have been sizabl   except for the most recent releas  though  minut have tend to be much less of a market event   presum becaus of their public lag   as shown in the tabl at the bottom right  your statement and the chairman   s tes oni have had effect on market price that  on averag  have been as larg as those associ with releas on the employ situat and larger than those associ with the public of data on the ism index or consum price   anoth point to make about your ten year experi with statement   at least as can be judg from the transcript of your meet on februari          committe member may not have fulli appreci that they were set a preced with a public announc   in the event  the respons to that short paragraph was so posit  you could not go back to signal polici chang through open market oper   that might be a lesson to rememb as i outlin various potenti chang to your communic strategi in the rest of my brief   page   give a roadmap of the rest of my remark   the option confront the committe are interrel   to facilit your discuss  my brief will have five part   i intend to lay out the rang of plausibl option befor the committe at the outset and then speak about them in more detail   those includ altern formula for the risk assess of your statement   that is  i will report on the progress of the work group chair by governor     then i will discuss the pros and con of expedit releas of the minut  which were given more complet in the memo by   madigan that i circul  and of an enhanc role for the fomc project  which were examin in a memo by benson durham   i will end about where i start by repeat the    chines menu    of possibl so that you can begin the hard work of determin how the piec might fit togeth   your first look at that chines menu is provid on page    which give a broad overview of option across three main communic issu on today   s agenda  the left column list the possibl for the paragraph in the committe   s statement that give an assess of risk to the outlook express a probabilist assess of the uncertainti surround the dual goal of inflat and output   to some  this serv to hint at the direct of futur polici without offer a commit   this be a central bank  it is alway an option to maintain the status quo in which the drafter start from a formula assess of the risk to inflat and output but have some discret in the exact word   with the expect that the result will preserv the three part assess of risk use sinc may   this approach allow some consult with committe member through the bluebook   the option dub    gradual evolut    involv expand both aspect of the process by allow more discret to the drafter to alter the word accord to evolv econom condit and to provid more discuss of the word of the statement in the bluebook   howev  there would be an explicit expect of includ a forward look aspect to the statement and an assess of risk  except on those rare occas  as last march  when no such assess could reason be made   if you would like  we could structur the forward look portion of the bluebook around two or three draft announc key to convey to the public possibl chang in either the outlook or polici   those altern would provid the basi for your polici discuss and vote  and one of them   with whatev last minut chang you want   would be releas to the public   if event between the public date of the bluebook and the committe meet chang the situat suffici  we would circul a bluebook supplement that suggest more appropri word   anoth set of possibl is to adopt new formula languag  as you had with the    balanc of risk    from      to earli last year   in just a bit i will report on the three formula that the work group forward to the full committe   last  you could choos to discontinu the assess of risk portion of the statement  accept that substanti critic would ensu for backslid away from open   in principl  that need not be backslid if the committe decid to alter some of the other margin of it communic polici   of cours  such other chang also may be view as desir in conjunct with retent of the risk assess   one possibl would be to expedit the releas of the minut  the subject of the middl column   about two week is the barest minimum requir for the secretariat to draft  circul for comment  and releas finish minut  but you may see some benefit in provid a bit wider cushion by releas minut  say  three or four week after each meet   anoth possibl is to enhanc the role of the econom project of the governor and bank presid as outlin in the right column   you might want to increas the frequenc with which the survey is conduct  lengthen the project period  or increas the number of variabl project   you might want to continu to releas those project in the monetari polici report  but they could also be part of expedit minut or the subject of a separ releas   as you could probabl tell from the thirti page memo that circul last week  the work group and it staff devot consider attent to altern formula languag   page   review some of the key lesson learn   in particular  member settl on six import design principl that ani formula should satisfi      good govern suggest that the committe should vote on the exact word of the risk assess       the statement should not hamper the polici discuss  nor should the committe feel constrain in it choic of action by a formula      the statement should be flexibl enough to encompass the committe member    view about the oper of the economi and the concept that can be use measur       the statement should be clear to the public  or at least as much as it is possibl for central banker to endeavor to be       the statement should cover the rang of feasibl conting so that the formula would last  if not for the age  at least a few year       the statement should avoid the use of potenti charg term  such as    risk     when refer to outcom that may be seen as posit   for exampl  the statement should not convey the mis impress that the committe is against strong econom growth for it own sake   while the work group settl on these six principl fair quick  three question remain unresolv  which are provid in the column at the right   in particular     ¢  should the word of the risk assess be in term of the level of output and inflat or their chang   convey a sens of level may make it easier to describ econom perform relat to the benchmark of potenti output and the committe   s inflat goal   howev  such specif may be seen as a drawback becaus there is a rang of opinion among member about appropri benchmark     ¢  what condit assumpt for monetari polici should be employ   the forecast could be base on the assumpt of unchang interest rate  as was the case with the old balanc of risk languag  but that present problem for project far into the futur should that assumpt diverg signific from what is built into financi market price   the altern would be to assum a histor normal polici path  but if the committe   not reveal that assumpt  the public may have difficulti understand the messag of the risk assess     ¢  over what period should the outlook and risk be consid   a shorter period   that is  the next sever quarter   has the advantag of limit the factor that influenc the outlook   howev  such a horizon may not be suffici if you think the lag in the transmiss of polici are substanti  suggest that you should look forward to the forese futur   confront with differ potenti reason answer to these question  the work group narrow the field of potenti formula to three   two state in term of level but differ as to the polici assumpt and period  and a third state in term of chang   i should note that the three altern do not explicit mention the condit polici assumpt   in principl  that design featur could be convey to the public when the new polici is announc and mention period in the minut as a remind   the    level a    altern is provid on page    with the left column repeat what was in the memo you receiv on januari      as note in red in the text and highlight at the right  this altern is state in term of level of inflat and econom activ and make explicit refer to benchmark for inflat and output   while the paragraph is silent about the condit assumpt for polici  it is base on an assumpt of    normal    polici   in addit  as shown in blue  the horizon is    sever quarter     but outcom are describ relat to path that extend further into the futur   the    level b    altern provid on page   share a focus on level and explicit benchmark  as note in red at the right  but differ in two import dimens   first  while it is also silent about the polici assumpt  the drafter assum that the implicit forecast is base on an unchang polici stanc   second  as shown in blue  the horizon is    the forese futur     that elast concept borrow from the old balanc of risk languag   the    chang    altern given in the left column of page   focus  as indic in red at the right  on chang in output relat to potenti and chang in inflat   presum  if the committe saw fit  the prior paragraph of the statement that describ econom condit could refer to level and benchmark   as in the    level b    altern  this formula is base on the undisclos assumpt of unchang polici and appli to the forese futur   staff subject these three altern to a varieti of stress test to gaug their perform both in scenario that seem like in the near futur and that have challeng the committe in the past   i am not reveal ani secret of the work group by indic on page   that problem emerg with all three formula   in particular  measur issu aris when word with vagu or multipl mean are use  such as the    long run trend of potenti    or    long run sustain pace    or even an unquantifi notion of    price stabil     in addit  you may feel uncomfort about the clariti of ani statement that reli on word such as    path consist with     which may admit mani possibl trajectori  or    the forese futur     which  for some  appear to have meant a period as short as the intermeet period and to other a period measur in year   last  the condit assumpt use in the implicit forecast introduc a fundament question as to the purpos of the risk assess   do you want to send hint about the futur direct of rate  which seem easier to do with the assumpt of unchang polici   or are you convey qualit inform about the fan chart surround your forecast  as seem the case with the assumpt of    normal polici    or the relat assumpt of    appropri polici       the work group decid that it mandat was to present inform to allow the committe to determin an accept tradeoff among the various pitfal  recogn that abandon an attempt to arriv at a formula is also an option   no doubt  this decis also interact with ani you might make about expedit the releas of the minut  the subject of page      central bank that do releas minut befor their next schedul meet  such as the monetari polici committe of the bank of england  stress advantag such as a desir to provid more  e inform to the public consist with their respons to be transpar and account   in addit  minut provid a platform to present the outlook and polici strategi in a more nuanc fashion than is possibl in an immedi releas statement   and relev to my earlier discuss  expedit minut may make you more comfort in trim the statement   the disadvantag most seem relat to possibl effect on committe dynam and other aspect of your communic polici over  e   you might be concern that  as the minut increas in market import becaus they are releas in real  e  mention in the minut would be view as a chip in the bargain process in arriv at a polici decis   the qualiti of the minut might suffer over  e if they were    scrub    to mitig potenti market reaction   in particular  you might be hesit about includ condit statement in the minut  such as a desir to chang polici at the next meet if interven data run in a certain direct or to hold an intermeet confer call   the bottom line is that experi has shown that market particip tend to overreact to conting statement  and fear of possibl inappropri market respons might be view as a decid negat   in addit  the committe  and futur committe  would have to exercis some self disciplin so as not to succumb to the temptat of use the minut to send signal in respons to develop after the meet   some thought would also have to be given as to the  e of the releas of the minut  particular on those occas twice a year when the chairman deliv the monetari polici report to the congress   inde  as a general principl  the prospect of creat an addit news event in which market particip and report await some fix releas from the fomc may seem especi daunt   and in that regard  the committe may want to review it polici regard blackout period so that the releas of the minut mark the first news about the think of policymak at the previous meet   twice a year  the minut includ the central tendenc and the rang of the governor    and bank presid    forecast of key macroeconom variabl   earli releas of the minut natur rais the question of the role of those project  as is discuss on page      there are sever margin over which the committe could enhanc the role of those forecast   in particular  you might want to     increas the frequenc of the survey to everi meet or everi quarter      increas the length of the project period  therebi give the public some sens of the committe   s view of the longer term prospect for the economi      increas the number of variabl in the project  perhap to includ core pce inflat  which seem central to the deliber of the committe   inde  you might view the project as a mean of convey to the public your view of the longer term element essenti for polici  such as the growth rate of potenti output and your individu work definit of price stabil  and perhap the degre of uncertainti about that outlook  by includ the width of uncertainti band about each variabl forecast   the latter might be particular attract  as wide band would reinforc that monetari polici is as much about control potenti risk when a forecast  almost inevit    not come true as it is about make project   at a practic level  the committe will also have to decid whether it is appropri to separ it project from the monetari polici report and tes oni   the pros of an enhanc role of the project given at the top right should seem familiar   by get

cumul   with the last page in your packag  i deliv on my promis to end where i start   page    repeat the chines menu and underscor that i am seek direct from the committe on all aspect of it communic polici   mani of the option that are list will requir much more staff work to arriv at a solut accept to the committe   that is  the discuss to follow will not be the end of work on communic polici  but i am hope that it is the end of the begin of work on communic polici
thank you      we know it   s not the begin of the end  have done this a few  e  i know that there will be deep emot  short speech  and long speech  which is all fine   that   s what democraci is all about   to help us tri to figur out if we have a consensus  though    has given us what he describ as a chines menu here   it would be veri help if in your comment you could at least touch on each one of these three topic   as i   m sure most of you will   so we can keep a record as we   re go through this  with that plea  whi don   t we open it up for discuss and see who want to start   chairman  span  do you wish to start this round
yes  that   s what this signal mean    secretari   s note  the chairman had rais his hand
that might end it
yes  so much for democraci   chairman  span is recogn  and then my list say there are other who wish to follow
there are a number of veri interest idea in here that have the characterist that they are irrevers upon implement   henc there is a certain barrier abov which i think a propos has to rise befor we move forward on it   i was a littl distress that my altern to a number of these issu  which i hadn   t thought of befor  didn   t get consid
it   s in there somewher   laughter
i   ve given consider thought to various formula procedur that we could use in tri to craft our post meet statement   while i was one who thought in the begin that it would be possibl to use a formula approach to that endeavor  i   ve conclud at the end of the day that there   s someth fundament wrong with such a process   that is  the statement either has to have too littl specif   which mean it  sn   t give us the flexibl to pick up nuanc reflect in our discuss   or it becom extrem complic becaus we are forc to put into a small number of altern phrase veri complex judgment about what the committe is do  as we   ve gradual been go through this process  we have come out with a number of ad hoc statement  which i frank think have not been bad   the reason they were not bad is that they were tailor to some veri specif and complex discuss that had taken place at our meet   and i think we readili communic our judgment about the altern we had  our true assess of the balanc of risk  and most import the inclin of the committe  we use a number of differ way to convey that  and the reason we did was that each meet was essenti differ   it had a differ mold to it   the main concern in do this is the basic problem  which i think we have all eschew  of write a communiqu© author by nineteen peopl at the end of the meet   that is physic imposs in everi respect that one can conceiv of  cathi    as i recal  rais a point at the end of the last meet about restrict the number of word in our statement   as i   ve thought about it over the intermeet period  my impress of what we ought to do   and i grant you it is not in these materi   is to continu the type of statement we have now   we have a statement that give our view of the outlook and inde of what has been happen   i think there has been almost no dissent on the word we   ve use even though they   ve been differ from meet to meet   we then give some sens of where we think the risk are  and unless i   m mistaken  in virtual all case   even though at  e we   ve use more word than we would have like   we were abl to describ that in a relat few word   the import advanc of communic sever word option to the committe through the bluebook prior to the meet   associ altern statement with various polici choic   struck me as a work model  so i   m of the opinion that we realli don   t need a signific alter in what we   re do   i would prefer that we continu to tri to do this the way we have been do it  but with two caveat if you will   one is that we use the bluebook to provid altern word suggest  and two is that we adher to what i would call the   restraint   my impress is that would work  i don   t know that for certain   it has work to date   i   m veri uncomfort with the elabor formula announc larg becaus i think they will forc us into rigid form of communic   if we have an economi that is continu chang  i think it is go to requir us to be flexibl in our languag and in our approach   we alway have the capabl of go from what we   re do now to formula languag in the futur   we probabl have the capac to revers a decis to use formula languag and to go back to someth like we   re do today  though not without some negat cheer from outsid observ of fed polici   but we can live with that   nonetheless  i don   t think we need to go with formula word   that   s my view on this particular issu
i think i would describ that  in term of the option   has laid out  as gradual evolut
it give us greater flexibl and involv use the bluebook to provid altern word for the statement
i will grant you that that is probabl the right character of my view
sinc you have the floor  do you wish to go on to the other two topic on the menu  earlier releas of the minut and the role of the project   or would you like to hear more discuss
if i may suggest   sinc this is go to be a long discuss and each of these is a relat separ issu   i think we   d be better off do risk assess first  then releas of the minut  and then the role of project   after we   ve done that i   d go on to the fourth item  which would be the coordin of these various aspect of our communic polici  becaus there is interact among them
how they all work togeth
okay   this be a committe  peopl will either accept or reject that approach   i have presid hoenig next on my list
given the suggest approach that you   ve just outlin  mr  chairman  i   ll confin my comment   on the risk statement  if that   s what we   re narrowli focus on  i don   t have ani differ with you   but i   d start out by say that i wish we could get rid of the risk assess in the statement   i   d like the statement mere to say this is the action we took  it   s the risk statement that alway seem to hang us up and rais other issu
is that option list   oh  here it is
that   s the veri last one on the list   to discontinu the assess of the risk   i   m not sure if you   re say you want to go with that one or with someth els
well  that   s what i would prefer   but bar that  depend on how this committe discuss come out  my second choic would be the gradual evolut option
okay   do you want to stop there  or do you want to address the other topic
i   ll stop there
okay  whi don   t we keep go in this mode   we seem to have fallen into focus main on the risk assess   presid santomero
follow that model  i too found myself in the situat when i had finish read the document   while it was well prepar and help me think about the process   where i wasn   t particular happi with the set of option   i   m tri to decid whether i am in chairman  span   s camp or presid hoenig   s   whether my prefer is an evolut or an evolut to a shorter statement   in fact  in the formal prepar comment that i have with me today  i end with a line similar to presid     s view  say that in mani case less is more   i don   t think ani of the option that we have befor us quit get us where we want to be   it   s hard to talk about level without talk about growth rate   it   s hard to talk about where we are without make a statement about whether or not it is in fact a desir place to be   i found myself look at and review the option and find differ subtleti and implic associ with the differ statement   as a result  i felt as if we were actual move backward rather than forward  my own sens is that we would be better off say less   i   d begin by say where we are current  as we do in paragraph     second  i think we should give some context to the decis  similar to what we do now but perhap expand it a bit   as in our last statement  we might also comment on whether or not our current polici is accommod  and then we could includ inform on what we think about current and futur econom condit  paragraph   would relat to what we think the outlook is for gdp growth as well as inflat  import  in my opinion  we should have an assess of whether or not the growth rate is problemat  and i   d be more symmetr in term of the word    problemat    or    worrisom    that appear in our statement everi onc in a while   with that i think we could stop   so in that regard i am closer to presid hoenig   s posit  but i think we can get there over  e by essenti stop at that point
toni  that would be a shorter statement
it would be inde   it   s almost what we   re do now  it just  sn   t go on into detail with the formula languag regard our assess of the risk   i do worri about the formula word   as i was read the memo  i ask myself    this tell us the same thing use formula approach a  b  or c   and frequent my answer was    no     second  i thought it would tend to forc our discuss into someth that seem quit constrain
i must say  toni  as i listen to what you said  it struck me as not veri dissimilar from the gradual evolut approach becaus you want to talk about the futur  you use some phrase that dealt with whether or not the outlook was problemat  which i think is what was intend by the gradual evolut option   but i think i understand where you are  the next one on my list is presid  n
i was part of the work group  but i certain agre that none of the altern is perfect   confin myself to the risk assess  if i were go to select formula languag  i would select the    level a    altern   for veri practic reason   when i ran through the stress test  that altern seem to me to do the best job of convey to the public the situat and the prospect stanc of polici given what we knew at the  e   other may disagre  i realiz  but that   s where i came out   howev  i would have no troubl   as you know  roger   go with gradual evolut   inde  if you look at the criteria on page   in     s memo  i think that approach may well do a better job on item       and     so i have no problem with that approach and would be veri comfort with it
i have governor   next
i began the exercis think that we could come up with a formula statement that would work most of the  e   in work through it   i was also part of the work group   i now think we can   t   i   m pretti much in sympathi with the chairman in believ that we will face situat where we may think the differ are subtl and not that great but in fact they are   in go through the stress test exercis  as was done in the memo  i found that noth here appeal to me veri much   not onli do these option not appeal to me  i think they are wors than what we   re do now   so i would be for gradual evolut   i actual recommend a sentenc limit befor   mayb cathi   s word limit is better than a sentenc limit  i don   t know   but i do think that we ought to keep it short  i would like to address a differ issu   the one cost that has been mention is that associ with write a new statement each  e   that it is too hard for us in term of the process   you pass out a draft  we   ve got to read it and think about it  and so forth   i   ve actual thought about that issu  and in my view  it is less of a problem than we may think   first  in the way these statement have gone  they realli haven   t chang all that much from meet to meet   second  in the last few bluebook    has describ how the statement might chang  so we have some warn or advanc notic   consequ  when we see the final statement  i don   t think it   s that much of a shock   in term of the process  i believ it   s someth we can handl at each meet   in sum  i think the formula approach don   t realli do it   second  i think we have overr the cost of write a separ short statement each  e to convey exact what it is we want to convey
i have presid broaddus next
let me approach it this way   in term of the chart here  i   m probabl go to come out with respect to the risk assess somewher in the gradual evolut area   but to me that   s close relat to the earli releas of the minut   i view that as an integr part of the communic effort   as sort of a packag   and even though at the end of the day i have difficulti with a formula approach  i think we ought to have some discuss of the propos in the memorandum   we receiv this document  and it   s veri involv  i   ve tri to think through these option  and i believ that can help to illumin some of the issu we   re discuss   so let me make just a coupl of comment that i work up befor i came in   they may be a littl off the immedi mark  given the direct of the convers  the first thing i would say is that i think the work group made a veri construct and help effort in tri to look at this and i learn a lot from it   it taught me  among other thing  that even minimum clariti requir that we be will to describ our think in term of level of econom activ and inflat in relat to their potenti or desir level   two of the three propos approach do this   as i work through the languag itself  i didn   t think it was success in pull it off   for what it   s worth  let me suggest whi i think that   s true   i focus main on the two altern label    level a    and    level b      you know  there   s a lot in this memorandum   i look primarili at scenario one  which seem to be the closest to where we are and where i think the balanc of risk lie go into this meet   to my mind  it may be help to consid whi the suggest languag  sn   t quit achiev what we want  the level a altern assum that the public understand that the fund rate has to rise at some point down the road  which seem to accord with the fact   but for me the problem with the particular languag in that altern is that it  sn   t give a clear sens of the current magnitud of the output gap   nor   it convey our expect   and i believ this is the expect of mani of us   that that gap will close onli gradual over a two year period   it seem to me  howev  that that   s precis the kind of inform the market and the public need to be abl to form their expect effici and effect   in some sens the languag we   re use now   a better job with the    consider period    phrase  then i look at the level b altern  that languag is at the bottom of page    of the memo   in this case it is base on the assumpt of a constant fund rate   that boil down to a statement that  in the absenc of a fund rate increas  the output gap is like to turn posit at some point down the road   but again  in my view  the languag  sn   t give a clear sens of how quick all of this might happen or how it might evolv  which i think is what the public need to know  have gone through this thought process  i think if one were to work through the other six scenario there would be similar problem   so i conclud that it just may not be feasibl to convey in a few short sentenc what we need to convey to allow the public to form it polici expect effici   we might be abl to do it if  in addit to the suggest languag  we state explicit and separ our current view about the sign and magnitud of both the output and the resourc gap and how quick we think they will be elimin   at some point  if we were follow a procedur like that  we could even add  as we have done with the    consider period    languag  some explicit refer to the fund rate target   of cours  the problem is that  if we have all those sentenc  it   s go to be near imposs to talk about it and vote on it in this committe  so that take me back to where i was in septemb  when i felt that it might be a good idea to advanc the public of the minut   and i   ll come back to that later   befor i do  let me make one last point   whether or not we decid to alter the statement languag  i think we could sharpen our discuss at our meet in the spirit of your committe   s level a and b propos  roger  by talk more explicit and quantit about the role that the output and inflat gap play in our analysi of the econom outlook and in our discuss of short run polici altern   whether or not we move up the releas of the minut  i think a discuss of the gap  along the line that i just outlin  could improv our extern communic at least by make the minut more explicit and clearer  to reap the full benefit of this  though  i think we would need to maintain a work es  of the path of potenti gdp  and i would argu that we would need to share that with the public   if we did that  we would obvious need to drop the other shoe and indic public the quantit rang for inflat that we think is consist with price stabil   i won   t push that last point ani further   i did that last  e  and i don   t want the chairman to throw me out of the meet or mayb out of the window    laughter   that   s where i   d come out
thank you   this exercis show us that achiev clariti and transpar for a larg and divers committe is quit difficult   but it   s also veri import both in our role as a public institut and for the efficaci of monetari polici   so i hope  even though it   s a veri difficult task  that we don   t let ourselv backslid in this effort  i want to say that i   m actual sympathet to the view of gradual evolut in the polici statement   we saw last week a statement by the bank of canada that was quit a model of clariti   in simpl english it explain condit in the economi  and it explain whi polici step were taken   in that respect i thought it convey everyth without the need for formula languag   but as we go to a simpler and shorter statement  i would hope that we would increas the inform we provid in other dimens  particular the minut and our individu project   and we   ll come back to that later  let me say a word about the statement   veri briefli  i agre with presid  n   my prefer among the three statement would be level a for two reason   the first is that i do think it   s import to describ the outlook in term of level relat to benchmark   the chang statement requir unspecifi preliminari languag in order to make it clear  which i think is a major drawback to that statement  my second point has to do with the condit polici assumpt   a number of central bank do use the constant interest rate assumpt in make their project   this assumpt has been veri strong critic by a number of observ  includ   rudebusch and lar svenson and by   woodford in his book and other place   there are two problem with the constant interest rate assumpt   one is theoret  and the other is practic  and they   re relat   at the theoret level  the constant interest rate assumpt is usual not well defin in the sens that mani forward look ration expect model simpli do not have equilibrium or they have multipl equilibrium under that assumpt  wherea backward look model tend to diverg and have unstabl behavior   in practic  that mean show path in the project that look veri unrealist   as a practic matter  the constant interest rate assumpt is realli not well specifi becaus it  sn   t specifi what financi market believ  for exampl   do they believ that interest rate are go to be constant  or do they have the current market reveal prefer   how long will the constant interest rate path be maintain   what would be the polici after that path has end   it   s not realli a veri use condit assumpt  and therefor  i just warn you that there are some serious reserv about that approach   thank you
thank you veri much   presid
thank you  roger   for the record anyway  i express the view last  e that i was in favor of fewer move part  although i think that would translat to both fewer word and  i hope  fewer sentenc as well   i think we should focus a littl   and this pick up a bit on what the chairman was say   on the problem that we   re tri to fix here  until last spring  i for one thought our communic wasn   t too bad   we were misinterpret for a lot of differ reason last spring  some of which relat to what was happen in the economi and some of which relat to our ongo discuss about what we would do if deflat were actual stare us in the face   i think split the risk assess in our statement  while it seem logic and felt right at the  e  probabl play into that a littl  and we were in some sens forc to add the    consider period    languag in the summer to tri to get market expect back on track   i   m not particular comfort with that languag  though some of the rest of you may be  i think it   s entir appropri to tell the market what we did   we owe them that   and whi we did it  though the latter involv a degre of forward look analysi   but i don   t think it   s a good idea to be specul on what we might do over an uncertain period of  e  given a number of specif assumpt   ani one of the formula statement we   re look at requir a short cours in macroeconom to be understood   i don   t think we   re speak to the academ with these statement   in my view we   re speak to the market and the public   and in that regard i have a lot of sympathi for the idea of either discontinu the risk assess or go back to the simpler risk assess we had befor we split it into address the two risk separ   the simpler assess work for us for a number of year   mayb that   s gradual evolut   the sens i got of gradual evolut from     s comment was that we were go to get bluebook of forti page in length  three quarter of which would be devot to explic three differ present of the three differ way we could chang the various aspect of the risk statement   i   m not in favor of that  we need to figur out a simpl way to convey what we want to say about the futur  and i think we ought to have some agreement on that   but there seem to be veri big differ of opinion among us on that  and mayb it   s foolish to tri to reach a consensus here   do we realli feel oblig to tell peopl what we might do  given an uncertain futur   that   s not necessarili what i would vote for  nor do i think that it would be help   if we   re go to tri to hint at our futur polici with a risk statement  i   d rather go back to some variat of what we use to do  that   s all i have to say for now
thank you   i began this process as a member of the work group lean toward formula languag  and the altern that seem most appeal to me was the    level a    one   but it becam clear to me that  even in our group of seven  it would be extrem difficult to get a consensus built around that altern   in fact  i wonder whether we can build a consensus of nineteen around ani of the three altern  which lead me to believ that probabl the approach now be refer to as    gradual evolut    might be the correct rout to go   it seem to me that  if we have languag in the bluebook that is specif to the polici altern  then the discuss of the word associ with whatev polici we want to follow should be rather simpl  requir relat few chang   of cours  ned  the polici decis would determin the statement we would issu  it would be base on that vote   so i come to the conclus that  given our differ view of how the economi work  we probabl ought to look more at the gradual evolut altern
i came to this meet somewhat fear that we would do someth fair dramat and possibl make a big mistak   so i was veri reassur by the chairman   s open remark  which i would character as say that the status quo is not all that bad   i think the gradual evolut altern involv more gradual than evolut  which is an approach i agre with   i   ve long been in favor of discontinu the statement of risk  and i still am   i agre with cathi that announc what we did and whi we did it provid enough context about the futur   in my view we make a mistak if we go further than that  it creat one more thing to be wrong about or to appeas peopl about   so i   m for gradual evolut  but i would hope to fold discontinu the risk assess into that process   preliminarili  i   m content with the way we   re do the minut and the project now   but if we have to make some chang in those area in order to justifi elimin the risk statement  then i would be in favor of that
we   ll come back to those issu and explor them   presid guynn
thank you   when roger call me and i ask him if an option was    none of the abov     i shudder  think that i   d be the onli one with that prefer   but i gather from the comment thus far that i   m not alon   so let me just say up front that i certain share the view that we ought to resist the temptat to tinker at the margin at this point  i  too  found the work group and staff paper help  but for a reason other than the reason that have alreadi been articul   i think those materi expos some veri fundament issu that we simpli haven   t come to grip with   i would suggest that the more we   ve tri to say and the more we   ve tri to sharpen up the languag of our post meet statement  the more we have bump into some veri frustrat fundament that i don   t think we   ve begun to agre on around this tabl   not onli is that go to get in the way with regard to what to say in our post meet statement  but i think it   s go to carri over into the discuss of the minut  in that regard  i don   t think we   ve realli decid what inform we ought to provid to the public   i agre with presid   and   that we have not even necessarili agre that we ought to be in the busi of provid short term   and i underscor short term   guidanc to financi market   we differ in our view as to whether that has been help and appropri   in my opinion  it has creat a veri short term focus on polici that has not been terribl help  so to my mind there are some veri fundament question along those line   i don   t think we   ve even begun to deal with some of the basic question about how to communic our polici object and benchmark   in fact  we haven   t even agre on the definit of some of the veri fundament term that   highlight  such as    sustain growth        long term potenti     and    price stabil      until we   ve defin those kind of term among ourselv  it seem to me that such concept as    gap    have no mean   they certain have no independ mean  they have mean onli in the context of the phillip curv framework  a construct on which at least some of us have veri differ view   so how do we anchor the forward look portion of our post meet statement on some kind of agre upon target and object   the notion of our target and object creep into those statement even by the way we construct them now   what is the relationship between the post fomc statement and the semiannu monetari polici report to the congress   those are question we need to talk about  and i think we   ll have some interest discuss in sum  my view of the work that has been done is that we should use it to highlight some of the veri fundament issu that i think are go to be with us whether we   re talk about the post meet statement or the minut   until we can come to grip with those issu  i think we   re go to continu to struggl   and the more we tri to say  the more difficult it will be for us to be comfort with the post meet statement   i   d like to come back and add some further thought when we talk about the minut and our semiannu forecast   thank you
okay   presid pianalto
thank you   i also found the work of the work group help in think through some of these issu   like other  i began the exercis think that formula languag would help the committe communic becaus it would narrow the rang of word we would be use and the market would becom more comfort with the phrase and then interpret them in the same way over  e   howev  as i review the altern present by the work group and also the concern list in the document and the pitfal note on page   of     s report today   measur issu  clariti  and the condit assumpt   my prefer becam gradual evolut   i favor tell the market what we did and whi we did it  i don   t think it   s appropri to signal futur polici action   and i strong support have explicit languag altern spell out in the bluebook  that said  i have favor for the past sever month discontinu the assess of risk portion of the statement   but i didn   t think that was an option   when we were discuss our communic with the market  i thought we took off the tabl the possibl of go backward  so to speak  and communic less   i thought take someth away would not be an option   so for now my prefer is gradual evolut  but depend on how we come out on the earlier releas of the minut or the role of the project  discontinu the risk assess portion of the statement might be a possibl
like sever other  i found the effort of the work group veri help in term of lay out the issu we   ve been talk about at the last sever meet and put them all togeth in one place   i also thought that  if i went through all the formula and the various scenario  one of them would realli appeal to me   i did go through them  and i must say that  while i like the level b altern in principl  i didn   t like the answer it came out with in some of the scenario   that led me to the view that a formula isn   t go to work for us   to my mind  what we have to talk about in our statement is what we believ is the most import issu  in the littl over two year that i   ve been on this committe we   ve face a lot of volatil in that we   ve had to deal with a number of unforeseen event   so if noth els we need flexibl becaus financi stabil is one of our object  though we usual don   t talk about that explicit   but we are seen as one of the forc that keep the market stabl in part becaus we have a reput for integr  which i think is veri import  let me make just a coupl of general comment   one  i like the idea of elimin word like    risk    that may have differ connot to the public   i say that as a former risk manag   i also like the idea of a littl ambigu in some of the altern we   ve discuss becaus around this tabl we all come at the polici decis from differ point of view   and we know that in econom there are altern path to achiev our object go forward  so i   m not troubl by some ambigu in the statement that we issu   also  while the idea of set benchmark has been discuss  as we start to move toward defin those benchmark  i think we   ll find that our differ point of view will becom more of an issu   some of the altern word propos i found veri troubl becaus i don   t know if we can come to a consensus on what the benchmark are  as i thought through where we   ve had communic issu   particular in the last few month   one of the thing that struck me is that we actual have describ veri well the data that drove us to the decis we took at each meet   as a few peopl have suggest with regard to fit in the conclus of the risk statement  mayb we could do a better job by ad an extra phrase or word about the incom data   mayb we could character econom growth in term of the output gap or better describ the risk of inflat rather than adher to a fix formula that is so rigid that it  sn   t allow us the flexibl to respond to unusu develop  while i don   t want to see a statement that goe on page after page  i   d almost prefer to drop the part of the risk assess about the output gap and inflat and add a few well chosen word to describ the incom data that drove us to our action   i think that actual would make the statement more concis and clear  and perhap it would deal better with the ambigu that was point out in some of the scenario under the various altern
we   re use the word    evolut    here   if i could use a genet analog  i think we want to be care that we have some high select breed and not random mutat    laughter   to begin my remark  let me reflect a bit on how we got to where we are   some of the past evolut   origin  of cours  there was no statement issu at the end of the meet  not even a releas of the polici decis   i think it was in the earli      s that the committe start to vote on a bias or asymmetri in the direct  but that was not releas until a few day after the next meet   then in       almost ten year ago to the day  the committe agre to releas it polici decis on the day of the meet   initi the practic was to make an announc when there was a chang in the intend feder fund rate and no statement otherwis   so  clear  the origin idea was to provid an explan of what we had done and whi   after all  a decis to keep the intend fund rate unchang is also a polici decis  but we did not have a statement at the end of everi meet   so the origin idea was to explain whi we did what we did   a littl after that we made the decis   and i think this was after i came on board   to releas the bias statement   subsequ the bias was view as a problem  and we substitut the balanc of risk statement for reason that we discuss at length   i won   t go into that   now we seem to be focus on the balanc of risk statement  and to me we   re not focus adequ on the explan of whi we act as we did and what the background was for our decis  there have been mani express of unhappi with a formula approach or standard languag  so i rais this point   to me the problem is not so much with standard languag but that there is no way to construct standard languag or ani other kind of languag that   a good job on a forward look commit   or quasi commit or whatev it is   regard where polici is go to go in the futur   but i do think it is quit possibl to come up with some standard phrase or summari phrase to describ the polici decis that was taken   now  that   s not the issu the work group investig   what it did investig and what i think is be reveal in this discuss is that it is veri hard to come up with standard languag   and i   ll predict ani languag   that we would regard as satisfactori in term of the forward look natur of the polici decis   i think we need to provid forward look inform about where we expect the economi to go and that probabl has to be nuanc depend on the fact case by case and meet by meet   but i believ that we ought to be abl to come up with some standard languag that say  for exampl  that we decid to rais the feder fund rate for this basic reason or we decid to leav it alon for this basic reason
thank you  governor     i think there should be forward look element in what we announc to the public when we make our polici decis   the reason for our decis  as presid pool was suggest  alway have some forward look element in them   but i think we can be a littl more help than that in the sens that the committe has an idea of how the economi and inflat will evolv over  e and we could convey that notion   not onli is that judgment a factor in the current decis  but also it would give peopl some sens of how polici might evolv in the futur   i   m not in favor of make commit on the short term path of the feder fund rate   i think what we did last august and have done sinc then with the    consider period    languag was an unusu step taken in unusu circumst   i   m not in favor of that as standard practic   but i do think that we have some idea and some analysi that it would be benefici for us to impart to the market  which would help them act in a more stabil way  consist with accomplish the goal we want to achiev  on the balanc of risk languag  i agre with presid pool   s histori   we got to the word we use today in a rather unusu way   but in some sens that languag evolv as a substitut for the forecast that other central bank provid   other monetari author are abl to issu more straightforward rational for their action in the sens that they have veri specif forecast and way to discuss econom develop relat to those forecast   there   s a veri clear sens of how they see the balanc of risk go forward   i don   t think that this group of nineteen peopl will ever have a forecast that it can agre on that will perform that function   so the balanc of risk languag has substitut for a forecast in give us a forward look element in our statement   i agre that none of the formula for the balanc of risk has work well   i came in favor the chang altern   i thought that was the cleanest way to talk about what might be influenc the direct of rate go forward  but other peopl clear don   t agre   and in my view  both level formula have problem   so  mr  chairman  i support your propos for lack of ani better altern  acknowledg that where we are isn   t so bad as a start place for a gradual evolut in the languag   i do think it need to evolv   the committe member don   t quit agre on the mean of some of the languag we use now   so i think we need to have that languag evolv  and it need to happen gradual in accord with the situat that we   re face  i do have some reaction to the general notion of shorten the statement   i think it should be as concis as possibl to get our basic idea across but not more concis   i   m a littl concern that arbitrari limit on sentenc or word   even though i realiz that peopl don   t mean that liter   will not afford us adequ flexibl to convey the import notion that we need to convey   so yes  it need to be concis  but in my view it would not be a good idea to drive for it to be so short that it didn   t contain adequ inform   we have some inform to impart to the market about where we think the economi is go  which will be help to them  and i think we should communic that inform in a veri general way
i  too  was in the work group and  as you can see  there was obvious not a consensus among the group on how to move forward   i was attract to the formula languag  though i recogn that there are some difficulti with it   it  sn   t appli to everi specif circumst  but it   provid a veri good framework for the committe to express it view  recogn that we can alway amplifi those view in earlier paragraph of the statement   the formula languag  sn   t prevent us from do that  and we would clear have to do that in some case   but obvious there   s no consensus in go forward on a formula approach today   so i won   t push it  just to be on the record  i favor the level b altern   i found some problem with the level a altern   the phrase    the path to    i found veri confus   there are mani differ path that would enabl us to reach our ul  object for output and inflat  and i think that phrase would be veri hard to explain to the public   so i have serious question about whether level a would be help to us  and i thought level b was easier to understand  in term of the gradual evolut approach  which we seem to be evolv to gradual  laughter    or mayb rapid   i would just say this   i think put the statement in the bluebook is a veri construct step   i believ it is veri import for everyon on the committe to see the draft word ahead of  e   if there are last minut chang to the draft statement  which i think was a possibl mention by    those addenda should be sent out as rapid as possibl to the member of the committe   i do think this process will requir more of our  e as a committe  which i   m sure is fine with all of us  and i think we should recogn that prospect  in term of the discuss of the specif of the statement at our meet  in term of the natur of the forward look at polici  i agre with what don kohn said  but i   d add anoth point   i think there   s a practic issu here in that it   s veri difficult for us as a committe to back away from provid that forward look insight into polici   i think it would be view by the market and by the public as a big step backward no matter what we do with the minut or even with our individu forecast   when we get to the discuss of the minut and the other communic issu  i think we can formul a packag   so i   ll hold off on the rest of my comment until then
let me just make a complic observ  which is that i   m not quit sure what we think we mean when we say we   re in favor of    gradual evolut      mani of you who have spoken today of gradual evolut have somewhat differ view about the futur statement in term of what the third paragraph should be   so i was just go to ask this complic question of you  governor     what   greater flexibl in assess the risk mean in term of which direct you want to see flexibl
i   m glad you ask becaus i was go to tri to summar the discuss and be more explicit about where i think we are   i   ve listen and written down some note   clear a number of you   though not a major   would like us to discontinu anyth that look like a risk assess   i   m interpret that even more broad  which is that this group  sn   t want to give what might be perceiv as hint about futur polici   that said  as i listen  most peopl seem to evolv to the follow view   pre set formula languag at some point will fall apart   the formula languag we use previous last for a few year  this languag may last  but it will never cover a veri subtl and complex situat   howev  i sens that most peopl also agre with governor kohn  presid    and a few other that either for practic reason or for theoret reason we do need to provid someth that is a bit forward look   in part that   s becaus it may help explain our polici and in part becaus it may help us communic to the market   not in the sens of give hint about polici but of fo  an appropri mindset in the market with respect to the incom data and what we are worri about   that has been describ as a balanc of risk assess  but it  sn   t have to be  so what i think we   re agre to here is a commit among ourselv  and frank with the market  that we will continu to provid some forward look languag that may have the flavor of indic that the committe tend to be more worri about x than about y   and how we say that has to be tailor a bit each  e to the particular circumst   if we are far away from what the committe general think of as an accept level   it could be a growth rate  but let   s say level   then presum we   re concern about that gap  whatev it is   on the other hand  if we are close to whatev we view as the right level  then presum we are worri about the point at which thing may chang and veer away   and we would be like to move   so i think what we have agre to here in this gradual evolut approach is that each statement will have someth that is forward look but it has to be tailor to the particular circumst that are prevail at that point   the languag may or may not includ a summat   what use to be the old balanc of risk   indic that we are more worri about x than y or that we are equal worri about both   there may be  e when we clear are more worri about inflat go lower or rise higher than we   d like   but we don   t necessarili have to commit to exact when we are go to tie togeth our assess of the risk  the other thing that i detect was a strong sens that  becaus we   re give the staff greater room to maneuv in draft the languag   not reduc it to a formula or to choos from column a or b   it   s import for various altern to be shown in the bluebook  we   re not talk about forti page  but there should be explicit exampl of how the forward look part might emphas one current or potenti develop more than anoth   i think those are the thing that we agre to   anoth point  which i believ   mention  is that be flexibl by definit mean that we also have the option not to includ a forward look element in the statement if we simpli can   t come to a common point of view    i think what i have outlin here reflect the general consensus  though there are some out point of view for sure   i believ that   s what we   re agre to  and that strike me as not a veri bad outcom  that   s my own summat   is that help
yes   i   m happi to associ myself with that consensus
okay  that is the broad consensus   let me say one other thing  though the chairman introduc the subject and got us somewhat focus on gradual evolut  from some previous discuss i think that is also a reflect of the broad middl view among the committe member after have look at the pros and con of the formula languag   i   m not at all surpris that we came to the sens that we want to be forward look but not tie ourselv to a formula  now i   d like to introduc the second topic  which is the releas of the minut   what i propos to do is to call on you in exact the same order as befor in lieu of ask peopl to rais their hand again   this topic was cover in one of the memo that were distribut  and i think that memo lay out veri clear the pros and con   this strike me as an area in which we are onc again balanc a lot of consider   my view on this is that  if we decid to releas the minut earlier  that is a decis we cannot adjust   unlik the risk assess issu that we just discuss  where i believ we can choos to includ a risk assess or not   if we move up the public of the minut  we are stuck with that decis   not just for this committe but for a veri long  e   therefor  as the chairman indic in his open remark  on this one we have to be veri  veri care   if we were to decid to releas the minut earli  in all honesti i think it would be round applaud by mani peopl   academ  perhap other central bank  and even the market   i had a discuss on anoth issu with the board of director of the bond market associ  and a number of them independ came up to me afterward and said     releas those minut earlier     have said that  i have come to the conclus that  on balanc  do so may not be well regard in the long run   the reason is that i firm believ that there would be an obvious interact between that decis on the minut and the discuss at our meet   one of two thing would like happen over  e   one  the discuss itself would becom less thorough and rich   the member would express fewer opinion about what might happen should some develop emerg   i suspect the condit statement we often make would not be express so fulli  and i think that would limit our abil to share our view and understand each other   or two  which is equal bad  the minut would becom a less accur reflect of the discuss that took place at the meet   that is  we might have these forward look condit discuss  but they wouldn   t be captur in the minut out of anxieti that the market would react negat       s chart point out that  in fact  our minut have serv us quit well becaus they are veri full and complet but they realli haven   t move the market  with one notic except   i   m afraid that if we acceler their releas so that they are closer to real  e we would find ourselv interven with the market more often  that lead to my second concern  which is the announc effect of the minut   i believ it is far better for this committe to speak onc contemporan with the decis and then let the market look at the incom data and react as oppos to come back two or three week later with anoth round of fed interact with the market   i think that do so  if anyth  will limit our abil to read the market fulli   the reason i chose to speak first on this topic is that i believ that it   s extrem import to think of this in a risk assess context  while mani peopl would argu that the benefit outweigh the risk  i am firm of the view that that is not necessarili the case   so befor we move headlong down this path  we need to think about it veri  veri care   have had my intervent first  let me go next to presid hoenig
i   ll combin a coupl of thing at this point   let me start out by say that  if the consensus conform with the view that you have just summar  i can live with that  i origin was in favor of releas the minut earlier  and my think was that do so would allow us to get rid of the risk statement   i know there is the thought that we can   t move back from a decis to acceler the releas of the minut  but i think the quid pro quo of elimin the risk statement could be favor   so that has some appeal to me   plus the minut give the market a more complet reflect of the broad view of the committe member  and there is perhap a benefit from that  i think that assess still hold   howev  i recogn your main point   i   ve been down that road befor  you jump  and then you   ve done it  and you can   t back out   so i don   t have a problem with approach the decis slowli  with a lot of thought   but i think it is a step worth consid and deliber   as for some of the comment that aris in our discuss  certain if the minut are not releas for two or three week  what we say in public statement dure that period can be more complic   but i think we live with that to an import degre now   so i don   t see that as a veri signific complic factor   the news event of the minut could be an issu if somehow the minut give a complet differ view of our assess of the balanc of risk than the statement did when we releas it   so i think the propos to advanc the public of the minut deserv continu thought if not accept at this point  final  i   m just go to go ahead to the next item  the role of our individu project  my thought was that  if elimin the risk statement were view as a back away  the project could be the substitut in term of fill in for inform that is forward look  that   s not as critic to me as the idea of releas the minut sooner to make public the general view of the committe   i   ll stop there
thank you   i don   t view releas the minut earlier as necessarili a bad idea   i do have two caveat associ with that view  and they are import to me   the first is that we should not do so and also expand the    blackout period    so that we end up with three or four week of blackout  essenti move us backward rather than forward  second  we should not releas the minut with such rapid as to get ourselv into a mechan problem that could later becom a polit problem   what i mean by that is that  in my view  everi member should have an opportun to see the minut and be comfort with them   we don   t want to find ourselv in a situat where there is a differ of opinion about what should be in the minut or what was said in the meet and have no way of resolv it becaus of the pressur of  e   the way i express it in my note on the subject is that at a differ  e with a differ staff we could find ourselv in a contenti environ  with disagr among the committe member as to what we want to say in the minut   i would hate to have a situat where the resolut is rush becaus the minut have to go to bed by thursday  say  or otherwis the market will see that there is discord in the committe  with that mechan piec of it resolv  i think we could in fact releas the minut somewhat more rapid   when i was think about all this  i wonder how rapid that was  are we essenti talk about move up the public by a week and then get into an overlap with the next fomc meet  or are we talk about releas it in two week with plenti of  e for everybodi to get a chanc to review it   i thought perhap we should consid do a dri run without actual releas the minut earli   we could say suppos we were to releas the document in three week  what would be the mechan   could we get there   i   d tri that dure      and see  with the benefit of a year   s histori  if we are comfort with the prospect of acceler the prepar and releas of the minut   so that   s where i am
so you come out with tri the mechan of this without go to the last step of releas the minut
yes  to make sure that we   re happi with the result   we can have a whole year of experi   we could ask ourselv  if we were go to releas these minut  do we think that would chang the market   whi or whi not   do we think the mechan issu would make it impract to releas the minut for four or five week and then would that interfer with the next fomc meet   a dri run would give us an opportun intern to see how this would work
okay   presid santomero has laid a third altern on the tabl  presid  n
i   ve long been relat enthusiast about releas the minut earlier  and that continu to be my view   i think toni   s suggest for do some dri run is a construct one   i   ve basic thought that the minut are an underappreci asset   they contain a lot of inform  but peopl don   t pay ani attent to them becaus of the  e of their releas   so i   m interest in have them taken serious   i   m make what is perhap a nave assumpt that the substanc wouldn   t chang   after all  the minut are base on a transcript of the meet  so to some extent i think that   s a reason but not foolproof assumpt   your comment  roger  about hit the market a second  e and perhap creat more chao than be help give me a bit of paus   my ul  reaction to that  though  is that there   s bound to be some learn period that   s go to go on for i don   t know how long   month  quarter  or mayb even a year   but i would think that over  e market particip would come to understand what   s go on   and in my view  the better communic is worth the price
thank you   first  roger  i thought you had a veri good summari of the first discuss   there was someth you said then that i would like to emphas regard the last item in the first column in     s tabl     discontinu the assess of risk portion of the statement      i believ that you said we would be flexibl about the risk statement but we would not elimin it   that happen to be my posit   i think that from  e to  e peopl are go to want a bottom line  and i think we ought to give it   we can be flexibl with it   we have been flexibl with it   but i wouldn   t want to elimin it  on the minut  i frank use to agre with you that it was good to releas them after the next meet and keep them out of the news   but this latest episod has turn me around becaus it is now clear that mani peopl think   even though it is not true   that we use the minut  say  from our octob meet to amplifi our decemb messag   while that is not true  onc the suspicion are out there it   s hard  no matter what we say  to get rid of them   so i am somewhat reluct go to the notion that mayb releas the minut earlier is in order  that is  after we have the meet  then two or three week later   whenev the staff can prepar them   we publish the minut   i think we ought to keep the minut just the way they are now  i agre with gari that they are an underappreci asset  and i wouldn   t chang their substant content at all   i   m persuad that the committe is quit ethic  and i don   t believ we would chang them   i think the process would go forward just as it   now with the one except   that the minut would come out three week  say  after the meet  i would agre with toni in that i would not chang the blackout period   pretti soon we could be black out total   so i   d keep the blackout period the same   we   d realli do everyth as we do now except that we   d releas the minut three week after the meet  on the experi  it   s my impress     that you alreadi did that   you acceler the prepar of the minut this last  e  and i didn   t notic ani loss of output or product   mayb somebodi did  but i thought they were just as they alway have been   so even provision i don   t think we need to experi much
we did the easi part of the experi  which was the staff side  well  it may not have been easi for the peopl actual draft the minut   we creat a rough draft by about this  e next week   we   ll do that again   the harder part of the experi is resolv how you will comment on the draft   will you want to see other member    comment  how will you know that the secretari has incorpor your comment and weigh various suggest against each other   how will we deliv it to you electron in a secur manner  so there is some work to do   also  we need to think about the rule associ with the product of the minut  such as the deadlin for submit comment and other item of that natur
i strong favor move forward the releas of the minut  but let me review briefli how i get there   i go back to the basic principl of the way i understand how monetari polici affect the economi   what we use to refer to as the transmiss mechan  name  what we do and what we say affect expect about futur polici and interest rate general   that is the foundat on which i build all of my think about this   with that point of view  it seem to me inescap that we have to have forward look statement   and to me it   s high desir for us to tri to give some sens of how we see the balanc of risk in the outlook   so i come out on that where don and   did   i feel strong that we have to have a forward look element in our statement  i don   t see how we can do without that  go back to our earlier discuss  it   s also clear to me  larg from the work of roger   s work group  that it   s go to be veri difficult and probabl imposs to convey this forward look assess with a brief post meet statement   even if we had some addit sentenc  i just don   t think that   s like to work   so that is what lead me to conclud that we need to consid move the minut forward   the minut are detail enough to convey   as they alreadi do   both the major and minor opinion about the outlook and the balanc of risk  and they do it reason robust   also in term of transit  the public and the market are familiar with the minut   yes  i realiz there   s a risk that they may chang if we chang the regim here   still  the general form and content of the minut certain are go to be similar  so they will be familiar to peopl  there are obvious drawback   it   s not a freebi   it   s not a panacea   a lot has alreadi been said about that   obvious  too  staff and committe member are go to have to be will to devot  e in the period right after the meet just to go through the process of get the minut readi for releas   and that   s not trivial   it   s go to requir chang in schedul and practic   i don   t see how in the world we can make a blackout work   so there is the risk that statement we make will add some nois to financi market   but market know how to discount that type of thing alreadi  so i   m not terribl concern about that  i must say that some of the point you rais  roger  are worth think about   i   m not sure that i   ve thought them through complet enough yet   on the point about our hit the market a second  e  my initi reaction is to tri to imagin what this new regim would be like where we are continu releas much earlier a lot more inform about what went on at each meet   it may well be that  in that sort of atmospher  it wouldn   t be news in the same sens that the statement is news now   i just haven   t thought that through complet  but it   s a point worth make   in ani event  for all these reason i think releas the minut earlier is our best altern   if we did that  we should continu to issu a statement immedi after the meet   and that   s how i got to the conclus earlier that someth on the order of the gradual evolut path would be okay for the statement if we took these other measur   but i can   t separ them
okay   governor bernank
thank you  governor     one of the reason we find it difficult to issu a polici statement is that there   s such a wide diverg of view around the tabl   the special advantag of the minut is that they repres the divers view and give some perspect and depth to the discuss   they also includ a lot of valuabl and interest inform from the staff present about the state of the economi   so i would be veri much in favor of move up the public of the minut   i would note  to address governor     s concern  that we would not be the first central bank to use the minut this way  mani central bank around the world do that without problem as far as i   m awar  with respect to the blackout  i think extend the blackout period would be counterproduct for mani reason   one of them is that it would be like a drum roll up to the minut that would in fact exagger the impact of the minut   so i would favor keep the blackout as it is   no one has mention this   the chairman might want to weigh in on it   but it might make sens on the regular schedul two day meet to hold the minut until after the chairman   s tes oni but just in those two instanc  final  with respect to the idea of dri run  perhap one or two might be worthwhil but it seem to me that  if we are go to make some chang  it would nice to be abl to announc them as a packag   do dri run for the whole year would limit in that respect the impact of the overal chang  if there is one  in our transpar polici
thank you  roger   first of all i   d like to congratul you on your somewhat brilliant descript of gradual evolut   i think there was someth in there that everybodi could hang onto and like
oh no  you caught me
it   s go to be interest to see this evolut   but as you   ve describ it  i   m comfort with it  and i think that   s the way we should go   i must say that i thought governor bie was correct and convey my sens of the valu of ambigu in a short statement   we   ve use it a lot   if one goe back and look at the statement we   ve issu over the last three or four year  they   ve contain a lot of vagu word   but they   ve also convey a decent sens of where the committe was go without tie us down   so i think there is some valu in ambigu   and not just becaus it may result in a shorter statement or ani reason like that   so i want to put in a littl vote for some construct ambigu  if i may call it that  i have long been in favor of releas the minut earli and had begun to question myself a littl on that for some of the reason that roger just mention   but as i throw my concern back and forth i come out on balanc in favor of releas the minut earli   i was look at it as a quid pro quo for elimin the risk statement   i   m not so sure we can use it that way   i tend to agre with presid   that total elimin the risk statement might be view as take a step backward  but i   m not sure about that   there is an issu that nobodi has talk about with respect to the releas of the minut that goe to the divers of opinion that are express in them   if we put the minut out earli  those opinion are public at a  e when they have some mean with regard to the next meet   sudden there may be a drumbeat from the press and other place as to who said this and who said that and who said the other thing  there   s a possibl that that could affect us  although i don   t agre with a blackout either   in ani event  it may be obvious by the  e the minut come out where the nuanc of perspect are at least among some of the more public activ member of the committe  i think presid santomero has a good idea   and it   s one that i had in my note as well   in suggest that we should parallel test this   if i recal correct  not onli the decemb minut but even the minut from the meet befor that were done somewhat earlier than usual   but i didn   t look at them in the same way that i would look at them now   in term of what they say versus the prevail view in the market and whether there would like be ani market implic when the minut are releas   do i think they would have a big impact or not   so i would favor a period of parallel test of this if peopl think it   s worthwhil go to the extra troubl to do that   frank  i wouldn   t make ani discern chang in our communic process befor do that or much befor midyear or so   i don   t think the gradual evolut in the statement would be view by the market as a major chang   and if we   re go to releas the minut earli  we need some  e to realli think about that as a group and see how we feel about it when we review what   s in the earli rendit of the draft minut that we get
thank you  cathi   i alway make it a practic of call for a coffe break whenev anyon say someth nice about me   this seem like a good  e to have a coffe break  speaker      now i   ll know in the futur   coffe break
i   m interest in but not yet enthusiast about acceler the releas of the minut   i think the inform advantag to the market of get the minut rough in their current form sever week earlier would be meaning   but sinc the earlier releas of the minut would becom a signific polici event in itself and sinc it preced the next fomc meet  i am concern that the acceler minut would be differ and perhap less inform than the current one   i also worri that our discuss would be affect by the knowledg that the market would focus more sharpli on the minut than they do now   that lead me to the view  if we   re go to pursu this   and i   d certain be support of go the next step or two   that we should have trial run or parallel process   for me the issu is not get the minut draft   i think the staff can do that readili   but the process of edit and resolv ani disagr that may aris with regard to specif edit chang   so in my view there   s room to look at this further
thank you   presid
governor    i think cathi describ your summari of the risk assess discuss as somewhat brilliant   i agre with that although we don   t need anoth coffe break    laughter   when you summar the discuss i thought you had left open the possibl of discontinu the formal risk assess portion of the statement   but governor   indic that he thought you hadn   t   i would urg you to keep consid that option  mani of you have emphas the valu of continu to have someth that is forward look  but i think there is the possibl of have forward look  relev inform in backward look statement   when we take an action at a meet and we say whi we did it  we are give inform about the kind of develop that trigger an action by us   if those condit chang or if they don   t chang in the next sever week  then market particip can form their own conclus about the implic of that  move on to the releas of the minut  i thought your preemptiv descript of that was brilliant  not just somewhat brilliant   i agre with all of it   i was prepar to trade away someth on the minut for the elimin of the risk assess   but i agre that what we have in the minut now is veri good  and given my druther  i   d stay with our current procedur   by our releas them after the next meet they   re avail for scholar  economist  and other to do what they want with them   they don   t disturb the market   put them out befor the next meet i think inevit is go to disturb the market   the onli  e the minut could come out befor the next meet and not do damag would be immedi after the meet they   re describ  which is obvious imposs   so i agre with everyth you said about releas the minut earlier   of cours  this put us on the wrong side of what peopl perceiv as inevit histori   we   re not go to be regard as progress in term of transpar   but i do believ your posit is right with regard to blackout  i think the blackout period after our meet is alreadi an anachron  and we ought to be consid shorten rather than lengthen it   to me the blackout sever day befor the meet is use   but onc we began issu statement on the day of the meet  the post meet blackout no longer serv a use purpos
thank you  governor     i agre with your character of the way to think about this as be risk manag   that   s a concept the chairman has use in other polici discuss   i don   t think the risk are so larg in term of the process of produc the minut  though i see some small risk there   and like most other who have spoken  i don   t like the idea of a blackout of essenti half of the period between meet   i think that would be a terribl step backward  to me the larger risk   and this is go to seem strang  but i take a differ view from the one you express   is that  rather than be less inform  the minut could becom more inform in an unfortun sens  you were say that perhap the discuss would be more care and more circumspect and as a result the minut would not be as inform   a point that bob parri also mention   i think it   s possibl that it could go the other way and that some peopl would be tri to get into the minut their own particular way of think about the economi   that could inadvert lead to a lot of  e be spent in the meet tri to get our prefer point of view into the minut and more  e spent argu dure the edit process about how much of that languag surviv   and it seem to me  as cathi   suggest  that the minut will be read more care if they come out befor the next polici meet   so depend on whose view the reader pick out of the minut  if we have that kind of joust for phraseolog and languag in the minut  we could in fact end up with minut that are more inform than we realli want them to be   i see that as a larger risk  as strang as that may sound   i just don   t think we need to go in that direct right now   and onc we do  we   ll have a veri hard  e go back the other way   so i would strong prefer to sit tight  i also origin thought of the earli releas of the minut as a possibl tradeoff to get away from the risk assess in the post meet statement   but i think there   s anoth way to make that kind of trade and it   s in the monetari polici report   we   ll come back to that short  that   s an issu i would like to keep open also  as presid   suggest   thank you
thank you   for all the reason that were list as pros in     s present  i was lean toward support earli releas of the minut   howev  some of the con list on the same page and in   madigan   s memo are more troublesom to me   i think they also present some greater risk  especi the temptat to send signal and the abil to make condit statement   some of the point that presid guynn just made  also  there   s the issu that presid santomero rais about the abil to work out differ among committe member or the committe and the staff in a  e fashion   those concern caus me to step back and not support earli releas at this  e   i was also go to recommend  as presid santomero did  that we do some dri run if the committe at some point feel compel to go in this direct   i think we realli do need to have some practic with this process to make sure that we are work out all of these issu  especi those that are list on the    con    side   so at this  e i   m not will to support earli releas of the minut   i want to have a better understand of some of the issu that have been rais
thank you   governor bie
thank you  governor     i   m go to come out on the side of support earlier releas of the minut   let me tell you whi   in respons to the comment that the earli releas of the minut would be anoth news event and could move the market  i   d point out that we are out give speech all the  e   our public statement all have the potenti to move market on occas  and in fact it has happen   to my mind we   re better off releas the minut   at least then there   s a balanc approach  with the divers of view present at one  e rather than the view that get press attent be depend on whose speak engag come where on the calendar   so i think that the earlier public of the minut would diminish the news event   it would help put into context when a bank presid or governor is speak where their view are in the continuum of view express at the meet that had just occur   i believ it actual would help lessen the    news    impact compar with the reaction to our speech   i also don   t want to extend the blackout period becaus i think our public appear are a critic way for us to communic between meet   we can communic when econom condit have chang from those that led to the decis we made at a meet  new data may get us move in a differ way   so i would hate to extend the blackout period  let me comment on one of the altern regard how to handl the approv of the minut   whether we should do that as a subcommitte or not   i strong disagre with the subcommitte approach   i think all of us need to be involv becaus these are our minut and they are veri import   i would feel veri uncomfort have a subcommitte perform that function   i also would like to see us go ahead and do the dri run where all of us have to make sure we schedul  e to read and comment on the minut   given that we couldn   t pull back from the releas date   but we could alway releas them earlier   i would suggest that  if we do go forward  we releas the minut with a relat long window for the draft and approv process   if we get better and fa  at it  we can move up the public date  but we can   t go the other way   so i would leav us some room and start with a longer period initi
thank you   i   m quit skeptic of earli releas of the minut   let me say that i start from the posit that the minut must absolut be true to the transcript that is go to be releas five year later   we can   t have a discuss of an issu that might be sensit and leav it out of the minut entir  somebodi will look at the transcript later and say that the minut just didn   t reflect what happen at that meet   so i think that   s a veri import consider  as i think about my own experi  not too long after i came here in      we had the problem of the long term capit manag hedg fund and the relat upset in the secur market   if i recal   and my recollect may be wrong  but that  sn   t matter for this purpos becaus we could imagin it take place   at our august meet of that year we had some discuss of what was go on at that fund   and we had an interim confer call discuss befor the septemb fomc meet   if we had releas the minut for august on some standard schedul along the line of what is be consid now  they would have come out just at the  e that all hell was break loos  if i may put it that way  in the financi market   now  unlik governor bie  i think there are  e when it   s veri construct to be quiet and not to say anyth   even if one has a schedul speech  there   s a way of give a speech and not say anyth about the fomc and monetari polici   i think we   ve all been there   but if the minut are come out and they   re go to be true to the transcript  we may not have ani choic but to say in the minut what went on at the meet   so  that   s one of the reason that i come out against earli releas of the minut  there   s also a practic issu that was not discuss in the work group   s report  i don   t know whether they consid it  but i think it would need to be consid   what happen if we want to have an interim meet a coupl of day befor or a coupl of day after the date the minut are to be releas   how   that complic our situat     the releas of the minut then muddi the messag that come from a polici decis at an interim meet   or if the minut are releas a coupl of day befor an interim meet  what do we do   what is the releas schedul for minut of an interim meet becaus  as i recal  those tradit are attach to the minut of the earlier meet   i don   t know whether or not those issu were discuss  but it seem to me veri import that we think through how we would handl those type of situat   i   m quit skeptic about move up the releas of the minut becaus when we look at all this care  i think we   re go to find a lot of veri sensit and potenti unfortun interact of that kind
thank you  governor     on balanc i   m lean in favor of earli releas of the minut   i think there is a lot of inform in them   it   s a much more complet explan of whi we did what we did and how we look at the futur   point that i made befor in talk about the statement   and as presid   said  the minut do give a sens of altern perspect   part becaus we have so few dissent on the committe   s polici decis  i think it is import to get the sens out there that there are altern reason for arriv at the same decis   consequ  though i do think earli releas would move market and it could be uncomfort from  e to  e  on balanc i believ that over  e it would result in market be more stabil by move in direct we want  i do recogn the concern that presid pool  presid guynn  and governor   have rais   they also have rais some technic issu about intermeet move or discuss that we need to think about care   and i do think it would requir some disciplin on the part of the committe to avoid have the earlier releas of the minut caus feedback effect on the committe   s deliber   i like the idea of the dri run   i   m not sure we need to go through a whole year of dri run  but we should do them at least for a while   and it   s not onli a product issu   it   s a matter of think about what these minut would do to the market if they came out today   now  the valu of the dri run is limit becaus  with our know that it   s a dri run  we won   t get the feedback of the minut on the deliber   but i think it can at least help inform a decis later if we have a number of instanc of the dri run
thank you   presid
this is a veri import issu  and on balanc i come out favor earli releas of the minut   it might make us a littl uncomfort at  e  but i think  as the document said  it will also make us more account  and in my view that   s a plus   it   s a real posit in that it improv our transpar   quit frank  in this age of rapid communic it   s hard to justifi hold off for six to eight week befor we releas them   it   s a red face test that i find difficult   i know we can alway say that we have to approv them at the next meet  but again in this era of communic i find that hard to justifi   i think the minut are a supplement to the statement that we releas short after the meet   i don   t view them as a substitut for that in ani way   so to me it   s an addit bit of transpar   i think toni   s suggest of a dri run is a good one  we need to work out the mechan and to set the rule for process the minut   i don   t think a full year is necessari  but it would be help to have a dri run  let me touch on the two point that roger made  which are both veri import   one is that it may affect the committe   s discuss   on balanc i realli don   t think it would affect the comment at the meet all that much   the onli  e it might have an impact is when we make condit statement   for exampl  that if certain develop occur  we may need to have an intermeet telephon call   i think we   d have to work out some way to deal with those type of circumst   i don   t know exact what that should be  but we do have to address that  other than that  i just don   t see it affect the discuss at the meet ani more than the releas of the minut after the subsequ meet     as for the other point about speak onc in our post meet statement and then let the market interpret the data  i think susan bie put it veri well   we are all individu speak at various  e  and in the process we generat a lot of news event   the press is cover us more than we would like   that   s just part of the process  and if we releas the minut earlier  the market and the press will becom accustom to it  on the blackout  i agre complet with bob   that the blackout period after the meet is obsolet   i think it could be shorten quit consider   we did shorten it about eight year ago as i recal   it use to go through the weekend  and we push it back to the close of busi on the friday after the meet   in my view  we could easili move it back earlier  as for bill pool   s comment about the  e of interim meet   i think these are import issu to think through ahead of  e  but on balanc i believ they   re manag
come new to this discuss  i have been more move by the argument in favor of acceler the releas of the minut than i am troubl by the argument against   but the argument against are prolifer  and those argument are signific   some of them i hadn   t thought through  and i believ they   re worth think about care   my general sens is that we should tri to get ourselv more comfort than we are now as a group with move toward earli releas   whatev way we can get ourselv more comfort are worth invest in   i would offer the qualif  just to amplifi what don said  that i doubt a dri run is go to tell us much about what   s realli materi to the choic here   it won   t tell us anyth about the market dynam   it won   t tell us anyth about how the decis will affect the dynam of the discuss   it won   t tell us anyth about how hard it is to get a consensus on the minut if the differ of view becom consequenti   my sens is that we should think through these two specif question of whether it complic an intermeet decis or reduc our discret on intermeet action   and we should explor a bit bill pool   s question about whether there are discuss we would have in this room   on subject such as a major financi system issu   that we would not want to mention public within six week much less three week or two week   i think those matter are worth explor  frank  befor we take this next step of go into a dri run   but just to end where i began  i think it   s worth tri to see if we can get ourselv more comfort with move in this direct becaus i suspect the return are worth it
may i ask the vice chair a question
what do you have in mind   let me put it this way   a dri run as an abstract obvious has a purpos   you   re suggest that it won   t work  nonetheless  you   re agre with the purpos of it  which mean you have an altern suggest
whi don   t we ask the baron of this place to explor a bit some of these technic question that haven   t been explor in detail in the paper   whi don   t we ask them to do that  and come back to us befor we go through the mechan of launch a dri run   i suggest that becaus i think those issu are more import  frank  than what we   re go to learn in a dri run
let me give governor olson a chanc to speak  and then i   ll tri anoth summat   or the chairman may want to speak  and then i   ll tri anoth summat
let me make a coupl of point   first of all  i think there are two goal in this process   clariti and transpar   go back to the risk assess issu and speak as a gradual evolutionist   regardless of what altern we might have chosen among the risk assess altern   in spite of the fact that we think we do a pretti good job of communic  not everybodi in the market agre   so no matter what we might have decid on the risk assess issu  some peopl would have said that we had not increas either the transpar or the clariti   as for move up the releas of the minut  i don   t see how there can be ani question that do so would be an improv in our effort toward both goal  i haven   t been involv in this process on this side of the wall for as long as mani of you  but i start follow the fed from a public polici point of view over thirti year ago  and it seem to me that someth the fed has done to improv itself is to increas it transpar   the statement on the polici decis  the expand minut  the concurr releas of the vote  and the releas of the transcript all have help to reduc some of the my i regard the fed   i think that the fed oper in more anonym than almost ani other public or quasi public bodi   and how we continu to deal with the question of transpar is a matter that i think we want to control and not have somebodi suggest to us that we ought to be do more  have said that  i want to come back to governor     s open remark becaus i think what he said is critic   in this instanc  onc we have made the decis  we can never go back   so of all the option we   re look at  this is one that we need to consid with the most deliber   i would suggest that  if we move in this direct  we do a dri run and simul the process at the same  e   even if it  sn   t chang much   and i think it will   it has the potenti to chang a great deal  and the simul may suggest to us issu that we may not have thought of   so i   m in favor of the earli releas of the minut  but i   m in favor of do it under a variat of the santomero approach   that we test it veri care befor go forward
chairman  span on the earli releas of the minut
there is a major issu here that i find troublesom  and i don   t know how to get around it  though i recogn that it may be feasibl to do so   it   s the issu that toni santomero has rais   we have veri scrupul avoid a nineteen member communiqu© type discuss of the post meet statement   now  if we take this issu of individu edit the minut serious  it involv a veri standard procedur that  if we actual follow  we would never finish by the  e we now releas the minut   that   s becaus we all would have suggest addit and delet   and addit and delet chang the context of what we have in the minut   at our meet we typic have three or four hour of discuss  and write the minut to fulli captur what went on is an art   the notion that we would all decid on what to includ in the minut that would fulli reflect our discuss or that we would agre on how to say it is just not believ   it   s not a big deal now becaus the impact on the market and the impact on what we do is not veri larg  i do think that this is realli an unknown   we have no idea how this process would work  it is quit conceiv  if we go ahead and subsequ find out that we can   t make it work becaus we are run into the equival of a nineteen person communiqu©  that we   re go to have some veri serious difficulti   it may mean that we will so diminish the minut that the issu bill pool rais   name whether they will look like an accur reflect of the transcript releas five year later   will becom a veri serious credibl issu   i frank don   t know the answer to that   that   s one of the reason i think the trial run  or the equival of what the vice chair is talk about  have a certain ring of desir  my judgment  as i   ve said befor  is that in a veri general way we ought to be seek to find as our ul  communic vehicl a way that  when we make a statement after meet   regardless of whether we act or don   t act   noth happen   what that suggest is that anyth we can do to converg the amount of inform current avail in the intermeet period to the point at which we make our decis is to the good   theoret that would suggest that we definit should speed up the public of the minut becaus by construct that would do it   we have one problem  howev   the problem is that appar the market overreact to whatev we say   if that is inde the case  then to move up the releas of the minut could be counterproduct to our goal   frank  i don   t see how one can know the answer to that particular question  there   s veri littl doubt that a good part of our deliber has becom increas condit   inde  the whole pattern of the most recent period has been character by this evolv    consider period    discuss  which is a conting if i ever saw one   and we   re go to do more of that becaus a risk manag mode is invari emerg as the way we oper   what i was identifi in the aea paper i deliv at the begin of the month was actual what had evolv in this committe   i was not suggest that there was some point when we said     we are go to take a risk manag view of monetari polici      it didn   t happen that way   it was  as we like to say today  gradual   the reason that has happen is that these market are chang and becom ever more sophist  so our approach is of necess tri to match that degre of sophist and is continu evolv  consequ  i think it   s veri difficult to know whether releas the minut earlier will be a plus or a minus  a number of thing could start to happen of which i don   t think we   re awar   nobodi has mention the obvious thing  which i   m sure will start to occur  which is that there will be pressur to identifi the peopl who took various posit   we don   t get that now becaus virtual nobodi except the academ read the post meet minut   but i don   t think it   s credibl to believ that that   s not go to happen   susan bie made a veri import observ   name  that there is a tendenc for our speech not to be uniform   we have nineteen member in this group  and i will submit to you that the distribut of word utter public between meet by member of this committe is high concentr  i would say that most of the statement are made by signific less than half the member   and i don   t think they are necessarili a repres half   so in that respect it   s use  as susan said  to get the minut out to provid some specif context for the polici decis  have listen to the convers today   and i must admit that i have been on all side of this issu over the year   my sens is that it get more and more complex   the one thing i   m sure of is that we ought to be reason certain how we think this is go to come out befor we move   i don   t know what vehicl we could use to becom reason certain   i do think the trial run is not go to solv the problem  as the vice chair point out  but it will give us some insight   and i   m sure that tri to work our way through what we would do under various condit will be help   the crucial question  howev  is what we will do about conting statement   if we decid to leav them in  there is a fair signific risk that we   re go to increas the volatil go into the next meet   if we take them out  we are do an injustic to the intent of convey what actual went on in the meet  and without them  we may in fact make the meet minut incoher   in other word  somebodi will note that someth obvious went on that   s not mention in the minut becaus the discuss  sn   t seem to track   peopl are not react to each other   s view   when the conting statement are put in  it all come togeth  so of the three issu that we   ve rais here  i think this is the toughest one   i understand the notion that we are a public institut and we have an oblig to the elector to be forthcom in all respect short of that which diminish our capabl to do what we are statutorili requir to do by the feder reserv act   and we are the onli one who can make that judgment unless we do it so poor that somebodi els will impos a differ judgment on us   but we can be certain  as someon said   i believ it was you  mark   that the judgment impos on us by somebodi els would scarc be better than one we would make  so the way i come out at this stage is that i   m a littl concern about move forward on this   but becaus of the public natur of this institut  i do think that we have to tri to see if we can move forward on it   befor we act  though  we have to be reason convinc that it will not make our job on monetari polici  which is the most import issu here  more difficult to implement becaus we   ve set up barrier to our abil to function effect   if that in fact happen  we are do a grave disservic to our mandat   i think the crucial issu here is not an issu first and foremost of be transpar   the crucial issu is to do the right thing in term of our monetari polici decis   be transpar mere involv explain what we did and what we might do   but if in the process of the explan we undercut our abil to do the best thing  that to me is a net loss
thank you   let me first disclos what i think the talli is   there are  i believ   it   s hard to get all the nuanc right   seven or mayb eight peopl whom i would describ as not enthusiast   the remaind appar feel that they   ve weigh the pros and con and on balanc are more comfort go ahead with an earlier releas of the minut  the obvious middl ground is to undertak some form of test as best we can  understand that what     said is true   the ul  test will not occur until we actual releas the minut   howev  i suspect we all believ  sinc no other approach immedi come to mind  that we ought to tri a bit of a dri run   that   s one thing to do  anoth thing we can do  which i have done  though mayb a lot of you have not  is to read some of the minut from other central bank   we can ask the staff to circul them  and you   ll see that some look familiar in term of be consist with what we do   some  such as those from the bank of sweden  are veri much in the mode that toni santomero suggest  one member said x  anoth member said y  and when you   re through what you get is a one paragraph version of the transcript   so there   s a rang in the way the minut could be formul   i propos that we circul some exampl so peopl can see what minut from other central bank look like   i would propos also that the staff go back and develop a way to work through toni   s thought of have a bit of a dri run for long enough to test some of the concern we have rais   do a dri run for just one or two meet this year may not prove to be much of a test becaus the probabl   though i can   t predict it fulli   that we   re go to be in a mode where we   re talk about conting and potenti chang in interest rate  sn   t seem so high   on the other hand  if we conduct dri run for a year  i think we will get to a posit where we are at least have more serious discuss of chang  so i think we could conclud by say that we should go forward with some sort of concept of a dri run  with the staff tri to give us an idea of how the minut would look and how this process would work   we could proceed down that path  recogn the concern that have been rais and the fact that  as   has pick up  this is a veri close call   even those who are enthusiast see some risk  and a number of other peopl clear are not enthusiast    that seem like a reason place to end this discuss  know that we   ll have to come back to make a decis on how to do the dri run and then onc the dri run is done we   ll look at this again   cathi
i would just like to interject that i think we can make the dri run a bit more effect  recogn that  as   said  we won   t realli know what the market feedback would be   nonetheless  we should put some effort into address the minut issu by prepar them for public and then read them again at the  e they would have been releas in the context of what   s go on in the market   we could then come to some assess of what the impact of their releas might be
yes  i think that   s an import point   we   re oblig to take this test serious   unless that is done  we   re go to learn noth   if we all essenti tri to replic what we would do in the real game  i think we   ll learn someth
i think the staff need to help us figur out if there   s a way to look at the content of the minut at the  e they are complet as well as the incom data sinc the meet and judg what the market reaction might have been   we need to tri to get an approxim  though admit a veri rough one  of how the market might have react
you know what we   ll learn   we   re go to learn how mani iter we need
oh  we   ll learn that
that   s one of the crucial aspect   i   ve sat through the write of too mani g   communiqu©  and that process make the old sausag factori analog seem benign   and the fomc has more member than the g
could i suggest in the interest of  e  unless someon has a burn issu here  that we move on to the third topic  which is the role of project   that is also veri import to a number of peopl   can we start our go around on that   would you like to start  mr  chairman
i might as well sinc i have the floor
you alway have the floor   you can exercis that prerog
i have veri consider concern about this   let me say  first  that if somebodi is mere argu that we should substitut core pce for the cpi in our project  i think that   s fine   if somebodi is discuss the width of uncertainti band for the project  i   m all for that   but rememb what these    forecast    are   i say that becaus everi six month i have to struggl when i appear befor the bank committe to tri to explain what these forecast mean   everyth i am discuss at those hear   which is a reflect of what we said at our previous meet   is full of vagu here  imbal there  and my endeavor to convey a fair broad sens of where the risk are   and then we have point es  with no specif of what the assumpt are and no specif of what the analyt structur of the forecast mechan is   what we call the rang of forecast is not the true rang   it   s the rang of mean   and that  as everybodi know  is smaller than the rang of potenti outcom seen by each individu  i would almost prefer  if we are go to continu give these sort of project  that we just show the rang without a central tendenc   the reason i say that is that the central tendenc isn   t a reflect of the way we function   these forecast were larg provid to avoid have to put out what would realli be an interest forecast   the staff forecast   that forecast is an intern consist forecast with explicit assumpt and explicit exogen variabl in it  and therefor one has some way of evalu it   i submit to you that there is no way to evalu what one is look at in the forecast we provid   to make them more elabor would involv a veri difficult process   and to tri to averag a group of heterogen statist is particular counterproduct to the subtleti in which we are engag when we are tri to make veri nuanc monetari polici decis  rememb that we don   t actual function off these forecast   it is quit conceiv  as has been the case on mani occas  that our    maximum likelihood    es    or median or central tendenc or ani other term you can think of to describ it   is overwhelm by a particular low probabl event   that low probabl event  if it were to occur  is so import that it overrid the central tendenc forecast   the issu of deflat  for exampl  has been a concern   in none of our forecast last year did we project anyth resembl deflat   yet i would submit to you that the strongest aspect of our monetari polici had to do not with the forecast or the expect of the most like outcom but with that low probabl  high difficulti problem  i have alway tri to decreas the exposur of these forecast  and i   ve tri veri specif to avoid them as much as possibl in my semiannu tes oni on monetari polici  inde  as you may have notic  on occas i don   t mention them in my tes oni but they are in the monetari polici report   the reason is that it is veri difficult to handl  in part becaus the outlook might have chang sinc the forecast were made   at the point when i   m testifi  these forecast are three or four week old   a short term forecast that is three  four  or five week out of date is realli veri peculiar look  and it   s hard to have to sit there and tri to explain what that forecast is suppos to mean   i   ve person found have to deal with that dure my tes oni psycholog debilit    laughter   but that  i grant you  is not a reason not to provid it  i certain think it   s wise to put in the core pce  larg becaus that  sn   t chang anyth i just said   i don   t see how we can widen the uncertainti band without defin what we mean by them   to talk about uncertainti band for a set of project that have no appropri statist characterist to add them up strike me as stretch our knowledg with regard to the natur of measur probabl  so i think there   s noth to be gain   for myself anyway   by expand the role of the project   if we realli want to move forward in this respect  then basic it becom a question of whether or not to provid a staff forecast   we can decid what the exogen variabl are and instruct the staff to chang variabl x  y  and z on fiscal polici  say  or even monetari polici for that matter  and then we   d have someth that has statist characterist  i   m not sure i   d be in favor of do that   it   s a huge job  i don   t think expand the role of our project is go to help us veri much becaus i don   t think these forecast realli correspond all that much to what we say about the economi  at the juli meet i sat there with everybodi   s forecast in front of me as you all discuss the economi  and i had great difficulti match the forecast with the commentari   and i will tell you the reason   when you talk  you speak in probabilist term  when you put down your forecast  it   s a specif number   if the forecast realli matter great in our deliber and in our polici decis  then i think we   d have an oblig to make that clear in order to be transpar and to communic to the market that those forecast are what we   re look at  but we   re not   so  to focus on those forecast would in my view actual be counterproduct to our purpos of be transpar   i think we would be confus the market by lead them to think that the forecast provid a basi for our oper   the market would react to chang in the forecast when in fact those forecast have veri littl to do with the way we function
thank you   let me just say that the idea of use the project came to me perhap more as a reflect of how much i dislik the risk statement than how much i realli like the project   so  given the almost brilliant discuss of the risk statement  i   m not marri at all to the project   i understand all the issu and concern  and i agre that we   d have a veri difficult  e make that work go forward   but i suppos it did serv my purpos in the sens that it illustr my willing to get rid of the risk statement   with that i   m go to be quiet
okay   presid santomero
are we still on the risk statement    laughter
we   re theoret on the role of the project   you have the floor
well  i concur with the chairman on this one   i think we have to keep in mind that we   re not in the forecast busi   and we should not do anyth to reinforc the notion that eight or ten  e a year we have a forecast of the macroeconomi  no matter what it statist valid   it take away from what peopl should be focus on as our respons   move from two to eight forecast releas each year with our thirteen staff work on the project es  would take up a lot of  e   and explain our forecast on an ongo basi   discuss their accuraci or inaccuraci    sn   t particular make sens to me   so from my perspect twice a year for the monetari polici report is fine
presid  n
i   m not in favor of chang the way we current deal with the forecast  when the idea first surfac  i thought it was intrigu   but the more i thought about it  the more i thought it would rais more question than it would answer   we would get into the busi of tri to explain or tri to qualifi what all these number meant   and that would not be like to turn out to be a product exercis  or at least  as i tri to go through that exercis for the moment  i couldn   t come up with a satisfactori way of do all that   so i would put this idea on the back burner
i agre with everybodi els and in particular with the chairman   i   ll make an admiss here   i don   t realli forecast   i have forecast on the staff over there  and they do a thorough job   they run altern simul   if someth look a littl funni to me  i can pick up the phone and ask whi that is and dig into it to ani degre i want   i don   t put down a coher forecast when i prepar for our meet   what i do is to tri to think how i ought to vote on monetari polici   i was curious on whi this interest in our forecast came about  i read appendix a in the document   it seem to stem from a somewhat contenti debat between chairman miller and chairman burn and various member of the bank committe when the first report on monetari polici was requir   so i agre with the chairman that there is zero inform here   there is a lot of confus   to be perfect blunt about it  if there were some way to get rid of give our forecast in the monetari polici report  i would even favor that
i think ned   s comment is a good one   i would like to find a way to get rid of that oblig as well   if there were some possibl of communic the staff forecast   or whatev kind of consist forecast we could possibl develop   and talk about how that outlook deviat from our ul  object  that   s what i think the public and the market need to know   none of these altern to our current forecast procedur would come anywher near that   so i wouldn   t want to go in this direct   again  i think we ought to consid whether there   s some way we can stop do these committe member forecast
thank you  governor     basic i   m just go to make a few suggest for margin chang in our current practic that might be use   but then i want be the devil   s advoc at the end of my remark   first  i think we should substitut or add the core pce becaus that probabl is  after all  the measur more relev to polici   second  i think it would be use to add six month to the januari forecast so that it has the same  e horizon as the juli forecast   that would not be chang anyth substant   third  to address an issu that the chairman rais  i think we should revis our forecast as close to the releas date as possibl so that they are not date or stale when they come out   and final  i do have a thought on the standard error   concern have been rais in earlier discuss of the project that they might be consid object or goal  for exampl  rather than forecast or that  by make a forecast  we risk our credibl in some way   obvious  we can put in standard error to make it clear that they are forecast and are subject to error and so on   one simpl way to put in standard error would be to ask each forecast to put a       bound around their es    the   th percentil and the   th percentil   then we could take the averag width of those bound across the peopl whose forecast are includ in the central tendenc forecast   that would give an es  of the averag uncertainti among the forecast of member who are make forecast   there are way  i think  to add that   i just want to rais that as someth to be consid  let me be the devil   s advoc for just a minut  although i   m not propos ani chang  statement have been made that these forecast have no mean and that they don   t guid our polici in ani way   i think that   s an empir question  and most of the empir evid that exist goe exact against that   work that has done at the st  loui fed suggest that fomc forecast are better forecast of inflat than the blue chip forecast  for exampl  over long period of  e
so far  and that   s all we can evalu the forecast on   there   s also evid that suggest that the taylor rule base on fomc forecast is a better descriptor of feder reserv behavior than other nave type of taylor rule   so i think it   s an empir question whether or not they   re use   again  i   m not suggest a major chang in the way we use them  but i would ask us to leav open the issu of what inform they contain
thank you  roger   i think the question of whether or not we should releas forecast is intrigu   but on balanc i come to the view that we should not for mani of the reason other have talk about   i also think we ought to be clear as to what we   re talk about becaus it seem to me that two differ propos have been made here   one has to do with the staff forecast  which is incred deep and intens and is produc through the effort of a number of peopl here at the board   it is extrem help in it  book formul in term of provid a base and a framework for us to think about the outlook  i view that forecast differ from the number that i provid for purpos of the monetari polici report   the four or five peopl we have work on our forecast in boston are veri good economist  but they can   t substitut for the depth and breadth and experi of the staff at the board   let   s say i had to produc a forecast for everi meet  or even quarter  similar to what we do for the januari and juli meet   base on the    appropri monetari polici    assumpt  which would be differ from everybodi els   s assumpt  i suppos   i   d have to add a lot of peopl to my forecast staff to be sure it was a forecast that i could defend or be proud of   there would be a continu issu about the qualiti of the forecast i was releas   now  if mine got merg with a number of other forecast and the public saw a central tendenc and didn   t see high and low  mayb that would be okay   but an accumul of forecast isn   t necessarili better just becaus it   s an accumul  i think over  e  becaus number are precis and it   s easier to pin peopl down on number  there would be an enorm amount of pressur to discov who was on either side of the distribut around these project   it   s conceiv that we could get ourselv into a situat where we releas the forecast  it becom known who has forecast what  and we might get ourselv dug into posit come into a meet   what realli worri me is that  in all of this communic effort  we could get ourselv into a situat   and i think it   s more probabl with numer forecast becaus they are specif and can be track   where peopl come into a committe meet with a harden polici posit   peopl might be unwil to listen to one anoth or to chang their view becaus they have stake out a posit associ with a number that is well known to the outsid world   that could make it hard to come to a consensus within the committe   for me this propos rais that possibl more than the other propos do   i think over  e that would tend to wreak havoc on the way we oper
thank you   i assum that we   ll continu with the mpr forecast  so i would suggest onli minor chang much along the line of those mention by governor bernank   i think go to the core pce measur make a lot of sens becaus that   s in fact what we focus on   and i   d probabl favor a slight chang in term of the durat of the forecast   i   d take the januari forecast out two year so that both forecast made in a singl year cover the same  e period   i think that would be use to the public
back when     was in charg of the staff   s forecast  the way i did mine was to subtract a percentag point from inflat and add it to real growth    laughter
the   rule
my practic now is to get veri  veri close to the staff forecast   but put standard error around my forecast would be  as they say in texa  like put lipstick on a hog    laughter
do i have to follow that   could i ask for a bye and have you come back to me   i   m go to risk a bloodi nose   i think the chairman has alreadi pop my balloon befor i tri to blow it up   i   ve actual been labor under the appar fals impress that we are in fact in the forecast busi   i   ve assum that we make polici decis base on both our collect and individu forecast   we spend a lot of  e not onli studi the staff   s forecast but look at outsid forecast and do some of our own   my staff tell me that there   s a not insignific bodi of research that say there is in fact some valu in put togeth a number of forecast that are done on a differ set of assumpt  i guess i was dream   it may be the equival of the nineteen person communiqu© that the chairman say just can   t be done   that twice a year we would take a look out twelv to eighteen month and tri to inform the public about what we see   i have the sens not so much in the forecast but in the semiannu statement that we have an opportun as a committe to let the public know our view of the outlook and how they might expect polici to respond to develop that might unfold   i know we respond to low probabl event  but i hate to think that our polici from meet to meet is driven without the benefit of a longer term forecast obvious adjust for short term event as they unfold   that troubl me a lot  so i had this dream that we could provid a realli thought semiannu statement from this committe   whether it   s done befor the chairman   s tes oni or after the tes oni   and offer that as our forward look view of the broader economi   if we did that and talk about develop that we believ would be import in the period ahead  i thought we might be abl to get away from the shorter term statement that react to the recent data   i   m troubl  for exampl  by the current bluebook   that we   re go to struggl tomorrow with how to re character the labor market becaus last  e we said they were modest improv and now it appear that they may or may not be   i just wish that we could get ourselv and other think a littl more about the longer term  obvious temper as we go along by unfold develop   that was my balloon that got pop  and i guess my nose is bloodi   but i want to take a crack at it
your head is unbow   presid pianalto
i concur with the chairman   i don   t think there is anyth to be gain by an enhanc role for fomc member project   i  like other  am not in the busi of forecast   my staff   not prepar project   i reli on the  book project as a start point   so i   m not in favor of expand the role of the fomc project
thank you  governor     i support the chairman in the sens that i realli don   t want to do ani more forecast   in fact  i would rather make all of our twice a year forecast roll one and revis them for four quarter ahead onli   i   d prefer not to go past a one year horizon becaus i tend not to have much wisdom about the outlook beyond that  but anoth point   and i   m go back to the idea of focus on risk rather than the forecast   is that the minut issu is relev here   i think releas the minut earlier is import becaus it   s the one place that convey the discuss we have around the tabl about mitig the risk of the differ forecast we have   over the past year  for exampl  while we didn   t forecast deflat  we certain had quit a bit of discuss about the vulner of the forecast in that regard   at least i person was struck by the fact that it wasn   t out of the realm of probabl that we could be face with such sever issu   and i think our view about those risk come out more in the minut than in ani forecast we could put togeth   i feel that we do a better job describ the outlook and our concern in the minut than in our forecast   so i   d emphas the minut rather than the project for that reason
i would make two chang and two chang onli   one would be to substitut the core pce for the total   i emphas substitut   if we do both  we have an implicit energi price forecast in there  and i don   t think that   s use   second  i think we ought to be abl to survey the committe member for ani chang in their forecast a week or two befor the tes oni  or whatev is practic in term of the schedul for do it   and mayb we could put a footnot in the mpr that these are the committe   s forecast as of whatev the date is  those are the onli chang i would make
i wouldn   t elev the forecast either for all the reason peopl have note  and i certain wouldn   t want to do psycholog damag to the chairman   i   m not quit as negat on them  i think  as governor   and chairman  span   i do think the forecast give a sens of where the central tendenc of the committe   s view lie   you   re right  chairman  span  that most of what we do in the policymak process has to do with the risk around those central tendenc  but i think it   s help for the public to get at least some sens of where the central tendenc are   and along the line of the issu that governor bernank rais  they do actual contribut a bit of understand as to how we move on averag over  e  though mayb not at particular point in  e   but they have all the problem everybodi has note  and i wouldn   t elev their role  i would like to address the issu of the staff forecast  howev   mayb it   s becaus i use to be sit on the other side of the tabl  but i realli think that releas the staff forecast would be a terribl idea   what we get from dave     and   is their best judgment about what is go to happen and what the most like cours for the economi is   ani attempt to releas that forecast would tend to move them  even if onli subconsci  toward hedg that  given worri about the market reaction or whatev   so i believ that would be a veri  veri bad way to go   i don   t think it would serv the committe well  in term of minor tinker with the forecast and what we releas  to me core pce is worth think about   unlik presid pool  i probabl would add it rather than substitut it   i agre that would result in an implicit food and energi price project be there  but so be it  total inflat is not irrelev   what is happen to total inflat could veri well shape expect about futur inflat  and it probabl     if we believ those expect are import  i think we ought to talk about the total as well as the core inflat  though i agre that the latter is more relev to the under pressur on the economi so i would add it   and i would give serious consider to ad six month or a year  particular to the januari forecast horizon   mayb we can return to those issu befor we come back in juli
i agre  mr  chairman  with the way you character this   i don   t think the forecast serv a use purpos here   also  though peopl have veri good idea for minor tinker that will improv them   the core pce  mayb lengthen the  e period  and thing of that sort   quit frank  i think there   s a danger in do that   if we do that  we draw more attent to these forecast   and we give the impress that we   re put more emphasi on them  and to that extent i think we elev them   that would be counterproduct   i   d leav it the way it is and not make ani chang whatsoev   discuss core inflat is obvious import  and you do that in your tes oni  which i think is a veri appropri place to do it  but i would not chang the way we present the forecast one bit
i have onli the weakest of convict on this issu   i think       s point is a veri interest one   if there are sensibl chang that we could all embrac in how we present these forecast but we   re all against or uncomfort with elev their import  it may be a mistak to contempl sensibl chang   i have a somewhat more open mind to the merit of think about some sensibl chang even if we   re go to retain the current relat limit role of the forecast in our think   so i   d say those minor adjust are worth think through a bit more   but i see no great benefit in substanti rais the profil or the contribut of the forecast   nor the  e we invest in them   as a guid to polici go forward   it may not be worth go through this  but i don   t think there   s a case for increas their frequenc  and i don   t know how i come out on the merit of separ them from the tes oni itself   so i offer those weak convict
just as a remind  when we discuss the first two issu   risk assess and the releas of the minut   we were talk about communic fomc decis  and we have a veri import respons in that regard   but i agre that we are not in the busi of make forecast   also  i would remind peopl of the purpos behind the legisl call for semiannu report on monetari polici   i feel like an old man becaus i had left the congression staff befor the humphrey   hawkin act was pass  but i had been there until two year befor that  and i rememb the mindset   it was a disclosur issu   it was not view as a tool of monetari polici or econom polici  it was a disclosur issu   to underscor that fact  let me refer you to the last line on page    of benson durham   s memo   you don   t need to look at it   where it talk about the hous committe   s respons to the second mpr in juli           we feel this step constitut a definit improv in monetari polici oversight      the issu was not monetari polici implement but monetari polici oversight  to put it in simpl term  the congress was ask     what   the fomc know that we don   t know      this was put into the law at a  e when we did not have anywher near the level of disclosur or transpar that we do now   as you probabl rememb  the humphrey   hawkin act did sunset in       at that  e i was back on capitol hill with the senat   what happen was that there was no particular sen ent for continu the specif compon of the humphrey   hawkin legisl  but there was great interest in make sure that the chairman came befor the hous and senat financ and bank committe at least twice a year to discuss monetari polici   so the word of the legisl that follow  start in       was design to ensur that that would happen   with that in mind  i don   t see ani reason to chang anyth that we do with the report becaus it purpos is so differ from what it had been  the chairman may have a differ recollect of what transpir in the successor to the humphrey   hawkin act  but that   s my recollect
let me give you my perspect on this issu   i am in the camp that say we have a rang of skill with respect to forecast  but my observ over the year that i   ve been here is that we are main consum of a rang of forecast   we are look at forecast to see whether we agre or disagre and to assess what the risk are  and so forth   i  like the chairman  have observ a number of meet where the forecast and the commentari seem not to be close intertwin   also  just to pick up on mark olson   s point about what we know that other don   t know  i don   t think this committe has ever forecast a recess   i can   t quit imagin how it would work   if we   re go to be veri transpar and forward look  in the sens of what do we know that they don   t know  would we say that the fomc   s central tendenc forecast was for a recess   that never happen   it never would happen   we   re not veri good at forese a recess  and if we did  we   d conduct polici to tri to avoid it   if you think about it  i suspect we   d alway forecast someth that look pretti much like trend  which i frank think we do anyway   it would certain undercut ani sens of credibl around these forecast  on some of these smaller chang   the core pce  sure  add six month  possibl  survey for revis  i   m not sure  partial becaus that get to michael     s point that do that start to convey this sens of great real  e valid about the committe forecast   so i   m not realli sure where i stand on those  let me now step out and tri to summar what i think i heard   there were no vote  as far as i could tell  for substanti chang the way we think about or use the forecast   there was a rang of view express on some of these small fix   the core pce  ad a few month  et cetera   and some peopl did not address those issu at all   i would propos  sinc we don   t have to decid ani of this until juli  that i or the staff send around to everyon a list of two or three option for a simpl yes or no vote   i   m not sure it requir a lot more discuss  we can then report back to you on how the vote came out on core pce   do we add it  do we use it as a substitut   ad six month or a year to the forecast horizon and revis our forecast closer to the  e of the chairman   s tes oni   i think those were the three issu that came up  we   ll see if there   s an obvious yes or no  up or down  and then discuss all this when we get closer to the next forecast round  but we have a coupl of meet befor then   governor
let me just mention one issu that we might also put on your list   i think all of us would care veri much about the chairman   s psycholog well be   what is the legal requir in term of whether these forecast have to go in the tes oni or just in the report itself
in the past it has been in the report and not in the tes oni
i think we have alreadi cross that bridg
yes  just in the report   there have been  e when the chairman  sn   t refer to them
there have been  e when they are not even includ in the tes oni   in the last ten year the chairman has almost never refer to them in the read draft of the tes oni  but there have been  e when they haven   t even been in the text of the formal tes oni submit   they are alway in the report
so do you get ask about them  then
if they are in the report  no   there were occas in the past when we were clear in a recess and the forecast was for no recess   and the issu that governor   rais is a realli import one in the sens that these are not best es  forecast   we can basic come out in  say  the june meet with a    basi cut in the fund rate and in the report on monetari polici show the economi go up   there   s also a question here of whether these are goal or object forecast   but the major problem is that they are not anyth in particular becaus we haven   t a clue what the under assumpt are   to have a bunch of forecast and not know the under assumpt and then add them altogeth is a statist monstros   i don   t what the mathemat characterist are
i don   t know if anybodi has ever thought of this  but could there be in a special appendix to the report some verbiag about some of these caveat
we don   t know what the caveat are   then the whole question is whi we are do it
as you know  i would prefer not to
in the last report we signific trim back the discuss in the tes oni   basic we just present the tabl  did the tabl read  and did not offer an interpret
i don   t think we got a negat respons to that as far as i   m awar
i would say that there are basic two thing that go wrong with regard to the tes oni process   one is that occasion there will be question such as   six month ago you were forecast this  and it didn   t happen   what went wrong
it   s onli that   it   s never    you were right
the second is that the forecast are number  and it   s easi for report to character them   so some  the newspap articl that come out after the tes oni are not what we would have expect becaus the report latch on onli to the number
it may be a statist monstros  but it   s much better to leav it there than to have the congress demand the staff forecast   so we should just leav it alon
well  that   s whi we have it   that   s how we got into it  speaker      it   s a legal requir
that   s where it came from   to protect the staff   that   s the reason that don kohn was mention that
and that   s still veri import  so let   s leav it
the sunset didn   t affect the legal
it   s not requir
no  it wasn   t even requir by law befor   by law the onli thing that was requir was monetari aggreg target   and this was append to those target part becaus the committe was suppos to say how the monetari aggreg target line up with the administr   s econom forecast   so this was a way of work around that as well   the onli thing in the law right now is that we are suppos to give some sens of like futur develop
i think the word is a discuss of    prospect
right     prospect
the memo mention the question of whether or not an mpr without a forecast would compli with the law   that   s an open question
it was an open question becaus the committe had establish a preced and they interpret    prospect    to mean these forecast number   but the issu isn   t whether you will be su  it   s whether you   ll get a wors outcom when the congress push back
let me close this becaus we want to get on to someth els   it strike me that the sens of the group is retain the status quo in term of this last question  we have a long histori of do forecast   i   m not sure that we   d be better serv by not do them   there may be some room to do some tinker on the edg  and the staff will do a survey on the three or four or five idea that have come up here   i think that   s it   i thank you all for a product discuss   i got through a number of semi brilliant conclus    laughter
thank to the chairman of our work group who obvious came out exact where he want    laughter
we have  e to hear dino kos   dino  thank you  mr  chairman   in the interest of get everybodi out
of here quick  i   ll read even fa  than usual today   if the marketplac is design to frustrat the major by move against convent wisdom and   more import   the posit of most market particip  the fix

governor    meet at the bis   protest against what he call the    brutal    move of the exchang market  the dollar recov after those comment  but this morn the euro was rise again to abov         one of the reason given for the dollar   s strength dure the late     s was that asset return in the unit state were higher than those avail elsewher  that is no longer the case when take into account move of both asset price and foreign exchang rate   the middl panel depict equiti market return   express in local currenc term in the gray bar   for the nasdaq  the s p      the dj euro stoxx  and the nikkei sinc januari           all did well on that basi   howev  the return of a euro  or yen base investor were trim substanti  when exchang rate fluctuat are taken into account   so while the s p has appreci about    percent in dollar term over that span  the appreci for a euro base investor is about one third of that   similar a u s  dollar base investor would have done better invest oversea  given the currenc kicker   the nasdaq was someth of an except in that it return were high regardless of the currenc base  though that was after three difficult preced year   the other factor that has work against the dollar in most case   with the except of japan   is interest rate differenti   short term differenti shown in the bottom left panel and long term differenti shown on the right both favor other currenc  which have had the advantag of offer higher yield and appreci currenc   and those foreign inflow that have move into u s  fix incom paper are more like to be hedg by sell dollar   that may be anoth factor that help explain the seem paradox between strong asset market and a depreci currenc   the focus on central bank activ has been most acut with respect to the yen and renminbi exchang rate  though we have less inform about the latter   the top panel of page   graph the dollar   yen exchang rate sinc august   as the yen has appreci  the pace of japanes intervent

were no foreign oper   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
the failur of bank to window dress have anyth to do with the freddi mac fiasco or ani of the other relat manipul by bank
i don   t know the detail  but there was appar some discrep between the way the loan were classifi and the way they were actual perform   but that   s someth i understand the fsa will be look into   more detail to come  i   m sure
question for dino   if not  governor
i move approv of the domest oper
thank you   without object  they are approv   we are adjourn until      a m  tomorrow   meet recess  januari               of     januari      morn session
good morn  everyon      do you want to go over this materi that was just distribut
i think larri was plan on talk about it
thank you  mr  chairman   we have distribut to you an extra sheet that has the latest inform from this morn   s releas on the order and shipment data  the line that we typic like to look at are the order exclud aircraft  shown part way down the tabl  and the    all other    categori which encompass rough two third of the total   the order number  particular for the    all other    categori  look pretti good to us and would impli perhap a small upward revis to the fourth quarter   the shipment number  shown a littl further down on the page  also indic some posit in the two categori   ex aircraft and    all other      but it turn out that there were some downward revis to the preced month   so on net  we actual would wind up cut our q  number by just a small amount   on balanc  we think the chang in the two seri would be about offset  and in our opinion the outlook for busi spend remain quit strong
the first quarter is go to have an upward revis
we   ll have an upward revis to q  and probabl a downward revis to q
let me ask someth further   a problem in this survey is the veri peculiar movement of unfil order for communic equip   you may recal   i   m not sure what month it was but probabl octob   that there was an extraordinari rise in unfil order  and it look idiosyncrat   i gather that when we check with the   the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     bureau of the census they indic that there were some flaki number for unfil order  some communic equip manufactur didn   t think those number were real  and they now appar are be written off   if you rememb  new order are calcul as shipment plus the increas in unfil order  so we are get a veri sharp declin in communic equip  and that is hold down the figur for nondefens capit good exclud aircraft  but if you take out the communic equip peculiar  the report is a lot better than it appear on the surfac  as larri just indic   i would say it is a wash
well  the one other thing that i would note  as we point out in the  book as well  is that the level of new order has been run abov the level of shipment  impli an increas in unfil order for some  e now for the    all other    categori   so  again  we take that to be a favor sign   shall we get start with the chart show now
pleas  for the chart show  sandi struckmey    kamin  and i
will be refer to the packet of materi that was distribut to you   while put togeth the  book  two of the question we ask ourselv were  first     where is the economi now     and  second     what are the forc that should sustain abov potenti growth over the next two year      with regard to what is some  call    forecast the present     your first exhibit show a varieti of indic that have inform our judgment   the top left panel plot averag month chang in privat payrol   like most observ  we were disappoint by the payrol employ report for decemb   howev  that read came on the heel of more favor report for the preced two month  averag through the month up and down  as i   ve done in the bar on your chart  you can see that  after a protract period of job loss  employ has been on an uptrend sinc midyear  albeit a weaker one than is typic for this stage of the busi cycl   in contrast to the payrol number  most indic of final demand have been quit favor   sale of auto and light truck  the top right panel  and other consum good  the middl left panel  point to continu strength of household demand  while the order and shipment figur  the middl right panel   which here are plot onli through novemb  tell a similar stori for busi demand   and as i   the materi use by messr     struckmey  and kamin are append to this transcript  appendix     mention earlier  this morn   s order and shipment releas provid further confirm of an ongo pickup in busi spend   thus  in put togeth our near term gdp forecast  we onc again were face with a tension between lacklust payrol employ number and pretti stellar incom data for final sale and product   and  onc again  we   ve resolv that tension by write down sizabl increas in product  the bottom left panel   sandi will be discuss product in greater detail later   the tabl at the bottom right add it all up   we now es  that real gdp grew at a     percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of      and will expand at a   percent pace in the current quarter   the bulk of the increas in gdp over this two quarter period come from robust gain in final sale  but with stock   sale ratio so low  inventori invest is expect to make a notic contribut as well   let me note that this exhibit reflect the figur that were in the  book   befor we got the data on shipment and order this morn   so perhap we might take a tenth or two off q  and add a tenth or two to q    turn to the outlook for the next two year  the subject of exhibit    the question is     will the current rapid growth be sustain and whi      as you can see from the top panel  we think that econom growth will be sustain at rate fa  than potenti through the end of        the remain panel highlight some of the key contribut forc   fiscal polici has been quit expansionari in recent year  and as can be seen in the middl left panel  we expect it to provid addit impetus to growth through the end of this year   howev  on our assumpt  fiscal polici swing to slight restraint in      as the partial expens provis expir and the growth of defens spend slow   monetari polici also has been quit support of growth over the past few year   and with the fund rate project to remain relat low over the forecast period  it will continu to be so   anoth factor with favor implic for growth is the ongo strength of product gain  which should influenc household percept of perman incom and busi percept of profit   given the surg of earn late  firm have been abl to financ their desir spend while keep a tight lid on their borrow   inde  as shown in the bottom left panel  debt ratio have fallen sharpli in recent year and are now either at or near the lowest level in the past two decad   with the mark improv in busi financi condit  risk spread   as dino note ye day   have drop dramat on both invest grade and junk bond  return to the top right panel  the stock market is assum to rise at a    percent annual rate over the project period   maintain risk adjust pariti with the project yield on long term treasuri secur   in our forecast  we see the higher stock market as provid some support to household spend after sever year in which it was a consider drag   your next exhibit focus in greater detail on the household sector   person incom  the dark bar in the top left panel  is expect to rise smart over the next two year  support in part  as i mention earlier  by the strength of product  the strong incom growth provid a consider lift to consumpt outlay  the yellow bar    in addit  last year   s tax cut continu to boost spend in       the top right panel show the implic of the pce and incom project for the save rate   as indic by the thick line  the bea current es  that the save rate was onli     percent in the third quarter of last year  and we think it fell anoth    percentag point in the fourth quarter   in our forecast  the save rate climb about a percentag point over the project period   one risk to the household sector forecast is that the save rate might rise more than we have allow for in the baselin   the bullet in the middl panel present our think on this issu   the first thing to note is that the bea  in effect  shift the goal post in it most recent comprehens revis  by take the level of the save rate down on averag over the past decad about a percentag point   this suggest to us that we ought to revis down our think about what constitut a    normal    or    target    save rate by a like amount   consider econometr work suggest the same   that said  the current save rate still is well below the level that mani observ often think of as a more normal rate   it   s import to keep in mind  howev  that the target save rate is a move target   it vari over  e as the fundament determin  such as the wealth   incom ratio  the composit of incom  and real interest rate  chang   inde  we read the current set of those fundament as point to a target save rate for the next year or two in the neighborhood of   percent   in our project  the save rate rise to     percent by the fourth quarter of       elimin the bulk   but not all   of the gap between actual and target save   we   re not sure what account for the gap that we   re see current  but departur from our save model of this magnitud are not unusu  histor  disequilibrium like this have been work off fair gradual  but a more sudden and complet adjust  and a consequ drag on aggreg demand  certain is a risk   the forecast for hous start is present in the bottom left panel   the pace of homebuild  fuel by low mortgag rate and robust incom growth  is anticip to remain strong over the project period  edg down onli a bit from the current elev pace as mortgag rate drift up a bit   the bottom right panel show our project of hous price   in our forecast  hous price slow from the   to   percent gain post in recent year  to about     percent dure        the downtilt primarili reflect the current dispar between rapid hous price inflat and much smaller increas in the data for rent   the econometr evid suggest that such a dispar typic is close by hous price increas move into align with rent   of cours  there is a wide band of uncertainti around this forecast  which impart a wide band of uncertainti   both upsid and downsid   to movement in household net worth over the next two year  with consequ implic for household spend   turn to the busi sector  exhibit    we expect real outlay for equip and softwar   both the high tech compon and the    other    compon   to rise rapid this year  spur in part by the temporari tax incent   inde  the partial expens provis add about     percentag point to overal e s growth this year and subtract close to   percentag point next year   the basic contour of the forecast is consist with the inform given recent to the reserv bank by busi in their district   as shown in the middl left panel  slight more than half of the respond plan to boost their capit spend in        the respons are appreci more upbeat than those in june   although the usual acceler effect were the primari reason given for the improv  a sizabl fraction of respond also point to replac need as an import consider   moreov  partial expens final appear to be on the radar screen of at least some firm   a quarter of the respond also cite improv cash flow or balanc sheet posit  reflect no doubt strong profit and  presum  the expect profit of new invest   as shown to the right  in our forecast the profit share continu to rise through mid      befor drift down as labor cost acceler and competit put pressur on margin   nonetheless  even through the end of next year  profit are still elev by histor standard   an import element of our capit spend forecast is strong demand for comput   in part  our forecast for comput spend has been inform by the project of industri analyst for unit sale of pcs   both so call desktop box  which typic sit on the floor  and laptop  which often sit on desk     laughter  the bottom left panel show one such forecast from a lead consult group   as you can see  unit sale are expect to rise sharpli throughout the project period  driven by the need to replac machin that have becom physic or technolog obsolet   after ad in the effect of qualiti chang  these unit sale translat into real spend increas on the order of    percent annual over the next two year   rough in line with the increas post dure the second half of the     s   one concern that has been rais in mani circl is the implic for the domest economi of outsourc comput product   that is  whether today   s box contain consider less domest content than the box sold a few year ago  the bottom right panel address this question   it use cost share to measur the domest content of pcs sold in the unit state   most of the domest valu ad in a pc is for the micro process unit   the pentium or similar chip that lie at the heart of our pcs   this is shown by the black shade portion of the bar  smaller contribut come from the product of special chip that provid basic logic or act like traffic manag insid your pc and  to a lesser extent  from integr and final shipment   the bulk of the foreign valu ad is for such thing as print circuit board  storag devic  and peripher   the point is that the unit state is still the world leader in design lead edg chip  a veri high valu ad activ  and fabric them  also a high valu ad activ    as a result  the domest content of pcs has chang relat littl over the past few year  accord  the sharp rise in pc sale that we are forecast should translat into domest product at about the same rate as in recent year     will now turn the discuss from domest content to foreign content

gdp  the blue bar  both rebound from their subdu first half perform   go forward  continu rapid gdp growth here and abroad is expect to keep both export and import expand brisk   i should note that  while beef export fall near to zero for most of this year as a consequ of import ban prompt by mad cow diseas  this should have onli a veri small effect on aggreg export sale   becaus u s  growth is project to exceed foreign growth and becaus the respons of u s  import to incom is believ to exceed that of u s  export to foreign incom  the growth of import would be expect to exceed that of export  all els be equal   howev  lag effect of the past depreci of the dollar  shown in the middl left panel  as well as effect of mild project futur depreci are expect to buoy export and restrain import go forward   in consequ  the growth of export is project to exceed that of import in      and       nevertheless  becaus import are substanti greater than export  import rise in absolut amount by more than export over the forecast period   this lead to a further widen of the current account deficit  shown as the black line in the middl right panel   owe to growth in the u s  economi  the deficit as a percent of gdp  shown as the red line  narrow slight over the next two year   return to the middl left panel  our forecast of a modest further depreci of the dollar is base on the view that the widen u s  current account deficit and the need to financ it will continu to weigh on the dollar   nevertheless  the  e and magnitud of ani futur addit declin is obvious quit uncertain   the bottom panel of your exhibit break down the recent financ of the current account  shown on line     notabl  the share of the financ come from offici sourc  line    has step up consider over the past year

  billion at an annual rate in the first half of      to a littl over      billion in the first two month of the fourth quarter   interpret these data is complic  howev  as purchas in septemb and octob were extrem weak  wherea they bounc back in novemb   data on foreign direct invest in the unit state  line    are avail onli through the third quarter of last year  but these inflow also show a declin from      h    convers  u s  purchas of foreign secur  line    and u s  direct invest abroad  line    appear to have held up well in the second half of last year   these data suggest that offici purchas of dollar increas are substitut for privat capit inflow in financ the u s  current account deficit and  as such  may be prevent the dollar from move down more rapid than would otherwis be the case   your final exhibit explor some altern scenario for the dollar   as indic by the black line in the top panel  the broad real dollar  though down consider from it peak in earli       is still well abov it trough in the     s   particular given the widen extern deficit  a steeper declin in the dollar than our baselin project is a distinct possibl   howev  the implic for the u s  and foreign economi will depend upon the circumst in which this declin take place   the middl left panel detail sever altern simul of the staff   s model   in the first scenario  indic by the solid red line  the fall in the dollar is trigger by higher than expect foreign gdp growth   such higher growth might plausibl be due to the long await rise in product growth among foreign industri countri  for exampl  or to a pickup of invest and consumpt in develop asia   specif  this scenario combin a shock to the risk premium on u s  asset  which would lead to a    percent declin in the dollar in the absenc of chang in monetari polici  with a shock to foreign domest demand equal to   percent of gdp in      and an addit   percent of gdp in        this combin of higher foreign growth  indic by the red line in the bottom left panel  and the lower dollar lead to an improv in the u s  current account balanc  the bottom right panel  and a rise in u s  growth of about    percentag point  the middl right   the second dollar depreci scenario is a so call disord correct   that is  a rapid fall in the dollar that engend a steep falloff in u s  bond and equiti price as well   it is not clear how plausibl this scenario is   the fall in the dollar sinc earli      has not disrupt financi market  nor did it do so dure the dollar   s previous correct in the     s   nevertheless  this scenario aris frequent in financi press commentari on the dollar   so to explor it effect  we assum the same shock to the dollar as in scenario   but ad shock to risk premium in other asset market that lower u s  stock price about    percent and rais long term bond yield    basi point   the combin effect of these shock is to leav u s  growth  the dash red line in the middl right panel  down onli a littl from it baselin path  as the advers effect of higher interest rate and lower stock price are offset by the s ul effect of the dollar   s declin on net export  howev  foreign growth is lower about    percentag point below baselin  reflect both the appreci of their currenc and lower u s  growth   final  while we view the risk to the dollar to be weight toward the downsid  we cannot preclud the possibl that the dollar may rise abov it project path over the next sever quarter   our project of u s  real gdp growth exceed that of most privat forecast  and as the market   s assess of u s  growth and associ rate of return is adjust upward  the dollar may be boost as well   the blue dash line in your exhibit trace out the effect of such a shock   while foreign growth is boost abov it baselin path  u s  growth is restrain a bit  and the current account deficit widen   to sum up  consider uncertainti surround both futur movement of the dollar and the circumst under which such movement might occur   at the risk of say someth you may have heard here befor  this make the outlook for the u s  extern sector particular difficult to pin down at the present  e    laughter   sandi will now

your next exhibit discuss key trend in the labor market   as larri note in his first chart  until veri recent  payrol employ has been notabl weak in this expans   as shown by the blue line in the top left panel  gain in payrol employ have run well below the typic postwar cyclic experi and have now diverg even from those in the jobless recoveri of the earli     s   of cours  the flip side of the lack of employ growth has been the spectacular increas in labor product in recent year   in put togeth our forecast  we have again reassess our outlook for the suppli side of the economi in light of these latest develop   with the comprehens revis to the nation incom and product account not chang the under pictur of product growth in the past few year  and with the gain in payrol employ remain on the anem side  we have rais our es  of structur product   as indic in the top right panel  we now es  that structur multifactor product increas almost   percent last year  as busi met increas in demand by better manag of their exist capit and labor resourc   we don   t think increas in structur mfp of last year   s magnitud are like to persist  but we have boost our project for the growth of structur mfp this year and next   even with these revis  the es  level of actual product  shown in the middl left panel  lie abov it structur trend  we expect actual product to run about parallel to the trend earli in       result in continu modest gain in payrol  the middl right    but with busi becom more op ist about sale prospect  we anticip that hire will pick up  bring the level of actual product back into line with the es  structur trend in        return to the top left panel  you can see by compar the slope of the three line that  onc hire pick up in earnest  employ grow at about the same rate as in preced busi cycl   despit the lack of gain in the payrol survey of employ  household employ has increas  and the unemploy rate  the black line in the bottom left panel  has fallen   i should note that  although it has outpac the payrol survey measur  growth in household employ in this expans also has been weak relat to it normal cyclic pattern   moreov  with the labor market perceiv to have littl vital  the labor forc particip rate  the red line  has move lower  on net  over the past four year   as is illustr in the bottom right panel  this pattern seem consist with past cyclic movement in particip about it es  trend  and we are anticip some upward movement in particip in the not too distant futur in respons to the past and prospect firm in econom activ  howev  such an increas in the particip rate still remain a forecast  and we clear cannot rule out the possibl that further declin in particip will result in a more rapid declin in the unemploy rate than we are project in the januari  book forecast   your next exhibit present our current project of potenti gdp   as can be seen by compar line   and    we did not rais our es  of potenti by as much as our es  of structur product   this reflect three key consider   first  post revis rate of wage and price inflat seem consist with our earlier es  of resourc gap   second  our model of     s law  shown in the middl panel  remain solid on track after the comprehens revis   third  base on the persist differ in the growth of hour work in the household and payrol survey  we reduc the so call technic factor  shown on line    that account for the differ in the trend growth of hour in the household and payrol survey   as can be seen in the bottom panel  the result forecast of the gdp gap is littl differ from the decemb  book   and we continu to project the elimin of slack in both product and labor market by the end of next year   your next exhibit present recent data on inflat   after an energi relat bulg at the begin of       consum price   as measur by either the cpi or the pce price index   slow signific  on net  over the remaind of the year   there also was a broad base slow in measur of core consum price inflat  the top right panel  to a pace of about   percent   in contrast  as shown in the middl left panel  food price acceler over the cours of last year   the pickup was relat to stronger foreign and domest demand for beef as well as to some delay in the suppli respons to higher price   the middl right panel illustr how this excess demand bid up the price of live cattl until the discoveri of mad cow diseas in the unit state in late decemb  shown as the vertic line in the panel    after a few day of signific declin  spot cattl price stabil at their level of last summer and then tick back up a bit   futur price suggest some downward pressur on spot price in the first half of this year   as far as labor cost are concern  we will get the eci for the fourth quarter on thursday   wage inflat  as measur by averag hour earn in the bottom left  fell to a   percent pace in decemb  reflect the slack in labor market and relat stabil in expect inflat  shown on the bottom right   your next exhibit outlin our outlook for inflat   overal pce inflat is expect to slow to a   percent pace  on averag  over the project period   the declin from last year   s pace reflect smaller increas in food price and renew declin in energi price   core pce price also are project to rise at about a   percent pace   a tad higher than last year   although non oil import price are expect to give a slight boost to inflat this year  continu strong growth in structur product  stabl inflat expect  and some remain slack in resourc util are expect to keep core inflat contain   the middl right panel present the outlook for eci compens per hour  which is project to increas about    percent per year in      and        a bit below the pace in       we expect the contribut from wage and salari to fall slight as the influenc of labor market slack is almost offset by somewhat greater pass through of product gain into wage   pressur from rise health insur cost and a cyclic increas in bonus is respons for the rise in the contribut of benefit cost over the project period   the bottom two panel updat our frb us base es  of the probabl of deflat   as you will recal  we have present two definit of deflat in the past   we defin    effect    deflat to be pce price inflat of    percent or less      pernici    deflat add the addit requir that the unemploy rate exceed   percent   as shown on the bottom right  although both probabl have fallen signific sinc your june      meet  they still remain nontrivi risk to the staff forecast   final  at the risk of inflict further psycholog trauma on the chairman  the last exhibit present your forecast for         laughter   the central tendenc of your project for real gdp is     to   percent  which you forecast will result in a declin in the unemploy rate to between    and     percent   you project consum price inflat to be littl chang this year at a pace of   to    percent  that conclud our report   my colleagu and i would be happi to answer ani question you might have
let me go sequenti in revers   first  a minor issu on chart      you mention that the declin in the unemploy rate was held down by the rise in household employ   my recollect is that the unemploy rate is a sampl statist  independ of the popul number from which we measur household employ   so that number would hold even if there were a downward revis in popul   in other word  if household employ is revis down  we will still have the same unemploy rate   but the obvious issu is the particip rate  as i think you point out   on the foreign econom outlook  in chart   in the top right panel  are these nomin u s  dollar on world export
yes  they are
shouldn   t they be in constant price sdrs   i ask becaus  clear if i were to convert these data into euro  which i could just as easili do  the export would not show as much of an uptrend  though i assum they still would go up
they would most like still go up  but i think you   re quit right
in other word  the declin you show here has export go down with ip in       which make it look high correl   yet a good part of that is that ip is physic  and this is nomin  but far more import  it   s a function of which exchang rate you quot the number in   i   m mere indic that i assum   but i don   t know   that if you use sdrs and constant price  that wouldn   t do violenc to the conclus that you came to   is that right
that is veri much the case   i complet agre with you that the measur you are propos probabl would be superior   the constant price data for all of these differ countri  which we were get from their nation data sourc  were not avail  transform it into sdrs is a veri good idea and would be worthwhil
price are not move enough to make that much differ here   they probabl don   t do too much violenc  but the exchang rate
that is correct  and i think you   re quit right that transform the data into sdrs would be use
could you actual run it use sdrs   i would be curious to see what it look like
absolut   that said  one of the issu we   ve been focus on in our forecast of trade is the fact that trade   seem to be much more sensit to industri product than it   to gdp   that   s in part becaus much of trade is compos of manufactur good  which are more relat to industri product than to gdp as a whole   so we think there are definit a lot of fundament under this correl   but i believ you are quit right that the declin in the dollar has probabl exagger the relationship present in that chart
go back to chart     prior to the nipa revis  the flow of fund save rate use the nipa definit and the save rate as measur by actual nipa dispos incom minus consum outlay were remark close  and the pattern of the gap between them wasn   t too bad   we haven   t revis the flow of fund number  obvious  but with the nipa revis  that gap has open up a bit  and there is a littl more discrep between the two   what do we know at this stage  after all these year of look at those two independ residu es  of save  to suggest which is like to be more accur
i don   t think we have a conclus on that   accuraci has to be defin as relat to what
well  relat to the real world   let me put it this way   in the real world  there is no discrep between the flow of fund save rate and the nipa save rate
i understand  but i don   t have ani third sourc of the real world against which to compar the other two   the one thing we can perhap do is to ask ourselv which of the two measur  in term of the econometr  help us best in transform the data into an understand of consumpt behavior or household behavior   onc again  i don   t think there is a firm conclus
we   ve tri both
yes  and we can   t definit say which has won over the other   in all of our work we stay with the nipa measur becaus then we are work with a consist measur system
there   s onli one discrep
right   so that   s whi we do all of our work use the nipa data  obvious we do look at what   s happen to household balanc sheet  and the flow of fund save rate is a part of that household balanc sheet system
but rememb  you   re endeavor to forecast the nipa save rate with the flow of fund household wealth data   and household wealth data are obvious direct convert into a save rate
it   s the flow of fund save rate
so when there is a discrep  as is now emerg  i assum that has some nois effect on the use of that particular system
thank you   sandi  i have a question about inflat relat to the panel on the top right of chart      if we were look at this chart in quarter term  we would be see at the end of      a rate of     percent   that   s the number in the  book   and then it goe up to     percent in the first quarter of this year   i know that in the  book the recent soft was character as    like temporari      i just wonder if you could talk about that a bit becaus obvious  if it turn out to be less temporari  it would affect one   s assess of the probabl of deflat and so forth   there wasn   t much said about whi it is view as like to be temporari
as we look at the consum price data for novemb and decemb  we were surpris at the larg declin in core price in novemb   in examin the detail  the declin were in some compon for which we did not expect continu larg price reduct   one of the categori in which we saw huge price declin in the fourth quarter was use car  which was probabl relat to the price incent on new car   those declin were big enough to matter for the actual total price index   we look at that  and we didn   t expect price for use car to bounc back up  but then again we didn   t think they would continu to go down at a doubl digit pace either   as we went through other categori  it seem to us that in the last coupl of month the price for some particular categori were affect a lot by special circumst   we saw that earli in the year  too  when price in certain categori move up and then down or move down and then back up again  and the three month chang in core inflat move around a lot relat to the twelv month chang   i think we show a chart in the pre fomc brief sever  e last year depict that pattern   the two seri are converg and are fair close togeth   the latest three month chang is a littl below the twelv month chang   so we do think that price are a littl low now and will probabl move up a bit in come month   we aren   t talk about a big bounceback  these are still month chang of around    percent on core cpi   that is just enough relat to what happen in novemb and decemb to have this measur tick up a bit relat to the fourth quarter
first  i want to thank dave   and dave   for the memo they prepar in respons to my request   i thought it was veri help   without go into it  i will say that i think it provid mild support for my posit  but that   s anoth matter    laughter
are you go to let the rest of us in on at least the subject matter
this was in respons to my request that the  book forecast be condit on the market   s feder fund rate assumpt rather than the  book assumpt   it   s a veri good memo  and i think that it explor the issu in a veri fine fashion  i   ll just repeat my summari that i think it present a case for my posit  i want to pursu that same issu in the context of the current period by think about where the economi is go to be at the  e of our june meet   let   s suppos that the  book forecast come true between now and then   what we would be look at in the june meet is five month of data on payrol employ with gain averag         a month  that is a million more job     x           so we   d have a million more job  some depreci of the dollar  and the prospect that by the end of the year the gap will be almost entir close  yet we have a forecast that is built on the assumpt of no respons in the feder fund rate befor rough a year from now   now  obvious  the market   s fund rate forecast has move back and forth   the decemb employ number itself made quit a differ in the market   s view   but if we get a seri of month increas in payrol employ averag          quit frank i find it hard to believ that the market is not go to be forecast some polici respons   i think that scenario fit in nice with the subject of the   and   memorandum  and i would like you to respond to that
presid pool  if we went back to june of last year and had this convers  you would have said suppos we had forecast for the second half of the year what actual transpir   if the stori was   percent gdp growth in the second half of last year  do you think the market would possibl have forecast us not to be tighten until late        that might have sound far fetch last june  but in fact that is exact where we are right now  there has been consider converg between our forecast and the market   s forecast  i take that to be in part becaus market particip have been surpris as well at the appar capac of this economi to grow without generat signific pressur on resourc util and without generat signific pressur on price inflat   in fact  we view our forecast   that we could get to the middl of this year without tighten   as not unreason becaus  if we see some pickup in payrol employ and continu strong growth  we   re still go to be look at an inflat situat that look incred benign   despit the fact that the dollar has gone down  the pass through of that into import price has been relat modest  as we discuss on monday at the pre fomc brief   the indirect effect of the jump in energi price that we   ve seen appear to us to be moder  and they were quit modest previous  we   re see veri littl sign of pressur on the labor cost side either in nomin compens or in unit labor cost  obvious  with the strength in product   so  we don   t think the fund rate path we have assum is unreason  and in essenc  at this point the differ between our path and the market   s path is about    basi point by the end of        we think the market will continu to be surpris by a combin of strong growth in aggreg demand but with that be match by consider strength in aggreg suppli   we   re expect a continu of the kind of converg that we   ve seen over the last six month in their expect toward our  have said that  there   s tremend uncertainti about how the market will react to the data  whether or not our forecast will be right  or whether the market   s view of under econom develop will be correct   so  we feel pretti comfort that we are put on the tabl an outlook that is not far fetch and in fact could be quit reason   and i take the behavior of financi market over the last six month as some small evid in support of our posit and approach
if i may make a follow up comment   the issu to me is not so much who win the hors race   obvious  we can point to particular case where one approach is superior by look at the statist evid you present   in fact  in recent period i believ the market forecast has been perhap ever so slight better but not signific differ   for me that is not the issu   it   s exact what you just said   that if we were to condit the  book baselin on the market forecast  then it would display veri clear what is differ in your view from the market expect  let me also refer to anoth exampl  which was the begin of the recess   in that case the market was predict declin in rate befor you were   if you had use the market view as your condit assumpt for the forecast  you would have ask the question  is the market detect some weak in the situat that we don   t see   that was the key question at that  e  just as the key question now is whether the market is pick up the possibl of either some inflationari pressur that we don   t see or a boom that is go to outrun what is current our best guess regard the economi   s perform   it seem to me that use the market assumpt would help us to focus on those veri key question
obvious  we are look at those signal from the market and ask ourselv precis those kind of question   we are not ignor that   we think we have incorpor our best judgment as to what signal the market are send us   it wasn   t that we weren   t pay attent to what the market was say in late       we just had an excess op ist view of what was go on   i would say that three or four month later we were forecast a flat fund rate go out and the market were alreadi forecast an increas in interest rate start in the second half of        we did not incorpor that market view  and in that case i think our judgment was better   but you are right   it   s not a matter of who win the hors race   it   s a matter of put on the tabl a vehicl that is use for your discuss   and as we note in the memo  we thought we would be produc a less help vehicl by use those market expect   we cite a few exampl where use the market base fund rate would have present an outlook that was inconsist with our view of the economi   there were  e that the market was forecast a tighten of monetari polici when we view the under strength of the economi as consider weaker than the market thought   so if we had taken the market   s view about interest rate with our view about how the economi was develop  we would have produc a baselin forecast that had a tighten of the feder fund rate with the unemploy rate rise and the inflat rate continu to come down  that did not seem like to be the most help vehicl for organ your discuss  as     and i note in our memo  the inform content of the staff   s forecast is pretti much independ of the assum fund rate path   we could write down an infinit number of fund rate path and an infinit number of gdp  inflat  and employ path to go along with that   the fundament inform that we would be bring to the tabl would be the same in each one of those various simul   the issu is where you want to begin in term of the framework on which to base your discuss  and i think that   s a matter of tast on your part   we   ve tri to address some of your concern by put on the tabl some altern  and at  e we   ve provid a market base fund rate scenario   at other  e we   ve recogn that mani of you might be wonder what the outlook would be if the fed fund rate were held constant throughout the forecast period   that in some sens that could be more help in your discuss   that   s where we come out at this point
i put my name on the list becaus i want to ask a mere question  but sinc this other issu has come up let me give my view on that   i tend to be on the       side on this issu   it seem to me that  for the staff forecast to be maxim use to us  we want to know what is be assum and how it all fit togeth   i have more confid in the way the staff now   it   where they are perfect open about their assumpt  and there is some central guidanc to make sure that all of the sector are use the same assumpt   as dave just point out  if there is random inform here and there about this or that  they can work it in   but at bottom they have a consist view of what is go on   i think if we ask them to base everyth on the market fund rate  they would have to get the market view of this and the market view of that  and i   m not sure how they could do that   so i   ve alway had a prefer for the way the staff   it forecast now   i think  bill  that the simul you ask for on the market fund rate have been veri help  but i   m actual quit content with the methodolog that is present in use  now  let me ask my question   in the press there is begin to be talk of new bubbl  i   m collect all the inform the staff has on that  so let me see if i have it right   first  larri  at the bottom right of chart   on hous price   if you squint at that  befor the forecast domain hous price actual are fall rather sharpli
they   ve start to fall   rather  the rate of increas is come down
yes  the rate of increas is come down   anoth issu discuss in the press is the earn   price ratio  and that ratio was a subject discuss in the brief on monday   the earn   price ratio is at reason high level  which mean that price must not be extraordinarili high   price are the denomin there   so as far as i can tell  you don   t collect put much credenc in the likelihood of new bubbl   mayb somebodi would like to comment on that issu
i will agre with you    laughter   it is true that in our baselin forecast we don   t see ani bubbl   we   ve tri to lay out the possibl of risk and point out to you where  if we are wrong in that judgment  bubbl could occur   for exampl  by our forecast there isn   t a bubbl in hous price  but if there were  we have tri to point out that that could be a risk   so if that sector were to collaps sudden  we have indic the implic of that for household balanc sheet   but you are correct that in our baselin we do not have a bubbl
the earn   price ratio is a function of the low interest rate   we have low discount factor go out on earn  which creat the high ratio of price to earn   one would realli have to argu that the bubbl is in the bond market and not in the stock market  which rais interest inflat expect
i would just add a comment on the hous price side   i would say that a year and a half or two year ago we were veri skeptic about hous price have more frothi characterist   we are quit happi to see a slow in hous price appreci   hous price have move high relat to rent  and i think we are a littl less confid about those be at full equilibrium   if anyth  we would be a littl worri about the risk of a sharper deceler   it is quit rare for aggreg nation hous price actual to turn down  but i don   t think we could rule out a period of extend flat in real estat price go forward   and that would put more pressur on household balanc sheet than is incorpor in the baselin forecast
but the argument is that  if there were a bubbl or a mini bubbl  we are alreadi see the adjust to it as hous price are come back into better balanc with rent
well  even these rate of hous price appreci are fa  than the growth rate that we   ve seen in nomin rent so far   so we   ve got to get that part down into a sort of balanc befor we even have the ratio of hous price to rent flatten out some
is the hous price to rent ratio affect by the rapid of the rise in the homeownership ratio
i   m not sure   there wouldn   t necessarili be ani linkag   there is some substitut but
peopl   s propens to move out of rental unit and into their own home clear has far more effect
on the margin that could certain be a factor   my guess is that it wouldn   t explain the basic diverg we   ve seen between hous price and rent
this last exchang actual was my question   the assumpt you seem to have made is that in fact the relationship between hous price and rent will converg back to the norm   we   ve talk about some of the risk   are there other risk that it won   t happen that way and that someth els is go on   perhap in the direct the chairman mention or in other direct
let me be perfect clear about one thing   we have a coupl of differ way in which we tri to make an assess about what is happen to hous price  one of those  sn   t take into account the arbitrag condit  as it were  between hous price and rent  it basic look at interest rate and cyclic variabl   on that basi  the expect would be that hous price would continu to rise quit rapid   when one take into account the gap between hous price and chang in rent  that model would actual have hous price  as dave indic  essenti have to flatten out and the gap come down to zero   so what we have done in the baselin forecast is to take a posit about midway between  move onli part of the way toward that flatten out view of the world   and the point dave was make is that the flatten out model could be the right one  so there is a chanc that we could see more hous price deceler than we   ve forecast   we could see the chang in hous price actual flatten out for a while or perhap   though it would be unusu   even turn negat
i gather from what you   ve said that you have anoth real factor model  if you will  suggest that hous price will go up more
yes  that model suggest that hous price could rise fa  than what we   ve put into our baselin   so we   ve tri to take a posit somewher between those two
i would like to ask a two part question about the employ and unemploy number   the household versus establish data   what is your feel about what the data are tell us   whi has the household seri been outperform the establish seri for such a long  e  and what   that mean   also  did you do ani analysi on alan meltzer   s wall street journal articl in which he was argu that there was no real increas in unemploy   there have been other similar articl   it seem as if the  book take the approach that the two seri are just differ  they are measur in two differ way  and they are what they are   do you think we are be over pessimist about employ and about the jobless natur of the recoveri
we think that the payrol survey is probabl give the more accur descript of what is realli go on in the labor market   one of the thing that peopl have look at in the household survey is whether the es  of popul on which that survey is fundament base are correct   if they have overes  popul  as they did earlier in the decad  then that will inflat household payrol gain relat to payrol gain   we think there is some preliminari evid that that might be the case for the earli year of      and        we   ve seen diverg between these two survey in the past  and they tend to correct over  e   the bls tend to put greater weight on it measur of the payrol survey  and we have histor also   so we believ that is an accur descript of the state of the labor market today
lead up to the decemb report  new claim for unemploy insur were run quit low relat to where they had been  and the decemb report just seem to come out of the blue   do you have ani comment on that   will the decemb employ figur be revis up  do you think   were there season adjust problem
that is possibl  the decemb report seem an aberr to us   it didn   t seem consist with all of the other data we were get at the  e  and we may see a revis in the next report   the claim data are measur peopl go onto the unemploy roll  and we   ve clear seen fewer layoff occur in both that seri and the challeng seri   or in ani of the other layoff seri that we look at   we have not yet seen in earnest a pickup in hire   the flow of worker back into job   the dearth of hire is a pattern that we still are see through the third and fourth quarter in the labor market   there has been some good news   layoff are down   but hire isn   t realli up yet the way we would like to see it
in the third quarter  the     percent growth in real gdp was match by     percent for product growth   do you expect some ridicul number like that for product in the fourth quarter
no   larri   s chart has our product number at about
i   m just look at my chart  and i think it may be misplot
as a short extens to the last discuss  i think we   re all wait for the number that we believ is the better number to record employ growth   the payrol survey had start to act the way it should if we   re go to have a self sustain recoveri here  i know everybodi was disappoint with the decemb number   i   m look at your chart     the bar chart on nonfarm payrol employ go into        grant  the last half of      did show employ grow  and that   s a good thing   it certain is move in the right direct  but how confid are we about the jump in the bar from the last half of      to the first half of        we seem to keep revis our think about product base on backward look disappoint  if you will  about the strength of hire   do we have other evid that give us some confid that this increas is go to take place
as we look at the histor relationship between growth and employ  we think hire will kick in at some point here  and when it   we may be underst payrol gain   we have revis down our payrol employ forecast in recent round   as i look at the blue line in the top left chart  the rise   seem a littl shallow than the norm   but that may be a second order effect in the eye of the behold  i could imagin a period of gain in payrol employ for a while in excess of what we   ve written down here
if we start to see the gain  then i could imagin that  too   laughter
we   ve seen it befor in past busi cycl
obvious  in term of our understand how much product and effici gain are still there to be harvest   let   s say one  e increas   we have almost noth upon which to gaug that   we can talk to busi or tri to undertak econometr es   but we have been consist surpris over the cours of the last two year by the perform of product   one of the biggest challeng in put togeth the forecast has been to tri to assess how much of what we   ve seen in product is go to be sustain growth go forward   we don   t know how much was a seri of one  e adjust that firm accumul over the late     s through tremend amount of capit invest or how technolog may have offer organiz effici that busi are just be abl to take advantag of  i don   t think we have veri much confid at all in our abil to pinpoint the quarter or even half year in which that stock of effici will play out   could that go on for anoth year   i think that   s certain possibl  and one of the simul we had in the  book was in essenc a higher level of product prospect   what that forecast produc was a weaker labor market  higher unemploy  and lower inflat than we are show in the baselin   i think you have to give that some reason probabl weight in your think about how the employ situat is like to progress  on the other hand  as hard as it is to believ that there are upsid risk to our product forecast  that also remain a possibl   a year or so ago product turn out to be much stronger than we thought   so it may be that over the second half of last year there was in fact an improv in under product that was be recogn by busi and household and those entiti realli did step up their spend quit signific   and it may be that what we are see now is just not a terribl unusu lag between that step up in output growth and a pickup in employ and that we will soon start to see a more signific increas in job  take our model that use labor market indic   such as initi claim  layoff announc  and past payrol employ gain   we don   t need to see ani further improv in those indic to get job growth on the order of the         per month that we are forecast for the first half   those same model have been predict better employ gain than we   ve seen for the last six month   so there are still some veri signific risk  and i think that your queasi about the extent of this step up is well found becaus of our inabl to be abl to pinpoint precis when those product opportun will for the most part have play out
mr  chairman  unfortun there is a chart error on chart  in the exhibit on nonfarm busi product at the bottom left   i just want to point it out so that no one is confus   rather than plot the quarter to quarter percent chang in those bar we inadvert plot the percent chang from four quarter earlier   so the correct number should be     percent for the third quarter      percent for the fourth quarter  and     percent for the first quarter of
thank you  mr  chairman   i have what i hope is a quick question on chart   about the save rate  which is clear veri import to the forecast   in the middl panel  you say     the current save rate is still well below the level that mani observ often think of as a more normal rate      but below that in one of the bullet you say that the current set now    point to a target save rate for the next year or two in the neighborhood of   percent      is the target the same as what most observ often think of as normal
i was use what i thought was construct ambigu there   laughter   i   m not sure what most observ think of as the normal rate  but when one read wall street newslett and thing like that  one often see number like   or   percent   i prefer the term    target    becaus i think it impli what we think is actual go on in term of our model of consumpt   that household have a target save rate that is base on thing such as those i note here  includ the wealth ratio and real interest rate   and then it is affect by the composit of incom and  in particular  the role of transfer payment   so i prefer the target concept  and by our reckon  that would current be someth on the order of   percent or so  that is the number that i think we should be focus on
but as you see this expans  what are we target on
in the extend  book simul that are present in the bluebook  we have real interest rate rise out to        consist with the baselin of that extend forecast in the bluebook  we would have by      a target save rate on the order of   percent   but that   s not what we should be think about for
but we could see a sharper upward movement in the save rate
absolut   and as i point out  that     percent save rate that we   ve written down for the end of      still is a bit below target  so we could clear get a more complet correct to target and mayb even some movement abov that target
who want to start the committe discuss   presid parri

thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve talk recent to most of my usual contact   my wal mart contact said that he view the situat as a bit confus   i   ve mention befor the midmonth paycheck cycl that has been evid in the pattern of sale at wal mart   wal mart had sale on januari    that were    percent abov sale on januari    as a consequ of the arriv of paycheck in the middl of the month   my contact said that the ratio is about as larg as they ever see  a normal number is more like   percent or even zero when the economi is realli strong   howev  overal sale in januari so far are come in at the top of the expect rang   about   percent abov year ago number for same store sale   wal mart is concern that  if job creation   not occur soon  their sale growth may taper off becaus in their view the consum is liquid constrain  my up contact said that up had  in his word     an explos decemb      busi was well over project   intern shipment  especi electron from asia to the unit state   as well as comput and tvs   were extrem strong and particular so in the four or five day befor christma   he said that fuel price are go to play a major role go forward  although up is signific hedg against the price increas   to give you an idea of the magnitud of the miss here  up had plan on jet fuel at about    cent a gallon  and it is come in at    cent per gallon  a signific upward revis   up expect to be pass along that higher cost in fuel surcharg  although there is a lot of custom resist  nevertheless  he said that it look as if it is go to be a great year   they are expect a super year in term of growth  but they are manag cost veri  veri tight  defer project until the point where they just have to do them   he also report that they are see headhunt prospect for up employe to move to other firm  i thought that was rather interest  my contact in the truck industri at j b  hunt said that busi is much better now than it was last januari   volum is run about   percent abov januari a year ago  and the increas activ is across the board by region and by industri   but he said it is a bit hard to sort out how much of this is a consequ of the improv economi and how much is due to the reduc suppli of carrier   a lot of the truck compani are no longer in busi   at the end of last year  i talk about the fact that there were new constraint on the number of hour that driver can drive   i ask my contact if there had been ani impact from that and he said    no    becaus the depart of transport has permit a two month delay in the enforc of the new rule   j b  hunt  by the way  also has impos fuel surcharg  our contact at bank of america said that the bank has been experienc a moder pickup in small busi lend and that middl market lend has flatten after sustain declin   larger commerci lend has yet to turn up  i would like to comment briefli on two other issu relev to the nation outlook   we had some discuss earlier about the employ number   bob   rais a question about the household employ seri  which had to do with statist popul control  and an issu on the payrol number  which had to do with birth and death of busi firm   an enterpris staff member in st  loui  kevin kliesen  contact four state   new york  california  georgia  and texa   from which he was abl to get some data on new incorpor   one of the problem is that the payrol number in the birth   death model  which appar resembl fanci arima model  are not tie to current inform on actual firm birth  which would be relev at the present  e  the texa number appli to the first eight month of last year and were convert to an annual rate   in all four state  new busi incorpor grew at a slower rate in      than in        i think that sampl at least tell us that there is no smoke gun in term of the payrol survey fail to pick up new firm birth   if these number had gone the other way  that would rais more question in my mind  i want to comment briefli also on the inflat outlook   bob rasch and jeremi piger did a veri nice memo for me on this subject   they use a standard phillip curv equat   a bob gordon type of equat  which i don   t think is too far from what is in the board staff   s model   which make the rate of inflat depend on inflat expect   they did their analysi in sever differ way  on the cpi and on other measur   the gordon model and the rasch and piger model have a distribut lag on the actual rate of inflat  a gap term  a shock term  and a random term   that is a pretti standard formul   now  suppos you leav the gap term out of the equat and then compar that equat with one that has a gap term in it   if you compar the standard error squar   you can sort of convert that to an r squar kind of measur   it turn out that the gap add  depend on exact how you measur it  onli perhap   to    percent to the total predict valu   a lot of the varianc over the sampl period come from the high inflat year in the     s  when we had some big swing  and that is when we saw a major impact from the shock term as well   the food and energi price  what i am drive at here is that a great deal of the inflat pictur   most of what we can talk about systemat   is tie to the gap term   but histor some veri import chang in inflat have come about that can   t be explain that way   we shouldn   t forget about that fact if we start to get some rise in inflat   the signific of that will depend on how one want to interpret the expect term   if you think of it as just a pure distribut lag  then you get a lot of warn about rise inflat becaus the expect feed through slowli  on the other hand  if you think about that as econometr proxi for expect that could move pretti quick  we could find ourselv in a situat in which we would have a surpris   we could have more inflat on our hand than we would predict right now   i just want to emphas this point   most of our discuss have focus on the gap term  but histor that   s not where we find most of the predict valu in an inflat equat
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom pictur unfold in our region  like that for the nation  continu to be encourag   both the hard data and the accompani commentari from merchant confirm that holiday sale were quit posit   we continu to see a chang mix of fortun among tradit retail  specialti retail  discount  and internet shop site   combin holiday sale exceed last year   s by almost all account   the news from our import tourism industri continu to improv  with report of record break attend for some district attract and stronger hotel occup and book   singl famili residenti hous market in our region remain strong  and even in the depress multifamili residenti and commerci properti sector  vacanc rate seem to have peak and are begin to improv  busi sen ent has decid improv across a wide rang of busi execut that i have talk with   that op  and strong profit are be reflect in capit spend and capit spend plan   interest  that spend is no longer just for cost save opportun or for equip replac  i am also hear more report of spend to expand capac in select case becaus sale are strong   truck firm  in particular  have note a signific turnaround in both hire and truck order   our bank examin report that larg region bank are see a measur pickup in commerci loan demand  although that renew activ is still more in the discuss stage than in actual loan book   negat report are now come most from struggl manufactur industri such as petrochem and apparel  the area of greatest risk and uncertainti in our region pictur over the near term is employ   while our region continu to lead the nation in employ growth  we have seen some falloff in the pace of that growth sinc the last meet   that said  the two state that account for the lion   s share of the growth we are get  georgia and florida  now have unemploy rate of onli   percent and     percent  respect   the largest employ gain remain in employ servic  and not surpris the job categori show net job loss continu to be nondur manufactur  at the nation level  i think we have to be rather pleas with the trend we are see and expect to see in the composit of growth   i interpret the vast major of recent high frequenc data to be veri posit   to my mind  perhap the most import read sinc our last meet is the confirm of strong busi profit and improv busi confid  which are now clear translat into more invest spend and inventori rebuild   that  in turn  should eventu contribut to some better job growth   like mani other who have alreadi spoken  i see the extent and  e of job growth as probabl the greatest short term risk to our forecast   in fact  our own forecast is on the low side of the  book and other forecast  we are less sure that hire will be as robust as other are expect  the greatest longer term risk  in my view  is the larg and grow fiscal imbal   the better feder fiscal pictur was an import contributor to our econom success in the     s  support our abil to conduct monetari polici gear to control inflat   fiscal imbal  should it continu or worsen  may signific complic our longer term polici choic   overal  my near term outlook   not differ great from that in the  book  and the differ hold littl signific for short term polici  which i believ is about right for now   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district continu to improv  and busi sen ent is posit   manufactur activ in the region continu to expand  and the index of general activ in our januari busi outlook survey show a strong rise to      percent  the highest level we have seen sinc the earli     s  the index of new order and shipment were a bit lower in januari than in decemb  but they also are at the highest level we   ve seen sinc the earli     s   gain were broad base  with onli textil and food product show net negat read  we  like the other district  particip in the board staff   s survey on capit spend plan   we survey sixti nine firm in the manufactur  financ  trade  and servic industri in our district   fifti five percent of the respond said that they plan to increas capit spend in       wherea onli    percent plan to decreas spend   the margin of    increas    over    decreas      i don   t think those are word  by the way    laughter  is larger than it was last june  when onli    percent plan increas and    percent plan decreas  in our district the most common reason cite for the rise in capit expenditur were higher sale growth and the need to replac capit good   the latter was a point that came out in one of the slide shown by the staff this morn   i should add  howev  that most of the firm we contact indic that the year over year increas in capit spend would be slight to moder   i would also note that the major of firm in the nation survey that plan increas have alreadi place order associ with that plan spend   this is true in the third district as well  but firm in our region appear to be wait a bit longer to place order than firm in the rest of the nation  retail in our district report that sale growth dure the holiday period was solid  meet or exceed their expect   on averag  sale were up   to   percent from year ago level in area store  though our retail had expect   to   percent growth rate   the last  e we met i report that busi lend in the third district was begin to pick up   this has continu   sever of our banker report that they have seen more op  among busi custom and expect busi lend to continu to expand  construct activ maintain the pattern it has shown sinc the recoveri start  residenti construct and home sale continu to show strength while commerci real estat market remain soft   the job market in our region continu to outperform that of the nation as a whole but still must be character as weak   for the three state in total  payrol employ basic has been flat sinc the start of the recoveri compar with a     percent declin nation   and the tri state unemploy rate averag     percent for the fourth quarter accord to the data releas just ye day  compar with     percent for the nation   in summari  the econom recoveri continu to build momentum in our district   this is be reflect in the improv mood and sen ent of busi contact in our region  who are project further improv this year  turn to the nation  econom activ continu to expand at a strong pace  although employ remain soft   the consum continu to support the recoveri  while invest spend is come back  support by strong profit growth   the recent weak in job growth is the biggest disappoint  as we all have point out here   these data seem to be at odd with the survey evid   includ the busi outlook survey  which suggest that firm are begin to add to their payrol   nonetheless  we can onli respond to the data we have   the philadelphia staff forecast see stronger job growth go forward  though less strong than the  book     although product growth is unlik to match the   plus percent pace we have seen  we believ it will remain strong enough that the near term improv in labor market will be moder but posit   in our forecast  job growth is expect to be around   percent this year and next   that pace of payrol growth translat to about         job per month over the next two year   this pick up on the theme that presid   mention earlier about the  book forecast for employ gain be much stronger than that   the job growth we forecast is a bit slower than pre recess number   job growth averag     percent in the late     s  for exampl   but it is consist with the report we are get from our busi outlook survey respond and other firm about their hire plan   we forecast a modest declin in the unemploy rate to     percent for the fourth quarter of this year and    percent for the end of next year  our forecast for gdp growth is similar to that of the  book  with consumpt growth in the   percent plus rang support by improv job prospect   the higher tax refund expect this year lead us to forecast somewhat stronger consum spend in the first half of the year compar with the second   our forecast for busi spend is slight stronger than that of the  book  but both can be character as robust   we expect the expir of the invest tax credit to pull some invest forward to      from next year   growth abroad is also expect to strengthen next year  and in our judgment  this combin with the lag effect of dollar depreci mean that export growth will acceler over      and      wherea import growth will deceler over      and        thus  we believ that trade will be less of a drag on gdp growth in      and may make a small posit contribut  our view on inflat differ onli a bit from the  book   like the  book  we expect strong product growth and onli slow improv in labor market to keep inflat low this year   howev  we are forecast a small acceler next year   even so  inflat in our forecast remain veri low   in the    to     percent rang   over the next two year   as with all forecast  there are risk   but to my mind the risk seem to be smaller  and they also appear to be balanc   given all of this  i see no reason to chang our polici stanc now  howev  given the lag in monetari polici  the  e for a chang is approach   so i believ we need to think about the condit that would caus us to adjust polici and what we need to do now to increas our flexibl to respond to chang event   it could turn out that there will be a surpris on the upsid  and we have to be prepar for that   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi has actual strengthen further sinc the last meet  and busi contact are frank relat op ist about the year ahead   i attend a tech confer near boulder about two and a half week ago  that confer is held each year at about the same  e   last year about     peopl attend  this year about     peopl were there  and they were all veri much engag with project go forward   so there is a clear improv in attitud in some of the technolog area   also  energi activ in the district continu to be strong  primarili in the natur gas area  and is veri posit general speak   manufactur activ actual continu to expand in decemb  both product and new order move further abov year ago level  with order post their strongest growth in some year   inventori also rose abov year ago level for the first  e in three year  in our survey on capit spend we did see some improv on net   thirti one percent of the manufactur said that they expect to increas expenditur in the next six to twelv month  and that is a substanti improv over the number for our region in the previous survey last may   mani firm that are plan to increas spend cite the need to replac primarili it and some other equip   have said that  some respond provid specif comment indic that they were go to hold onto their current equip until it actual fell apart on them befor they would invest again  they were absolut commit to not spend money at this  e  commerci real estat activ is still weak in our area   vacanc rate actual edg up in the fourth quarter  and we are not see a lot of construct activ in that sector of our region economi   labor market also remain soft  but the under trend of layoff and new hire was a littl more favor this  e   adjust for some of the mad cow effect on meat pack plant activ  we have seen more hire than layoff base on our own survey  in the agricultur economi       was a veri strong year for our region and i think nation  primarili becaus of the declin in the dollar and the demand oversea   we actual are go to have some of the highest earn in sever year in the agricultur sector   in fact  agricultur incom hasn   t been that high in the last seven year   so that is realli posit   and we now expect that the mad cow effect will be less sever than we had origin thought  base on talk with various group in our region where that threat is so import  turn to the nation outlook  i would agre with those who say that recent indic confirm a strengthen in the economi look ahead   our project for gdp growth is not as strong as the  book   s  we have it more in the area of     percent   but i think that the differ are a matter of degre   the direct is the same  and some of the reason for the improv are the same  includ veri accommod monetari and fiscal polici and favor financi condit   so i think we will see some improv  one comment i did want to make is relat to the point that presid pool mention about look at the output gap as an indic   i  too  am a littl uneasi about put much weight on the output gap becaus the es  of it size are so vari   the same is true of some other paramet such as the natur rate   the gap could be as littl as    percent of gdp or as much as   percent  and that is too wide a rang on which to base judgment   so i think presid santomero is right in ask what area we are go to look at to help guid us in our polici decis in the futur   that is a veri import question  as for the inflat outlook  we think inflat is most like to increas over the year by perhap as much as    percentag point  given the fact that we have a veri accommod monetari polici and fiscal s ulus in the pipelin   i think that is an import consider for us as we look forward   i   ll stop at that
there is coffe out there  so whi don   t we break for ten minut   coffe break

thank you  mr  chairman   the district economi is do reason well  and most indic of econom activ are posit   let me summar that situat quick  start with household demand   on balanc  auto sale continu to be fair strong  and tourism is have a good year in the district   overal consum spend is grow moder  aid in part appar by the return of canadian to some of the northern border citi   i presum most as a result of chang in the exchang rate   residenti construct and relat measur like hous sale remain anoth bright spot       was a record year in mani part of the district   most peopl in the marketplac expect anoth good year in         perhap not up to       but quit strong nevertheless  manufactur activ is improv  and the outlook for capit spend is clear a bright spot   we have the benefit of the survey that was done by the staff  but the most impress report on the capit spend outlook came from one of our director who survey a number of larg firm in minnesota   almost uniform these firm are plan doubl digit increas in capit spend for the current year for a varieti of interrel reason have to do with capac expans  replac demand  cost reduct initi  and so on   that was clear a much more posit report than we had been get previous and more op ist certain than i would have anticip  at least until recent   mine activ has also pick up  and that is most taconit mine in northern minnesota  which probabl reflect what is go on in the steel market   the situat in commerci and industri space is diverg  absorpt of industri space in the twin citi market was quit substanti in        the best absorpt in three year or so   but offic vacanc remain at an elev level   i think we are see some modest improv in labor market condit in the district  and wage gain general remain in the   to   percent per year rang  as far as the nation economi is concern  i think the outlook is posit  and i am reason op ist in that regard   my own forecast isn   t quit as strong as the  book   s  but basic  whether i adher to mine or i take the  book baselin  i   m pretti comfort with the outlook   i do think the uncertainti around the forecast has diminish   one issu i would point to that has been talk about by other is the labor market   i remain skeptic that we will see overal employ gain of the size indic in the  book   there is no doubt  at least in my judgment  that employ will come back and probabl come back substanti  but i am a littl skeptic that we will achiev employ gain in the next coupl of year as larg as those anticip in the  book   have said that  i don   t think that is go to have ani profound effect on the way the economi perform becaus the differ is like to be made up by product   final  i think the inflat outlook is benign not becaus of the gap but becaus inflat has been low  and i expect it to remain low
thank you  mr  chairman   the weather has been frigid in new england  but the economi may actual be heat up   anecdot  mani contact in manufactur are more upbeat  and our contact in the retail arena report a notic pickup in busi in the fourth quarter   busi confid in massachusett surg in decemb  and consum are more confid as well  particular about futur condit   even employ trend may be better than we thought   an earli assess of the like benchmark state employ revis suggest that job loss in earli      were greater than previous thought but the latter month of the year saw a greater rebound   nonetheless  region employ level are still below       and the area   s unemploy rate held at     percent in novemb  initi unemploy claim rose as well  though help want advertis is pick up  the increas in busi confid that i note earlier was accompani by statement that employ in massachusett have abandon their wait and see postur and now believ that a robust econom recoveri is under way   howev  other contact are more skeptic about that  the continu abil to increas product and the expand use of outsourc seem reason enough for rein in domest hire  at least over the near term   recent contact with sourc in the high tech world indic that op  is spread there   big custom are start to spend money  and the mood of softwar execut has definit brighten   i think that is along the line of what presid parri and presid hoenig mention as well   one of our director is the ceo of a relat larg chip manufactur compani   he report that worldwid semiconductor manufactur is increas on the basi of solid new order growth and rise profit   compani in this industri were wait for growth to materi befor commit to new hire   now he believ that they are readi to add staff  and in one case  a major firm recent hire     worker for it portland  main  facil   that is a start anyway  i certain hope that solid employ growth in the nation as a whole will start soon  as i see it  that   s the remain fli in the ointment  if you will  to a recoveri that in everi other way show sign of realli pick up   i  like other  was disappoint with the decemb unemploy report   the disappoint number may get revis away  but i think there is still a sens of caution   though perhap it   s eb   on the part of busi to both spend and hire  in my view  question remain about the durabl and self sustain natur of this expans  past the fiscal impuls   it is certain true that consum spend continu to be buoyant  and we expect it will remain so   busi spend also seem to have pick up and will like acceler further given profit level and incent that are built into fiscal polici   it   s like that hire will follow  but i think it will take some  e befor all light are   for both spend and hire  speak of    the  book forecast continu to anticip an economi that is about as good as it get or is like to get   i don   t have ani major problem with that forecast  growth is expect to be strong over the next coupl of year  with unemploy lower and inflat a moot issu   fiscal polici s ulus reced in the latter half of this year  but the economi is sustain by continu strong consumpt  an improv extern sector  a declin dollar  and veri favor financi market   we in boston  not unlik other around the tabl  show lower growth project for      and      than   the  book   but the direct of our number is the same as those in the  book  and i don   t want to quibbl about differ at the margin   the overal messag is the same   product is strong  the gap in resourc use narrow  and inflat  if anyth  is like to trend down in the near term  but that trend down isn   t worrisom  what i think could turn out to be a littl worrisom and need to be given some thought are the implic of the extrem accommod financi market that we are see   for now  veri low credit spread and rise equiti market are not out of line with profit and are one of the key underpin to sustain a solid pace of growth in        what i view as a possibl concern is whether these market have the potenti over  e to feed into the type of specul excess that were so damag to emerg market abroad and then to our own economi in the late      s   it hasn   t even been ten year sinc the first asian crisi so there is reason to believ that borrow  lender  and investor rememb the hard lesson they learn and will manag their risk more effect   but i think it   s someth to watch   howev  what i   m most focus on watch  at least over the near term  is whether we will begin to see the increas level of employ envis in the  book forecast or even in our forecast  which is a littl lower  on balanc  as i look ahead there seem to be risk on both side of the project   if employ pick up as the  book project  we could see some surpris in reduc product and higher inflat   on the other side  the employ growth in the project remain a forecast  and if  sn   t occur soon  it could take longer than we expect to realiz ani tighten of resourc   as vinc put it in the bluebook  we may be abl to be patient for a while  but i think we have to be watch as well
thank you  mr  chairman   as in other region of the countri  the richmond district economi is increas signal a sustain econom expans  at least as far as demand and product are concern   our sens is that holiday sale were solid   and servic sector compani in our district   there are mani  includ truck compani  financi sector firm  and law firm  and we have a lot of law firm    laughter  are all tell us that their busi have strengthen most recent  more import for our region  though  manufactur activ appear clear to have bottom   we still have textil compani and apparel compani in the  ina that are hurt  but that   s larg the ongo result of a secular adjust   other manufactur compani in our region  especi high tech compani but also manufactur compani produc such thing as construct equip  indic that they are do better   new order at factori have been rise at an increas rapid pace in recent month accord to the month manufactur survey that we conduct   that survey has an employ compon  which in the month of decemb gave us the first non negat read that we   ve seen in about two year   that may be a sign that the long declin in factori job in our region is end  at least in the aggreg   relat to this  the result of the capit spend survey that we did in respons to the board staff   s request were  as in other district  much better than those from the previous survey in the summer   i think that in general busi decisionmak are much more confid as to the durabl of the expans than they were earlier  final with regard to the region economi  despit the evid of slight firmer aggreg demand and increas product  we don   t see clear sign that our labor market are firm signific at this point   this relat to the central issu you were underlin  cathi  and that we are all grappl with at the nation level   howev  as i said earlier  i see encourag evid that the hemorrhag in the factori sector may now be end  with regard to the nation economi  the broad contour of the  book forecast have not chang a lot sinc decemb   to summar what everybodi know  the forecast for real gdp growth is about     percent for this year and   percent for next year  the board staff still anticip that the employ gap will be elimin over the forecast period  but not complet until the end of next year   and core consum inflat is expect to remain at about   percent   for me  the realli interest part of the  book forecast discuss   and i suspect this is true for a lot of other peopl around the tabl   lie below the headlin growth and inflat project   name  the substanti increas in es  structur product growth in      and      is expect to continu this year and next   the  book now conclud that much more of the recent product surg is perman than was thought to be the case befor  i find this reassess of broad product growth veri interest   i have been worri for a while that the product surg may be longer last than had been assum in earlier staff forecast   the key point here  of cours  is that this develop certain has the potenti to move the employ gap in the wrong direct  that is  it could widen the gap or at least keep it from close as rapid as we would like to see   i think that risk is nice summar by the altern scenario in the  book that is label    temporarili fa  product growth      in fact  i thought the two altern scenario on product growth were veri help  but the temporarili fa  product altern is the one that i would focus on here   it describ how the public may perceiv the product gain as a one  e increas in the level of product rather than a sustain rise in product growth go forward   in the case of a one  e level increas  the public would not feel much wealthier  and aggreg demand would potenti fall short of the increas in aggreg suppli result from the higher product growth   in that scenario  the output and employ gap would widen rather than close  and inflat conceiv could fall further  in this regard  i think it is worth underlin that  in this  book forecast  the trend in the output gap stay fair constant compar with the last  book despit the signific increas in product   the reason  of cours  is that the forecast assum that the trend in labor forc growth slow by about as much as the trend in product growth increas  with the result that the path of potenti output is not chang   my concern here is that extrapol the recent weak in labor forc growth forward may be a mistak   in fact  part   of the  book present evid that more worker may be discourag by poor hire prospect now than has been the case histor   i don   t know if the  book mention this  but immigr domest worker could be discourag in this situat   and the result could be that the overal u s  workforc is now more cyclic sensit than earlier  mean that trend labor forc growth may not declin  in contrast to the  book assumpt   in this situat  workforc growth would like pick up strong as employ growth begin to pick up   this mean that it would take longer to absorb the labor market slack than the  book project   in that case  the risk of further disinfl would be greater than the  book discuss might suggest  and that of cours is where i was go with all of this  my bottom line concern  for the reason i have just summar   and i   m back to where i start   is this   even though the real growth and inflat project in the baselin forecast have not chang a lot sinc the decemb meet  i think a good case could be made that the risk of further disinfl is greater in the current forecast than in the previous one   i   m not go to conclud from that assess that we should eas polici  but this would be a basi for me to want to resist chang polici in the other direct   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   by most measur  econom condit in the fourth district are improv   household have continu to purchas new and exist home  automobil  and light truck at a solid pace   banker in the district are report that credit qualiti in their consum loan portfolio has been veri good   a notabl develop dure the intermeet period has been the improv in sen ent regard capit spend   wherea sever month ago it was common for me to hear from most ceo that they were not go to invest signific in new equip for a    consider period    of  e   laughter  mani busi leader now say that they are will to do so   this improv in attitud seem to be due both to a chang in mind and to a chang in heart  the chang in mind come from a better capit spend arithmet   mani ceo are now convinc that demand for their product will remain strong   moreov  corpor earn have been excel  and investor have flock back to the equiti market  the chang in heart seem to stem from the appear of more stabil in the intern situat   the paralyz uncertainti that had been in place has been replac by more inform risk take   ceo are begin to act as though we are in an expans  and they are again begin to make decis  especi invest decis  with more confid  nevertheless  the contrast in busi attitud between capit spend and hire plan remain strike   my busi contact remain adam about not expand worker head count except as a last recours   a cfo from a larg nation retail told me that she and the compani presid must approv ani net addit to employ anywher in the compani   at the same  e  though  while some ceo express a grudg reluct to hire  i am begin to hear from a number of banker that they are have difficulti find qualifi worker to hire   we are experienc our own problem in that regard in the district   we are have a difficult  e find qualifi bank examin to hire and a difficult  e in our cincinnati marketplac tri to find employe for some expand check process oper that we are do there   so labor market pattern are puzzl   the data suggest to me that someth unusu is happen both on the suppli side as well as the demand side so it is hard to get a handl  as mani other have said  about the degre of slack in the labor market   i think the staff   s decis to lower employ growth in      from it previous project is a sensibl adjust  what has surpris me most in the district dure the past sever week has been talk about price increas for certain product despit the low inflat rate of which we are all awar   i don   t want to make much of this   it   s just that i haven   t heard the topic of price increas mention in quit a while   commod price  both energi and non energi relat  have been increas for some  e   some manufactur are now quiet look for opportun to pass on price increas in their product   steel produc have gone from famin to feast   they are enjoy a strong global demand after a period of industri consolid  with the strengthen in demand  steel price have been rise sharpli and obvious without the protect of tariff   price increas for raw materi and industri commod have not found their way into retail price in ani broad base way   inde  we discuss the loos of the relationship between commod and consum price at the last meet   in addit  i know that mani manufactur expect that the dollar   s depreci will provid them with some leverag in a strengthen global economi even though  again  the empir evid of that happen is question   after all  retail price inflat is still slip rather than rise  but perhap the mere fact that there is ani discuss about price increas is simpli anoth sign that busi person have regain their confid in the outlook  as i think about the nation outlook  i realiz that  despit my confid in the prospect for the expans  i have littl confid in forecast of the futur cours of inflat  the output gap and our es  of the natur rate of interest provid us onli rough guidelin in the best of circumst   unfortun  today we have the challeng of tri to deciph inconsist evid regard labor market tight  account for the possibl that some of our measur capit stock is obsolet  and attempt to es  the under rate of growth in structur product   my best guess is that we have pass through the point of concern about unwelcom disinfl and are enter a period where the odd favor greater inflat stabil   given that  i believ we should proceed with the strategi that you laid out at our decemb meet  mr  chairman   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   onc again i   m an outlier in term of my project of the strength in gdp growth for this year  as i can see from the chart we look at this morn   i want to note  howev  that someon els is even more ebulli than i am  but that person has not yet    fess up      laughter   for me  the lesson of the second half of last year was confirm of the strong respons of the economi to fiscal and monetari s ulus onc the restraint of fall equiti price  capit overhang  busi caution  and geopolit risk had fade   in fact  the respons was stronger and quicker than i anticip   consequ  for next year i expect the fallback from the   percent plus growth of the last half of      to be limit  fiscal s ulus ebb fair gradual as we saw on a chart this morn   household spend held up better than expect at year end despit weak labor market  suggest that it earlier strength was base on more than just rebat check and newli liquefi home equiti  low interest rate  rise wealth  and increas confid about the futur sure play import role  and these factor will continu to boost spend   inde  financi condit have becom even more s ul over the last sever month  and that will have it effect this year   sinc septemb of last year  equiti price have risen    percent  rate on corpor bond have fallen as much as   percentag point or more  and the dollar has depreci near   percent on the broad index   the largest declin in bond rate were on the riskiest issu  and the grow willing to take risk in capit market is echo in increas op  about futur profit and sale by busi more general   a develop certain wit by mani of the report we heard this morn   lower cost of capit and grow confid should interact with acceler output  strong profit and cash flow  and the need to make up for previous postpon replac spend to support consider ongo strength in busi capit expenditur   in effect  we are begin to see greater feed through of strong product growth to spend both by household respond to rise equiti price and by busi react to profit opportun in new invest  given financi condit  fiscal polici  grow confid  and strong growth in product  real gdp growth of   percent or more is not a stretch at all   it is well within the normal respons pattern  and this suggest to me that there are upsid as well as downsid risk to such a strong forecast   in a sens  though  the growth forecast isn   t all that interest   i agre with presid broaddus that the interest and more difficult question are on the suppli side of the economi   how fast will potenti grow  how will it interact with demand  and what are the implic for the output gap and inflat   the staff has a favor stori here   strong under product boost actual and expect profit  equiti price  and anticip incom stream  rais demand   but actual product growth slow some  so strong demand show through to a close output gap   at the same  e  compens growth remain moder  labor   s share of incom remain fair low  and worker onli begin to catch up with the higher under product growth   as a result  the slow growth of actual product  sn   t rais unit labor cost veri much  and it keep core inflat at recent level  this seem a reason project  take account of the surpris behavior of product and labor cost in recent year  but there are consider uncertainti around this most like outcom and appreci skew to the probabl   for one  the staff did not allow the higher trend product of recent year to show through to a larger output gap  and sandi gave some good reason for this   but we did see more disinfl than expect last year  and while special factor contribut  price behavior could point to a greater probabl that the gap is larger and not smaller than the staff   s es    moreov  the staff has interpret some of the recent product gain as push the level of product abov it trend  and this gap disappear onc busi confid rebound further   but given the uncertainti about the origin of the astound product gain in recent quarter  there would seem to be a good chanc that they won   t be revers   so  actual labor product might not slow as much as in the  book forecast  keep unit labor cost on a lower trajectori  other risk point to the potenti for greater price pressur   compens could acceler more as labor market tighten  allow higher product to pass through to labor more quick   product advanc could begin to show through more forcibl into demand  in effect rais the natur interest rate more quick than in the staff   s forecast   at this point  howev  sinc we have experienc repeat product surpris and insuffici demand to tighten labor market  while some measur of wage gain continu to trend down  i judg the risk on inflat aris from the suppli side of the economi still to be tilt toward the downsid  these uncertainti and skew have implic for polici strategi   given the lag in compens behind product  this most recent product surpris bear a resembl to the mid     s   then we took some of the temporarili favor output   inflat tradeoff result from the product surpris in output   the unemploy rate fell to   percent   and some in lower inflat  as core pce fell from     percent in      to     percent in        at this  e  with the core inflat rate in the neighborhood of   percent  it would be import to take as much as possibl of the product surpris in output  not in lower inflat   so in my view  the suppli side uncertainti  togeth with the skew in those uncertainti point toward a higher probabl of inflat come in below expect  reinforc the rational for be veri  veri cautious in move off our current high accommod polici stanc   this is a subject i assum we will come back to in the next part of the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   develop in the second district seem to be track those in the nation as a whole   we are strong where the nation economi is strong   the empir survey show veri high level of busi confid  order  shipment  and most thing we measur  but the slope of the increas has flatten  employ is still soft  perhap a bit softer than it has been nation   in our neighborhood  howev  inflat seem to be run somewhat ahead of the nation number  and our survey show further increas in price receiv and paid as well as higher expect for both six month out  develop in the nation economi sinc our last meet support grow comfort in the outlook   the expans seem more broad base  with strength continu in household spend and hous  and capit spend grow at reason rapid rate   export are perform well  consum and busi confid are at quit high level  and busi caution has reced   the increas confid in the sustain of the expans seem justifi  although we have a somewhat softer outlook for growth than the central tendenc of the forecast around this tabl  we share the general expect that the payrol number should begin to show more rapid growth   the fall in claim  increas part  e employ  and survey of enterpris plan support this view   with demand growth strong  it would be surpris if we did not see more rapid growth in hire   inflat  of cours  is still veri low   it is hard to find evid yet of a chang to the trajectori of a gradual downward drift in the rate of increas in core inflat  look outsid the unit state  demand look stronger and the news is general encourag   still  the major economi are grow at rate substanti short of the u s  pace  polici in europ and japan may be get better  but it  sn   t look too impress when judg against the scale of the structur challeng   fundament in emerg market economi have improv  although perhap not to the extent impli by the veri low spread to treasuri   the broad consensus in favor of open trade polici seem more fragil these day despit the strength and breadth of the global recoveri  overal  we believ that the u s  economi is like to continu to expand at a pace somewhat abov our es  of potenti growth and will do so for the next sever quarter  we believ that the rang of uncertainti around this outlook has narrow  but the probabl of a stronger outcom may now exceed that of a weaker outcom  and this is a good thing   we expect inflat to stay low   there is some chanc that inflat will deceler further in the near term  but we can afford to be less worri about this risk given the appar strength in demand   we now face a rise  if still small  probabl that inflat will find it floor and begin to move modest higher   the critic question  of cours  is whether this will happen even if the appar slack in the economi is absorb onli gradual  this is a reason encourag outlook  but it is probabl healthi to acknowledg the sourc of uncertainti and risk   the sourc of uncertainti and risk are not new  but they are compel still   the appar strength of product growth support the view that the microeconom fundament of the u s  economi are except strong relat both to it recent path and to the perform of other major economi   there is a lot  though  that we do not know about these dynam and what they mean for employ and inflat  given our forecast for growth  and what in turn the implic of these dynam are and how soon it will be appropri for us to adjust polici   caution here argu for give ourselv more flexibl than our statement now provid  with a possibl that we may need to move sooner than we had thought and than the market now expect  the scale of the broader imbal in the economi   the low level of privat save  the substanti deterior of the structur fiscal posit  and the size of the extern imbal   remain a sourc of consider risk   even if the long run sustain level of u s  growth is higher than convent thought  the factor necessari to bring these imbal down to more comfort level are not now in place  and they do not appear to be in prospect  the fact that the dollar declin has been so benign should not be too reassur  given the forc at work to slow it and to support offici foreign demand for u s  fix incom asset and given the extent of the further adjust in the dollar that may still be requir   these risk don   t alter the balanc for monetari polici now  but they may suggest that we need to be more attent to the downsid of give the market too much confid that polici will remain on hold indefinit  and final  of cours  financi condit are now veri accommod   asset market  credit spread  risk premium  and measur of volatil have all move a long way toward a veri benign view of the world   these factor make the fundament look better than they probabl are   they make us more vulner to the buildup of distort in financi market that can onli be unwound with some drama   they amplifi the forc provid by our alreadi except accommod polici stanc   this merit attent  and at the margin it probabl also reinforc the case for recalibr our signal a bit to posit us more comfort to deal with the possibl that we may see a case for move polici befor the end of the year   this is not a call to arm or a call to action   this is meant just to be a case   to borrow ye day   s formul   for a gentl  gradual evolut  laughter  in how we frame the forward look signal in our statement   thank you
presid broaddus use the term    bottom out     and i think that express also appli to the two issu that i want to discuss   fiscal polici and the bank system   first  with respect to fiscal polici  you undoubt know that the omnibus spend bill pass the senat last week and was sign by the presid   this mean that the govern is no longer be fund on a continu resolut   you may or may not have notic  becaus it got lost in the report of the victori of   kerri in the iowa caucus  that the closur vote in the senat to bring the bill to the floor fail the first  e around   it receiv fewer vote than there are republican member of the caucus  which a lot of peopl took to be a signal that mani senat have reach a point where they recogn the need for some disciplin in the govern spend process   the short term result of the spend bill is that it will provid a whole lot of s ulus for      but in way that most of us would not approv   the bill includ somewher between       and        separ earmark  which we use to call    pork      it   seem  though  that in a respons to the last spend effort  both republican and democrat see the need to go back to a budget process that will impos some disciplin   the futur reduct in deficit that are be discuss are more consist with what we have in our  book  with respect to the bank system     bottom out    has a much more posit connot   as has been report  the qualiti of asset in the bank industri has reach the point that there is an expect that it could go down   nevertheless  my discuss with banker this past week differ from mani of my convers in other recent week   instead of talk about loan loss  they are now talk about watch list   what that mean is that  rather than be correct in term of their approach to bad loan  they are now be prevent  which would suggest that the economi is now probabl bottom out   that is import for a coupl of reason   despit the improv in bank profit  we see that interest incom margin continu to declin and are at their lowest level in mani year   what banker are tell me is that low margin are put great pressur on lender to increas loan volum   now  becaus the consum loan side has stay strong  the onli opportun for signific growth is in the c i loan compon   what i   m hear now is that there is a lot more loan demand and tremend competit among banker for loan   it seem to me that banker are will to take on more risk than i have heard them admit to in recent year   this includ both credit risk and interest rate risk  with a lot of bank financ involv commerci real estat ventur   so we may be at a point where in      there will be mani lender compet for a relat small number of loan  a conclus that is support by the financ gap of nonfinanci busi as describ in the  book and anecdot   one of the banker i spoke with told me that they use the demand deposit of their commerci custom as an addit benchmark for forecast loan volum   the low level of such deposit suggest that the need for bank financ of busi capit expenditur is go to be veri limit   this conclus is also support by the chart that larri   show us earlier today  which indic that debt   asset ratio  both short term and total  are at a record low  in summari  i conclud that we will have a lot of s ulus stem from the feder budget process but perhap more fiscal disciplin go forward   from the banker    side  we have signific indic of more interest in capit spend by busi firm   unfortun for the banker  most of it will be financ intern or outsid the bank system
thank you  mr  chairman   we seem to be enter phase   of the fight against the downturn   phase   involv bring in all the fire truck   fiscal expans  monetari accommod  and languag such as    consider period      the fire is out now  the economi is grow at a healthi rate  and the pattern of vigor growth is spread throughout the economi   earlier  most of the strength involv household and govern spend  now the strength has broaden to invest and export   it is not inevit but fortun that inflat has stay veri low in this expans  and it is still bump along the bottom edg of our target rang and point down in it most recent number   on the other side  we are just begin to hear talk of new asset bubbl such as we discuss previous   in these circumst  to bring this all togeth i person think it is  e for polici to start pull back the fire truck gradual   for monetari polici  we should start unwind our rhetor by move toward a more flexibl set of word   we can deal with interest rate later on  fiscal polici should do likewis   now  i   m talk here about the general fiscal outlook  larri   discuss a chart earlier today that show one period of sharp declin in fiscal impetus  but in general the trend is for a seri of larg deficit   make the administr   s prefer assumpt that the tax cut will be extend  the cbo declar two day ago that the outlook is for a      billion year deficit as far as the eye can see   a former colleagu  alic rivlin  is conven a brook confer that has the deficit rise to twice that level   these number are much too larg  and we should gradual be remov the fiscal fire truck as well  not do so will drain fund from capit format  wast tax revenu on excess interest cost  and put the countri in poor shape to deal with the upcom retir crunch stem from age babi boomer  there is an interest  if difficult to understand  impact on the foreign side   under the normal mundel   fleme model  gradual fiscal tighten should lower the dollar and lead to a gradual reduct in our current account deficit   part of that has actual happen   there has been a dollar reduct that accord to the  book has result in a current account deficit that is smaller by a percentag point of gdp than it would otherwis have been   but the current account deficit is still veri larg     percent of gdp through the  book horizon and possibl even larger beyond that horizon   the net extern debt impli by all of this   it was zero as late as        is    percent of gdp right now  and it could easili be as high as    percent of gdp in three year   we are put a lot of dollar instrument on the intern market  and it   s reason to ask who is go to hold them all   so far  the asian central bank have been huge buyer and are now hold more than a trillion dollar of foreign exchang reserv  larg in dollar form   they seem to be motiv more by the desir to keep their export competit than by tradit rate of return consider   as other currenc bear the brunt of the adjust  it is not imposs that this kind of behavior will spread to other central bank  suppos mani of the world central bank gang up to support the dollar   can they pull it off   i don   t know   we know that it is physic imposs for central bank to interven indefinit to support their own currenc  but they may be abl to keep print money to support some other currenc   the question is whether they will exhaust their abil to  il these intervent and whether this monetari expans ul  will lead to rapid inflat  we   re into the realm of unfamiliar econom  a realm that we have visit often sinc i   ve been on the board    laughter   is such intervent desir   to me the answer is clear    no      if the support just goe on for a finit period  the central bank are overrid the normal exchang rate adjust process   the current account deficit remain too high  too much extern u s  debt is be creat  and inevit adjust onli becom more difficult down the road   the world economi would be better off with small and gradual adjust now   in the limit case  where the support goe on forev  one must be less definit  but as i just said  i serious question whether this limit case is possibl   politician have an old saw call the law of hole  which say that  when in a hole  the first thing to do is to stop dig   i think the world macroeconomi would be a safer place if the econom author around the globe would follow this rule   the unit state should be gradual tighten it fiscal polici  foreign central bank should get out of the busi of export promot  find domest way to s ul their economi if necessari   the fed can  and i trust will  pull back it fire truck  but now is the  e to pull back all the fire truck
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   the incom data  as almost everyon has note  appear to valid the confid that emerg at the last meet that a sustain expans seem most like to be under way   almost all compon of domest final demand seem to be on a relat firm foot   household consumpt is clear benefit from s ul polici and the effect of rise stock market and hous wealth as well as improv consum confid   residenti real estat invest also is on a solid foot  with recent declin in mortgag rate most like to support a strong hous market for some  e to come   import  the expans seem to have broaden out  as other have indic   in the busi sector  incom data on new order and shipment  when combin with survey and anecdot data  do suggest that busi are like to increas their invest in a widen rang of capit good as oppos to retrench   final  the firm that is under way domest also appear to be occur oversea  of cours  this good news must be temper by a clear understand that firm are not yet creat job as quick as we would like   howev  even in the labor market there are a few posit sign   aggreg hour rose in the fourth quarter as a whole  which i think was the first quarter increas sinc        the unemploy rate has declin  and initi claim also seem to be shift downward   the other small fli in the ointment is that core price seem to have drift somewhat lower dure the intermeet period  i believ in larg part becaus of strong product growth   a theme to which i will return short   given my read of these incom data  i think i can accept the contour of the baselin forecast in the  book  which for me impli the desir of ongo patienc with the current stanc of monetari polici  howev  even against that benign outlook  there are a coupl of risk that confront us  and i must say that they are in some sens inconsist   on one hand  i have some concern that the baselin  book forecast has assum a fair larg drop in the growth rate of structur labor product for      and      from it es  level in        i fulli agre that product growth cannot pick up indefinit   tree don   t grow to the sky  as they say  howev  if the rate of chang in structur product were to come closer to maintain it      level instead of fall as in the baselin forecast  the outcom would be better captur by one of the two fa  product growth scenario in the  book   both call for somewhat lower inflat   i think that echo the point that presid broaddus has alreadi touch on and that we in fact discuss earlier today in the question and answer session right after presid     s question   now  it   s obvious veri hard to know exact what is go to happen to product  as the answer that dave   gave indic   but if one look at the special survey of beig book contact that mani have refer to  it   s quit clear that one of the major factor behind the capit good spend plan for this year is the desir to replac either it or other capit good   therefor  busi will again have the possibl of captur some effici enhanc improv that come with the technolog capabl embed in some newer generat of equip   if they do so  we may well find that product growth is stronger than in the baselin forecast  and against the backdrop of inflat  which is alreadi at the low end of the rang that i find accept  that clear call for some import discuss about what our polici should be  on the other hand  i have anoth kind of concern  which has to do with the state of financi market   dure the intermeet period  we saw quit a run up in the price of equiti  as busi prove that they inde have a great deal of earn power if not much price power   nonetheless  dure that same period  interest rate drop quit signific  risk spread have come down  which is a good thing as governor kohn suggest but also may indic an underappreci of the risk that may be embed   frank  to put it mild  i think that the dollar carri trade has becom extrem well entrench and that the market are look to us perhap more than they should be   one small piec of evid in this regard is that the flow of the fund and the behavior of multifamili invest strike me as be somewhat out of touch with the fundament   this suggest to me that perhap we are anchor the yield curv more than we   d like  and in my mind we need to tri to do two thing simultan   one is to suggest that inflat risk  while they have reced from corros disinfl or deflat  still tend to be tilt a bit to the downsid   the other is to suggest that market should be look at and calibr more fulli the incom data and the under risk to the economi   i   m afraid that at this stage  given the high product possibl  the fix incom market in particular are not in fact do the appropri job of price risk   we need in some sens to remov the anchor that we have place on those market   with that  mr  chairman  i   ll stop and look forward to the second half of our discuss
as i suggest ye day  my guess about futur econom condit is veri close to the board staff   s forecast   i   m just a littl more op ist than they are on real growth and unemploy   so  don  i may be your guy    laughter   the economi appear to be in the sweet spot of strong growth combin with veri low inflat   it would be even sweeter if it were accompani by rapid fall unemploy   i believ that we are go to get a declin in unemploy soon  as   the  book   but like cathi  i   ll feel better about it when i start see it   the product improv in manufactur seem to be spread to the wholesal and retail trade sector  where inform technolog advanc have improv the economi of scale in retail  lead to below par hire in that sector   i   m a lag indic when it come to use new technolog  but i recent got up enough nerv to use the self checkout counter at the supermarket    laughter   it was veri scari   the bar code was a tremend product enhanc  and now we have the bar code without the employe   with the custom use the bar code   i understand that wal mart is push technolog that is go to make the bar code obsolet  which will be even more of a miracl   i think that  in addit to technolog  freer trade and outsourc are also contribut to fa  product growth  turn to the eleventh district  i can say with a lot more convict than i did at our last meet that the texa economi is well on it way to recoveri   on the basi of revis and more complet data  we feel more confid that our economi has enter a sustain period of growth   and it now appear that our employ growth slight outpac the averag in the nation rather than come in slight behind it  as we had thought recent   the improv perform is occur across a widen rang of sector   sinc the middl of       construct activ has been contribut to the district   s recoveri   singl famili build permit and residenti contract valu took off in mid      and remain at record level   the mexican economi seem to be do a littl better  too  which is help our district   domest drill has not respond much to higher oil and natur gas price  so we haven   t gotten a boost there   but gas drill activ is anticip to pick up this year   output has stabil in texa manufactur   the texa lead index continu to indic improv growth in the month ahead   broad speak  the district   s recoveri is under way on a par with the  book outlook for the nation
thank you  mr  chairman   i find it amus that ye day everyon deni be in the forecast busi and today there is a round of forecast    laughter
you heard me refer to mine as a guess
seventeen forecast and one guess   one of the key issu in the forecast  of cours  is the role of the output gap  and i have a few comment to make about that topic   the use of the output gap or the phillip curv relationship in forecast inflat was a subject at our two day meet in june        at that meet  art rolnick of the minneapoli fed present research by andrew atkeson and lee ohanian suggest that output gap measur were no better forecast of inflat than a simpl random walk assumpt that inflat next year will equal inflat this year   in particular  atkeson and ohanian show that the  book forecast of inflat  which make heavi use of the output gap concept  did no better than the random walk model for the period      to       given our current relianc on the output gap concept for project inflat  i thought it would be worthwhil to revisit this discuss briefli   in particular  i would like to call your attent to recent work by staff member at the board and at the feder reserv bank of boston   work by board staff member deb lindner summar in a memo last summer  which i   m sure she   d be glad to make avail  confirm the result regard the accuraci of  book forecast for the period      to      for inflat measur by the gdp deflat  howev  she also show that the atkeson   ohanian result regard the accuraci of  book forecast are high fragil on a number of dimens  notabl with respect to the sampl period employ and the measur of inflat use   use the gdp deflat to measur inflat and use real  e data onli  lindner show that when the atkeson   ohanian sampl period is extend back to       the  book forecast are    percent better in term of root mean squar error than the random walk altern   in the more recent           period   for which we  of cours  have the  book data but they are not yet public avail    book forecast of gdp deflat inflat are    percent better than the random walk benchmark   lindner show that the result are more dramat still when inflat is measur by the core cpi rather than by the gdp deflat   even for the atkeson   ohanian sampl period       to        book forecast for core cpi inflat are    percent better than the random walk altern   for the recent period             real  e  book forecast of core cpi inflat are a full    percent better than the random walk   these result are consist with those of sever publish paper  includ a well known paper by christina and   romer that show that the  book forecast of inflat have outperform privat sector forecast  the other recent studi to which i   d like to call your attent is an articl by boston fed economist michell barn and giovanni olivei in the most recent new england econom review   barn and olivei es  a piecewis  linear  phillip curv that allow the effect of the output gap on inflat to vari depend on how far away the economi is from potenti  they find littl relationship between unemploy and inflat in a region close to full employ but a robust relationship when the unemploy rate is relat far   which they defin as     percentag point   away from the natur rate   barn and olivei propos econom interpret of this find  but i would suggest a measur error interpret  becaus our measur of the nairu are necessarili quit noisi  when the output gap is small  the measur nois domin the signal   onli when the measur output gap is relat larg can we be reason sure that an actual output gap exist and  therefor  that inflat will respond  these result  by the way  are consist with my own inform investig of the predict power of the phillip curv   for the period from      to the present  i find that a veri simpl phillip curv specif   not out predict the random walk out of sampl except at  e when unemploy is at least   percentag point abov it averag for the previous six year   in short  output gap base forecast of inflat are probabl the most reliabl dure period of recess   and inde  inflat behav as the output gap theori would suggest in      and        look forward to       the unemploy rate is now less than   percentag point away from the es  valu of the nairu and from it recent averag   while a continu output gap may induc some further disinfl  from a statist point of view the random walk model may now be just as good   that is  follow presid  n  a good guess is that inflat in      will be the same as in       with your permiss  i   d like to add one thought on the    consider period    languag that we   ll be discuss later   a good rule of thumb is to tri to look as if you know what you   re do even if you   re not entir sure   we proper emphas that    consider period    refer to econom  e  not calendar  e  and we made our commit explicit condit on low inflat and resourc slack   we can debat whether or not the intermeet data  includ the decemb job report and veri low inflat number  suggest improv on those two dimens   howev  the bond market clear believ that they do not  as yield have fallen signific and the expect date of fed tighten has been push further into the futur  henc  as our condit is not perceiv to have been satisfi  we have no fig leaf for drop the    consider period    languag today   i would rather wait until march and the presumpt that we will see at least one good payrol number by then   in short  i   m look now more at long term credibl issu rather than short term flexibl and tactic issu   of cours  if we don   t see a strong payrol number by march  then we might be glad that we didn   t drop the languag   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my comment come at the end of our go around are go to be repetit of some of the view express earlier   so let me just summar my view   first  i agre with mani of the comment around the tabl that this recoveri has move into a new phase   we   ve move from the stage of the busi cycl where the economi was driven main by the consum to one where busi is now do it share in fo  the expans   have more balanc growth go forward give me much more confid that this recoveri has leg  and i want to focus my comment on the busi side today  we all know that this was a uniqu kind of cycl becaus it was driven more by the busi side than the consum side   while consum spend continu to grow through the whole recess  busi fix invest and inventori invest both fell and were the major engin for the slowdown that we saw   on the inventori side  we have now gone from a period  includ the first three quarter of       of fall inventori to a period where we expect inventori to have grown in the fourth quarter of last year and our forecast has strong inventori growth go forward   we   re begin to see in survey that busi are becom more comfort with inventori level   now  i fulli expect that inventori   sale ratio will continu to push the envelop lower  as busi firm continu to improv the procur and manag of their resourc   but i think busi are begin to express some confid that sale level are sustain and compani are at least begin to increas inventori to support the level of sale that they see come  on the capit spend side  equip and softwar expenditur also have turn around in this last period   again  in the earli part of this recess  we saw consum spend outpac equip and softwar spend   but in the second half of       we began to see a pickup in the pace of the latter   there was some growth in that sector in the second half of       but it realli wasn   t until after the iraqi war that we saw some forc in it expans   and as the survey that accompani the beig book show   and other survey reinforc this   busi now are begin to plan for increas equip spend in the come year  the other side of the busi invest pictur that is particular strong is the busi debt pictur   while household have not done a whole lot to mend their balanc sheet and they continu to run high debt level  busi clear have made substanti progress   the flow of fund data show with regard to the financ gap in the last two quarter that cash flow due to strong profit more than cover the capit expenditur that busi have undertaken  this should provid further leg to support the busi fix invest that would keep this recoveri on more balanc ground   so again  i think financi condit give us strong hope  as mani other member have point out  the one part of this balanc recoveri that is stretch our abil to understand is the employ stori becaus the data are give mix signal   while the payrol number continu to show veri disappoint result in light of how fast and how durabl spend has been  i believ that it   s due to product and that we are in the earli stage of improv busi confid that will bring peopl back to work   but i also am look a littl more at other indic of improv employ condit  name some of the data that come from other sourc  particular self employ incom   over the last year  the incom of peopl who are self employ have grown by    percent more than the growth in overal person incom   it may not be so much a formal busi expans as this self employ incom that is creat multipl leg for the recoveri and show up in the household but not the establish survey  the profit of major busi could be forc up nonfarm proprietor    incom for the same reason  or it could be that more peopl   either out of necess becaus they   ve been laid off in corpor restructur or becaus of lifestyl choic   are choos to be self employ   so  we may have a differ type of labor forc go forward   i think we   ll have to wait for more data to see what the end result is go to be   either way  i think this show that small busi tend to lead employ growth
you   re on  thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi
that   low is hand out   there is a zen koan   which is a medit riddl spell k o a n  not a relat of the governor   that hold that the most difficult act of all is to do noth well   this sen ent seem to appli to today   s meet   as can be seen in the top right panel of your first exhibit  market particip have scale back the path expect for the feder fund rate as much as    percentag point in       with the nomin fund rate seen open      at   percent   this path of the expect fund rate is consist with a probabilist assess that the median expect date of the start of tighten  seen as the peak of the dash line at the right  rose from around five month to about ten month  the solid line   as judg by option on money market futur  shown in the middl left by the red bar plot the impli probabl distribut that prevail ye day   investor are somewhat surer that the fund rate will trade around   percent six month henc than they were at the  e of the decemb meet  the dash line    while consider weight is place on the possibl that polici will firm  some weight   and more than at the last meet   is place on polici eas   in the latest survey of primari dealer conduct by the desk  the greatest number of respond judg   as shown at the middl right   that the onset of tighten would take place in the second half of this year  although a sizabl portion thought it would come sooner or later than that   as to the specif of the statement to be releas this afternoon  as shown in the bottom left panel just one primari dealer forese a chang in the assess of output risk  and onli a coupl more view the risk to inflat as anyth but balanc   in that regard  i would not view that consensus on balanc inflat risk as a chang in your assess   while the committe   s last statement indic a balanc slight skew toward lower rather than higher inflat  market particip most interpret this as    balanc      thus  the four respond call for    downsid    risk are more like predict that you will scale back the current set toward odd favor disinfl   the staff has interpret a good portion of the ralli in financi market over the intermeet period as result from a   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     downward shift in market expect toward our assumpt that polici tighten will not take place until next year   that there remain consider mass on the possibl of earlier tighten embed in financi market price impli that there is a potenti for the ralli to be extend as expect correct more to the  book baselin   whi market particip might still expect earlier and more signific firm is evid in the bottom right panel   a survey of economist at eight dealer indic that their outlook for inflat is decid less subdu than the staff   s  even with a growth forecast that is less robust than the staff   s   a distinct possibl is that mani in the market have a gloomier view of the prospect for the growth of aggreg suppli  a point that came out in the exchang between presid pool and dave     one of the more interest market develop over the intermeet period was the further declin in yield on treasuri index debt  seen in the top left panel of your second exhibit as the shift from the dot to the solid line   the real yield curv remain steepli upward slope  but this has prevail becaus both short  and longer term yield  shown in the top right panel  have move lower   these movement have two implic relev for set polici   for one  the low level of longer term tip yield may signal that real rate need to be veri low to encourag privat spend  suggest that forc of restraint still loom larg  includ an equiti premium on the high side of histor experi and a desir on the part of household to rais the save rate to someth more in line with histor norm   if the committe put much weight on such possibl  it might be inclin to eas polici  or at least to project a willing to do so  as is the subject of the middl left panel   in particular  a sens on your part that busi confid would remain impair might lead you to seek a polici offset   while the anecdot about spend are encourag  firm have yet to put their money where their mouth are when it come to new hire or addit to inventori stock   the recent sluggish perform of the monetari and credit aggreg  shown in the tabl at the bottom left  may rais your discomfort level on that score   anoth possibl is that we are see addit onc off increas in product that  as the simul in the  book and the extend scenario in the bluebook suggest  impli that the increas in aggreg suppli is actual outstrip that of aggreg demand  therebi generat addit resourc slack and put further downward pressur on inflat   even if you are satisfi that spend has settl onto a sustain and accept upward track  the recent sluggish read on inflat may be worrisom  either becaus they suggest that the level of inflat is alreadi on the low side of your prefer rang or that it may be pois to go lower   the second implic follow from the steep of the index debt yield curv  which could be taken as a measur of the gap between the current veri low real short term rate and it longer run equilibrium valu   if aggreg demand is sluggish  then such a configur would be appropri   howev  you might be concern that   as relat in the middl right panel  which make the case for polici firm   too much financi accommod is in place   if the committe was comfort with the level of the nomin fund rate at it decemb meet  it might believ that  as in the bottom right panel  the declin in longer term yield  the run up in share valu  and the depreci of the dollar sinc then warrant a polici offset  as presid   was mention   such concern would be more intens if you believ that the staff was a bit too op ist about the prospect for inflat to remain subdu   if event unfold similar to the    more inflat pressur    scenario in the bluebook  the committe would probabl want to begin firm some  soon   of cours  there is an obstacl in do so   the last sentenc of your past four statement held that polici could be kept accommod for a consider period  therebi constrain the flexibl of your action   but as relat in exhibit    such a constraint may not realli be bind on your current rate decis   in particular  the case for keep polici on hold could rest squar on your confid and satisfact with the general contour of the staff forecast  in which the economi is expect to grow brisk  resourc slack to narrow  and core pce inflat to remain at around it current level   inde  in the altern long run simul report in the bluebook and repeat in the bottom four panel  the nomin fund rate could remain at   percent until next year if the committe   s inflat goal were   percent  the black line  or until      if the goal were     percent  the blue line    given the limit of our abil to model the economi  such simul are realli onli for illustr purpos   your polici decis involv weigh a varieti of cost and benefit in a probabilist set   and in that regard    percent may look like an appropri level for the fund rate if you view the cost associ with a firmer polici   should you be wrong about aggreg demand expand vigor   as larg relat to those incur by run a littl easier polici and risk a more vigor expans if aggreg demand prove more robust than you now expect  committe member might be reassur in that regard from the fact that measur of longer term inflat expect  the top right panel  remain subdu as well as from the staff   s assess that resourc slack remain consider and that potenti output will be a target that is move rapid upward   howev  as oppos to the past few meet   given the buoyanc of financi market   you might be less confid about that tradeoff go forward  and therefor be more reluct to make promis about your futur action  which bring me to your final exhibit   at  e over the past six month  member have chaf at the constraint impos by the commit to keep polici accommod for a consider period  but by be explicit to the public about this self impos constraint  you did help limit the tendenc of market particip to build in unhelp aggress expect of polici firm  therebi keep financi condit accommod at a  e when you might have been concern about the efficaci of altern monetari polici action   in the event  the expans of aggreg demand did not falter  and there was no need to dig deeper into the toolkit of policymak   but the fact that insur was not need ex post   not impli that it was unwis to purchas it ex ant   three option for the word of the statement are laid out in the middl panel  for one  you could decid to retain the sentenc  which would be particular appeal if you were confid that the economi was like to evolv in a relat benign manner at an unchang fund rate for some  e  as in the staff forecast  that option would be even more appeal if you thought inflat was current on the low side of your desir outcom   in addit  as presid   and governor bernank have point out  the news on the condit element of the statement   inflat and slack   move in a way over the intermeet period that would seem to have extend the consider period   and that is how the market took those develop as well   given that most market particip appear to expect retent of the    consider period    sentenc  you might want more  e to prepar the way more for it delet  perhap use the opportun provid by the chairman   s upcom semiannu tes oni   as anoth possibl  you could drop the sentenc  as would be appropri if you either anticip tighten within the next few meet or were no longer confid that you could rule it out   if you view aggreg demand as grow along a self sustain track and were worri that inflat pressur might pick up  you might welcom a check on the extent of financi s ulus   even if the committe put low odd on tighten polici some  soon  it might view either delay need tighten or reneg on it commit should inflat pressur pick up as suffici damag to it credibl to warrant drop the sentenc preemptiv   but if you are concern that the reaction to drop the sentenc might be outsiz  a third option would be to soften the sentenc   in the bluebook  we suggest adopt the notion of    patienc    that the chairman introduc in a recent speech  which market particip would probabl take as impli that the committe view event as such that it could be gradual in firm polici   we suggest the sentenc      with inflat quit low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that it can be patient in adjust the veri accommod stanc of monetari polici      in the feedback i   ve gotten sinc the public of the bluebook  some member express concern that describ polici as veri accommod  which has not been a featur of previous statement  might be taken as too strong a signal that signific tighten would soon be under way   anoth possibl  as shown in the bottom panel  would be to have the committe character itself as    patient in remov it polici accommod      i would advis  howev  that you run the statement through a spell checker  someth i forgot to do   that conclud my prepar remark
ani grammat question    laughter
may i ask a question   if you look in the bluebook  the rang of es  of the real equilibrium rate has shift up substanti  which could suggest that we   re a lot farther away from the real equilibrium rate than we thought   this is especi true for the es  base on the frb us model   can you comment on that
well  you are right   the es  of r  have move up rather sizabl  as you can see in the bottom panel of chart   in the bluebook   the es  from frb us is up about   percentag point  mean that the gap between actual r and r  is bigger than you thought over the prior two year and that the current stanc of polici is more accommod than you thought   i think the revis relat to a coupl of thing   in part the benchmark revis and a rethink of save behavior but also that the es  of the risk premium in equiti price is higher
the revis princip has to do with a sort of respecif of the model rather than object chang in econom circumst   as   said  a signific chunk of that came about by how we were model the term structur premium   so i think that upward revis should not be taken as a chang in econom circumst   on the other hand  from your perspect of how far the rate is from what that model es  the equilibrium rate to be  the distanc is wider
it   s wider
i think the other thing to note when you look at that chart is that the band is wider as well   our uncertainti about r  is veri sizabl
presid broaddus  did you have a question   are there ani other question   if not  let me get start   i must say after listen to this roundtabl discuss that i find it hard to recal a degre of buoyanc like the one that come across today  unless i   m mistaken  committe member have not report on indic of a more unequivoc benign and posit econom outlook in a number of year   it sound as though we   re back in the late      s or perhap earli        that  i suspect  is a reflect of what is go on in the economi   inde  on the basi of both the beig book and today   s roundtabl discuss of region develop  the data that will be forthcom from offici agenc  if my experi serv me well  are go to come in surpris on the upsid   the outlook seem extraordinarili benign  and i   ll get to the reason whi that bother me short  profit margin are high though they may have peak and probabl will be edg downward   at this stage the usual lag between product growth and it effect on real compens is like to result in increas incom and thus provid a fair solid base for further growth in consum spend as the impact of earlier tax cut fade   the wealth effect  which has been a drag on spend for quit a long period of  e  is now back to neutral or possibl has turn posit  and in my view  the consum debt servic burden that one hear about from most of our privat sector colleagu are realli be overst   if we look  for exampl  at the debt servic burden on home mortgag  we find that a veri larg number of homeown have refinanc and have lock in a veri low coupon rate on averag   that suggest that most mortgag credit servic payment are go to be relat flat irrespect of what we do in the marketplac   and while we like are look at an increas in the consum credit part of household indebted  it is mortgag  of cours  that domin the overal household sector debt  on the busi side it has alreadi been mention that the financ gap has turn negat for the first  e in quit a signific period  and we   re see the implic of an increas in cash flow on capit invest   we   re see it in the anecdot inform on capit appropri and certain in the new order seri  which are continu improv  inventori invest has nowher to go but up   the institut of suppli manag report that purchas manag continu to view the inventori of their custom as except low   the implic is that new order will strengthen  and we   re even hear some discuss about a prospect pickup in commerci lend  that has not yet happen  but it would be anoth indic of a surg in inventori invest   the hous market is bound to soften at some point  but we   ve been say that for quit a long period of  e   in ani event  it   s hard to imagin that hous activ will contribut veri much in the way of strength to the expans   net export will probabl continu to be a small drag   inflat clear is stabl  i think the employ data are actual a good deal better than the latest payrol number suggest   if we look at the chang in employ as the differ between gross hire less gross separ  the gross separ seri as best we can judg is pretti much what we would expect given the gdp growth number that we have been look at   initi claim are down signific as are job loss   what   s happen is that new hire are well below expect in relat to econom growth  and i suspect that virtual all of that weak is mere a mirror imag of the increas in output per hour   inde  the question here is how much longer we can continu to get such rapid increas in output per hour   i do not deni that we may get addit quarter with   percent product growth rate  but if that goe on much longer  it will becom histor unpreced  an economi character by cut edg technolog such as in the unit state   not seem capabl of expand much fa  than   percent over the long run   inde  the level of intellig is not high enough to fo  appreci fa  growth over  e   as i like to ask the question  whi did it take so long to recogn the econom valu of silicon among other thing or to appreci the desir of reorgan corpor structur the way busi do now  busi firm could have done that fifti year ago  and they didn   t   the answer is that we   re just not smart enough  the reason that a lot of the emerg nation are abl to sustain fa  econom growth is that they are catch up   it   s not an intellig issu   so there is someth here that has to chang  or we realli are look at a new trend in product that  as i see it  is remark fundament   my impress of the employ data is that the probabl of a signific upward revis in the decemb number or a pop in the januari number is a good deal better than         and i would submit that  as of next week  we may   i say    may      be look at a somewhat differ overal pictur of the labor market  the question that we have to ask ourselv is  what could go wrong with this extraordinari scenario  which the board   s staff forecast extend through        it involv the most extraordinari and benign econom perform that i have observ in my busi life    but then again all this involv a product world that i   ve never perceiv or live in  and it may be more real  if i may put it that way  than we imagin  there are sever develop  howev  that i find worrisom   all have been mention in our discuss   the first is that yield spread continu to fall   as yield spread fall  we are in effect get an increment increas in risk take that is ad strength to the econom expans   and when we get down to the rate level at which everybodi is reach for yield  at some point the process stop and untoward thing happen   the troubl is  we don   t know what will happen except that at these low rate level there is a clear potenti for huge declin in the price of debt oblig such as baa rate or junk bond   to put it anoth way  the potenti snapback effect are larg   we are alway better off if equiti premium are moder to slight high or yield are moder to slight high becaus the vulner to substanti chang in market psycholog is then obvious less   in my view we are vulner at this stage to fair dramat chang in psycholog   we are undoubt pump veri consider liquid into the financi system   it is show up in the goldman sach and citicorp indic   we don   t see it in the money suppli number or some other standard indic  we   re see it in the asset price structur   that structur is not yet at a point where    bubbl    is the appropri word to describ it  but asset price is get to be veri aggress  i don   t know whether ani of you have notic that  while stock market price have been rise persist sinc march of last year  the rise in the last four or five week has been virtual straight up   that   s usual a sign that someth is go to chang and that the chang is usual not terribl help  i think we have to be wari of the possibl of a somewhat differ outcom than is suggest by the model we may be look at  the main issu here is what will happen in the event of a declin in the rate of growth in output per hour   in the context of the strength in aggreg demand that we are experienc  we should get a big surg in employ   we should also get  as the staff forecast suggest  the first signific increas in unit labor cost   it is not price that we ought to be focus on   it is not core pce  although i think that   s ul  where we   re go   the first sign of emerg troubl are like to be in the form of increas in unit labor cost  and with profit margin current at high level  those increas may be absorb for a while in weaker profit margin  which is probabl not a bad forecast at this stage  but there is also a difficult question regard what has caus the declin in inflat in recent year   it has been global and not confin to the unit state  and it cannot simpli be the consequ of monetari polici   i realiz that a lot of peopl think that world monetari polici has sudden gotten terrif and that it is the reason for the global declin in inflat   i   d love to believ that is true   i don   t believ it for four second   i think that what we   re look at is  to an import extent  the consequ of a major move toward deregul  the open up of market  and strong competit forc driven in larg part by technolog   i don   t know how long this veri signific downward pressur on price is go to last   with regard to deregul  i do know that the lower of trade barrier is come to a halt   all of the low  hang fruit involv in trade negoti has probabl been pick  and we will be veri fortun if we can just stabil the situat here without experienc a rise in protection  there has been a lot of discuss about the gap issu here  and i think for good reason as ben bernank and bill pool have indic   i might add that random walk   not mean that the inflat in      is necessarili go to be the same as in        that   s the expect valu  but the outcom could veri easili be     point higher under forese circumst   what i think we have to ask ourselv is which of the various altern for polici can give us the most signific troubl if we are wrong   in that regard my judgment is that the expect valu of inflat is in the area of it current level as far out as i can see   i also think that if we want to retain the    consider period    languag  we would be abl to do that for a signific period of  e   inde  i would guess that the most like forecast of when we will have to move is not too far from when the futur market is current anticip that move will occur   we need to rememb that we are talk veri larg about a move in a tighten direct   there is a small probabl that we might have to move rate lower should we sudden run into some deflationari problem   that in my judgment is a veri small probabl  but it is not zero  we are  therefor  essenti look at the question of do noth or tighten   in that regard  the most cost mistak would be for us to be constrain by the    consider period    phraseolog at a  e when inflationari pressur were build up fair rapid   if the probabl that we will have to drop the    consider period    refer is veri high  which i think it is  it   s not clear to me what we gain by wait   if  inde  the economi is as buoyant as the discuss around this tabl has just describ  then we are go to be press relat quick by market develop to start move   in that event  the futur bulg now ten month out would veri like start to move closer in  e   i don   t think that   s the most probabl outcom  but it is a suffici larg part of the probabl tail to suggest to me that we ought to drop the    consider period    languag and adopt some refer to    patienc     the latter would in my view give us greater leeway to take action   we probabl will also have to tack against the amount of liquid that we   re pump into the financi system   as governor   right mention  it   s probabl wise to call in the fire engin  it   s one thing to look at the degre of liquid after rate have been this low for this long and anoth to presum that the structur of the economi is go to stay this way if we continu to hold rate at this level for  say  anoth year and a half   so my view as far as polici is concern is that it would not be a bad thing if we refer in some way to     patienc    rather than to    consider period    in our press statement and the market respond in a negat way by move up fund rate futur and long term bond yield   unless what i   ve heard this morn about busi condit and busi sen ent is go to be dramat revers by the  e of the next meet  interest rate are too low   one may ask how that can be becaus a larg number of market particip are awar of all these develop and in the past they presum would have move market rate higher by now   i would suggest that there is a veri signific danger that they have listen to us    laughter   we have convinc them that the earlier simplist view of our respons to an upturn in econom growth and the associ risk of rise inflat   not appli under prevail circumst and will not lead us to tighten monetari polici in the near term  we have succeed in demonstr that such a view was now wrong   when we first argu that it was wrong  they didn   t believ us   we argu again  and they said     well  mayb      we continu to argu that they were wrong  and they now believ us  one implic in my judgment is that we can   t necessarili look  for exampl  at a chart show the one year matur for the ten year treasuri note nine year out  which is trade steadili at a littl over   percent  and say that the market   not expect a rise in inflat   that may be what the number tell us   what i don   t know is whether that chart is base on market factor or whether i   m look in a mirror   and i fear that it   s more the latter than the former   it is a terrif vote of confid in the system or what al broaddus like to call our credibl  but i   m not sure that we   re wise to sit here and allow that view to persist if inde that is the case  as a consequ and in line with our discuss at this and previous meet regard the desir of take gradual step  i think today is the day we should adjust our press statement and move to a refer to    patienc      i think the downsid risk to that chang are small   i do think the market will react    negat    as we use to say  but i   m not sure such a reaction would have negat implic  quit frank   if we were to retain the    consider period    word  i would hate to find us in the posit of see citicorp   s forecast of a         increas in januari employ number actual materi in next week   s announc   we would be in a veri uncomfort posit   if we go to    patienc     we will have full flexibl to sit for a year or to move in a coupl of month   i don   t think we   re go to want to do the latter  but i   d certain like to be in that posit should a rate increas becom necessari   that   s my view   who   d like to comment   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i end my previous present by say that i would be veri cautious about move from the veri accommod stanc we current have   rate are extrem low and obvious much lower than they have to be over the long run  but from a risk manag perspect  as you like to say  i think they are at an appropri level right now   i think that keep them low and move aggress if necessari make sens in a situat in which the risk on product  cost  and price are still point down  total inflat is like to fall   we haven   t seen ani close of the output gap   this is a situat in which we ought to be take our risk on the side of ensur a rapid return to full employ  the benefit in econom welfar would be consider   a small overshoot that push inflat up a littl would have essenti no cost and might even be desir  have said that  howev  i still support drop the    consider period    languag and substitut    patienc      the    consider period    phrase was insert as a form of unconvent polici when we were concern about deflat and the lower nomin bound  that   s not an issu anymor   rate will rise when we move to    patienc     but the expans is robust to a modest increas in rate   i think the rise will be modest sinc it is in the context of weak employ and low inflat   no one should anticip that the committe is contempl an earli tighten   i think retain the slight downward tilt in the inflat risk sentenc will help  and i believ that is your propos as well  there will never be a good  e to elimin the    consider period    phrase   but i think that do so today will be seen as a logic extens of what we did last  e in term of tie polici action to econom develop and to the word that you and other member have use in speech rather than as a sign of immedi action   you will have an opportun in your tes oni to expand on    patienc    and that theme   such a shift is not onli about restor our flexibl  with the economi strong  it might be a good  e to let the market react more to incom data   there are upsid risk to our forecast and to the path of rate despit the fact that my best guess is that rate won   t have to rise for a while   sit on expect in these circumst might not be stabil from the long run perspect   this could damp some of the interest rate risk take that we see in the market   i   m not sure it will do much about credit risk  which peopl also have express concern about   i think the lack of appreci of credit risk is a function of a veri  veri good econom outlook  and i hope that view  sn   t chang even with this chang in word   i would be cautious about use that argument   it strike me that it   s about second guess asset price level   it   s someth we didn   t do in the stock market run up in the      s  and i was pretti comfort with how we handl that   so i   d be a littl cautious about use monetari polici to tri to damp asset price movement
i certain agre with that   presid pool
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   if in nine day  when we get the employ report  it   s a weak one   i hope it   s not   much of the increas in interest rate that we will see this afternoon will go away  but we   ll be out from under the    consider period    languag   if we remov the    consider period    languag after we see a strong employ report  i think it will be taken as an announc of an action at the next meet  which is a move we might not want to make   remov the    consider period    phrase give us a lot of flexibl  and i think it   s the right way to go
thank you  mr  chairman   first off  i would endors mani of the dovish comment don start with    laughter   but in the mean  i   ll be reliev to drop the    consider period    languag   i think you   re right that we   re look at the mirror in that the market is listen to us   and that   s even more than normal nerv wrack   i would like to keep open the possibl of stay ahead of the curv  and i think this propos new languag   that   we   re not make a move  but as you point out  there   s a whole lot of uncertainti about various aspect of the economi  and we have to be readi to move if need be   so i support the rate recommend and the languag suggest
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   on the fund rate  i absolut agre with you   on the chang in languag  to the extent that it add to our flexibl i think it   s a good  e to make the chang   so i   m veri support
mr  chairman  i support both your recommend on the rate and the chang in the word   i have a question   at our last meet we vote on the exact word in the press releas   are we go to do that again
yes  we shall
mr  chairman  i support your recommend for the rate   my prefer on the sentenc would be somewhat differ from what you   re recommend   i would prefer to have you explain    consider period    in more detail in your tes oni   it will be deliv after the job report come out  so you will have the flexibl of give a clearer signal   if the job report is veri strong  as i think it will be  you would be in a posit to give a veri clear signal that the    consider period    will not last for long   we have condit it alreadi  and my prefer would be to get rid of the concept complet and not have it phase out by a refer to    patienc      if we have a sentenc in our statement that say the committe believ that it can be patient in remov it polici accommod  we will still have the problem of remov that sentenc some  in the futur   so my prefer would be to have you do the explain dure your tes oni and to get rid of the  e refer complet in the march statement
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend on the rate and on the chang in languag   i would reiter one point i   ve tri to make befor   appar unpersuas   that further disinfl or even a touch of deflat  if it   s stem from rapid product growth  is not necessarili a caus for concern
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support both element of your recommend   as i said in my earlier remark  i   m somewhat torn between two kind of risk  but as i think about the outlook for this year  it seem to me that the economi could unfold veri much the way it did in               and         in that period we start to get a better sens of the product stori and it implic that real equilibrium interest rate should rise   i want to be set up for that possibl   but i also want to be set up for the possibl that we won   t want to do anyth   given the degre of uncertainti that i feel about the appropri strategi for this year and mayb next year  i think gradual start to get to a posit of greater flexibl is without a doubt the right thing to do   nevertheless  i would not in ani sens want to suggest that we   re eager to move   so  keep the inflat balanc a littl to the downsid and leav the rate unchang while start to remov the    consider period    commit by modifi the languag strike me as the best way to give us the degre of flexibl we   ll need this year
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend on the rate  and i am glad to see that the old languag refer to a    consider period    is go away   i can support the recommend word chang to    patienc     but like presid   i would prefer not to use the    patienc    languag becaus we   ll have to get rid of that also   i   d feel much more comfort go back to not includ in the statement ani kind of forward commit of that sort   the fa  we can elimin both the    consider period    and the refer to    patienc    the better i will feel
i support both part of the propos   but i would echo what governor bie and     said   implicit with the introduct of the word    consider period    was the need at some point for an exit strategi   and in my view even with the term    patienc    we will need an exit strategi   but i agre with your unchang rate propos  and i think the chang in word to    patienc    is an improv from where we are now   so i support both part of your propos
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre that there   s no need to move polici now   the far more import issu right now is what we say about it   it has been clear from our discuss that risk are perceiv on both side of the  book forecast   growth and inflat   some believ we could be surpris on the upsid with both growth and inflat  other see suppli trend as possibl lead to declin inflat even in the face of what may otherwis be strong growth  this rais the question   and you  too  rais this issu in your comment   of where it is most cost to be wrong   i think some of us believ that be wrong on the inflat trend side   that is  lower inflat than we are project   would be more cost   i have question about that along the line that presid  n just suggest   i don   t believ that price decreas prompt by strong product creat a pernici form of deflat   on the other hand  if suppli contract fa  than we expect and both growth and inflat take off  there is way too much accommod in the pipelin   fiscal polici is accommod  monetari polici is accommod  and financi market are increas so   i agre with your posit that be wrong on that combin risk may in fact be more cost than be wrong on the inflat side  it is true that we have yet to see the kind of strong employ growth that we expect   but by modifi our languag i think we get a bit of flexibl for the  e when we do see that growth and a littl more space to move proactiv in the face of a strong grow economi  so i feel that it   s a good move on both side  i also think that it   s better for market to see us take sever step in remov the    consider period    languag becaus there seem to be some froth out there   it   s go to take a littl while to get rid of some of the bet that peopl have been make on how long the    consider period    will be   if we step back gradual  the market reaction will be less
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend on the rate and also on the chang in languag   i welcom the remov of the    consider period    refer becaus  as i said earlier  i would prefer to be silent on ani futur polici action that the committe might take   in that regard i would also have to agre with the concern that presid   and governor bie and olson rais regard the new languag   but i do support the chang at this point
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i do think the new languag is a nice recalibr of our signal   it is an exit strategi that is thought and gentl  and in that regard it make sens   when ned was talk about call in the fire truck  i was think that we had alreadi plan to do that  but we sent the gas truck in their place   laughter   we   ve had the nozzl on automat  and i think it   s  e that we put our hand back on the nozzl   in my view  your propos reword is a great signal  and i support it   thank you
i support your recommend on the rate and also on the word   in term of the  e  at some level i could make a case that the weak job report make it a littl easier for us to take this step becaus it  sn   t involv the anticip of an immedi interest rate movement   as to the concern about whether or not this is a big enough step  we need an exit strategi  and this is one   these are babi step  but as we know from our babi  the first step is the hardest   and move away from    consider period    is probabl a step well taken now   we can move over  e to where we want to be  and then we can final get rid of this conting languag   so i think it   s the right thing to do and the right  e to do it
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the phase out approach   i think it would be a mistak to drop this languag sudden   it would risk send a signal that a tighten is immin and creat an overreact in the financi market   so i support both your rate recommend and your languag recommend
so do i
so do i
mr  chairman  i had my hand up rather quick  although norm didn   t see it  becaus i was look forward to support what i thought would be don   s recommend to keep the    consider period    languag   but i can accept your recommend   this is a tough issu  and i think you made some veri persuas argument  especi at the end of your statement   but let me just comment veri quick   i agre that most of us are now much more op ist about the outlook  though i may not feel quit as strong as you do   but i do believ that the suppli side issu that don discuss and that are rais in the forecast are signific or at least not insignific   also  we talk a littl about downsid cost  as you know  there is a probabl and a cost   i agre that the probabl of further disinfl may be lower than a move in the opposit direct  but i think it   s import not to underes  the cost if in fact we do have further disinfl   we have the fund rate at   percent   i   m not confid that we are fulli prepar yet to deal with the kind of polici issu we would have to deal with if we got a bigger disinfl move than we now anticip   so if it were my call  i would leav the    consider period    languag in the statement a littl longer  but again it   s a close call  and i could certain accept your recommend
let   s get the draft statement distribut around the tabl   i assum everyon has had a chanc to read it   ani question  comment  or object  presid
i have no object to this press releas   i think it   s a realli good one  but i would just like to make a comment   mayb it   s becaus of the discuss ye day or the way the bluebook was line out or the present today  but as a member of this committe  i realli feel better about the process we   ve gone through over the last coupl of day as it relat to the statement than i have at ani  e in the last sever month   i think i   m come around to understand better how this communic is work   and i thought the process of work through portion of the statement in the bluebook was realli help   so despit my comment ye day about forti page involv three altern and so forth  i do want to compliment the staff on the job you did
if there are no further comment  i   ll ask the secretari to read the appropri languag
start with the direct word itself      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent     and with regard to the announc languag that the committe is vote on      the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal   the probabl of an unwelcom fall in inflat has diminish in recent month and now appear almost equal to that of a rise in inflat   with inflat quit low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that it can be patient in remov it polici accommod
would you call the roll
chairman  span vice chairman   governor bernank
am i vote on the statement or the statement and the polici action  yes yes
on both   thank you   yes
governor bie governor   governor   presid hoenig governor kohn presid   governor olson presid pianalto presid pool          yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
may i interject   in fact  the vice chair has an interest suggest  so let me call on him
the third sentenc in the second paragraph  which is the sentenc about labor market  now read in the propos text      although new hire remain subdu  other indic show an improv in the labor market      i was just go to suggest that we replac    show    with    suggest     speaker      yes  that   s a good idea
i think that would be use   unless anybodi disagre  let   s make that chang in the statement   secretari   s note  the chang in question was not in the paragraph of the statement cover by the forego vote
i have a note from michell about an issu that we should address
here is the issu that has come up   the press and peopl in the market know that we had a work group on communic and that we were go to discuss communic issu today  there was no secret as to what we would be talk about at this meet   the press i suspect will be interest in know what came out of the discuss today   so michell would like us to consid what we want her to say about that   she has some thought of what she might say   do you have other copi of this note that you have given me  michell
i can get other copi  that one is for you
okay   here are some thought about what michell might say   i think we all want to provid a consist messag in our public comment   one question is whether we are go to be make some chang   michell propos to say that the committe consid a rang of issu and has no new formul to announc  which is the case  and that we decid to adapt the statement gradual in respons to chang econom circumst   i think that is a fair assess  the second question is whether today   s discuss was relat to the studi of the work group mention in the octob minut   in lieu of tri to tie this to anyth  i think it is best simpli to say that we   ve been evalu and will continu to evalu communic in respons to chang circumst but announc that the work group has disband   that group  sn   t have more to do
whi don   t you just say it has complet it work
or has been shot    laughter   okay  it has complet it work  final  the hardest question is the one about releas the minut earlier   i think the safest thing is to say that we have made no decis on earli releas of the minut becaus  in fact  we haven   t yet made ani decis on that issu     anyon have ani strong object to that approach to deal with what i think is go to be a pretti frenzi interest in what happen
this is not an object but a question   what about the role of project   that issu has been in the press
oh  it has   i don   t recal that be in the press
governor bernank in his aba speech rais the possibl of increas the frequenc and the  e period   i don   t believ that peopl expect you to make a decis about that at this meet  but we may get some question about that   it would be a good idea for you to give me some guidanc
well  i think the answer is that we decid not to increas the frequenc or chang the  e when we releas the forecast   but i think we can say that our polici will continu to evolv as we go forward with regard to exact what we forecast   i think that   s a fair statement of where we came out   is anyon uncomfort with that
i would be inclin at least to emphas that we recogn the import of communic   my concern is that this sound as if we   re suggest that our work on communic issu has been conclud   i don   t have precis word to suggest  but i think we want to emphas that we will continu to look at issu of communic
i was about to rais the same issu   also miss here is a statement that we actual had a veri product discuss
in fact  we discuss this subject of communic for sever hour and came to a number of conclus   this make it sound as though we couldn   t agre on what page number we were deal with
well  i think just the opposit occur
it was actual a veri interest and use discuss about how we ought to communic   and i think we will continu as is necessari to be involv in endeavor to improv our communic as the economi and market chang
mr  chairman  the committe did vote on the exact word of the press statement   if you intend to do that in the futur  that is anoth piec of posit news that michell can relay   and that will be in the minut
we didn   t vote on the whole press statement
but you vote on the risk assess paragraph
we vote on that paragraph  yes
that strike me as veri much a question in intra committe dynam  not a question of extern communic   i   m not sure about the degre to which the market are focus on what get vote on and what  sn   t
well  at the last bond market associ meet   or rather the  e befor   the signific of not vote on that word was an issu that was rais
and i thought the way we handl that was to say that it just happen
after you work through all of these piec  can you make sure everyon of us get a script  if you will  from this so we know what   s out there and what isn   t about what we conclud
they   re go to come at us in differ direct  so i think it   s import that we have some uniform way of talk about what we have conclud
i would hope that we can get this draft redon and circul to everybodi relat quick
we did have a rather extens discuss ye day on whether or not we should parallel test  with some work involv on both the staff side and our side  the earlier releas of the minut just to see how it goe   i don   t have a singl problem with not tell anybodi that   in fact  my own view is that that   s the sensibl thing to do   let   s see how it feel to us first befor we go tell the world that   s what we   re do   there are  howev  differ opinion about how to deal with the outsid world among those of us at this tabl   should we have an understand about that
that   s whi we need that document
let   s ask michell her view
i think if we did announc that you were conduct a parallel test  you would be forc to releas the minut earli
that   s what i think
i would recommend that the committe not say anyth about parallel test and give yourselv an opportun to see how that process work   you could then choos whether or not to make a comment
i agre with that
this is one of those case where  onc we move in a direct  we cannot move back
and announc that would actual be a move in a direct   we don   t have the luxuri to say we   re contempl do someth like that and then say we made a decis not to be transpar
right   i think we learn our lesson about that last year   i realli do think that we need to agre not to talk about this becaus  if we talk about it  then parallel test  sn   t do us ani good
it is regrett i must say  but unfortun that is an accur statement
well  i presum that decis  which was taken ye day  is cover by all the secur and confidenti rule that cover all these kind of issu
i hope so
so that   s the point in tri to be clear about what we are say and what we   re not say
could i just rais anoth approach   mayb you won   t like it   but if michell get ask about this  could she just say that it will be dealt with in the minut
i don   t believ so   i think you all will experi some pressur from the media and the public   and i think this issu will come up in the chairman   s monetari polici report tes oni   report in the last week were say that they expect some announc at this meet on the conclus of your effort in this area   so i don   t think we have that luxuri
the next meet is march      dave   is avail to accept revis on your forecast up to the close of busi friday   let us go to lunch  end of meet
