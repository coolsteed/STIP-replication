thank you  mr  chairman   to start  i just want to updat peopl on what happen overnight in market   equiti rebound a bit in both asia and europ  and bond yield revers some of the declin that they saw on monday   the dollar was slight weaker against the yen and the euro but still in the rang that it establish   it did not go back below the low that it reach earli on monday   i would say that general the market    function was okay   the big issu was bank fund pressur in europ were evid for dollar fund   the fund rate bid as high as    percent  which is quit surpris on the eve of a meet in which we are like to reduc the feder fund rate target   term fund pressur  if you look at the one month or three month libor   oi spread  are basic unchang from monday  when they were up quit sharpli from last friday   befor talk about what market have been do over the six week sinc the last fomc meet  i   m go to talk a bit about the bear stearn situat   in my view  an old fashion bank run is what realli led to bear stearn   s demis   but in this case it wasn   t depositor line up to make withdraw  it was custom move their busi elsewher and investor    unwilling to roll over their collater loan to bear   the rapid of the bear stearn collaps has had signific contagion effect to the other major u s  broker   dealer for two reason   first  these firm also are depend on the repo market to financ a signific portion of their balanc    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     sheet   second  the    per share purchas price for bear stearn was a shock given the firm   s     per share price a week earlier and it state book valu of     per share at the end of the last fiscal year   the dispar between book valu and the purchas price caus investor to question the accuraci of invest bank    financi statement more general   the contrast in the behavior of invest bank equiti price versus credit default swap  cds  spread is reveal   share price fell sharpli  but the cds spread narrow a bit  indic a lower risk of default   for exampl  lehman   s stock price fell    percent  but it cds narrow by    basi point  to     basi point  ye day   this underscor the differ between the    per share buyout price for bear stearn   less valu than peopl thought   and the introduct of the primari dealer credit facil  pdcf    a reduct in the risk that a liquid problem could drive a firm into insolv   i have a few word about the pdcf  befor move to a discuss of market develop sinc the januari fomc meet   the pdcf should help to restor confid among repo investor   it essenti creat a tri parti repo custom of last resort   us   when investor have concern about the abil of a dealer to fund itself  they are reluct to roll over their own repo transact   the reason is the fear that the clear bank may not send their cash back the next morn when the overnight repo matur   this fear may not be misplac   if the clear bank is worri about whether investor will stay put  the clear bank may decid to keep the cash   in that case  the investor would be stuck with the secur that collater the repo transact   the pdcf should break that chain of worri by reassur the clear bank that the fed will be there as a lender to fund the repo transact   the repo investor are reassur that the clear bank will send back their cash the next day and thus are will to roll over their repo transact   at least that   s the theori   as note  the pdcf should provid some comfort to the counterparti of these firm that these firm will  in fact  be abl to fund their oblig   ye day  the major money market mutual fund complex did roll their outstand repo with the major invest bank   howev  the juri is still out on whether the pdcf will be suffici to stabil confid   high use of the pdcf would result in a larg increas in the amount of reserv ad to the bank system   i think it is import to go on record on that becaus  if that were to occur  over the short run the new york desk might not be abl to drain reserv suffici quick to keep the feder fund rate from trade extrem soft to the target   we will make all effort to make the    short run    as short as possibl  but realist  there is a good chanc that the feder fund rate could trade soft relat to the target  especi through the end of the current reserv mainten period   in fact  ye day we saw that  although it start the day quit firm  the fund rate crash at the end of the day  and the effect fed fund rate for the day was      percent   it depend  in larg part  on the volum of use of the pdcf   step back from develop of the past few day  recent week have been mark by rapid and  at  e  disord deleverag of financi hold within the global financi system   as i discuss last week  the most pernici part of this unwind has been the dynam of higher haircut  miss margin call  forc sell  lower price  higher volatil  and still higher haircut  with this dynam particular evid in the mortgag back secur market   i   ll be refer to the handout from here   over the past six week  we have survey a number of hedg fund and one reit about the haircut they face for financ differ type of collater   as shown in exhibit    the rise in haircut has been most pronounc in non agenc mortgag back secur   but even agenc mbs have seen a signific widen of haircut in recent week   the collater fund pressur have been particular evid for residenti mortgag back secur collater   this is due to sever factor includ veri unfavor fundament for hous  a high level of uncertainti about the ul  level of loss  and an overhang of product for sale  both current and prospect   in our discuss with market particip  unleverag player have been unwil to step in to buy    cheap    asset for sever reason   first  there are few sign that hous is close to a bottom   second  a signific amount of product sit in weak hand and  thus  could be dump on the market   third  this particular asset class has characterist that exacerb price volatil and  therefor  risk   for exampl  when spread widen and yield climb  prepay speed slow   this extend durat  when the yield curv is upward slope for longer matur  the rise in durat generat an increas in

includ the follow   first  a sharp widen in option adjust mortgag spread   as shown in exhibit    option adjust spread for conform fix rate mortgag have widen consider sinc the januari       fomc meet

new busi  becaus addit share issuanc at the current share price would lead to massiv dilut for exist sharehold   fifth  the yield level on mani mortgag back secur have climb signific abov the yield on

that all asset should repric   the risk adjust return from hold differ asset type should converg   recogn that the degre of leverag that is avail in market may differ across asset class in accord with diverg in price volatil  liquid  transpar  and other characterist   of cours  the notion of converg to equival risk adjust return is an equilibrium concept  and we are not in equilibrium   the event of the past week underscor that point   but there are plenti of other exampl of disequilibrium at work   for exampl  for mortgag back secur  the loss impli by the price of the aaa rate abx index tranch appear to be high even relat to the darkest macroeconom scenario   the municip bond market is also a good exampl of how market valuat can becom unusu depress when suppli increas rapid   then the valu inher in the secur becom broad known  this mobil new money  and risk adjust return come back down relat quick  term fund spread also indic greater stress within the financi system   as shown in exhibit   and     the spread between one month and three month libor    oi spread have widen sharpli in recent week  even befor bear stearn   s demis   we are sit today at    basi point for the one month libor   oi spread and    basi point for the three month libor   oi spread  about the same as ye day morn   as you are all awar  we have been activ in respond to the grow market illiquid   exhibit    illustr the result of the taf auction   note how proposit and the number of bidder have increas recent and the spread between the stop out rate and the oi rate has risen over the past few week   even befor the primari dealer credit facil was implement this weekend  we were in the middl of a histor transform in the feder reserv system   s balanc sheet  we are increas the suppli of treasuri held by the public  either outright or borrow  and reduc the suppli of more illiquid collater held by the privat sector   even exclud the uncertain impact of pdcf borrow  this shift will speed up notic over the next month or two   our current plan are to increas the size of the taf to      billion  scale up the singl tranch rp book to      billion  renew and increas the size of the foreign currenc swap with the ecb and the snb to     billion outstand  if fulli subscrib   and implement a      billion tslf program   exhibit    show how these program are like to chang the composit of the feder reserv   s soma portfolio   as can be seen  when all the current program are fulli phase in by may  treasuri hold will have shrunk to about    percent of the total portfolio  down from about    percent last juli   at the same  e that financi market have been under sever stress and the macroeconom growth outlook has deterior  the inflat news has also been disturb   sever market base indic are ad to investor    concern about the inflat outlook   first  commod price have increas sharpli   as shown in exhibit     the increas have been concentr in both energi and agricultur price   of cours  subsidi to s ul the product of ethanol from corn have been an import factor   by divert corn product to this purpos  the linkag between energi and grain price has been signific strengthen   second  the dollar  after a period of stabil that last from mid decemb into februari  has begun to weaken anew  exhibit       this has gotten consider attent in the press and abroad as the dollar has hit new low against the euro and has fallen below     against the yen   up to now  the declin has general been order  and the downward slope of the broad real trade weight dollar trajectori shown in exhibit    has not chang much   the foreign exchang market are clear veri skittish   in particular  there has been consider focus on china and the gulf cooper council  gcc  countri and their willing to maintain their peg against the dollar   for china  investor expect it crawl peg to move fa    as shown in exhibit     the chines yuan is now expect to appreci about    percent against the dollar over the next year  up from an   percent pace at the begin of the year   for the gcc countri  there is specul that some of these countri might decoupl from the dollar   howev  on a one year forward basi  market particip are current build in onli a coupl of percentag point of expect appreci   breakeven rate of inflat have continu to widen   as shown in exhibit     both the board staff   s and the barclay measur have broken out abov the rang evid in recent year   it is difficult to differenti how much this widen reflect a higher risk premium due to greater uncertainti about the inflat outlook versus higher expect inflat   but either way  it is probabl fair to say that inflat expect have becom less well anchor over the intermeet period   i will say  howev  that ye day breakeven rate of inflat came down veri sharpli   the move was    to    basi point   today  we are back in the rang we were in  but that is onli today   short term rate expect continu to move lower   as shown in exhibit     feder fund rate futur now anticip a trough in yield a bit below     percent   the yield impli by eurodollar futur price have also shift sharpli lower  as shown in exhibit      the trough in yield is expect to be reach in late summer or earli fall   our formal survey of primari dealer  which we normal show you  was conduct more than a week ago  and it is clear out of date  these exhibit are includ in the appendix to the handout    so let me focus on what the dealer    expect were as of ye day   they chang quit a bit over the past week  most dealer expect either a cut of    or     basi point   there are eight for     basi point  ten for    basi point  and two for    basi point   this compar with the slight more than     basi point built into the april feder fund rate contract  ye day the april fed fund contract impli a      percent effect fed fund rate for the month    there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the januari       fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
are there ani question for bill   vice chairman
may i say just one thing  mr  chairman   i want to point out that not onli has bill  along with a whole rang of peopl in new york and on the board staff  been work    hour a day for about five day  not onli did he write a terrif statement for the fomc just now  despit all of those other preoccup  but he sat with his wife through major surgeri on thursday and friday and with her as she recov   just a remark  terrif perform   i compliment him and just note that the burden he has been carri is consider even in comparison with the burden of so mani other
we thank you   presid
you   re still go to get question appar    laughter
i hope your wife is do well
she is do well  thank
first  just about breakeven   breakeven came down a lot ye day  but my understand is the five year  five year forward did not come down near as much   i think the figur i have are   basi point on the board   s measur and just    on new york   s measur   is that right
three is right on the board   s measur
i don   t have a number
i am concern about this late day soften problem with the primari dealer credit facil   everyth els we have done has been fair straightforward to  il  but becaus with this the quantiti is activ late in the day  the fund are just go to flow into the market   you know  you   re in the posit of predict someth with a huge varianc  the take up on that   now  this could unravel   if late day soft becom the norm  becaus of the arbitrag that   s avail to bank within the mainten period for hold reserv  this could erod our abil to hold the target   now  you peopl have been realli creativ about lend money  so i was wonder if mayb you could turn your creativ talent toward this problem   the thing that come to mind is some mechan for suck up fund at the end of the day on an autom basi   the natur thing would be for us to do sort of the opposit of repo late in the day for return the next morn   have you given that some thought   are you work on that
we have given it some thought  but the press of other busi  frank  has overwhelm us in the veri short run   but i think it is a good point   i would say two thing about the primari dealer credit facil and our abil to keep the fund rate at the target   one  if this work the way we hope it work  there are not go to be mani peopl show up at the primari dealer credit facil   we hope  over  e  none   becaus if we reassur the repo investor that they can roll their repo  we think that will domin come to the primari dealer credit facil   so if this work out the way we imagin it could work  the primari dealer credit facil use will be veri nomin  so we won   t have this issu   the second thing i would say is that  if peopl do come to the primari dealer credit facil and that lead to soft in the feder fund rate  by definit it will make the primari dealer credit facil less attract becaus  rememb  the primari dealer credit facil cost is tie to the target feder fund rate not to where the feder fund rate actual trade in the market   so that also will obviat some of that issu   but look  we haven   t done this befor   we have now had one day of experi   we   re go to have to work on the issu that you rais  and we   re go to have to see how it goe  frank
mr  chairman  could i just add one thing on this   i think the delicaci of the whole tri parti repo thing is hard to overst   for better or wors  most for wors  the full tri parti repo market general has spread over the last few year well beyond fed elig secur  and until we get to the other side of this  there is a lot of risk in that stuff on repo that goe further out the elig collater qualiti spectrum   even in a world where confid come back around the primari dealer as counterparti  the thing is there   s just some natur risk that that stuff is go to have to be financ in some other form  the hardest thing in this balanc now is to tri to do someth that  sn   t increas the incent so that we becom the counterparti to everybodi   we   re tri to make sure that it   s a backstop  but not a backstop that   s so attract that they come  and that   s go to be a veri hard line to walk   i say that  bill  becaus  just to lower expect  the necessari cost of the choic we   ve made is that we   re go to take the risk that we end up fund a bunch of stuff like that  and the commit to do that is the onli way this help   it is veri hard to know   again  even if confid hold  there is a reason probabl that some of that stuff is just go to have to move into differ form and other hand  and that could be a delic transit  particular if peopl read into that a broader loss of confid in this stuff  the other thing that   s import to point out is that it is just not realist to expect  even with the forc of the thing that we announc on sunday night  that we don   t still have a wave of deleverag ahead of us   there is still just a huge part of the world that know they are realli long on risk in a fragil environ and have not yet gotten to that point   with everyth that   s happen in market  their leverag is go up as the world goe against them  and they   re go to want to keep bring it down   that realli is go to work against the effect of all the thing we   re do   so just be prepar under the best of circumst for a sustain period of substanti fragil   but to underscor your point     we agre with your point and had been discuss in what we thought was a slight calmer world over the past two week exact that mix of thing  and we   ll be on it togeth and consult
yes  i just want to emphas that what we have done so far has had this separ about it  and except for the brief period in late august last year  it has not threaten our abil to manag the feder fund rate in a way we thought appropri for the whole economi   if we don   t cure this problem soon  it will becom visibl  it will becom well known  it will get price in  and to some extent it will overtak this committe   s deliber in the sens that it rather than our target rate will run the fed fund rate   i think that would be a fair danger outcom  and it just strike me that this is incred urgent
you make a good point  presid     presid
more mundan question  but by the way  bill  thank you for your servic  everybodi agre with what the vice chairman said  and i hope you took note of it   now that i   ve made you feel better  i have just a veri simpl question   on the taf  has the portion of foreign particip gone down
i don   t think there has realli been a shift   there   s no meaning shift
so it   s still pretti much where it was
it   s high   it will be interest now with the reintroduct of the swap  you know  the ecb will essenti have a noncompetit auction with us on this come monday  it will be interest to see how that affect the taf auction result
then the second question  bill  which i rais on the phone   i don   t rememb an answer   is it correct that german bund have now trade through treasuri in term of default risk  and is that meaning at all
i think there was a day that that might have happen  but i don   t realli know the answer to that   i   m not sure what that realli mean
that   s my question     it mean anyth
if that were to happen  i   m not sure what i would make of it   that would probabl reflect more what   s go on between differ countri in europ than to have anyth realli to do with us versus germani   that   s how i would interpret it
i   d like to commend the new york fed staff for what i know has been a veri difficult  e over the past week   my question is almost the opposit of presid     s  he rais some interest point  but i wonder   given the stigma issu involv and what   s just happen with bear stearn  you would think that borrow at ani kind of penalti rate for an invest bank  which arguabl is more suscept to run than the typic commerci bank  is someth that no one would take advantag of becaus of concern about stigma   is there ani evid that there   s more stigma   how are the primari dealer view this  and have they rais concern about confidenti and what would be disclos
yes  we have certain gotten question about how this will be disclos   now  there will be a disclosur   there will be a line item in the h     releas  but it will just show the total dollar amount extend through this facil   it is all bid through the new york district  so the total primari dealer borrow will be shown in that releas   the stigma issu is a legi  issu  and that is whi we have to be veri care about how we talk about this and take tremend care not to disclos who or even what type of institut use it  but at the end of the day  if you can   t fund your repo and your onli choic is to come to the pdcf  that is probabl what you are go to do  now  to come back to vice chairman     s point  i think that is exact right  though   the fact that to the extent that there is stigma  they are not go to want to come  and that is go to reinforc the deleverag process that is clear under way  as is the fact that they just saw bear stearn go from a troubl but viabl firm to a nonviabl firm in three day  the lesson from that for a lot of firm is go to be  oh  i need more liquid  i need to be less leverag  and that lesson  from what happen to bear stearn  isn   t go to go away
i   m under the impress   bill  you correct me   in the earn call from the invest bank today and tomorrow  the four remain are go to do all they can to destigmat this facil with answer to the effect that    we haven   t tap the facil yet  but we would be veri open to do it in the right circumst    and to provid some comfort that it is not stigmat in their own mind   for the strongest of those firm to say that should provid some halo for the rest   but to bill   s point  i think we will have to evalu that as we go
i think it is incumb upon me to point out that the board staff was also veri involv  and i mention   madigan  pat parkinson  scott alvarez  deborah bailey  and other as well   so it was veri much a joint effort   other question for bill  if not  we   ll turn to dave     oh  i am sorri  we need a vote to ratifi the open market oper
i move that we ratifi the open market oper
without object   thank you   now to dave
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know  we have made some veri larg chang to the econom project in this round   so larg  in fact  that we had to adjust the scale on the forecast evolut chart that we put in the back of the  book   obvious  the most notabl chang has been our adopt of the view that the economi is move into recess   i thought it would be help to briefli review this morn our reason for make that call at this  e   in addit  i will lay out the rational for the depth and durat of the weak in real activ that we are now project   final  i will explain whi  with so much more project slack in resourc util  inflat has  on averag  been revis up from our januari project   we have note on sever occas in the past few month that our decis to stick with a forecast in which the economi muddl through it current difficulti without fall into recess was a close call   well  over the intermeet period  we continu to accumul a bleak array of econom indic   consum confid move still lower and  in the case of the reuter michigan measur  drop to level last regist in the earli     s   region index of busi sen ent continu to deterior notic  with steep drop in the measur report for new york  chicago  and philadelphia   although the weak was less pronounc in the nation ism survey  the composit index for both manufactur and nonmanufactur were below    in februari   small busi   as report in the survey conduct by the nation feder of independ busi   and larger busi   as captur by the duke univers survey of chief financi offic   have turn veri pessimist   these indic taken alon  or even in limit combin  might not be that troubl   but when view as a whole and especi when taken in conjunct with the mani financi indic that have been flash recess signal for some  e  the pattern of recent read is disturb   furthermor  recess signal are no longer limit to survey and financi indic   privat payrol employ is es  to have drop         in februari  and there were sizabl downward revis to earlier month that left employ show declin in both decemb and januari   industri product drop     percent in februari  and manufactur ip fell     percent   the weak in industri product occur not onli in the seri in which we use product worker hour to es  output but also in seri where we have measur of physic product   for both payrol employ and industri product  diffus index indic that the weak has been spread wide across industri  this morn   s data on hous start also suggest littl end in sight to the ongo recess in hous   singl famili start fell more than     percent  to         unit  in februari  and permit drop a similar amount   both figur were veri close to our expect   multifamili start move up to         unit  but that figur follow some low figur late last year  and we wouldn   t attach much signal to that read   moreov  while i certain am not go to tri to predict what the nber will ul  do  a number of the seri consult by the date committe appear to have peak late last year or earli this year   at least on the current publish data   real person incom  industri product  payrol employ  and real manufactur and trade sale all have local peak some  between octob and januari   all told  the evid of a serious weaken of the economi appear to us more palpabl now than it did in januari   if one grant that the economi  from  e to  e  exhibit nonlinear behavior  then our forecast will need nonlinear chang to avoid make outsiz error   at this point  we   ve seen enough to make us think that recess is now more like than a period of weak growth  and that is what we are forecast   but have made that discontinu chang to our project  i want to impress upon the committe just how much this remain a forecast of recess  a lot has to happen that we haven   t seen yet to be confid of this call   inde  there are sever reason to be skeptic that we have transit into recess   one strike featur of sever survey of busi sen ent is that busi appear more pessimist about the overal econom pictur than they do about the prospect for their own firm   anoth cautionari read come from the motor vehicl sector   sale have soften notic over the past coupl of month  but they haven   t tumbl as they might have if the economi had alreadi move into recess   in labor market  initi claim for unemploy insur  which had risen earlier in the year  have level off of late  with the four week averag run about         in recent week   that level of claim is not yet high enough to clear signal the declin in privat payrol of between         and         that we expect will be occur this spring   final  order and shipment for nondefens capit good flatten out late last year but as yet have not shown ani sign of serious deterior  which will be necessari short if our project downturn in capit spend is to come to pass   for now  we are will to treat these read as suggest that there is some upsid risk to our forecast of a modest recess   one of the key featur of past recess  as view through the len of our model  is a tendenc to observ larg negat residu that are correl across the major spend equat   we have built that featur into this project   but this also remain a forecast becaus a pattern of correl negat residu is not yet clear evid in the data   to gain some perspect on how the forecast would have look had we not built in these recess effect  we show an altern scenario in the  book that effect remov these residu   the result is a forecast that is similar to  though in the near term a bit weaker than  the one we show in the januari  book larg becaus of higher oil price and weaker hous price  but we have mark down the baselin forecast consider more than would be suggest by these factor alon   to be sure  we may have overreact by move to a recess call   but that possibl is counterbalanc by some clear downsid risk even relat to this more pessimist forecast   the recess that we are forecast is relat shallow   in our forecast  the depth of the downturn is limit in the near term by tax rebat  which provid a substanti boost to dispos incom start in may   this should help to buffer some of the drag on spend that is anticip to result from declin employ  higher oil price  and weaker household net worth   moreov  domest product benefit appreci from the past and prospect declin in the exchang valu of the dollar and the continu growth in the economi of our major trade partner   factor that help to provid a sizabl boost to net export this year and next  these influenc result in a small upturn in real gdp in the second half  and the unemploy rate rise onli    percentag point  to    percent   that is a small increas in unemploy even by the standard of the past two mild recess   as i   ve note  well  e macro polici and substanti support from the extern sector lead us to expect that this  e will be differ and that the unemploy rate will rise less than usual   but you should alway be wari of forecast that expect this  e to be differ   anoth notabl featur of our forecast is that  although the project downturn in activ is shallow  the period of weak aggreg demand is lengthi  especi given the assum low level of the real fund rate   for those of you so inclin  this might be a good  e to check your blackberri for e mail or to get in a coupl of game of b break becaus i can assur you that i will not be offer much in the way of scientif insight on this issu   in our forecast  the growth of real gdp pick up next year for sever reason   hous demand final bottom out  and accord  construct activ begin to arrest it steep declin   in addit  given our forecast of a flatten of crude price  the drag from higher oil price on consum spend is expect to wane next year   import  we also assum that there will be a gradual lift of the restraint on spend as financi stress abat  the last influenc is now assum to lift more gradual than in our previous forecast and  along with an intensifi drag from lower hous price  account for much of the linger weak in this project   correspond  the unemploy rate fall to onli     percent at the end of        in our previous forecast  we had the effect of financi stress fade over this year  on the thought that  as it becam appar that the economi would avoid recess and that hous was bottom out  risk spread would narrow  credit condit would loosen up  and spend restraint would eas   obvious  in our current forecast  the economi experi recess this year  and hous  sn   t show much sign of stabil until next year  as a consequ  we don   t begin to phase out the unusu restraint on spend result from financi stress until next year   this aspect of our forecast  even more than other  is larg guesswork   we just don   t have much in the way of histor experi on which to calibr the project   in recognit of that uncertainti  we includ in the  book two altern simul   in the    fa  recoveri    alt sim  we assum a stabil of hous later this year and a revers of most risk spread by the middl of next year  under these assumpt  growth pick up more notic  and a tighten of monetari polici is requir next year   altern  one cannot rule out some further deterior in financi condit and an even longer period of subpar econom perform   in the    greater hous correct with more financi fallout    scenario  a steeper declin in home price result in a deeper contract in construct activ  a further widen of risk spread  tighter lend condit  and an addit deterior in household and busi sen ent   although this scenario might sound extrem  it onli push the outer edg of the    percent confid interv for real gdp and unemploy   it is also sober to recogn that this simul result in a nomin fund rate path that skirt the zero bound  the bottom line   we know with probabl   that the baselin forecast will be wrong   but with the downward adjust that we have made to this forecast  we feel that there is signific probabl mass on both side of our project   despit mark down our forecast of real activ substanti this round  our project of consum price inflat  both headlin and core  has been revis up in      and is larg unchang in        those revis reflect margin wors news on the incom price data as well as further deterior in some of the key determin of price inflat   as for the news  our read of the recent price figur is that core pce price probabl did not rise as rapid in januari as is current publish but that they like rose fa  in februari than might be suggest by a cursori examin of last friday   s cpi report   as we note in the  book  bar offset influenc  we believ that the current report increas in core pce price of     percent in januari will be revis down to     percent after the bea incorpor the low read on medic care servic that was shown in the januari ppi   as for februari  the core cpi be unchang was a favor develop   but a sizabl fraction of the good news was in rent and medic care  rent receiv a much smaller weight in pce price than in the cpi and  as i just note  the pce price index use the ppi  not the cpi  for measur medic cost   incorpor medic care price from this morn   s ppi releas suggest to us that core pce price rose about      in februari   all told  we are project an increas in core pce price of     percent at an annual rate in the first quarter      percentag point more than in januari   we have also incorpor into this forecast a further jump in the cost of crude oil and higher import price associ with the weaker dollar and more rapid gain in commod price   moreov  we have read the survey measur and tip spread as suggest that there may have been some deterior in inflat expect of late   taken togeth  these less favor develop more than offset the project emerg of some slack in resourc util   as a consequ  we are  now project core pce price to rise     percent this year  up   percentag point from our januari project   despit an unemploy rate that run near    percentag point abov our previous forecast  we have left unrevis our project of core pce price in      at     percent   higher food and energi price have result in a further upward revis to total pce price inflat of near   percentag point  to     percent  in        total pce price inflat for      is unrevis at     percent   befor turn the floor over to nathan  i want to let the committe know that the three research divis are undertak a review of the structur of our polici

we would have expect   total foreign real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of last year step down to     percent from the rapid     percent rate that had prevail through the previous three quarter  as the pace of activ slow in both the advanc economi and the emerg market economi   this fourth quarter out turn  howev  was about    percentag point stronger than we had expect  reflect an upsid surpris

singapor  and taiwan move up in januari  and domest consumpt in the asean countri has remain solid   taken togeth  these data seem to indic that growth abroad has cool but has not stall   our forecast thus seek to balanc sever offset consider   on the one hand  the project for u s  growth this year has been cut by a sizabl     percentag point  this has particular stark implic for countri like canada  mexico  and some in emerg asia that have close trade tie with the unit state   the further deterior in global financi condit should also weigh on activ abroad   on the other hand  the incom data suggest that the foreign economi are not yet follow the unit state into recess  and the red hot commod market also lead us to believ that activ is hold up in some corner of the world   weigh these factor  we have cut our forecast for total foreign growth in      to     percent  down from     percent in the last  book  with much of this markdown reflect softer growth in canada and mexico   our project for emerg asia have also been reduc  but we see these economi still expand at a moder pace   clear  there are both upsid and downsid risk around this forecast   on the downsid  the advers spillov from the u s  slowdown and continu financi stress may be more sever and more broad felt than we envis   on the upsid  the appar resili in foreign demand to date suggest the possibl that growth abroad may hold up better than we now expect   in       foreign growth is project to rebound to     percent  in line with the expect eas of global financi stress and econom recoveri in the unit state   with commod price increas sharpli  foreign inflat has continu to rise   notabl  in the euro area     month headlin consum price inflat climb to     percent in februari  well abov the ecb   s

 to date  the ecb has held it polici rate firm at   percent  cite the level of headlin inflat  possibl second round effect from commod price increas  and risk from ongo wage negoti   given these

reduc it polici rate    basi point sinc the fall   and we expect anoth    basi point by year end   in an effort to cushion the economi against financi headwind and slow in the hous and commerci real

further monetari s ulus is like to be requir      thus we see anoth    basi point of eas in the second quarter   as note earlier  the dollar has depreci more than   percent against the major currenc sinc mid februari as the widen diverg between the path of polici rate in the unit state and other industri countri  particular the euro area  has weigh on the dollar   as a relat factor  the tone of the recent u s  econom data has been much softer than for most other advanc economi   in broad real term  the path of the dollar in our current forecast is about     percent weaker than in the januari  book   go forward  our forecast call for the broad real dollar to declin at a   percent annual rate  with this depreci expect to come disproportion against the currenc of the emerg market economi   i conclud with a few word regard the perform of the u s  extern sector   the januari trade data show export continu to rise at a healthi pace while nonpetroleum import contract   import of consum good were particular soft   for      as whole  we now expect the extern sector to contribut a substanti     percentag point to growth  about twice as much as in our previous forecast   to be sure  much of this larger arithmet contribut from net export reflect a contract in import caus by the slowdown in u s  demand   howev  part of the reduct in import is also due to the declin in the dollar   export this year are seen to grow at a pace of near   percent  just a touch less than in the last  book  as the effect of the weaker dollar almost offset the markdown in foreign growth   in       import rebound as the u s  economi recov  and the posit contribut from net export accord shrink to about  …  percentag point  final  ye day the bea report that the current account deficit narrow to     percent of gdp in the fourth quarter  it smallest share of gdp sinc        we had expect the rise in oil price to drive up the deficit  but this was more than offset by a mark improv in net invest incom  part as earn receiv by foreign on their invest in the u s  financi sector declin  reflect the effect of the ongo financi turmoil   we will now be happi to take your question
thank you   question   presid
if i put the two comment togeth  one of the messag i receiv is that we are less confid in the linkag between u s  slow growth and rest of world slow growth than we or convent wisdom was befor   you mention  in the discuss of the intern side  the downsid and upsid on growth   there is also a downsid and an upsid on inflat   i just want to ask about our thought on this from a staff standpoint   clear  the downsid price pressur come from our hous crisi and all of the other relat issu and  i presum  from the build of slack and rise unemploy and  therefor  restrain wage demand   that is the domest side   at the same  e  i think i hear you say that on the global side it is not happen in that fashion elsewher   the emerg countri  particular china  are still grow at a rapid pace   howev  it may becom somewhat slower   my question is  do we feel that there is as much an offset to our domest disinflationari  deflationari forc as we thought befor   are these global demand pull inflationari forc basic mitig our expect of the contractionari domest forc   how has your opinion   the two of you   chang in the intermeet period   i hope that is a clear question  but i think you get the point that i am make
over the intermeet period we have live through an experi that manifest the upsid risk to our inflat forecast  and i would indic that  with the   percentag point markup to headlin foreign inflat in      in our forecast  the vast major of that is a reflect of these red hot commod market  which then press the question to us  well  what is go on there   certain  in the case of the demand in these market  by now i would have expect to have seen some attenu or a bit of soften   realli  it seem to be quit the opposit   the demand sinc the first of the year has acceler   some other factor are at work as well   idiosyncrat suppli stori  electr outag that made it harder to smelt aluminum and copper  and so on   so there are some suppli factor as well   the demand side seem to be import  and to the extent that demand remain strong  i am not sure where these commod price are go to top out   the futur path is a reason guess at sort of the balanc of suppli and demand   there is also some upward pressur on these price from the depreci of the dollar   but to the extent that commod price move up  i would say that we will probabl be mark up our forecast of foreign inflat next  e  just a broader comment on the linkag between the u s  and the foreign economi   again  i was surpris at the strength of demand in these commod market   i would have expect by this point to have seen more mark evid of slow in the foreign economi  so we have mark down our forecast for      in line with these prospect develop  the further slow in the unit state  and the financi stress   but we didn   t mark down our forecast veri much  just a tenth or two  and main in canada in q   and the data that we have in hand are not point to a dramat slow   we are expect more of that to come through in the second and the third quarter
presid    i will just basic reiter what i said earlier and amplifi mani of the same thing that nathan just said in term of the influenc on our headlin forecast   we revis up   percentag point as well  and that realli is come from higher energi price  higher food price  and higher commod price  all of which we think are alreadi show through to some extent and we expect to continu to show through to headlin inflat  despit the fact that we run with a much larger output gap in this forecast  we haven   t revis down our forecast for      becaus of the linger effect of the run up in commod price that we are expect   as i indic  we think there has probabl been some small deterior in inflat expect as well
thank you veri much   thank you  mr  chairman
dave  my question is basic about the influenc of the financi stress on the outlook   i was talk to an offici at the bank of canada last week  and she had an intrigu calibr by which she said that  sinc last august  they thought that financi stress for canada was worth about    basi point of restraint at the outset and now they thought it was more like    basi point for their economi  which is do quit well   i guess the imposs question is  have you thought about that type of calcul and how it influenc the way we think about interest rate for your forecast   the way that i am think about this and that presid   and other have thought about this is that we are tri to separ the effect of standard monetari polici and of the innov polici   ani separ that affect financi market direct help us think about the more normal calibr of polici   but  of cours  with financi stress we have these add on effect   so that is whi i think that would be interest
we have thought about that  and the difficulti at this point is tri to identifi the truli exogen featur of the current financi stress that is oper over and beyond the channel that are normal incorpor in our model   our model  obvious  have asset price  such as hous price and stock price  and have interest rate and interest rate spread  and as those thing have chang  we have been abl to incorpor them into our forecast   but then  over and abov that  we think that the model  sn   t realli captur a lot of the credit avail channel   there is a lot more stress in the market beyond that captur by the interest rate in our model   so take this with more than a grain of salt  we think rough   percentag point on the level of gdp this year   over and beyond the effect of lower hous price  the weaker stock market  and the higher interest rate spread   that basic linger on into next year and onli then begin to gradual phase out   that is an import factor as to whi this forecast is base on such a low real feder fund rate   obvious  if you came to a differ conclus either about the depth of what is like to be occur in the next few month in term of the restraint   not just from these financi stress condit but also from our call that we are move into a recess   or about the way that restraint fade out over the forecast  that would have a huge influenc on the project path for the fund rate   so it is import to recogn that this forecast is condit on one in which those effect linger quit signific into next year
other question   if not  we will begin our econom go round   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i would talk a bit about some event in our region that i think have global implic   that is to say  i will talk a bit about agricultur   you have heard other here this morn talk about some of the price movement  and i think it is worth perhap spend a few minut on their effect   first of all  agricultur commod price have surg to record high  driven by obvious strong demand  lean suppli  and a weak dollar   sinc the fall of       winter wheat price have doubl  and corn and soybean price have risen about    percent  to record high   rise crop price are boost farm incom   in real term  u s  net farm incom is expect to climb to the second highest level on record  trail onli       when abrupt sale of u s  wheat to russia push up farm incom  an emerg concern is the grow disarray in futur market for agricultur commod caus by a surg in invest by index and hedg fund go forward   recent report indic that hedg and index fund invest in futur market for corn  soybean  and wheat rose from     billion in januari      to     billion this past januari   earli this month  index fund held more than    percent of the long posit on wheat contract on the chicago board of trade   at this rapid pace of invest   sinc the begin of this year averag    billion per week   the fund would own the nation   s entir      corn  wheat  and soybean crop by earli        now  that is obvious theoret  but that is how much money is go into this market   the result market disarray is constrain the tradit use of commod futur to hedg market risk   grain elev  which use futur to hedg their contract to purchas crop from produc for futur deliveri  are face much larger than normal margin call on their futur posit   some report indic that lender are begin to restrict their fund of elev hedg   as a result  an increas number of elev are limit their contract for crop purchas to no more than sixti day in advanc of the deliveri instead of the normal one to two year  now  this surg in crop price and farm incom is push up farmland valu  accord to our bank   s agricultur credit survey in the fourth quarter of       non irrig cropland valu jump    percent over      level  with strong gain also report in irrig cropland and ranchland   our director and other contact report a further strong gain sinc the begin of the year  and some have report as much as a    percent increas in the first quarter alon   adjust for inflat  the averag price of farmland across the nation now top the earli     s peak  which immedi preced the plung in the earli to mid     s  to date  crop product budget suggest that the recent run up in farmland valu is support by current revenu from crop product   howev  farm input cost have also risen sharpli  driven by higher energi cost  suggest that a drop in crop price could quick erod farm cash flow and undermin these valu   district banker report a surg in farm capit spend   in februari  sale of four wheel major equip rose    percent abov      level  and combin harvest sale were up    percent   farm equip price have risen sharpli  and our director and other contact report that some equip dealer are ration purchas among their custom   in the past month  anecdot report from district contact indic that nonfarm investor have boost their farmland purchas   our contact at a nation farm manag compani base in omaha state that the number of inquiri for farmland purchas by corpor interest has jump signific recent   similar  one of our director report that a hedg fund with asset of more than    billion is expect to invest      million in cropland from texa and nebraska   this fund recent purchas near    squar mile of corn acreag in we n nebraska  now  we continu to watch for sign of rise leverag  but to date farm debt level have risen modest onli  and agricultur bank seem to remain healthi   banker report continu use of cash to financ farmland purchas  but i would note that leverag is be brought into the pictur  and i think that will acceler as opportun and greed have their way   total farm lend in the district bank has increas a modest    percent over the past four year  with most of that growth be in farm real estat lend   but district bank examin and respond to our survey report that the farm credit system was be more aggress in fund farm real estat transact   real estat mortgag loan held by the farm credit system rose about    percent in        asset qualiti at our ag bank remain  at this point  solid  noncurr asset   all asset  not just farm loan   at ag bank are up onli slight from a year ago and remain well below histor averag   net loan loss are still veri low   earn have remain solid primarili becaus of cost control and veri low loss provis   i am veri pleas  but i will tell you that  go forward  in term of the survey with the kind of pressur and price appreci go on  i think the push for leverag is just begin  at the nation level  in term of the  book  everi indic is that the economi is slow   whether it is recess or veri slow growth is a matter of degre  but i think our project are in the same direct as the  book  turn to the inflat outlook  i am concern  as i have said befor  about the upsid risk to inflat   though i certain agre with other around the tabl that weaker econom activ may put some downward pressur on good price inflat  i think we can also agre that a number of factor could push inflat higher  includ rapid rise commod price worldwid and a weaker dollar   as discuss in the bluebook  there is some indic that inflat expect may be move higher as well   as i have indic befor  i am increas concern that  in our need to respond to sign of econom weak  we risk lose our hard won credibl on inflat   for the past four year  core pce inflat has averag about     percent  consider abov the number that this committe has put forward in it long term project   frank  i do not think that mani peopl outsid this room think that this committe can deliv the longer run project that we have put forward   i don   t think that we can keep inflat expect anchor onli by talk if actual inflat rise further in the month ahead and we continu to eas polici in a rise inflationari environ  this is someth that we need to keep in mind as we discuss our polici option today   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the econom data have continu to indic a veri weak economi and that  in all likelihood  we have enter a recess   like the  book  my outlook is particular influenc by indic of signific weaker labor market and a hous market that is as yet show no sign of reach bottom   privat payrol employ fell         in februari  and the sum of the downward revis in decemb and januari was about the same magnitud   not onli have we had three month of declin privat payrol employ  but also the declin has been widespread across most industri   the blue chip econom forecast  the  book forecast  and our own forecast have the unemploy rate peak somewher between     and   percent   while most analyst are in the process of downgrad their forecast from skirt to actual have a mild recess  the risk of a more sever downturn is uncomfort high  a major determin of the sever of a downturn will be the hous market   becaus recent develop in the hous market are so differ from most postwar histori  i remain veri concern that the effect of substanti declin in hous price will be difficult to captur in statist model base on histor data   the case shiller index indic that hous price fell approxim    percent in       and a declin of similar magnitud this year would mean that mani home purchas in the past sever year are in a negat equiti posit   elev foreclosur and larg inventori of unsold properti are provid abund opportun to purchas home at heavili discount price financ at low interest rate by histor standard   but widespread concern that price will continu to fall have result in mani prospect buyer defer purchas decis   to date  the hous market has been quit weak  despit relat low unemploy rate   but if our forecast are right  job loss this year are like to exert a signific further drag on hous price as rise unemploy rate forc addit home sale or foreclosur   fall hous price are like to have a collater impact on consumpt   perhap reflect this risk  the credit default swap rate on retail have been rise  and we are increas hear of retail that are close store or postpon expans   retail  like consum  are awar that high oil price  increas job loss  and loss of wealth in the stock and hous market are not like to be conduc to robust consumpt  exacerb the negat econom news is the continu deterior in financi market   credit spread have widen signific over the past six week  with mani spread more than    basi point higher than at the last meet   hedg fund and money manag that i talk to are acut awar of the counterparti risk and are veri care manag their collater   most firm with excess collater are in the process of manag that posit down  the deleverag that is go on has reduc the willing of bank and other financi intermediari to financ their posit   in addit  as concern with liquid rise  we are onc again see renew pressur on the asset back commerci paper market   the rise in credit default swap for compani like washington mutual and lehman brother indic increas concern for the solvenc of other larg financi institut with larg exposur to mortgag  the potenti for a further episod of financi market dysfunct and for run on addit financi firm is signific   my primari concern at this  e is that we could suffer a sever recess   fall collater valu and impair financi institut can signific exacerb econom downturn  some indic of inflat are higher than we want  but dure previous recess  commod price and inflat rate fell   given my forecast for the econom outlook  i expect substanti excess capac to signific reduc inflationari pressur go forward  and i see littl evid that higher commod price are caus upward pressur on wage and salari
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc we met at the end of januari  there has been an utter dearth of good news concern both the real and the financi side of the economi   on the real side  i just can   t recal ani intermeet period in which near everi singl data point was dismal   on the financi side  there have been occasion good day  but the net chang over the intermeet period have been negat across the board in both the equiti and the credit market  so financi condit have unambigu tighten   these develop are familiar to all of us  and i won   t take up  e to review the specif  my overal sens at this point is that the effect of the sever and prolong hous downturn  the financi market implos  and the price increas for oil and other commod have now spread to most corner of the economi  includ the major segment of consumpt and busi fix invest   export repres about the onli sourc of strength  and while that is welcom  i must say that the economi is pretti clear in troubl when the contribut to real gdp growth from export exceed overal real gdp growth  as may well happen this year  the bottom line is that  like near everyon els  i have downgrad my econom outlook substanti   assum that the stanc of polici is eas substanti at this meet and addit by midyear  i see the economi as essenti in recess dure the first half befor pick up somewhat in the second becaus of the effect of monetari and fiscal polici  howev  i certain see larg downsid risk to my forecast  and i think the  book   s view that recessionari nonlinear have alreadi set in seem to me to be within a reason rang of outcom   in fact  we have also been look at month data on coincid busi cycl indic  and that examin suggest to us that the nber may well date the begin of the recess to last novemb  the prospect of this outcom has been made more palpabl for me by the rather sudden increas in the frequenc and intens of pretti dire comment i am hear from my contact  first  i have heard widespread report of reduct in capit spend plan due to caution or pessim regard econom growth   for exampl  a larg manufactur and retail of outdoor sport equip report that technolog and infrastructur spend has been cut by at least a third in        in anoth exampl  a larg player in commerci real estat in the san francisco bay area describ how project are be cancel becaus the financ spigot has been shut   inde  nonresidenti construct is one sector where i think the  book may be too op ist   i envis grow weak there  second  my retail contact suggest that spend has soften further in the wake of a weak holiday season  and expect are for continu weak at least through spring   for exampl  the ceo of a larg high end nation retail oper report that for januari and februari he has seen declin in sale that haven   t been experienc for almost fifteen year  these declin have creat tremend pressur on inventori level requir larg markdown with negat effect on profit   vendor are reel from the cancel of order  the return of good  and sharp reduct in new order  third  a number of contact have provid comment reinforc the view that a signific credit crunch is under way   slight more than half of the comment receiv on this topic indic that credit standard have tighten signific in recent month   in one exampl  the ceo of a bank in my district report that sever of the nation   s largest mortgag lender have suspend withdraw from open home equiti line out of concern that borrow could now owe more than their home are worth   as a final anecdot  a banker in my district who lend to wineri note that high end boutiqu produc face a distinct soften market for their product  although sale of cheap wine are soar    laughter  now let me turn to inflat and inflat expect   of cours  much of the recent data have been disappoint  have been push up by rise energi and other commod price   though i was hearten by friday   s cpi report  this one observ hasn   t chang my overal impress that prospect for core inflat this year have worsen a bit sinc we met in januari  and i have rais my project for core pce inflat about   percent in       to    percent   these data rais the issu of whether cut rate as much as need to fight a recess may risk persist higher inflat and inflat expect   but i tend to think this risk is manag  first  as i have said befor  i view inflat as less persist now than it onc was  tend to revert fair quick to it longer run trend   we have recent review and updat our econometr evid for this and found it to be even more convinc now than it was a coupl of year ago   of cours  it is import to rememb that the current lack of persist presum is due to our enhanc credibl  so we do have to be care to maintain it   recent increas in inflat compens in treasuri market highlight the risk that our attempt to deal with problem in the real economi possibl could lead to higher inflat expect and an eros of our inflat credibl   but inflat compens is just one indic of inflat expect   i veri much like the board staff   s approach  which is in the current bluebook  of combin the inform from a wide varieti of indic into a princip compon type model   i found it reassur that the result index of inflat expect and uncertainti is still within the rang of variat that we have seen over the past decad or so  second  i tend to think that develop in labor compens are an import part of the transmiss process for monetari polici to inflat   befor we get into too much troubl with inflat and inflat expect  i would expect to see labor compens begin to rise more rapid   i find it reassur that both our broad measur of compens have expand quit moder over the past year  and product growth has been fair robust   so after incorpor it effect  unit labor cost are up less than   percent over the past four quarter  final  the more pronounc slowdown that i expect for econom activ is like to put somewhat greater downward pressur on inflat go forward   overal  i expect core pce inflat to fall below   percent next year under an assum level out of energi and other commod price and the project weaken of labor and product market
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  the baselin forecast in the  book look to me a lot like the      recess experi   veri brief and veri mild   if thing turn out that way  we will have been veri fortun  frank   the forecast i submit at the last meet was lower than most around the tabl  and now my bottom line is that i think the recess that  if we are not in  we are confront is more like to resembl that of          which  while brief  wasn   t that mild   there were a coupl of quarter  as i recal  where the economi contract by at least   percent in real term   i am not sure that this recess is like to be as brief as the previous two either   i have tri to use the         experi and it aftermath as sort of a guid to think about where we are today and how thing might unfold and evolv becaus there are some signific similar as well as some signific differ between the period   but it is also a way for me to start to organ thing and think about this  so let me just describ a few of what i think are relev featur from that experi and how today   s circumst are either similar or differ  if you compar our circumst today with what we were confront back in       on the posit side inflat and inflat expect are both lower today   the unemploy rate is lower than it was go into that recess   nomin and real interest rate appear to be lower today than they were back then   i think that nonfinanci busi balanc sheet are in better shape today on averag than they were go into the         experi  and depositori institut overal are in better shape today than they were back then  although of cours they are have some veri high profil problem   of cours  that was the period when we saw more or less the virtual demis of the thrift industri and problem of major bank   there was also a signific correct in hous activ  which commenc in      and ran through into       it wasn   t as sharp as the one we are experienc  but it was signific nevertheless   there was also a credit crunch back then  and that was given a lot of respons not onli for the recess but for it aftermath   that is  the relat sluggish recoveri that occur onc the recess end   becaus it was alleg that financi institut  nonfinanci busi  and household were all tri to strengthen their balanc sheet simultan  and so there was a good deal of caution throughout the financi sector   so there are a number of similar as well as a number of differ  when i think about today   s circumst  a coupl of thing come to mind   one is  as presid   summar  that the breadth of negat news about the economi is strike to me   on top of that  i think today   s financi problem are  without question  more sever and more intens than they were back then   they have engulf mani financi market  as we are well awar   while there were declin in hous price and hous valu in some market back then  the declin we are experienc today is both more widespread and is like  befor it is done  to be a good deal deeper   so i think that at least a reason parallel is the kind of thing we experienc back in          now  on the inflat side  let me start with polici   we weren   t target the feder fund rate back then   we were still wed to the monetari aggreg  more or less   but the fund rate  nevertheless  provid some use inform   the fund rate  in earli       was around    percent   it got to   percent by septemb       where it stay until earli        i cite that becaus inflat  whether you look at core or at headlin  actual diminish through that period   so while some peopl have been worri  and perhap justifi  that this is go to shape up like the late     s or much of the     s as far as inflat is concern  all i would say about that is it is not a foregon conclus if you look at histori   i don   t know that it is easi to distinguish how this is like to play out  but that was a veri signific seri of polici move undertaken back then  and inflat  nevertheless  diminish  the onli other comment i would add to this   and it is not go to lift the gloom right away  certain   is that these financi problem are go to persist   even if they bottom out and condit start to improv  i would expect that they will exert headwind on the shape of the recoveri   my view is that      is not like to be as healthi as the  book envis  larg as a consequ of the hangov of financi problem   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   clear  the incom data on activ have been weaker than we expect   i think they point to a downturn in gdp in the first half of the year similar to that in the  book   while the februari cpi report was welcom news  on balanc i think the inflat pictur continu to be troubl   i notic a mark chang in the sen ent of my busi contact this round   mani more are now tell me that the problem on wall street are affect their financ   credit avail is now an issu   with regard to borrow from bank  these report seem consist with the senior loan offic opinion survey   credit is an issu for those tap nonbank sourc as well  as in the comment that presid   made   as an exampl  back in decemb a major shop center develop indic that  even though the commerci mortgag back secur market had dri up  he was still abl to obtain financ on reason term from other sourc  such as life insur compani   last week he told me that these sourc had dri up  too   he   s now tri to rais equiti fund  which he consid veri cost and an unapp altern  mani contact also express increas nervous over the econom situat and it like impact on demand for their product   manpow   s ceo told me that their busi had deterior in recent week   some of his client were trim staff becaus of a lower current demand  and mani other were be cautious and cut back in expect of futur weaken  still  even though restrict financ and heighten caution are weigh on household and busi  there is a sens from my contact that spend is not collaps at this point  and export of capit equip in the agricultur sector continu to do well  similar to presid hoenig   s comment  anoth common theme i heard from my contact is that  while the fed   s innov respons has help  they do not expect that these measur will do a lot to solv the financi sector   s fundament problem   i doubt that ani of us disagre with that   as one of my director put it     monetari polici is not enough   we need a solut to the subprim mess   onc that happen  the contagion will run in revers      i believ our innov polici are help for facilit market function  but they don   t address the root problem   market want a firmer sens of where price for stress asset will bottom out and of the magnitud of the portfolio loss that will be taken by major financi player   unfortun  it will take a good deal of  e befor these uncertainti will be resolv  and i   m not sure what we can do to speed the process   after all  a number of these loss are go to stem from mortgag delinqu that have not yet occur and perhap from homeown who have not even contempl that outcom   this mean that financi headwind like will be weigh on the real economi for some  e  as presid  n said   i agre with his comment there   the substanti uncertainti over the length and breadth of this process add uncertainti to the medium term outlook for growth   so while i am hope that the economi will begin to recov in the second half of the year  i   m a lot less confid of that outcom than i   d like to be  turn to inflat  friday   s cpi report was about the onli good news i heard dure the intermeet period  i think last  e the report weren   t veri good either  presid     although as the  book supplement point out  the less favor translat to pce price take out some of the lu    it   s no surpris that mani of my contact point to increas pressur from higher cost for food  energi  and other commod input   i also heard numer report of higher cost be pass downstream   one notabl case was for wallboard   even though demand is weak and the industri had plenti of excess capac  higher cost for energi input were result in the first increas in wallboard price in    month   the director who report this was concern that price behavior is move toward a cost plus mental   this is  after all  his industri   if so  this would have negat implic for inflat expect   howev  i see this as a risk and not a base case scenario becaus the resourc gap open up in the economi should bring inflat down   firm will find it difficult to pass through cost increas in an environ of weak demand  busi and financi market particip will be awar of this difficulti in pass through cost  which should help keep down their inflat expect  that said  even in a weak economi  firm will have onli so much room to absorb cost  and pressur from higher price for energi and other commod and for import good pose a risk to the outlook   in addit  while i expect inflat expect to be contain  there are risk on this front  too   some can see a low fed fund rate path  such as that assum by the  book  as an indic of a lack of resolv on inflat   i don   t agre with that assess  but it   s an increas risk that we will be run  particular if the inflat news break in the wrong way  thank you  mr  chairman

first half of        but our chang are consider smaller than the revis in the  book   s forecast  which have revis down person consumpt in      from     percent in the januari forecast to zero in the current forecast while incorpor signific more monetari polici s ulus   i realiz that the board   s staff has a good track record  but i am not wholli comfort with the  book   s forecast  which i think incorpor a number of judgment adjust that are respons for take it pretti far away from where privat sector forecast now are  second  i   m just less comfort with the inflat outlook   i   ve said befor that  if inflat expect becom unhing  we will face an even more difficult problem as monetari polici will feed more quick and direct into higher inflat outcom   the ensu loss of credibl will be cost to regain   i wish we had the luxuri of wait for unambigu evid that expect have lost their anchor   but if we wait until then  it will be too late   this mean that we have to look for earli warn sign so we can take appropri action to ensur that expect remain anchor  and i am concern that we are see those warn sign   despit last friday   s cpi number  headlin and core inflat have been trend up   oil price are at record high   commod price continu to trend up  and the dollar has fallen sharpli  our busi and consum contact are consist stress price pressur as a concern  these develop concern me part becaus research indic that inflat actual may have becom less persist sinc the     s  and i think we have to be care not to interpret the lack of persist independ of what monetari polici action are taken   moreov  inflat expect measur by survey and market base measur have all risen over the last coupl of month   inflat risk premium have risen  which could be an earli warn signal of a wane credibl or commit on the part of the fed   the nation associ for busi econom survey in earli march show that a third of the respond think that monetari polici is now too s ul  and that is up from less than    percent just a few month ago  accord to a special question on our novemb survey of profession forecast   i report on this sever meet ago   half of those forecast     out of the     believ that the fomc has an inflat target   of those    forecast     believ that long run inflat over the next ten year will be    basi point or more abov what they view our inflat target is   i might be abl to shrug off one or two of these  but the predomin of these signal has me concern about the risk to our credibl   i   m also concern that the public seem to perceiv that the fed has effect set asid one part of it mandat  price stabil  in our all out effort to promot econom growth   said differ  it seem to suggest that not onli are we incorpor new data into our loss function as our forecast chang but we are chang the coeffici on that loss function   i don   t believ that we are necessarili do that  and i don   t believ that   s the right way to make polici  but i do believ that ul  it   s up to us to make that clear to the public as best we can  third  we have to calibr the appropri level of the fund rate and not just it rate of chang   this is not an easi task  especi in the current circumst   we have reduc the target fund rate by     basi point sinc august and     basi point in just the last six week  it is simpli too soon for the economi to have felt the full effect of these rate cut   while the recent deterior in the outlook might suggest that we need easier polici  i believ that the recent increas in inflat expect mean that the real fund rate has alreadi fallen either below zero or close to zero depend on how we measur it   for exampl  the real fund rate is now minus   percent  which is below the more pessimist  book consist r  of minus     percent given in the bluebook  if you measur the real rate as the nomin fund rate minus the  book   s one quarter ahead forecast headlin pce   the  book suggest that the real fund rate can be negat over the next two year and inflat will continu to deceler as upsid inflat pressur is offset by greater slack in product and labor market   i am skeptic   this outcom is predic on inflat expect remain well anchor despit aggress and persist eas for a sustain period of  e   given the current fragil of inflat expect  this seem veri unlik to me   the altern  book scenario with more inflat pressur from oil and import good suggest a steeper polici path and higher inflat by          fourth and final  like everyon els  i am veri concern about the develop in the financi market   i   ve been support of the step we   ve taken to enhanc liquid in the market through the taf  the tslf  the pdcf  or whatev
don   t say iou    laughter
well  i   ve been support of those  and i want to compliment the new york desk and the peopl who have work on this becaus i think they are veri innov   i   m not clear how success these instrument will be  and they are not without their own set of risk of creat some potenti danger expect regard futur fed behavior  which eventu we must deal with   but i think they are worth tri as long as they are remov in due cours   i can also support a further narrow of the spread between the fund rate and the primari credit rate  although i would eventu like to see a review of what we think that spread ought to be in more normal  e and what our exit strategi might be like as we move toward that   give some thought down the road to that i think would be help  so while i believ that we have appropri reduc the fund rate in respons to the worsen econom outlook for the real economi  i am less convinc that reduc the fund rate further will do much to stem the liquid problem in the market or to lower risk premium  uncertainti about valuat seem to be the root caus of liquid problem   the price discoveri process need to continu  and it may take a while   in this case  i think the fed need to continu to do it job to reassur market that it will act as an appropri lender of last resort  but we must be care that a lower fund rate  if that is the path we take   sn   t becom just a form of forbear that contribut to delay the necessari writedown and the price discoveri process itself   yes  the financi market can have spillov to the real economi to which the fed need to react with monetari polici  and i believ we have   at the same  e  we need to keep focus on both part of our mandat   we put our credibl at risk if we do not do so  and this would be a caus for sever problem later when we may need to act to regain it   we will have to face the fact at some point that we will disappoint the market with their ever increas forecast of a lower fund rate   thank you  mr  chairman
okay   thank you   it   s         whi don   t we take twenti minut for coffe   thank you   coffe break
okay   whi don   t we reconven   let   s start with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   mr  chairman  today is my   th birthday  and i can   t think of a better group of peopl to spend it with   or a less happi  e to do it
we sure know how to take the punch bowl away from this parti   laughter
well  listen  i know we are suffer becaus our deputi secretari here sit to your right  mr  chairman  just gave me a candl and had me blow it out with no cake attach    laughter   i want to use veri quick just four exampl of what i think is go on with the economi   the first is that    mile of boxcar that are    feet in measur each and usual carri lumber are laid up on railroad   the second is that there   s a labor shortag in the yangtz river basin  accord to one of my interlocutor   the third is that exxon is roll     billion in cash in overnight deposit   the fourth is  just to keep you listen  that i am go to come back to my ninth birthday in conclus  as to the    mile of boxcar  the averag length of a flatb car that carri lumber is    feet   burlington northern has    mile of it laid up   i mention that becaus  accord to my contact at the happi hous group that i talk to that build a signific portion of home in this countri  this hous setback  as they put it  is wors than               and       combin   i have been a bear on hous from the first  e i came to this tabl  and i agre with everyth that has been said about the downsid pressur that is be exert by hous   i would add a coupl of point just to underscor that   one is the    mile of flatb car that are laid end to end   the other is a concern i have from my interlocutor at up in that the past six week they have seen a downturn in their volum of   percent   the ceo describ that as a veri unusu swing from an up   percent in januari and someth that he has not seen befor  and i want to remind you that he was a cfo for mani year   the third point is on the growth side  someth that perhap we can monitor go forward   wal mart now poll one million custom   they start do so last april   there are some imperfect in their poll   they find that    percent are concern about the econom situat  particular about their financi matter  driven larg by percept of their decreas wealth in their home but also  more import  by cost of live factor such as gas price and the cost of money  with regard to the comment on china  at a confer in pari recent  governor kohn  presid   and    and i had the pleasur of listen to mr  yi  who is the deputi governor of the peopl   s bank of china   he made the comment that there is a shortag of labor in the yangtz river basin  which i found quit startl   i follow up with him on that convers more in depth  and becaus of that  i am not surpris to hear about the inflationari forc that were spoken about at this tabl   it goe beyond energi  mr  chairman  and it goe beyond food  although i want to make some comment on food   i talk to sever food produc  and they are all intend to pass through price increas of somewher between   and    percent   most distress to me was anheus busch  sinc i am a beer lover   the cost of input of hop and barley has gone up     percent   when you add aluminum  transport charg  and other thing  it total almost    percent  and they expect at the retail level for the price of beer to be pass through at about     percent   so  say    to   percent   combin that with the largest produc of pizza crust  who is expect a    percent increas in the price sought for their product  then you get a sens of a broader issu at hand on food   let me summar that broader issu   i want to come back to wal mart   they sell        food item  they expect an averag price increas across those        item that they are budget for this year of a littl over   percent   accord to a senior offici     we will be aggress about price   we are lag in term of our price increas as price leader  and now we are work aggress to catch up      that lead to concern on my part   i am well awar of the fact that we have not seen increas demand from labor  but i don   t consid labor to be a domest phenomenon   i consid it to be a global phenomenon  and i am concern that you are hear such report in area where our produc have offlaid certain manufactur process and sourc of inventori  includ in china   i  therefor  would suggest that they bear watch  with regard to the comment about exxon   s roll cash  to me this get to the heart of the issu  and that is that i don   t believ  as mr    said  that monetari polici is address the root problem   the root problem is a problem of liquid  solvenc  and trust   when you have a sophist oper like that roll cash in overnight bank deposit  it rais signific alarm to me becaus it indic a lack of trust in the system through which you might otherwis conduct your cash and liquid oper   i liken the situat  mr  chairman  to the follow   and forgiv my simplic   i   ll use a hydraul rather than a medic exampl  which i am often wont to do   we are the water main  and yet the grass is turn brown   the water is not get to the grass becaus the pipe is clog with all the hair and residu and all of the ugli stuff that has been build up in this rube goldberg pipe devic that we allow to happen over a long period of  e   i don   t believ that cut the fed fund rate address the issu   i do believ that the measur we have undertaken recent to enhanc liquid  to improv the function of the system  and to address the solvenc issu are of signific import   earlier you mention the duke survey of cfos   seventi five percent of those cfos said fed fund rate cut were not help their busi oper   i would have expect otherwis   after the last meet  pray against my own vote  i hope that everyth that we had hope would go up would go up and everyth we had hope would go down would go down   spread et cetera   yet if you look to the chart book   the bluebook  for exampl  or the present earlier this morn   almost everi singl graph of what we had hope would go down went up and vice versa  and i think that indic that there are limit to the efficaci of cut the fed fund rate  i said i would conclud with my ninth birthday   when i was nine year old  three month treasuri bill were trade where they are today   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  may i ask one clarifi question
presid    did you just say the efficaci of    ani    cut in the fed fund rate
i believ that the efficaci of the cut that we have undertaken has been diminish by virtu of the liquid   solvenc crisi
i complet agre with that   but just to make sure that i didn   t misinterpret you  did you say the efficaci of    ani    further cut
i think it is pretti clear that i am not go to vote for further cut
no further cut
at this junctur   look     we cut rate    basi point last  e   i was in a minor of one  and i respect the group around this tabl more than i respect myself   here is the point   everyth that we want to go down went up  and everyth that we want to go up went down   so i just wonder about the efficaci of the cut as oppos to the measur that we have undertaken
i wasn   t debat   it was just a clarifi question
okay   governor kohn
thank you mr  chairman   i agre with the other around the tabl who have said that the prospect for econom activ have taken anoth sizabl leg down over the intermeet period   i think we have been  for a  e  in that advers feedback loop between financi market and spend that everybodi   governor   and other   has been talk about   that is not an unusu kind of loop to be in dure a soft econom period   i think it is probabl characterist of a lot of slow growth and recessionari period   but certain it has been more intens this  e becaus the financi turmoil has spread well beyond hous and has intensifi signific over the intermeet period  the incom data on spend  employ  and product were weaker than expect  hous price are move lower by more than we or the market expect   all of these data have accentu concern about the creditworthi of household and busi and  henc  about the creditworthi of the peopl who lend to them  especi those who lend in the mortgag market   as percept of risk and risk avers rose  there was a flight to safeti and liquid   i think we see that a littl in the growth of m  over the past coupl of month  which has been veri  veri strong and suggest that household are retreat to money market fund  probabl the one that hold govern secur  and to insur deposit   in wholesal market there has been unwilling to take posit and rise concern about an array of intermediari   bill describ this process much better than i could   illiquid market  extrem volatil  deleverag  margin call  forc sale  especi in mortgag back secur  wider spread  equiti price fall  and lend and fund tenor collaps toward the overnight  again   so financi condit have tighten for everybodi but the govern   and some of the european govern have seen them tighten  i guess   mortgag rate have risen  and busi bond yield have risen as well  even with treasuri rate go down   tighter credit and declin equiti and hous price are reduc wealth  and all of this weaken spend further  now  to this process  the staff has judg that the economi has enter a recessionari state in which we can expect household and busi spend to fall short of normal level  given incom and interest rate   i am not sure how much weight to put on this   i am a bit uncomfort with construct that don   t have a clear stori behind them   but i must say that  look at the sen ent indic and listen to what i have heard around the tabl today from almost everi feder reserv district report  i now put more credenc in dave   s recessionari state than i did befor the meet start   obvious  someth is go on that is undermin confid and make peopl much more cautious than you would think  given the exogen variabl   i do think talk about the recessionari state underlin the extraordinari uncertainti we are deal with   presid  n point out the         preced   there are some preced for some aspect of this  but we don   t have mani  and i think it is realli difficult to know how financi market will evolv and how that will feed through to the variabl that affect household and busi spend   the reaction of household  busi  and state and local govern to tighter credit condit  i agre with presid  n  presid    and other who said they thought that the financi stress are deeper and will last longer than we thought and will  therefor  put more restraint on spend   until market stabil on a sustain basi  the risk to satisfactori econom perform by the u s  economi will remain skew veri much to the downsid  now  feder reserv liquid tool that we have use are necessari to reduc the odd on even more intens  downward spiral crise and market liquid feed back onto spend   so i think our innov here have been use to reduc the downsid risk a littl and therebi to promot spend   but i agre with the other who say that they don   t direct deal with the under macro risk  which is realli a stori about capit  solvenc  wealth  and price  i think monetari polici eas is a necessari aspect of address these macroeconom risk   i agre with presid    presid    and other that there is more go on and that monetari polici eas may not be a suffici way of address these risk   but i do think  as long as the economi is weaken the way it is and we have these risk  that eas monetari polici will be help   it will help bol  asset price   it will make the cost of capit lower than it otherwis would be   it may not be suffici to turn the thing around  but i do think that without the eas that we have done    and that i hope that we do today   the situat would be far wors than it otherwis would be   we need to eas to compens for the substanti headwind that we are face  now  the forecast for inflat has not been mark down despit the greater output gap  as other have remark  this output gap is offset  to a consider extent  by the upward pressur on price from oil and commod and import price as the dollar has fallen and price have risen in our export partner   china  for exampl   i have to confess that i don   t realli understand what has been happen to commod price in recent month   i don   t think the rise has been justifi by the news on the under condit of suppli and demand   it is much larger than the dollar weak has been  and the dollar   commod price has alway been a weak relationship   so  in fact  commod price are rise in a bunch of currenc   this isn   t just a dollar weak problem   i have to believ that there is a specul element here   part as a consequ  i am comfort with the forecast of a flatten commod price pictur in the futur   it might even declin  but at least a flatten out  i do think a shift from financi asset  especi dollar asset  into commod is go on  and most this has been trigger by concern about the u s  economi and financi market   in some sens  that shift is okay   it is drive down the dollar  and that is help to stabil the economi   the declin that we saw in oil price ye day suggest that  when peopl get more confid about where those financi market are go  some of those commod price will actual fall as the concern about the u s  economi are allevi   it is sort of an upsid down relationship  but i do think we saw a bit of it that way   but i also sens that some of the rise in commod price and the fall in the dollar reflect concern about the inflat outlook here   it is not surpris to me  in a veri volatil and uncertain environ  that inflat expect are not as well anchor and that they fluctuat a lot in respons to new inform   i expect that inflat will come down as commod price level off  then the output gap will increas  and that in turn will keep inflat expect down   still  navig this appreci weaker econom outlook for the real economi and the threat to financi stabil  on the one hand  and the tender of inflat expect  on the other  will requir some discuss in the next section of our meet  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   to join the grow chorus in the discuss today  i would say that there are veri signific polici challeng across five area on both side of our mandat   first  the real economi is materi weaker   second  inflat risk are quit discomfort   third  we have genuin issu with respect to financi stabil   fourth  we have veri real problem with respect to the credit channel and credit avail   final  as i think a coupl of other have said  we have risk in term of possibl disord move on the dollar   in term of what market believ that we believ are the big concern  i think they right understand that we are veri worri about downsid risk to the economi   they believ that we are veri focus on financi stabil risk  and with the three new facil announc in recent period  they are come to believ that we are find an effect mean to deal with a credit intermedi system that is  to perhap overst onli a littl  broken   but market particip may not yet believ that we are as concern as we ought to be about inflat risk and about risk with respect to the path of the exchang valu of the dollar  with that summari have been made  let me talk  first  about financi market condit    about the deterior in market function sinc the last fomc meet  bill spoke in great detail   over the past coupl of week  not just in the episod with bear stearn  counterparti risk has becom the domin concern in market   as has been point out around this tabl  it is increas difficult to separ liquid issu from solvenc issu   so what should we take from this deterior in counterparti risk   if we look at a rang of financi institut that have differ degre of impli backstop by the govern base on their size and their regulatori structur  we think about the gses that have an impli govern guarante and even ginni mae  which have the full faith and credit back of the u s  govern and about which the board staff share some data ye day with us   the spread on all of these look as though they have widen substanti   we have seen veri real deterior   but when you see that it is happen for the ginni mae  just as with mani of these other secur  it suggest that this is substanti  but not complet  about liquid risk becaus the credit risk of ginni ostens can   t be call into question  financi institut  more broad than financi market  are have a hard  e find their way   we have talk around this tabl befor about their balanc sheet problem  and most recent we have talk about their incom statement problem in figur out what their core busi is   in the market in the last coupl of day  we have had the broker   dealer with widen cds spread and fall share price  and of cours  that is about their mortgag exposur and liquid concern   but i think  most fundament  that the busi model of invest bank has been threaten  and i suspect the exist busi model will not endur through this period   as a result  the current architectur of the regul of financi institut and of the busi model across rang of financi institut   commerci bank  invest bank  and hedg fund   will chang through this period   the old model  at least in invest bank  of high imput leverag work incred well in a world of high liquid and  sn   t work as well when liquid is in short suppli  whi do i think this matter   it matter becaus it suggest that ani catalyst for improv from financi institut feed into the real economi for the rest of      or even for the first half of      is quit suspect   these institut are spend all their  e and attent on their own busi model  figur out how they can surviv this period  not on provid credit to the real economi   so i don   t look to financi institut to be veri good shock absorb or veri good catalyst go forward   my concern  broad  about financi institut is highlight when i think about the need  across all these institut  to rais signific capit for safeti and sound purpos and  in addit  for credit avail purpos   it strike me that this broad class is systemat undercapit  and we need to use all our tool to persuad them that it is in their interest and in the interest of the broad economi for them to rais capit  but find capit  certain over the next six month  will be a veri real challeng   the capit market are not in a veri strong posit to satisfi issuer need at present   that obvious can improv over the next coupl of month  but there is no certainti   sovereign wealth fund and other sourc of invest that we have been talk about for some  e   and we saw their real interest in invest in financi institut at the end of last year or earli this year   are quit beaten down   those that i talk to  who are veri sophist investor from place in asia and the middl east  do not want to appear as though they are doormat for these financi institut   their own polit structur make the loss they have had to endur front page news   i think the expect that sovereign wealth fund are go to continu to be a sourc of fund in this period is well overst   moreov  privat equiti   the case for opportunist capit   has littl abil to get leverag in this environ  and so if they don   t reduc their target hurdl rate  i don   t expect them to be abl to come to the rescu   all of that  again  suggest to me that the real economi will have to wait awhil for improv as this repair is slow and not at all certain over the next six to nine month  obvious  the implic for the real economi is hard to specul about  but i think  look at some rough measur  mayb a third of the credit avail of the real economi has been taken out dure this period   mayb more than that   i would say that the last week make it hard for us to judg how much more credit channel capabl and balanc sheet capac have left the real economi  but it suggest a pictur for the real economi that is worthi of real concern   now  when i look to the real economi  i would just underscor the comment i have heard from other   a coupl of ceo who have been incred op ist  at least in my discuss with them in the past coupl of year   these are ceo of lead consum product compani   have thrown in the towel   they have given up tri to justifi and explain away weak   across the auto sector  a coupl of the new owner of the auto compani are now focus on a scenario in which unit are in the      million rang rather than the    million or      million rang  larg becaus of weak of consumpt in term of consum purchas  but that realli goe back to credit  and in some way the credit avail to fund those auto purchas is a chanc for anoth stepdown in the next month  i think that busi cap ex is as threaten as has been repres today   it is the onli area for which my own sens is probabl more negat than the  book   s in term of weak to expect out of europ and the unit kingdom   it is hard for me to think  as we go through this period  that europ and the unit kingdom would stay as decoupl as recent data suggest   their economi are tie to their bank system more concret than we are tie to our  and i suspect that their larg financi institut are go to suffer real problem dure this upcom period   if not  it is certain a risk factor  let me turn to the last two issu   inflat and currenc   on the inflat front  there is littl reason to be confid that inflat will declin   there are reason to believ that our inflat problem will becom more pronounc and  i fear  more persist   the recent run up in energi price and commod price in the context of weaker global demand is troubl   no doubt part it is a move to real asset by the financi communiti   that is  a hedg against all of this is certain  to the governor kohn   s point  rais commod price   but i am not sure what catalyst will chang that over at least the next six month   as the board staff has note  there has been some rise in inflat compens and inflat expect   there is acceler in the fall of the exchang rate of the dollar  suggest of increas import inflat   moreov  it is not obvious to me that a slow economi in this cycl  in the short term at least  will do our work for us on the inflat front  final  let me turn to currenc   given this particular confluenc of event  the acceler depreci of the dollar is troubl  and i think the risk of a disord move on the dollar in the upcom six week are hard to discount   the catalyst of that could be a sudden de peg by certain countri in the middl east   but even if that   not come to pass  there is an expect in the market  where trader are look for bet where they believ they can make money with certitud  that there is still a free one way bet on the dollar   that is not healthi for currenc movement  regardless of one   s view of where the dollar should ul  be trade against the currenc of our trade partner   at this  e  particular  given our concern about make sure that the u s  economi remain open for foreign direct invest   that this is where other want to invest their capit   it strike me as a reason danger prospect if the view is that the dollar will continu it acceler path   obvious  this suggest veri difficult judgment for the next round of our discuss  and i will take up monetari polici in that context   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank   i   ve talk mani  e befor about the slow burn from the financi market that is spread out elsewher   unfortun  i think the fire is a bit hotter than i had expect in my earlier discuss  and it come particular through capit pressur in the financi institut   what we   re see now is the simultan of stress in the hous market and stress in the financi market  and they will be cure togeth   i think they are join at the hip  whether we have tool to address those direct is someth we continu to discuss  but i think it is this direct connect that potenti lead to the negat feedback loop that we have discuss quit a bit   for hous  of cours  there are the direct negat wealth effect but also the linger uncertainti of what   s go to happen  as mani peopl have mention   part of this come from just a chang in behavior   peopl are act veri differ dure this hous cycl from in the past  so it is veri difficult to predict the evolut of foreclosur even given a particular macroeconom outcom   there   s still the uncertainti of the macroeconom outcom  but peopl are go delinqu much earlier   they are go delinqu on their hous befor they go delinqu on their credit card   and so it is realli a differ model of consum behavior  which make valu the secur particular problemat   this is  of cours  in addit to unchart territori in term of real and nomin price declin   we   ll see exact how peopl will respond to these thing   obvious the market are close  and the bank have to keep these on their book  with higher cost and more difficulti financ   some of the chang that came in with the s ulus packag to rais the conform limit for freddi mac and fanni mae have done littl to bring down the spread becaus they have signific increas the cost of the guarante given this new environ   it   s not unreason to do that  but the potenti benefit from the chang is lower than we might otherwis have hope for  this is all have consequ for credit card   even though at first it was the mortgag  now we   re start to see a signific uptick in delinqu on credit card and spend  and a number of peopl   presid    presid    and first vice presid sapenaro   have mention some of these thing   i just want to report a bit from my convers with some of the major credit card compani  which have kind of a window into real  e consum spend  they are see a continu flatten but not a falloff of growth   there   s no collaps but certain a continu downtrend  as i   ve been report over the past few month   a continu slow of payment and a continu increas in delinqu   their so call roll rate of peopl move from    day behind to    day behind to    day behind continu to go up   they are still go up  although not signific   they are concern about that  but it is not spike up   they are main concern about when the roll rate get into    to     day   they   re not get their money back  person bankruptci are go up   the cure rate are much lower  and the recoveri rate are much lower   so there seem to be a group of peopl who are get into extrem financi difficulti   all the seri that i   ve quot are general averag   the contact said that in area of particular hous stress basic all of the number are three  e as high   it is signific more stress there  show a veri clear link between stress in the hous market and these other stress  have they been respond   well  becaus of veri strong pressur that may be come direct from us and certain from capitol hill  the credit card compani don   t respond by chang interest rate   they respond by reduc the amount of credit avail  and that   s exact what they   ve been do   so they   ve been cut credit line of a lot of peopl   also  as i think presid   or a number of peopl mention  they   re also cut back on the heloc becaus they have been concern that peopl are take money out when no equiti is there  and so they realli want to pull back on that   these overal tighten credit condit are reflect the continu stress on the balanc sheet of bank and financi institut more general  as you see with the bear stearn exampl  it   s not just the depositori institut but a broader set of institut that are creat pressur both on the asset side and on the fund side   we have had a lot of the siv and a lot of the other asset come on board   unplan asset expans may continu  particular if the economi   go down   what now seem to be veri good credit in the leverag lend market may no longer be good credit   so the anecdot evid that you   ve been mention around the tabl could turn into further unplan asset expans if these thing start to go south  consum write off  obvious  are anoth thing that is put on fund pressur   also as i think presid   mention  interest there have been few actual loss that have occur on mani of these secur in term of the inabl to make the payment  although the loss in the valu in the market have been quit spectacular in some case   some of this has to do with the broad evalu uncertainti   some of it has to do with liquid   i think this is where we have the direct link between liquid and macro stabil becaus the uncertainti in part are come from the macro uncertainti about how hous market will evolv   obvious i have said this befor   there are other factor that come in  but that   s a big one  so do someth to provid some insur against that or to help provid comfort that these market can come back is import becaus there   s a veri close link between liquid issu that we have been see  the unwilling to financ  and the capit issu that have been come from an incomplet of market   the market just aren   t there for peopl to be trade in   they are valu thing off an index   the index can   t be arbitrag against the under market becaus the under market aren   t there   so the index is do someth els   it   s the onli somewhat liquid market that   s provid some hedg   it   s drive that down  and peopl don   t want to buy the under secur becaus they   ll have to take the mark against this index rather than the true valu   if they have to take the mark against someth that they think is go to be push down artifici  they   re not go to buy the secur in the first place   these kind of continu stress make me feel a littl less op ist about the bounc back in       that   s in the  book  although i don   t think it   s rule out  just turn quick to inflat  we have a bit of a paradox in what has gone on recent as everyon has said   signific slow growth over the past four to five month but no evid of slow in the pressur on commod  energi  and agricultur price   that   s despit some slow elsewher in the world and expect of slower growth   the ppi number that came out today rais some concern that some of the good part of the cpi will not be flow through to pce   also  over the last year or two  when we   ve had the unemploy rate below   percent or    percent  whatev your favorit number is  where there would be pressur on wage  we haven   t seen much pressur on wage   so i   m not sure that  if the unemploy rate goe signific abov   percent  we   ll see much on the other side that will take pressur off wage to bring thing down   so i do remain concern there   but i think there   s a final risk that  if commod  energi  and agricultur price do signific move down  it could have a major effect on some of the emerg market and some of our other trade partner   so there   s a bit of a paradox here that  if there are some potenti benefit of the slowdown to reduc these price  that could actual also reduc export demand  which   as a number of peopl point out   is veri import in the forecast for keep this a shallow recess   so i remain concern on both the growth front and the inflat front  but i do think that macro stabil is probabl the primari thing that we need to be think about right now   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i   m quit depress   that   s not my usual person trait  but the realiti is that we   ve had as bad a set of shock as i could have imagin  and i want to talk about this set of shock   we have been hit with thing that are make our polici environ as complic as i possibl could have imagin   the realiti is that we are in the worst financi crisi that we   ve experienc in the post   world war ii era   i don   t think we should be shi about say it   we are in a financi crisi  and it is wors than we have experienc in ani other episod of financi    disrupt     which is the word i use   i will not use    financi crisi    in public      financi disrupt    is still a good phrase to use in public  but i realli do think that this is a financi crisi   it is sure go to be call that in the next edit of my textbook  particip   when is it come out
wouldn   t you like to know   i believ that actual the  book forecast of a mild recess is reason  but the possibl that we could have a sever recess is uncomfort high  and i find the prospect pretti scari   the realiti is that we are in this advers feedback loop that i and other talk about   i think we   re deep into it   the credit market have been deterior   that   s led to a sharp weaken of the economi   s prospect   this is reflect in the veri larg chang in the  book forecast  with which i do strong concur  so i don   t think that it was out of line to put those in   of cours  that weaken has been feed back to deterior financi condit   so i think we   re realli in a tough pickl  and there are cost not just in term of the economi   one result is that we   ve just expand the safeti net to a much wider set of institut  and we are in a brave new world here  and it is veri disturb   so the ramif in term of the economi weaken and the advers feedback loop go beyond just the fact that we might have unemploy   it may have major effect on the way market work in the futur  and that  i think  is someth that we should be worri about and should be a consider as well   the bottom line on real activ for me is that the prospect are veri poor  and i find the downsid risk just plain scari   that   s the first part of my depress  the second part of the depress is that it   s bad enough that we had these contractionari aggreg demand shock from the financi sector  but we also have had veri negat suppli shock that are both contractionari and inflationari   so we are get hit by the doubl whammi  the news on inflat has general not been good  even with the recent cpi number   but then  of cours  they are revers by the ppi number today   i don   t put that much weight on the actual current number becaus  as you know  i take a view that the primari driver of inflat and inflat dynam are inflat expect and expect about futur output gap   so that   s the framework in which i   d like to discuss what will happen on the inflat front  we have two problem in term of inflat expect right now   one is the suppli shock  which i think is have some effect on inflat expect  and also the view   although i believ it   s incorrect  i do think that there   s a problem that this view is wide held outsid  and presid   mention this   that we on the fomc are focus onli on growth and are not at all worri about inflat   this is a communic issu that is hard to deal with becaus  even though i   ve been advoc be more aggress in term of eas  i do worri veri much about the issu that we also have to indic that  if necessari  we   ll get out the basebal bat to keep inflat under control   that is not an easi thing to do   so when i look at inflat expect  which i consid to be a key driver of inflat  i think that the evid in the data is that we have had not a big increas but a slight increas in inflat expect  on the order of about    basi point   there   s a lot of uncertainti about that  it could be a littl more than that  but i don   t think a whole lot more  also disturb is that we certain have had a big increas in long run inflat uncertainti  that   s reflect not onli in term of inflat compens but also in the fact that peopl are buy inflat cap  tip are becom veri popular  and so forth and so on   in fact  one of the negat thing that happen to me as a result of take this job is that i had my entir tiaa cref in tip and unfortun i had to divest all of it becaus they are govern secur  and that turn out to be bad   but that   s onli one of the minor cost of be in this posit    laughter  the issu here is that  although i don   t think that inflat expect have gotten unhing at this point   and i think that we can say that the phrase    reason well contain    is okay   there is a greater risk that they could get unhing   now  i want to be clear   i   m not talk about the     s  it   s not    that      s show      i have not been particular happi with allan meltzer   s comment about a bunch of thing   the issu here is not that inflat expect would go to that kind of level  but it could be that inflat expect go up to     or mayb even a littl higher and it would be cost to get that down   that   s the concern we have to worri about  but let me talk about the other side becaus  when i think about the inflat dynam  it   s not just inflat expect   i do not believ in the deus ex machina view of the inflat process  someth has to tie thing down  and what tie it down is not current output gap   which is whi i think the standard phillip curv don   t predict veri well   but expect about futur output gap   on that score  i worri that there could be a lot of downsid risk to inflat from that   if realli bad thing happen  which i think unfortun is a serious possibl  inflat could fall  a key fact  by the way  is that if you look at past recess  you do find that inflat fall in the    month after recess   in a coupl of case with suppli shock  there was a rise in inflat at the begin of the recess   seven out of eight are in that categori   particular if it   s a sever recess  it   s much more like for inflat to fall   so it   s not true that there   s just upsid risk  there is downsid risk as well  and that   s one reason that inflat uncertainti is not an issu just of potenti upsid   in fact  in the      episod that presid   mention  the reason there was such a sharp rise in inflat compens was not that peopl worri about inflat go up but that they worri that inflat would go down   nonetheless  there   s still a cost to the fact that long run inflat expect are not as solid ground as they were befor   so my view in general is that we are face an incred unpleas tradeoff   we basic have the risk of the economi turn veri sharpli and the risk of inflat get somewhat unhing   i want to discuss that later  i wasn   t go to discuss this  but i just realli can   t not react to the comment that you made  presid     there   s a view out there in the media that monetari polici has been ineffect   this was the statement that i think you made  and i think it is just plain wrong   so i want to discuss it becaus it   s actual realli import in think about a polici stanc right now  and it   s import to think about the econom of this   we have had a veri nasti set of contractionari shock from the financi sector  particular the widen of credit spread and the restrict of credit   so i want us to think about a counterfactu   let   s think about a situat in which we had what   s happen and we did not lower interest rate   what would have been the outcom   do you think that credit spread would have lower   i think credit spread would have risen   in fact  when you think about what credit spread are be driven by   i   ve argu this befor   there   s a valuat risk   the fact that we can   t valu asset  and that   s this price discoveri problem that we realli can   t do that much about   but there is also a macroeconom risk  which is a lot of what   s go on right now  particular in term of the hous market where peopl don   t know where hous price are go to bottom out   the view that they may keep on go down   and we had a veri negat number on hous price recent   mean that even the aaa tranch now look as though they   re veri vulner  and therefor  the credit spread on them go up a whole lot   my view is that monetari polici has been veri effect becaus thing would be much  much wors if we hadn   t eas   on the other hand  we just had an incred nasti set of shock as a result of what you describ were the problem in these sector  so i realli think that this is veri import   to finish up on this  the exampl of japan is construct becaus the bank of japan had a view veri similar to the one that you   ve express  which is that they had all these problem in the bank sector  and the problem were not their fault   but they then took the view that they couldn   t do anyth about it   monetari polici was not the sourc of the weak economi  so they were veri slow to lower interest rate   the chairman has talk about this   everi monetari economist who went to the bank of japan dure this period   i did it when i was with the new york fed in the mid     s   told them that their monetari polici was too tight   they basic said     well  you know  it   s not too tight  and it   s not our fault that the bank are all screw up becaus of poor regul      well  the result was they end up with deflat  and they lost ten year of growth   i   m be a littl more blunt than usual  but i think that the econom argument here are actual central in our discuss
mr  chairman  may i answer
well  let him finish   are you done
i am done  yes
just veri quick  i said that the liquid situat we   re in diminish the efficaci of fed fund polici  i   m not say it   s not a worthwhil tool   second  i was fulli support until we got to       then we went from     to   percent   everyth we want to go one way then went the opposit way   so i just made the observ that it didn   t seem to be effect   third  i think i spent even more  e in japan than presid    who is an expert on japan  and you cannot compar the two economi   they are gear total differ  with total differ effici   i   d be happi to debat that at a later point   i think it   s a veri poor analog   now  have said that  i respect the enorm macroeconom downsid risk that we have   and i have one of the most pessimist forecast   but there   s a price to be paid for what we   re do unless it is effici  and that price is reflect in inflat expect   that   s my point  mr  chairman
thank you   vice chairman
mr  chairman  i   m go to cede all of my  e to you  except to acknowledg and to point out that there   s much i agre with that has been said around the tabl  particular with how peopl character the growth outlook and the risk and what   s happen in financi market and to the outlook   i can   t say that stuff better than it has been said  but there   s much i disagre with in what   s been said  particular on the inflat side  about the lack of credibl  i just want veri quick to say a coupl of thing about how we talk about this stuff base on what   s been said   first  some of you at this tabl may believ that we are lose credibl  and you may be lose confid in the capac of this committe to mitig the risk to our long term inflat object   if you say that in public  you will magnifi that problem  and just becaus you believ it   not make it true   i believ that you should have more confid in the commit of this committe to do what is necessari to keep those expect stabl over  e   second  the stuff about capit and the financi system is veri  veri import   it is veri hard to make the judgment now that the financi system as a whole or the bank system as a whole is undercapit   some peopl out there are say that   in some state of the world  particular if there is no liquid  then ani financi system will be systemat insolv   but base on everyth we know today  if you look at veri pessimist es  of the scale of loss across the financi system  on averag relat to capit  they do not justifi that concern   it is veri import to make distinct in what we say about that   it is veri differ to say that their distribut is uneven and to say that for some institut those loss may be  larg relat to capit   that is obvious the case  we have alreadi seen that to be the case   it is import to make the distinct between the averag and the distribut   although the averag loss look relat manag relat to capit  the system is short of capit relat to what would be ideal  given that we   ve had the collaps of a veri larg part of the nonbank financi system   bank as a whole are not larg enough now  even with their capit cushion  to compens for the scale of disintermedi of that type of nonbank financ   those are veri import distinct to make in this case  there is noth more danger in what we   re face now than for peopl who are knowledg about this stuff to feed these broad concern about our credibl and about the basic core strength of the financi system   so i just want to underscor the import of except care in how we talk about those thing  even in privat   a lot of peopl out there who should know better   none of us is guilti of this   are cast broad aspers about solvenc that are veri danger in this context   may we get to the point where those concern are justifi   of cours we may get to that point   if we systemat mismanag polici  we may get to that point  but pleas be care in that context  i   m sorri  mr  chairman   i meant to cede all my  e to you    laughter   final  i have to state for the record that i did submit our forecast   to state the obvious  it   s close enough to the  book on most thing  and  given the rang of uncertainti  there   s no materi between our view and the  book   s
thank you veri much   thank you for all of your comment  let me just briefli summar and add a few point   to summar the discuss  incom data have been weak  and some view the economi as have enter recess   hous demand and construct have continu to declin sharpli  and hous price declin have been somewhat greater than expect   hous weak has implic for employ  for consum spend  and for credit condit   it also lead to    mile of empti boxcar    laughter  financi condit have worsen consider  reflect weak in hous price  and credit market in particular are high stress and illiquid   wider spread have offset some or all of the declin in safe rate for mani credit product  and credit condit are tighter for most borrow   financi condit are like to be a signific drag on econom growth   some note the risk that continu financi turmoil could lead to a more serious and prolong recess  impli possibl larg downsid risk to growth   with respect to household  consumpt growth has flatten out  and there was general greater pessim about the labor market and econom prospect   consum credit qualiti may be worsen   payrol employ growth has turn negat   there was littl expect express of strong help from the fiscal s ulus packag  firm are general more pessimist and cautious but also remain concern about cost pressur  inventori look to be in balanc   export continu to be an import sourc of final demand and will continu to contribut signific to growth  although it   s possibl that growth abroad may slow  read on core inflat have been mix   increas in energi and commod price are import sourc of increas headlin inflat  and some produc have adopt a cost plus mental   agricultur price  in particular  are up a good bit   inflat breakeven are up somewhat  especi at the five by five horizon   the dollar has depreci  potenti ad to longer term inflat pressur and ad some risk   howev  nomin wage increas are moder  as are unit labor cost  and u s  and global econom weak could moder gain in commod price and creat domest econom slack   sever member warn about the risk of lose inflat credibl   ani comment  thought  let me make just a few comment   again  i   m veri sympathet to what almost everyon has said around the tabl  in particular the fact that we   re face a three front war  if you will  which make this extraordinarili difficult and delic   i thought in januari that we were in recess  that was my view at that  e  and i certain believ it now   the  book has done a good job of tri to factor in the data and the other type of evid   i think i   m actual slight darker on growth than the  book is   the reason is that i don   t see where the recoveri is come from in the begin of next year   in particular  we won   t have a recoveri until financi market stabil  and the financi market won   t stabil until hous price stabil  and there is simpli no particular reason to choos a  e for that to happen   so i do think that the downsid risk are quit signific and that this so call advers feedback loop is current in full play   at some point  of cours  either thing will stabil or there will be some kind of massiv government intervent  but i just don   t have much confid about the  e of that  i would like to say a word   i would just agre with governor   about the efficaci of our polici   i think that it has had an effect and it has been benefici   we obvious affect short term rate  includ commerci paper rate and the like  which have implic for financ and for borrow   we affect the dollar  which has mix effect  but on the growth side has some posit effect   it   s true  as presid   point out  that medium term and long term rate have not fallen becaus lower treasuri rate have been offset by higher spread  but again  the question is the counterfactu   where would we be if we had not lower rate   i think that lower rate have both lower safe rate and offset to some extent the rise concern about solvenc  which have caus the credit spread to widen   i think this argument can go either way   you can say that our polici is less effect and  therefor  we should do more of it   so there are two way of look at that   in addit  there may be some benefit for capit format of low financ rate and a steep yield curv in keep bank share price from entir collaps  on inflat  i agre with much of what   s been said  and i   m veri concern about it   let me make one simpl point  though  which i don   t think has been adequ discuss   nineti five percent of the inflat that we   re see is either the direct or the indirect effect of global trade commod price   food  energi  and other commod   what is happen is that there is a chang in the relat price of  say  oil and the wage of an ohio manufactur worker   there   s a relat price chang go on   that has to happen one way or the other   it can happen either by overal increas in the nomin price of oil  which are reflect in overal increas in headlin cpi inflat  or by lower or negat growth in nomin wage   now  if we have temporari movement in these relat price  i think all the theori tell us that the best way to let that relat price chang happen is to let the shock feed through  let the price of energi  commod  and so on rise  accept a temporari increas in headlin inflat  and focus on make sure that the increas in headlin inflat  sn   t feed through into domest core inflat  say  through wage or domest price  a good respons to that is  well  we   ve had a lot of    temporari    shock here and they have gone on for a long  e   that   s certain true   but again  it was veri difficult to anticip how these price have move  look forward  the futur market have been wrong and wrong  but they are the best we have   in my view  if we think about the like slowdown in the u s  economi and the global economi  there are go to be some forc that will prevent commod price from continu to rise the way they have been rise  which ought to take the pressur off the inflat process   that be said  i fulli recogn that there has been a bit of movement in some of the indic   i think i like the use of the index measur   it use lot of differ indic   i don   t think we should overemphas inflat compens   for exampl  the one year inflat compens three and four year out has move up less than the five by five  and i think for good reason   the five by five could reflect  again  general uncertainti   it could also reflect more volatil in the relat price chang of oil  for exampl   if we think there   s more volatil in that  if it   s up or down  that would creat more uncertainti about headlin inflat and would feed through into that spread  frank  in think about inflat  i am concern about inflat expect and the general psycholog   i   m hope at least that it will moder as commod price moder although  of cours  no one can know for sure   i agre with governor   that  from a financi perspect on the inflat side  the greater danger are in the currenc area   exchang rate are veri poor tie down by fundament  except over veri long period of  e   i think ken rogoff had a paper in which he said that over mayb     year or so the ppp final work    laughter   so a lot of psycholog is there   i think that it is an import issu   we need to think about what the treasuri will say and those sort of thing   that is a concern  and i consid that in some sens a greater risk at this point  so there are risk on both side   i think that the downsid risk  includ the financi risk  at this point are greater   not to belittl inflat risk  which i think are quit signific   we are obvious go to have to make tradeoff about how to deal with these   use both our polici tool and our communic is veri import   i agre with vice chairman   that we need and i need   and i have a veri import role here   to maintain clariti in communic about our attent to inflat  that we are not ignor that side of the mandat  final  let me just say  as i said last night at the dinner with the presid  that i think we are get to the point where the feder reserv   s tool  both it liquid tool and it interest rate tool  are not by themselv suffici to resolv our troubl   more help  more activ  from the congress and the administr to address hous issu  for exampl  would be desir   we are certain work on those issu here at the board  and i will be talk to peopl in washington about what might be done to tri to address more fundament these issu of the hous market and the financi market   so those are my comment   whi don   t we turn now to   for an introduct to the polici round
thank  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the revis version of tabl   distribut earlier today in the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      the revis tabl present the same basic set of altern that was discuss in the bluebook   howev  we have propos some chang in languag that affect the statement for altern a and b   i will discuss those chang  shown in blue  short   altern d  present in the right hand column  would leav the feder fund rate unchang at this meet at   percent   committe member might be inclin to favor this altern if they were particular concern about prospect for inflat and if they believ that  with due allow for lag  the monetari and fiscal s ulus in train would like be suffici to lead to a resumpt of moder growth over  e   the word of this altern would acknowledg the downsid risk to growth   but as shown in paragraph    the statement would indic that inflat has been elev  cite sever factor that could put addit upward pressur on inflat  and state that the upsid risk to inflat have increas   no net assess of the balanc of risk would be includ   under altern c  the stanc of polici would be eas by    basi point today   a modest eas of polici might be motiv by judgment that the econom outlook has weaken  but by appreci less than in the  book  and that the inflat outlook is troubl   member might see financi strain as concern but like to exert less restraint on growth than in the  book forecast     the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     in these circumst  the committe might want to be cautious about polici adjust that could add impetus to inflat  particular given the substanti eas of monetari polici to date and the lag in the effect of polici   the languag propos for altern c would note that the tighten of credit condit and the deepen of the hous correct are like to continu to weigh on econom growth   the inflat paragraph for this altern is the same as that for altern d   as shown in paragraph    the committe would make an explicit judgment that the downsid risk to growth outweigh the upsid risk to inflat   under altern b  the committe would reduc the feder fund rate    basi point today  to     percent   such an approach could be seen as consist with the  book forecast   inde  under that forecast  the committe is assum to eas polici    basi point at this meet and anoth    basi point over the next three month   the motiv for such a trajectori is provid part by the    percentag point downward revis to the  book consist measur of short run r    the committe might concur with the staff   s assumpt regard the amount of cumul eas that will eventu prove necessari and find a gradual shift in polici attract  particular in view of what seem to be some upward drift of late in inflat expect   such a path would also be qualit consist with the op  control simul shown in the bluebook for a   percent inflat target  in which the feder fund rate is eventu eas to around    percent   as shown in paragraph    the statement issu under this altern would indic that the outlook had weaken   we have suggest strike the refer to risk as that thought is pick up in the risk assess   the statement would go on to mention sever factor that could weigh on econom growth  and we have suggest ad    over the next few quarter      with regard to inflat  the committe would note that inflat has been elev   it would also indic an expect that inflat will moder in come month and cite sever factor that could contribut to that moder but note that uncertainti about the inflat outlook has increas   notabl  the list   not mention    reason well anchor inflat expect    or some variant of that phrase  which has been use recent in the minut and other polici communic   inde  the first sentenc of the paragraph note that some indic of inflat expect have risen   part becaus inflat compens includ a premium for inflat risk as well as inflat expect  we thought that    indic    of inflat expect might be a better word than    measur    and have suggest that substitut   over the past few day  inflat compens as read from tip has plung  howev  we are skeptic that the declin repres primarili a drop in inflat expect or inflat risk   rather  we suspect that it is import a result of shift liquid premium  as yield on nomin treasuri secur have fallen sharpli part becaus of increas demand for safeti and liquid   the final paragraph of altern b would repeat the risk assess issu after the januari meet   it would again indic that downsid risk remain and emphas that the committe will act in a  e manner to address those risk   final  under altern a the committe would lower the fund rate    basi point today   given the extent of polici eas assum in the staff forecast  this altern could easili be consist with an outlook along the line of the  book   this polici approach could also be motiv by concern about the possibl implic for the econom outlook of the worsen in financi market condit in the five day sinc the staff forecast was final or by a risk manag approach that gave particular weight to the downsid risk around the outlook   the languag propos for the rational section  paragraph   and    of altern a is ident to that propos for altern b   as with altern b  the risk assess paragraph say that polici action should promot moder growth over  e and mitig downsid risk  but this version also allud to the measur that the feder reserv has implement to promot market liquid   this languag could also be use in altern b   rather than provid an assess of the balanc of risk  as we did in the bluebook version  here in alter a we have suggest simpli indic that downsid risk to growth remain   given the high degre of uncertainti  you might again prefer not to make an overal risk assess  this paragraph differ from the correspond part of the januari statement also by indic that the committe will act in a  e manner as need to promot sustain econom growth and price stabil   thus  while the committe eas    basi point  this languag of altern a would signal some increas in the committe   s concern about inflat in sever way   by indic that inflat has been elev  by note that some indic of inflat expect have risen  and by incorpor a tradit formul of the dual object  includ price stabil  in the final sentenc   as bill note this morn  market particip appear to place substanti odd on a     basi point polici move at this meet   thus  implement of ani of these altern would involv at least somewhat less eas than expect   given what would appear to be veri fragil market condit and high skittish investor sen ent  you might see somewhat greater risk than usual in diverg from market expect  and obvious the risk would be larger the greater the gap between anticip and your action   at the same  e  you might see good reason for some diverg   first and most obvious  you might see a smaller move as appropri calibr given your outlook and sens of the risk   also  some indic do seem to suggest that inflat expect have becom a bit less firm moor   even if you see gradual dollar depreci as like to be appropri given the weak of the u s  economi and quit possibl a necessari factor in fo  an improv current account balanc over  e  you may be concern about the downward lurch in the dollar over recent day and the potenti for disord condit to develop   you may judg that a polici decis today to implement somewhat less eas than market expect and a statement that impli somewhat greater concern about inflat could be help in lean against inflat expect and ani sens in market that you are indiffer to downward pressur on the dollar   altern a would like prompt some increas in shorter term interest rate  but given that the risk assess would point to continu downsid risk  market particip would infer that further eas is a like prospect  and the effect on other financi asset price and financi condit more general could be reason limit   the    basi point eas of altern b  in contrast  would suggest to market particip that you are inclin to be consider more cautious in eas polici further  even with the downsid risk assess  and short  and intermedi term interest rate could ratchet consider higher  equiti price declin  and credit condit tighten   respons that presum would be amplifi  perhap nonlinear  under altern c and d
thank you   bill
i just want to updat the dealer survey   we got two more respons   two peopl move from    to       so right now as we speak  it is ten in the     camp  eight in the    camp  and two in the    camp
okay   thank you   question   vice chairman
mr  chairman  it is kind of awkward to ask this in the midst of a meet  but i think it is import   i think there was a pretti big chang this morn at least in risk percept today across a bunch of market   can you tell what the fed fund curv has done this morn
i think that the april fed fund futur contract earlier this morn was price at       and it was up by   basi point   i don   t know if it move subsequ
vice chairman  it has move up somewhat further at least as of mayb an hour ago   it look as though  at least for this meet  the odd were rough even balanc between    and      in term of what was price in
stock are up about   percent   both lehman   s and goldman   s earn show declin  but they were less signific than expect   so share price for both of them have ralli a lot   lehman   s stock was up    percent when i last look   i don   t know where it is today  so a lot of revers occur ye day in term of the invest bank
financi credit default swap this morn are much  much narrow   may i rais a conceptu question around this  though   mayb this is realli for you  mr  chairman   how should we think about the tradeoff between what we do with the fed fund rate and whatev effect we have on liquid and credit spread  which are obvious in some way work against the reduct of the fed fund rate   it  sn   t seem to me quit right to say that they are perfect tradeoff
i guess my question is  don   t they have independ effect   i mean  they are separ and somewhat differ in term of how we think about mitig the risk to the overal economi
i would think of them as complementari   they are not strong substitut  obvious   in the sens that  as is often point out  the liquid measur can affect credit and solvenc concern
so mayb to echo the dialogu that you had with governor    if we were to be success through take out some of the liquid risk of market more general and we got those spread mayb back down to   i don   t know       in a crude proxi sens  that would be good and power but we would still be left with except tight financi condit relat to the given target fed fund rate   is that fair   i mangl that
yes   i   m not argu that lower the feder fund rate narrow these spread a whole lot   it certain work in that direct  but there is a big independ movement becaus of both fear in the market and some liquid concern  which is whi i think it is veri import for us to have both set of tool   we have tool that can work on the issu of expect about monetari polici and stanc  but to the extent that we can use other tool  that   s also extrem help   it is not that we think we can solv all the problem  particular becaus these shock are so larg   this is one problem that we are face  which is that this disrupt is realli big  big  e  so then the question is whether we want to use all the tool at our dispos that we can
i just want to make one point to the vice chairman   s question   the way i think about this is that monetari polici tend to move continu   of cours  the feder fund rate is essenti continu  but what we are do with liquid measur is design to combat nonlinear to the extent that they   re discontinu  and so i think they have a differ qualit feel   we   re attempt to prevent a breakdown in market and allow monetari polici therebi to oper more normal in a more continu way
i guess anoth way to frame the question is  if we are reason success in mitig this advers feedback dynam in market and the effect that has on financi condit  would we still need to lower the nomin fed fund rate further to achiev the forecast laid out in the board staff   s  book
the answer to that would be    yes      when we layer on signific addit negat add factor for this recess scenario  they realli weren   t direct tie to our read of liquid in financi market but a read of the real economi
i think the issu here relat to the whole question about nongradu that we   ve been talk about   clear  if we got lucki and financi market turn around in a major way  then the stanc of monetari polici would need to chang  actual veri rapid   this is one of the issu face us   a communic issu  which is how we indic to the market and the public in a serious way that we realli care about keep inflat under control   i   m not sure what the answer to that is   it is one of the great challeng that we   re face at this particular junctur   clear  part of it is that we don   t want interest rate to be particular low   in fact  the higher interest rate could be for us  the happier we would be becaus that would be an indic that financi condit had turn around a lot   howev  the problem  of cours  is that inflat expect get unhing
mr  chairman  vice chairman   is ask in an eleg way about the issu of efficaci  which i was tri to touch on and did so in a less sophist way   i just want to make sure that i understand your answer   if we were to achiev the degre of success that   rough es   we would lessen that pressur   from a staff standpoint  what degre of eas would you advoc   would it be a lesser degre than what is imput into the
i can   t realli answer that question   over this intermeet period  we were cope with two import develop   one was that we saw some increas in overal measur of financi stress   as you know  we went to a forecast back in septemb when they first emerg and start mark down the level of gdp to account for that   we did a littl more in this forecast to account for what we perceiv to be an increas in financi stress   but the bigger factor in mark down our forecast signific this year was a read that we were switch from a sens of a slow growth scenario and move into someth like a more nonlinear downturn of the economi   that motiv the more signific portion of the downward movement that we had in the equilibrium real interest rate here
okay   presid
well  i just want to clarifi this becaus i didn   t get the answer i was expect   i don   t think i understood exact the question about financi stress becaus i thought the question was whether we would have to do more with the fund rate to achiev what was in the  book   did you mark down your outlook from the  book   i don   t think i understood
i guess i was think more along the margin chang that we would make should the factor be more success than we   re current anticip them to be   that would probabl caus us to edg up our path of the fed fund rate to account for that
okay   got it   thank
ani other question for     with your indulg  it has been a veri volatil period with a lot of chang in view   we   re also a littl short of  e   i think it might be more focus if i gave a propos and had peopl react to it   presid   made the correct point that we need to think about the level of the fund rate   where should it be   i think it need to be lower  frank   in our last meet  at   percent  mani of us view that as about neutral without much insur   sinc then we   ve seen  i believ  a much stronger indic of recess  an increas in downsid risk   when i spoke about the downsid risk in the congress and in speech  i cite three categori of risk   hous  financ  and labor market   all of those have transpir in that direct   so i do think we have to respond effect against that   for that reason i would recommend the    basi point reduct   i recogn the concern peopl have  and i have them myself  about both inflat and the dollar   so i would make two comment regard that   first  we will be even now disappoint the market somewhat   a more aggress eas is built in   second  as   alreadi indic  in a number of place in altern a  which i am propos  we have ratchet up the languag about inflat  notabl in paragraph    where we talk about it be elev and inflat expect  and in the last sentenc  where we reinstitut price stabil and clarifi what our dual mandat is  minor comment   i   m open to anyth  but i point out that in paragraph   we ad the list of explan for whi inflat may moder   we didn   t have that last  e   if peopl are uncomfort with that  we can take that out   the other thing we ad in paragraph   was the comment about market liquid measur   i think that   s use   it show that we   re do other thing   it creat a sens that there   s more go on besid monetari polici   but again  if peopl have strong object  i have no strong feel about that   in addit  my recommend would includ maintain the discount rate differ of   percentag point that we establish on sunday   so that   s where i would be   whi don   t we now have a rapid go round   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i think this is a mistak   i want to take just a second   i understand whi we   ve been lower the rate  tri to keep the problem from spread over to the real economi   i   ve been reluct becaus our practic has been to go too low and to creat a new set of circumst that we have to deal with although i   ve understood  given the serious of this financi crisi  that we   ve had to go down   i have been and continu to be veri support of the use of our taf and our other vehicl to provid liquid to the market to help address and stanch the panic   the fact of the matter is  though  that there is an enorm amount of loss  whether there is enough capit in the bank industri  we know that there is a solvenc issu out there  and these action  while they provid liquid  cannot solv that problem   that   s where fiscal polici goe   but i   m not sure that our continu to lower rate isn   t allow other who should be address this to look to us to solv the problem that is not our to solv  and that concern me about where we are  the fed fund rate at   percent nomin  i think  is a s ul rate in term of where the real fed fund rate is   in an environ where we now move down even lower than that  we are invit other specul activ   liquid has to go somewher  and it is go there fast   i think there   s a danger in do that  and this   percent will s ul the economi forward   two and a quarter will s ul the economi forward and introduc other signific risk both to specul activ and to inflat  and that   s whi i think we should be more care in go forward   now  do noth will shock the market  but i   ll tell you that the market has been shock as much by some of the new action we have taken as if we said     here it is at   percent     there are a lot of peopl on the sidelin wait for us to stop so that they can come in and take advantag of the situat   so there are lot of reason that i would much prefer to hold at this period  and i felt compel to express that view   thank you
certain   presid
news of the problem at bear stearn and the veri fragil situat in financi market complic our decis today   feder fund futur indic that the market is anticip a reduct of at least    basi point and probabl more than that   normal the expect of financi market particip would not factor heavili in my decisionmak  howev  given the fragil in the market and my own expect that  even with this move  further eas will be necessari  i strong prefer altern a   while i view altern b as a signific action  i would have concern about like market reaction given the graviti of the situat in financi market and the possibl that a recess may not be mild  given fall collater valu and financi difficulti at mani of our major financi institut   a    basi point move would mere offset the increas in credit spread that we have seen sinc the past meet   in addit  the boston forecast and the  book forecast with a    basi point eas leav the unemploy rate well abov the nairu but with inflat rate below   percent by the end of        eas less than    basi point at this meet would seem entir inconsist with the econom and financi deterior we have seen sinc the last meet
thank you  mr  chairman   we   ve spoken a lot about inflat expect here today   let me at the outset emphas that what i   m refer to in the measur we have are the expect of the public   they   re not necessarili my expect or governor     s  vice chairman     s  or the committe   s  and they don   t necessarili correspond to the realiti of the distribut of inflat realiz five year  five year henc  if each of us had our druther or if the committe as a whole last that long togeth and conduct polici the way it best saw fit   i trust that no member would deliber encourag continu discrep between what they view as object realiti and the public   s expect   but that said  that discrep is not the same as less commit on our part   it   s certain the same as less credibl about commit on our part   i think and trust that most member when speak in public about inflat expect would endeavor to reduc that discrep   presum  each of us has a threshold for accept inflat expect that  if it were cross  would induc us to be will to disappoint market expect   person  my threshold has been cross  so i think that  if we eas  we should eas much less aggress than market expect  more broad  i think of this in term of the follow question   what strategi would we want peopl to believ we will follow in futur episod like this   as i point out in my letter to the committe last week  think in term of our strategi is differ from a meet by meet approach that take the public   s current expect  wherev they are  as given   we should ask  i believ  what expect we would have want them to have had about our behavior dure episod like this   do we want peopl to believ that we will follow a polici that allow inflat and inflat expect to ratchet up perman whenev growth slow   i don   t think so  but that seem to be what the market believ we   re do   conceiv  we could tri to use our statement and minut to communic our intent to bring inflat down  but at this point  my sens is that our statement about inflat appear to be taken as much less reveal than our action  this is a uniqu challeng episod in the histori of our economi and our institut   i have found it use to remind myself from  e to  e about the limit of central bank   we cannot prevent this recess  and it   s doubt to me that we could have or should have even if we had had perfect foresight   we are unlik  as i said  to have much effect on the ul  magnitud of mortgag loss at this point  and i don   t think we can do much to acceler the resolut of uncertainti about those loss   we cannot resolv uncertainti about the fundament under the creditworthi of financi market counterparti  and we cannot enhanc the liquid of ani financi instrument without alter it relat price   what can we do   we can control inflat  and we can limit the extent to which uncertainti about our inflat intent add to market volatil   to do this  i like the idea of be clear about our strategi   i take that as consist with what presid   was advoc  that we concern ourselv with what level we see as appropri now and see as like to be appropri later this year   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your propos for a    basi point cut and the languag that   s propos for altern a   as i said in my comment  i   m veri concern about econom growth and agre basic with the  book perspect   i think we are into an advers feedback loop  and i agre with the bluebook assess that the equilibrium real fund rate has drop substanti  mayb into negat territori   i don   t believ in gradual in circumst like these   i think the argument for more aggress action now is similar to when inflat is veri low and we face the zero bound for nomin interest rate   i agre with governor     s comment about the lesson of japan   i think that the sooner appropri s ulus is put in place  the less like it is that polici will end up face veri unpleas consequ of essenti reach the zero bound in this case becaus of a prolong and sever recess   so i   d like to see the fund rate move down to where it need to go sooner rather than later  i think the appropri level of the fund rate is one that would provid some insur against realli bad outcom for the economi  and i don   t see this move as take us into insur territori yet   so i understand the constraint that you have weigh into this decis have to do with the psycholog of inflat expect and the dollar  and probabl this is as far as we can go sensibl today  but i think it is import to move as much as we can  if the move prove unnecessari  i think we can revers the stanc of polici quick  with a good chanc of avoid inflationari problem   i agre with governor     s view on risk manag polici in the face of financi shock   we had an interest discuss last  e about the possibl that a quick revers might mean that we don   t have much s ul effect on spend now becaus we may not lower long term interest rate enough  and i think that was good food for thought   but have spent some  e think about it  i think that a lower fund rate will actual lower long term rate  in part becaus  by reduc the probabl of a financi crisi  we will bring risk premium down  which will lower long term rate   a lower fund rate will also be s ul becaus a good deal depend on short  and intermedi term rate   i think there are also a number of other way in which short rate matter to spend through channel like rais firm    profit and cash flow and lower the stress from arm reset   so i strong support the action that you recommend
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support your propos  both the action and the languag of altern a   i think it   s an appropri respons to the develop situat  and i do think that the languag will help us on the inflat front   let me elabor a bit  we   ve had a mark deterior in the outlook  as everybodi around the tabl has seen and has agre with   i do think  as presid   and other have said  that a declin in the feder fund rate will be help in mitig the recessionari tendenc in the economi   the declin of    basi point is not as much as the  book r  declin  but i think it   s appropri and reason to await more evid about whether at some point we need to go further   the result real feder fund rate would be approxim zero use core inflat  and i think that   s a reason place to be  given the weight of the constrain factor in the econom outlook  particular from the credit market   i use core in think about the real fund rate becaus i do think that even a zero real fund rate under these circumst  at least for a  e  will be consist with inflat come down as commod price level out and as resourc util goe down  i agre with   that there could be a bit of an advers reaction in financi market becaus it   s not quit as much as they   re expect  but with that risk sentenc in paragraph    it shouldn   t be too bad   i do think it   s consist with heighten attent by the committe to inflat and inflat expect for the reason you gave  mr  chairman   it   s less than the market expect  and both paragraph   and paragraph   increas the attent to inflat and inflat risk   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i came in here think that i prefer    basi point  but i also recogn that i expect that we would have to go beyond that after this meet   so i fulli support    and the languag that you discuss  i just want to take a minut to give my perspect on the discuss earlier about the     s and inflat expect   i certain didn   t expect when i came onto the committe that we would be lower rate as much as we have done  and i thought we would be more concern about inflat  but this is where we are  and i think it is the appropri respons   inflat expect risk remind me of paul volcker  hero of the feder reserv system   whi is that   he broke inflat expect   how did he do that   well  when i talk with my colleagu  larri christiano  he remind me that it wasn   t realli by reduc money growth   m  growth increas dure that period  and yet financi condit were restrict   there was a big recess   there was a lot of resourc slack  and that was realli import for bring inflat down  i agre   i think we   re in a situat where this is most like a recess   i expect that it will reduc pressur on inflat   that   s my forecast   i think it   s consist with the earlier period  and it   s hard to know exact how much it will bring inflat down  but i think that it will lower inflat   the  book is call for a recess   they could be wrong  but we   ve been chase them down the whole  e  and i   d be veri surpris if they were wrong  i would like to know where the bottom of the fund rate cycl is   like financi market particip who want to know what the valu of their mortgag secur is  i   d like to know where the bottom of the fund rate is   but that is wholli unrealist at this point   we just don   t know   so i would be hope for eventu someth like the  book path assumpt   but i support the recommend   combin with our separ attempt to reliev financi market stress  we have two prong go  and that is veri help   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  as somebodi said recent  there are no altogeth good choic   i strong support the recommend and the languag that goe with it  a coupl of week ago i thought the fund rate probabl should go to     percent   i got there basic by say  well  given what i know about current condit  the outlook  and everyth    percent is not a bad level   but there are a lot of thing i don   t know  and it   s like that some event are go to occur in the next coupl of week or some  in the futur that may disturb thing  and as a littl insur for that      would be a good idea   well  those event   i   m talk about bear stearn and other disrupt   occur sooner rather than later  so it seem to me that we need to go to     and then ask ourselv whether we want some addit insur   my answer to that is    yes      so i   m perfect comfort with take the fund rate down   percentag point now     it strike the appropri balanc between our concern about financi condit and the outlook  and inflat and inflat expect on the other side   i don   t know   but as i said at the outset of this  i don   t know that there are ani altogeth good choic   i think this is about as good as we can do under these circumst
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i don   t like be obtus and  be a peopl person  i don   t like be unpopular   but i
we   re alway go to love you  come on    laughter  particip   we don   t like be unpopular either  particip   happi birthday    laughter
i just can   t bring myself to go that far  mr  chairman   i listen veri care to what was said at the tabl  and implicit in     s question to me was  would you be will to do someth   the answer is    yes     but not as much as you   re suggest   i tri as hard as possibl  even though i   ve made my live in financi market  to ignor the report that we were just given as we start this convers becaus what we   re paid to do and what i believ is our duti and oblig to do is what   s right for the long term interest of the economi  i am more bearish now than befor  and i was an outlier on the bearish side of econom growth   i   ve been at the lower end of the rang  but i also believ that we have signific inflationari concern   i have a further point to add to presid hoenig   s   i agre with his intervent   i think that  by be accommod  we are encourag other who have a role to play here   you mention them yourself  mr  chairman   to sit back and let us do the job   to me the combin of inflationari pressur  which i consid to be real  imput into a much weaker econom growth scenario  which i have thought for a long  e  mean that we cannot do this job alon   the fact of the matter is that we have undertaken signific liquid enhanc initi  and i think we   re go to have to do more  and i   ve been fulli support of them  but i think    basi point  mr  chairman  is way too much   my thought is that it encourag the financi market   they   re not go to be satisfi   i said this last  e   it   s jabba the hutt   they will keep ask for more and more   we have to quit feed them   i   m in a pizza mode  by the way  in this convers   i do have a suggest  howev
you mean pizza the hutt  not jabba the hutt    laughter
pizza the hutt  that   s right   vice chairman   made a veri interest point  and that was that we have to be veri care about how we talk about inflat and even say what we think   what worri me about go down altern a   s path  if that   s the wisdom of the committe  is that the second paragraph say a littl too much of what we think   it realli say that we   re not done   if you want to say that  that   s fine  but it keep hammer on  even after    basi point  that thing are soft  thing are soft  thing are soft   you may disagre with me on that  but i would suggest that we take out the justif reflect  in paragraph       a project level out of energi and other commod      to me that   s a wing and a prayer  and you suggest that you might be will to take it out   were i you  advoc    basi point  act as i think you are about to act  with one dissent  i would take that wing and a prayer languag out of there  then i would suggest one other thing   in fact  i would ask for one other thing   in the veri last sentenc      the committe will act in a  e matter as need to promot sustain econom growth without sacrif long term price stabil      that   s realli what we   re talk about on the upsid and on the downsid   so i would ask for that chang becaus that   s realli what we   re say   you   re say that we   re worri about the downsid   we   re all worri about that  but we   re go to promot sustain econom growth without sacrif long term price stabil   those are my suggest  mr  chairman  and thank you for put up with me
alway a pleasur    laughter   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i came to the meet prefer altern b      basi point   i certain can bring myself to support your propos      basi point   i don   t view it as a fist pounder  but let me make the case for    basi point  at least as i think about it   first  i do think it is a movement that acknowledg financi instabl and the grow real weak   as i argu in my earlier remark  it may set the scene for decoupl rate polici from liquid action if condit allow   i think the action make a minim acknowledg of inflat risk  and it may signal the view that lower rate can do onli so much and that  best case  the market will have to proceed to sort out the market problem and  worst case  the fiscal author will have to deal with them   although i am not a train psychologist  let me just propos that  in deal with market psycholog  there may be some valu in appear to firm up our rate movement polici and to set one element in the fluid situat with greater fixiti than it has been in recent week   that might generat the kind of firm dynam and even help produc a turn in psycholog   that   s a lot to ask for simpli    basi point  but i also prefer the languag of altern a to that of altern b  and i think   said that you could conceiv appli altern a languag substanti to a    basi point cut   so in general i like that approach  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   as i said earlier  i do see the risk to the  book baselin as be skew to the downsid becaus of the absenc of ani sign of a bottom out in the hous market   as other have mention  i am concern about the risk that we will have a more protract recess   at the same  e  the short term inflat environ has deterior   i am also concern about inflat expect becom unanchor   as governor   and other have said today  we face some veri unpleas tradeoff  but in the end  i support be more aggress in our polici action today   i am hope that  as other have said  the languag that we have ad in paragraph   about inflat risk and a remind in the assess of risk paragraph about our dual mandat will be help in keep inflat expect from rise further   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   first vice presid sapenaro
mr  chairman  exclud for the moment the market   s expect of a signific downward polici move at this meet  i have a strong prefer for altern d  like presid hoenig   i see widespread evid that the upsid risk to inflat has increas appreci  as evidenc by rapid money growth  a depreci dollar  rise price of energi and commod trade on the world market  and higher inflat compens in bond market   howev  as we all know  the market   expect a signific reduct in the fund rate from this meet  part becaus of the state of the economi  part becaus of the turbul in the financi market  and part becaus of past statement and communic from committe member   consequ  under these condit  i believ that a failur to accommod much of this expect would produc addit  major market turmoil   henc  i was prepar to accept a    basi point reduct come into the meet and  with some trepid  can accept a    basi point reduct   in my view  howev  it would be desir for the committe   s communic go forward to emphas that we have not lost our zeal to fight inflat and that further rate cut cannot solv solvenc problem without unaccept futur inflat   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i mention in my first go round  and like    i have been terribl depress on multipl dimens about what is go on and have struggl mightili in tri to think about what appropri polici is go forward and  as presid   suggest  about what our strategi is as we move forward   i certain believ that eas of polici is appropri in a weaker economi  and i have support that   but as i allud to earlier   and  mr  chairman  as you said   i do believ that a weaker economi   not mean that we continu to cut rate as long as the economi is weak   we need to calibr the level of the fund rate  i think it is veri import   i think the market seem to have the expect that it is the rate of chang  not the level  that matter   that concern me and feed into some of the problem that we are face   i won   t elabor ani more about expect  which i mention befor   but i would prefer action as well as languag that reinforc our commit to price stabil and a paus today in our rate cut   i think that the languag of altern d would accomplish that   but i also believ that a more modest cut  combin with languag such as that in altern d  might accomplish the same thing   i am afraid that an aggress move combin with the languag that we have in a or b feed the belief that we have place asid our commit to price stabil and the expect that we will continu to cut rate for the forese futur and that there is no bottom in sight  we have talk a lot about take out insur around this tabl   i believ the  e has come to buy some insur against our wane credibl about restrain inflat   that   not mean that we couldn   t choos to continu to make rate cut at some futur date  should that be call for   ul   if we wish inflat expect to be well anchor  we must act in a way that is consist with such an outcom   word are simpli not enough   reput capit  whether it be for a central bank  an academ institut  or the brand capit of a firm  is veri hard to build   but most of us know  in the privat sector and in other sector  that capit can be easili squander   we must not let that happen  i appreci  mr  chairman  your comment regard the idea that we may be reach the limit of what monetari polici and the central bank can do   i veri much agre with that   at the risk of mayb sound a bit trite to some of my colleagu who are familiar with this   i don   t mean it that way becaus this express some of my concern   i would like to remind my colleagu of a quotat of milton friedman  which he made in       that    we are in danger of assign to monetari polici a larger role than it can perform  in danger of ask it to accomplish task that it cannot achiev  and  as a result  in danger of prevent it from make the contribut that it is capabl of make      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   a coupl of quick introductori point   first  i have total confid in the fed and the fomc  certain over the cours of my coupl of year here  in effect handl these challeng  which is key to highlight at the outset of my remark   i have total confid in this institut   s abil  in particular  to handl both side of the dual mandat   moreov  i would say that i have total confid in our abil to have a realli robust discuss here and recogn  as presid   point out  the fragil in these financi market   a lot of our strength come from be abl to have veri open  tough discuss with each other and recogn that  if they were in the public squar  they could be misinterpret and destabil   i think he is right that we all need to take that into account  particular over this next intermeet period  which we all hope last six week   moreov  i think that the power of our tool  our creativ  and our innov abil over novemb  decemb  and these recent week has been incred impress   i think that those will work in concert with monetari polici   i would underscor a point that the chairman made  which is that we have taken a huge burden on ourselv and that the burden will have to be match by other here in washington   and i suspect befor we get too much into the second and third quarter by other around the world   which will go a long way toward help us accomplish our object  second  i have total confid in u s  financi institut over the medium term to deal with these issu   they will come out of this thing stronger  smarter  and fa  and will be huge net export of servic  but that is go to take a while   my own view is that the capit rais is good and veri import   if the tail is as fat as we have discuss  capit rais by these institut should help them stave off safeti and sound issu that could aris   so i think that it is good prudenti manag by them and us alik  to the task at hand on monetari polici  i will support altern a  as the chairman recommend  and i take particular comfort in the narrat and languag in a as be a veri import next step for us to guard against risk on the currenc front and on the inflat front  now  these word themselv won   t do a ton in the short term  and they won   t have an immedi effect  but i do think it is import for us to take these and build on them in our privat and public statement   so that give me some comfort   on the decis of    point versus    point  i would be kid myself if i thought that those    basi point were complet consequenti   i wouldn   t ascrib virtu or vice to that sort of bid ask spread   i would say that it is a hard call   i share the view express by some that these market are go to need to be disappoint at some point here   that is the onli way the word that we express will be proper understood and taken into account in the market    judgment  and i worri that we are not go to have ani great opportun to disappoint them over the cours of the upcom meet  final  let me say this   i will end where i start in this discuss  which is  at the end of the day  it is this institut   s credibl that is paramount and that is increas the case at this point in the cycl   it strike me that we have to continu to make the case in the upcom month that we have the will  the wisdom  and the tool to tackl these issu   to the extent that monetari polici is perceiv by pundit and fed watcher as not work  it is import that we rebut those argument and explain that our tool will work over  e and that we are look for assist both in washington and in other nation    capit   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you   obvious  as i said befor  we are in a veri uncertain situat with respect to inflat   we have slow econom growth  but we have also had veri elev price   we had a veri low unemploy rate and a veri low rate of wage inflat  so we have to worri a littl about whether we will get the benefit of lower resourc util in term of lower inflat   but when we look back histor at previous slowdown  as presid  n mention about         and as we have discuss about          when we didn   t actual have a formal slowdown  the committe cut rate  and we didn   t have a burst of inflat   obvious  after the slowdown in       the main challeng was concern about inflat get too low rather than get too high at that point   if we look over the past few cycl   and i think market are awar of those   we see that you can have cut in the feder fund rate that don   t lead to inflat get out of control  both when the economi is grow strong and when the economi is quit weak   so although i do think that the situat is uncertain  i don   t think that the market would read a cut of    basi point today as a lack of commit to inflat control   i think there is a lot of histor evid that suggest that it is not necessarili inconsist with that in ani way  the slight uptick that we have seen in some but not all of the survey  sn   t suggest that our inflat credibl has been lost   i think it is veri difficult to read what the market are say becaus just look at the volatil over the past few day   are those tip spread realli tell us about dramat chang in the market   s view of our credibl regard what we are go to do in fight inflat   i don   t find that credibl   there are a lot of other thing that are go on that make it veri difficult for us to read someth out of that  so i support altern a   my think is actual veri much along the line of presid  n   s   that we need to take out at least a littl insur go forward   the statement in altern a   a veri good job of talk about some of the concern about inflat   with respect to whether or not we includ the explan of whi we expect inflat to come down in come quarter  one of the thing that chang in this version relat to the earlier one is that there is no explicit mention of inflat expect  which i think is right becaus there is such uncertainti about how to measur those   that the uncertainti about the inflat outlook has increas is the thing that we can read from what the market are tell us  the assess of risk in paragraph    where it mention not onli the polici action but also the measur to fo  the liquid  is valuabl so that peopl see that these are complementari tool and that we understand how they can work togeth   the mention of price stabil at the end and how that differ from our statement from last  e is a good way to signal that   but i realli don   t see evid yet that we have lost credibl   if we look back histor at when we   ve done rate cut in either financi stress  e or actual econom downturn  at least over the past twenti five year  it has not turn into inflationari challeng  and i don   t see ani evid that the market think otherwis   so i support altern a  as is   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious  we are face a veri difficult polici problem  and that is whi     we will go have a beer later  so that we can deal with our depress
how about two
yes  mayb two   clear  we are challeng by the fact that we have to balanc the risk of both under inflat and inflat expect go up   against that  we have to worri about the downsid risk to the economi  and the financi sector could realli go south   so that is realli the polici problem that we face  i do support altern a  but i would like to give some perspect on that becaus i may have a differ take than other on this   if you are think about the risk manag viewpoint that i and some other have talk about  i want to emphas that lower the feder fund rate    basi point is not   and i want to repeat  is not   take out insur   if you look at the  book project  they have    basi point  and they have a further declin after that   the r  has drop     to       well  it depend on which model  but quit a bit more than      so from an insur perspect  we should actual be do more than    basi point  but i am not go to argu for that   in fact  i would argu for that if some of the other thing  such as negat suppli shock  hadn   t been happen  i also have a concern about a phenomenon that has occur  which i don   t fulli understand   normal i would not worri about dollar depreci   i gave a speech recent on pass through   it was an opportun for me to interact with nathan   s staff and to read the literatur   and the evid is that there is just not a whole lot in term of pass through   but late we have seen someth that is veri peculiar  which is that  everi  e we have had depreci in the dollar  the oil price has gone up   that make me much more nervous about dollar depreci than i would usual be   i hope that it may be just coincid  but it make me a littl more nervous  anoth problem that we face is that we have not convinc the market that we will be will to bring out the basebal bat if inflat start to get out of control   that is realli a key part of the risk manag approach  and a key part of   i think vinc reinhart call it post gradual in his speech   he gave a veri interest speech the other day and call it post gradual   but we have not yet convinc peopl about it  and part of the problem is that we realli haven   t oper in that way in the past   this is one reason that it is worthwhil talk about this and say that we need to think about oper in a differ way   but it suggest to me that  if we actual were more aggress than    basi point  it could have veri negat reaction in the market about our commit to control inflat   so  that is one of the reason that i strong support the chairman   s propos   i should say  by the way  that even so  the    basi point cut  which i don   t think take out enough insur    pose some risk that long run inflat expect will rise   but we have to realiz that there is a lot of risk of realli bad thing happen that could mean that thing realli get out of control   the discomfort is that we now have a tough tradeoff   but then  when i think about the tradeoff  i am will to say that we have to take the risk becaus otherwis the consequ could be veri problemat  i should mention that i have one concern about the word in the statement   i usual don   t make comment about the word becaus i am just not subtl enough to get that   but i did worri a bit  for exact the reason that vice chairman   mention  about the issu that talk about inflat expect get unhing could be actual veri danger   the first sentenc in altern a say     inflat has been elev  and some indic of inflat expect have risen      well  i worri about that   first of all  the evid is not complet clear on that   it is true that there has been an increas  and i have said it is about    basi point  but there is other research  and there is a lot of uncertainti about these measur   i am wonder  if we put that in  whether it will actual caus a problem in term of market reaction  so it worri me a littl   i would probabl be more comfort with what we have in altern c  which is that inflat has been elev and then the reason for upward pressur  i am not sure that this would be help   i don   t feel super strong about it  but the comment of vice chairman   made me a bit more worri about it than i otherwis would have been
thank you   vice chairman
let me just begin with a question becaus i think it is realli central   it goe to the issu of how accommod polici is now   fundament that must be critic to the magnitud of the risk we are take that we are go to get it wrong and inflat in the futur is go to be too high   now  i am not realli part of your profess  but i have alway found this chart to be the most discourag prism on the choic we face
what chart is that
this is the bluebook equilibrium real fund rate chart  but ani way you look at it  the real fed fund rate is closer to best es  of equilibrium than dure ani downturn of the past two decad or similar period of  e   there is no gap between the es  real rate today and the center of the es  of where equilibrium is   if you look back to what that gap was in       in          or in       there was a substanti gap  as most judgment about polici would suggest was necessari   i understand that there is a huge amount of uncertainti about es  of equilibrium  but we can   t be face both the most serious risk of a financi crisi and of a deep  prolong recess in         or    year and at the same  e the risk of have a veri substanti rise in under inflat over the medium term   it seem to me that we are go to have one or the other   the choic we face  of cours  is which risk we are prepar to take   which mistak is the easier to correct for   it is a veri hard judgment to make  but i think we have to be confid that  if we end up be success in avert the risk of a veri  veri danger  damag spiral in the financi market with the consequ of a veri deep recess or a deeper recess than in the earli     s  then we will be abl to deal with the like consequ that we will have more inflat and less moder than we now anticip   i guess i don   t understand whi we would not be confid in that   so let me just say that i don   t think this is easi   like mani of you  i think that it would be great if we got away with     but i think that is not tenabl   not even close in this context  even though it would be nice if we had a consensus in the unit state about a set of fiscal measur that we think would be good on the merit  we can   t make monetari polici in a framework where we condit our action on action by the congress   in an environ like this  it is not possibl   if we do the right thing    that mean it take the pressur off them  mayb  but probabl not so much   but it can   t constrain us from do what is appropri now  just one final thing   peopl who know this stuff quit well  who are reason calm peopl  say     this is possibl the worst financi crisi in    year  and the most challeng set of pressur face the central bank in    or    year      think about that in this context   okay  it is no surpris that we disagre  it is no surpris that the rang of agreement about what we see and what we should do is go to be wide in that context   but just think veri care about the signal it send to the world at this moment to be explicit in public about the degre of dispers about our view   just think care about it becaus this is a special moment  i fulli support the languag and the action in altern a   presid    i would not amend the last sentenc to say    without sacrif    part becaus i think we need to project confid in our capac to manag long term inflat outcom   i am ambival  as you know  mr  chairman  about that claus that presid   suggest we delet about reflect a project level out   the virtu is that it explain and underpin  therefor  the basi for a medium term forecast   the vice in it is that  as the chairman himself said  the first part may seem like a thin reed on which to base our forecast  given what has been happen   i actual think  governor    that acknowledg some indic of inflat expect   it is realli about uncertainti have increas   is help to our credibl   at the margin  it help  even though  sure  you can say that we realli can   t know what they are tell us about the market
may i just ask a question back   i do think that inflat expect are a concern   it is just a question of how the market   and i am not as good at this as the peopl who realli follow the market   and the press will react to this phrase becaus i think that the amount of movement here is still veri small   you know  the kind of number we are talk about for inflat expect are on the order of    to    basi point   will this mention  becaus it is new  rais a flag that will get more attent and more concern than  in fact  is justifi   that is the t i problem here   we should acknowledg it  but again  i am not good enough at wordsmith to figur out how to do that   this is a bit of my concern here   i don   t know if anybodi has ani thought about how to handl it
presid    i think i agre on the last sentenc   i would like to keep it someth that we have use frequent befor and that emphas  in fact  the symmetri of the dual mandat   are there other thought on either the indic of inflat expect or the list of reason that anyon would prefer to chang from where we are
on inflat expect  becaus they haven   t risen veri much  i agre with presid     i like the fact that we tell peopl we are awar  but we could say    have edg higher    or someth like that instead of    risen
we could use my    smidgen    word  but    edg higher    is better
went up a smidg
all right   presid
edg higher    is an unusu phrase
have risen somewhat
i think an issu with    edg higher    is that it realli   sound as though you have some veri specif measur in mind
do you have a thought on    risen    versus    risen somewhat    versus take it out
i think if you take it out that veri much rais the question of what to do with that languag in red about the factor that would push inflat down   it would be tough to drop the inflat expect thought and not have inflat expect mention anywher in the paragraph   there would just be vacant space where you had  at least in previous minut  refer to it
anyon els   bill
ad just the word    slight         risen slight      get to your point
slight    or    somewhat    risen
somewhat    mitig it a littl  or   that highlight it
i   m not sure   i mean  in my mind it mitig it
is    slight    better than    somewhat
somewhat    is bigger than    slight
that is    versus    in the old day
mr  chairman  if i understand the discuss about this  when you say    some indic have risen somewhat     you are get into territori that seem sort of meali mouth
risen a littl
what is wrong with    slight
all right   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i don   t want to prolong this too much  but in respons to the vice chairman   s comment  i am not sure i follow what you are say   i think the model that you show us  in term of where the equilibrium rate is  is a short term model   it is base upon a varieti of es  and output gap  and i think there is plenti of room for disagr around that model   so the fact that we have differ view on this committe is veri healthi  even to the world it can be veri healthi becaus a lot of peopl out there have a differ view of this and are wonder if there is ani varianc of view within this committe   i think that can serv as use a purpos as uniform without object
let me say for the record that i agre with everyth you just said   my onli point is that there is no surpris that we disagre or that it is complic and we have a differ view of the balanc   if anyth  what this chart show is how broad the rang of uncertainti is around this   that was part of my point in say it   but i do think that the valu of the public display of dispers is differ when you have this degre of a confid problem in market general   that is the onli thing i was suggest   i complet agre about the valu of divers of view in this context   it is no surpris that we disagre in this period   my onli suggest is in term of how we think about talk about it public  given that we are at such a delic moment
vice chairman  we have a bubbl develop in some part of our area  i think they are awar of that  and so i think we have to be mind of that in our discuss more broad   that is whi i think there are import differ that we should necessarili be abl to   and should in fact   acknowledg public
okay   have thought about this  i think that    some indic      tone it down a bit   perhap we could just leav it where it is   who know what reaction this will get   again  there is some sens here of tri to ratchet up at least our verbal attent to inflat   let me say to everyon that i went through each of these altern and tri to find one that didn   t make me intens uncomfort   and i am still go through them   these are veri  veri difficult decis   we are all peopl work in good faith  and we are all do the best we can   i appreci the candor and the honest comment  and we will continu to work togeth and to address these veri  veri difficult issu that we have   if you are readi  then perhap we could take a vote
the vote will encompass the direct i   ll read from the bluebook and the statement for  altern a in the chart that you have in front of you     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     chairman bernank vice chairman   presid    governor kohn  governor    governor   presid pianalto   presid    presid  n governor    yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes yes
thank you   we are go to recess for the discount rate  unless there are object  we are go to maintain the   percentag point differ   recess
okay   the next meet is april    and     tuesday and wednesday  a two day meet   we will talk about interest on reserv   and we will meet you short upstair for a lunch in honor of bill pool   the meet is adjourn  end of meet
