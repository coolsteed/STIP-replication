i realiz that we all have to eat dinner  and we all shall  but it   s pointless not to use this  e for more import thing   for exampl  michell smith has volunt to give us a lectur on the epistemolog of the ancient spartan  and i thought we might want to keep our ear tune to her accent as she   it in the origin greek   laughter   but sinc she   s eat  i decid it wouldn   t be nice to call on her   so mayb we ought to get to less import matter like communic polici  let me start off by say this   just the fact that we are have extens discuss on communic polici is an indic that our basic monetari polici  which is by far the most import thing we do  seem to be general on track and not particular controversi   inde  one can look back at our histori and see a polici that sinc      is about as good as a central bank can get it   nonetheless  despit what has realli been a long run of broad success monetari policymak  we find ourselv confront with what to some observ is a seem inabl to communic   i find their argument less than persuas  but i understand the problem   it stem essenti from an episod that aros in the last few month   i   d like to give you my view of what happen and whi  other may have a differ view   the experi put at least some of the issu we will be discuss in the context of where we are and what we have to do  it   s evid that mistak were made both by us in communic and by the market in interpret our messag   it is interest to note the natur of the mistak   i must tell you that i was quit startl when i learn the reason that the ten year note rate went up signific after our    basi point cut in the fund rate in june and our relat statement   the reason was that the market had anticip a signific shift by us to nontradit mean of monetari olici oper   inde  market particip obvious had discount such a shift to a signific extent by drive the ten year rate down to just modest abov a histor low   percent   i look back  and i say     what happen      how did they get the view that there was a suffici high probabl that we were go to use such an approach to lead them to essenti discount it in the market   the market move down almost to where it probabl would have gone if inde we had embark upon an aggress effort   for exampl  to buy long term treasuri note or bond  two thing are obvious in retrospect  and i must say onli in retrospect   one is that there was a general view in the marketplac that we would not reduc the fund rate below    basi point larg becaus of the difficulti that would creat for the intern dynam of the money market   the money market mutual fund issu was onli part of those dynam   second  the belief was that not onli would we start to engag in a further eas of polici but that we would do so at    basi point use a so call nontradit approach  howev  we in fact had conclud that we could go veri signific below    basi point on the fund rate   while we recogn that there would be impedi as we move the rate downward  we felt that  with some dilig  these could all essenti be dealt with   we believ that  if we need to go well below    basi point for econom reason  we had the capac to do so   essenti we recogn   as a consequ of a number of excel studi by the staff   what would happen to the repo market and fail and the implic of move signific quantiti of asset  includ money market fund  to the commerci bank industri   we were awar of what that would do to leverag and of various other problem that would aris were the fund rate to sink well below    basi point   the general conclus of the taff  and i think of the fomc member  was that this would creat some difficulti but  if we need to move the fund rate down further  it would be desir to do so  in light of the market   s belief that we would coupl a cut to    basi point with a move to nontradit mean of conduct open market oper  almost everyon in the market appar was well posit  have alreadi bought bond extens   the truth of the matter is that     we did not view    basi point as a limit and     we had conclud on the basi of evalu of probabl that it was quit unlik that we would need to go to nontradit oper method  in effect  what we kept say to the market is that the probabl of deflat of a pernici sort was remot  but if it happen  it would be a signific danger event  therefor  we felt we need to have on the shelf plan for use the nontradit mean requir to address that possibl   we decid to go all out to find the answer to a number of question   answer we did not have  given the long period we   d had of fiat money in which inflat was rampant and deflat had never enter anybodi   s mind as a problem   the prospect of deflat in this countri had not occur to anyon until the japanes demonstr that it was possibl to have fiat money and deflat   not necessarili of a pernici type but definit deflat  as a consequ of that  we embark upon a full court press to get as much inform as we could on deflat and it implic   we thought about what type of polici would be requir in order to implement an anti deflat polici  and we engag the financi communiti quit extens in this effort   i gather that you  dino  and other at the new york bank and elsewher communic with market particip to learn exact what the implic of deflat might be for various sector of the marketplac   we learn a great eal   at the end of the day  we made an assess of the probabl of various develop and what would happen if they occur  and we thought about what we would do and how we would do it   have conclud our research and brought our knowledg up to date  we effect close the book and put the general plan on the shelf   and we told the marketplac that we had come to two conclus       that    basi point was not  as the market had often suggest  the lower limit   that inde we could go lower   and     that we thought the probabl of our have to use nontradit oper method was remot  now  we use the term    remot    all the  e   i notic that everi one of us who said someth about the deflat issu start off with pretti much standard languag   almost boilerpl   to the effect that the possibl of deflat was remot but this is what we would do if that veri unusu event occur   even in elementari cours in mathemat probabl a remot event remain remot irrespect of the number of  e one mention it    laughter  this turn out to be a misunderstand on the part of mani trader who have a differ way of look at the world   to these peopl  the feder reserv   inde  everi organ   is view as a conspiratori organ  and sinc we continu to talk about deflat  the fact that we use the word    remot    was not the relev issu  but the number of  e we use the word was   therefor  they thought the appropri way to assess the probabl of whether or not we would go out and buy long term bond was to add the number of  e we said    remot     inde  they did that and conclud that the probabl was far better than    percent that we were go to engag in a veri massiv action in the long end of the market  should we have caught that   mayb   i   ve been in these market for year  i don   t even want to mention how long   it never enter my mind that that was the market   s interpret  when i testifi in juli at the senat hear on our monetari polici report  somebodi read to e a statement that bond price had declin becaus the market was disappoint that we had taken purchas long term note off the tabl   and i naiv said that i wasn   t awar that we had taken anyth off the tabl   i didn   t know what they were talk about  what this basic tell us is that the issu of communic is not simpl   there are a lot of peopl who are tell us what we should do  as if they knew   i submit that even the most thought peopl who are give us instruct on what to do would probabl have made exact the same mistak that we made in interpret how the market would read our use of the word    remot      there   s a tendenc for peopl in the market to be surer about what they are say than they could conceiv have reason to be   in the circumst  i mere want to suggest as a prefac to this discuss that it is import that we clarifi what we are say   it   s import first to come to a judgment on how to communic   i gather that most but not all of us are of the belief that we should be say thing over and abov announc the action that we are take   i person happen to think that  inde  there is valu ad in communic not onli what the committe did at an fomc meet but what the reason were and also  import  a general view of the econom outlook as we see it   i think it creat a more effici marketplac if we can communic that  whether we   re right or wrong  so peopl can interpret where we   re come from   that   s not alway easi becaus our press statement are talk for nineteen peopl   so while we can get someth of a central tendenc view  it is quit difficult to do   but i happen to believ that there is valu ad  and by implic valu to gdp  if we are forthcom in tri to communic our view of the futur and the context in which we are make our decis  i   d also argu  howev  that we are a veri power organ of unelect offici  and we owe it to the public   to the elector and everybodi els   to be as transpar as we an be  but with an import caveat   name   in part reflect the fact that market do not work wholli ration   if we are too transpar  we will effect reduc the capabl of this organ to oper in a manner we are requir by statut to do   i have no doubt that if we were oper under full transpar   which essenti would involv have televis camera on us at our meet   we   d all end up read prepar statement   we   d be veri care and noncontroversi  and we would not challeng the view of other member of the committe   that  i think  would veri signific undermin the capabl of the feder reserv system to carri out it respons   so with those open remark  in lieu of a far more interest discuss from michell  i will turn the floor over to   reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that were at your seat when you came in  but you also receiv a copi of these materi from me last thursday   pleas bear with me  but i   d like to begin on a note of parliamentari procedur   it seem to stretch to the break point ani interpret of the committe s rule to argu that member and their altern could gather to discuss it communic polici outsid a formal meet   the choic  then  was to view this as an intermeet consult or an earli start of the septemb    meet   if we had done the latter  our customari procedur would seem to involv inform the press tomorrow morn that the meet had actual start earli  risk the build up of expect that a major chang in your communic polici was brew   we opt for the former becaus it permit an ex post announc of the meet with the releas of the minut for the august meet on thursday   to do this  we will circul a draft summari of this meet to you tomorrow for inclus in the minut   i shall focus the bulk of my remark on what appear to be mani member  immedi concern   the draft and the content of the announc   those concern have arisen  in part  becaus there have been notabl chang in the announc over the past four meet   to facilit your discuss on the subject  my brief will have four part   first  i will offer five general principl that the committe may wish to weigh in choos an announc polici   second  i will review preced establish by the experi of foreign central bank and the committe   s own histori   third  i will suggest some option you might want to consid on how to proceed with regard both to the process of prepar the announc and to the substanc of the announc   as to the latter  i will then address some specif aspect of the languag of the announc  tri to keep the discuss general enough to be appropri for this even   s discuss of the     the materi use by mr  reinhart are attach to this transcript  appendix     ommitte   s procedur rather than tomorrow   s meet on polici choic   sinc februari          the committe   s discuss of communic with the privat sector has center on the announc of it action   i   d note that the first few such releas were explicit bill as statement of the chairman explain the committe   s action   after mid       though  this distinct disappear   i am go to assert that five principl govern the process of produc the statement seem part of the receiv wisdom  or reveal prefer  of the committe  which i list in exhibit     first  the process should respect the import role of discuss at the meet  to circul a singl prospect draft announc or sever propos altern that isol a limit number of the current featur of the economi befor member have discuss their view of econom condit and monetari polici general might stifl that discuss   at the same  e  it is hard to imagin how nineteen peopl around the committe tabl could construct edit a draft releas after their deliber   the most repeat sen ent across the past nine year of transcript is that group edit cannot arriv at an accept result   part of the worri  as in my second point  is that the committe has not seem to want to complic the forg of consensus on polici action   while word are import  it is onli becaus investor have come to expect them to be act upon consist   the risk is that some disagr in the futur about a subordin claus in the fourth sentenc of a draft releas might caus a rift among member who otherwis might agre on the polici action if not the exact word to describ it rational   the event of this summer have shown that the word of the announc can be power   my third observ is that you might want to take the opportun that this potenti influenc provid to increas the effect of your polici action   to settl on a strip down announc becaus it is hard to compromis on anyth more specif might repres an admiss that the committe is unabl to use a potenti import instrument at it dispos   fourth  the committe sure want to avoid mistak   from my experi  draft a press releas share some similar with juggl chainsaw  in that you most spend your  e worri about what can go wrong and then count your digit when you   re done   the less the  e and the greater the number of last minut chang  the more like there will be mistak   fifth  and this almost goe without say  everyon should want to preserv the confidenti of the committe   s decis until it releas   i would not have rais this but for the fact that just in the past year there have been sever instanc in which we have read about the committe   s deliber in newslett less than twenti four hour after the fact   given that realiti  the longer the  e between the decis and the announc  the more like it may becom that there will be eak  either inadvert or otherwis   in light of these five principl  the committe might want to consid the five model for draft an announc present in exhibit     some member might consid the experi immedi prior to the introduct of announc on februari          as relev to today   s discuss   in those day  the committe   s decis were signal to market through open market oper  and onli those associ with chang in the discount rate were announc to the public   except for discuss about the word of the direct  which was releas with a lag  concern about word did not intrud on deliber   howev  the committe did forgo a mean of communic with the public   a variant on this that you might find appeal would be to releas inform limit to the committe   s polici decis   the intend fund rate  perhap a simpl risk assess  and the breakdown of the vote   the committe would have to weigh whatev benefit are seen accru to it deliber against a varieti of cost  not the least includ the like critic that would be levi at perceiv backslid in transpar   the committe might hope to avoid heavi critic of a reduct in the inform content of it polici announc by follow the exampl of the bank of england list in the second row   the monetari polici committe releas a short and direct announc with it action and defer a more complet explan until the public of it minut about two week after it meet   while strip the announc of content beyond the polici action and  perhap  a brief risk assess might seem a step backward on the communic front  the quicker releas of the minut would provid a more nuanc descript of polici choic than can be done even in the current statement   that is whi i place a question mark in the appropri box in the third column on communic   i   m a bit more confid that the expedit product of the minut introduc a greater risk of error   becaus the minut would be releas while the circumst they describ were still relev  market particip would like pay consider more attent to them than they do now   that rais the odd that news report would latch onto ani differ of opinion that were highlight or aspect of the outlook perhap underappreci by the drafter and review in the short window avail to prepar the document   as a consequ  the attent member pay to draft minut and probabl the number of iter in the draft process will have to be step up  with obvious implic for the schedul of nineteen busi peopl   if the committe decid it was import that it announc be accompani by a more complet justif  it might consid the exampl provid by the bank of canada   as shown in the third row  policymak at the bank of canada deliber on rate set and then draft the statement after the polici decis   in their case  this mean delay the announc until just befor the open of trade the next day   by push your announc past      p m   you might accommod a draft session after your polici decis so as to releas an announc the same day   that has advantag  in that the committe   s announc would reflect it complet deliber   howev  an enhanc emphasi on the word of the announc could rais the odd that word would interfer with the committe   s chiev a consensus   even more problemat  draft on the fli risk make mistak  and lengthen the  e between the decis and it announc rais the unwelcom specter of leak   the feder reserv   s experi of the     s provid anoth model  shown in the fourth row   at that  e  the direct to the account manag contain standard concern about the economi  but their order vari with circumst  the bluebook distribut to the committe befor the meet discuss possibl altern order to give member a sens of like possibl   in current circumst  the staff could identifi potenti theme for the descript of the economi in the first full paragraph of the announc consist with the polici altern present in the bluebook  as we did in the section titl    polici announc  direct  and assess of risk    in the most recent one    as a further step  the committe could standard the languag of it risk assess in the second full paragraph so that it would vote on what was to appear in the announc   in circumst when a more substant chang in the announc was contempl   say  as in march or may of this year   a memo could be circul in advanc of the meet no later than on monday afternoon  given these indic of what would appear in the announc  member might be more will to defer consider of the specif word until after the vote on the rate decis and the risk assess   put consider of the word of the announc into play in advanc of the vote on polici might complic forg a consensus  and routin the form of the risk assess might limit it effect in communic with the public   howev  the committe may well view do both as a reason compromis to ensur that it decis are base on full and complet inform   this be the feder reserv  maintain the status quo is alway an option   the committe could routin review a prepar draft statement after the polici decis  with the advantag and disadvantag note in the bottom row   as to process go forward  of these five possibl  implement the model of your anglo saxon counterpart would probabl requir the most lead  e   if you decid to emul the bank of england  the secretariat will have to speed up it draft schedul  which may take a meet or two to implement   if you opt for the bank of canada model  market particip would have to be given some advanc warn that the announc would be delay past      p m   perhap in the minut that will be releas this thursday   of cours  the committe could abandon or sharpli reduc the content of the statement at ani  e   it is onli a matter of decid when you are best posit to accept the critic that may well follow   the rapid with which you can make the risk assess more routin so that you could vote on what is publish  as in the fourth row  depend on whether you are comfort with the current three part structur that was adopt in may   that is the first of sever question about the content of the announc that are flag in your final exhibit   again  are you satisfi with a three part assess that individu list the relat threat to your  goal of maximum sustain econom growth and price stabil and that weight those threat in an overal balanc   the decis in may to split the old balanc of risk assess into the first two compon has seem to serv the committe well  as it appear now to cover all the relev possibl confront the economi  but member have express differ opinion on the wisdom of then combin the two differ judgment in the third sentenc  individu word in the announc also seem to have taken on differ mean for differ member at differ  e   in particular  as in the second question  the committe may want to settl on what it mean by    sustain    econom growth   in the report of the   subcommitte in       sustain growth seem to serv as a stand in for expans at the growth rate of the economi   s potenti to produc   in more recent announc  the same word may be read to impli the growth pace consist with avoid the creation of econom imbal  therebi implicit introduc a notion of the level of econom activ relat to the level of it potenti   member might also have concern about whether the word    risk    carri negat connot that might be avoid by speak of the balanc of probabl or the odd of outcom on both side of their median forecast   fourth  committe member may have doubt concern whether the    forese    futur is too slipperi a concept to provid guidanc to the public as to it view of the outlook   but be specif about that  e dimens now may limit your option at a later date   similar concern may also be rais about    the consider period of  e    in the last sentenc of the august announc  which conclud my list of question   i won   t speak about this issu beyond that becaus it seem woven inextric into the polici debat schedul for tomorrow and is unlik to be a long last featur of the announc   these may be too mani option to tackl at onc   one strategi would be to identifi your main area of concern and pick them off one by one in an increment approach over  e   anoth would be to use this meet to identifi problem and charg the staff or a subcommitte to come back at a later date with more specif altern   do so  howev  may delay progress in improv the announc for a  e   as to other issu not direct relat to the announc  the first day of next januari   s two day meet has been reserv to talk about the committe   s communic polici onc again
let me just add to     s comment   the procedur we current are use to communic are essenti ad hoc   they have been work in the sens that we have succeed in releas by      p m  on the day of the meet a press statement on which we   ve gotten the general agreement of the committe   this has noth to o with the issu of lack of communic to the market   this has to do with our own intern practic  it strike me that we have been fortun  becaus i think we in fact are tri to do someth that in the long run is not possibl   name  we are tri to craft a statement by nineteen peopl  which i hope everyon agre is just not feasibl   if we ever did it  no one would want to read it   or they shouldn   t   the practic of releas the press statement at      p m  on the afternoon of the meet put us in a posit of drop on the tabl a draft statement that a signific number of the member of the committe have not seen befor  fortun  we have not had consider diverg between the view held by individu member and those express in the draft   but i can   t imagin that that   s a proper way to go about do this becaus at some point we   re go to run into a set of serious differ within the committe and it   s go to take a long  e to resolv them   we could veri well run beyond the self impos      p m  deadlin   that could creat a lot of difficult problem  in ani event  it realli isn   t fair to drop on you a draft   grant it   s onli a paragraph or two   and ask that you make a judgment on whether it communic what we are think  that   s especi the case when the action is not someth that is in disput by the marketplac becaus the statement then becom a critic vehicl by which we convey the substanc of our discuss at the meet   so we have to find a mean to communic somehow to the full committe what the various option will be in the statement we will look at subsequ to the vote   there are a number of way of do that  and i think we do have to move in that direct  otherwis we are take too mani risk that someday   when the decis are get difficult and the economi is chang in a manner on which we don   t have full consensus   the way we current forg the press statement will caus us problem   if it is not the general belief among he committe member that we   re all look at the same thing on the econom landscap  we will find that this particular process is go to serv us quit poor  i would suggest that the solut to this problem  in my judgment anyway  has to meet sever requir   one is that we should not have everi member involv in tri to draft a statement dure the meet itself   two  we ought to have a form of communic in advanc of the meet that would enabl individu member  should they see someth in the contempl word of the announc to which they cannot acquiesc  to so inform the secretariat   that way we can tri to captur a consensus from the committe in advanc of our endeavor to draft the statement   i think that is feasibl  we cannot and should not tri to draft a seri of statement and send them out in advanc for everybodi to look at   first of all  i think that would be extrem  e consum   second  i have a concern that it would be the focus of the discuss at the meet rather than a statement that reflect that discuss   in effect by send out earli draft  we would risk the possibl that the draft would distract us from concentr on the area of the economi we normal discuss  and i don   t think that is a good idea   i don   t know where we   re go to come out today or  if we don   t come out with a clear plan today  where we will come out when we talk again about our communic polici   is that at our januari meet
yes  in januari
i do think that our experi of the last sever year highlight the difficulti we confront in tri to reach a consensus when we have a rang of opinion on one issu or anoth   we have to solv that problem   as far as i can see  the problem we   ve had in shift to the kind of statement we   ve issu recent have caus veri ittl damag   but i think that   s part good fortun and not necessarili good manag or good judgment   i don   t think we can take the risk of leav that type of problem unresolv  as i said at the begin  the fact that communic is the problem and not the fundament of what we do   name  what the target fund rate is  how soon we move  and the size of ani chang   suggest that we are handl those big thing rather well   communic should be a relat modest part of what we do   the fact that we have the luxuri to spend a good deal of  e on it is an indic that the rest of our world  if i can put it that way  is run satisfactorili  let me call for a small break at this  e so everybodi can go get dessert   but let   s come back as quick as we can  and we   ll resum with question to     then we   ll go to a broad discuss of the issu   i might add for those of you who have specif point of view that differ from what   laid out or from what i laid out  we will use the discuss period for you to expound on your view   if your commentari get too extend  peopl will get up and leav   laughter   whi don   t we take a short break   dessert break
what i   d like to do first is to open up the floor for question to     then i   d like to have those who want to make small present of their point of view  which are somewhat differ from or in contradict to     s  take the floor for an appropri amount of  e   after that we   ll have an open discuss  and you can put on the tabl various idea or talk about your concern regard what we   ve done   let   s see if we can get most of that out of the way and complet this even  if possibl   question for    r  hoenig    mr  chairman  i have a question about someth you said   i   ll ask for     s interpret of it so i can get this question on the tabl now    laughter   you were talk about want to inform the market about our outlook for the futur   i think that   s what you were say in your open comment
well  go all the way back  that   s what the tilt
that   s what i want to clarifi   are we talk about the risk we see today and how we interpret those risk   or are we talk about take the statement further  as we did last  e  in term of polici in the forese futur   what is the intent
it could be both
first of all  there realli is no such thing as an accur forecast   we don   t have ani capac as such to forecast how the economi will evolv   all we   re do is extrapol current imbal and assess how they might resolv themselv in the futur   i   m mere communic that  in my judgment  we have to go beyond the individu action we take and continu to indic how we view the outlook   in that regard  what we do now i think we do rather well  frank   my own view is that if we could somehow find a way to make what we have been do in the last two or three month stabl and function  that would be ideal   i do believ that indic our view of the balanc of risk is wholli appropri as a way for us to fulfil our oblig to the public in term of be transpar   make a forecast  sn   t add anyth becaus those forecast  in my view anyway  aren   t veri valuabl
i think it   s import to be clear what we mean when we talk about the futur   if we   re talk about the balanc of risk we see today base on the inform urrent avail  that   s one thing   if we suggest that our assess of the risk impli a futur action on our part  then i think we   ve gone beyond what we can reason do as far as predict the futur
i would say that we have to be veri care not to commit the committe to ani seri of futur action  which would necessarili impli that we know how the economi is go to evolv   we may feel reason certain about it  but we   ve been wrong too often in the past  and i think the cost of a mistak of that sort is veri larg   that   s my view
that   s help to me   thank you
let me say this   i think what we have been do is fine  for exampl  i would not have chang anyth that we   ve done in the past two or three month on the basi of what has been happen in the marketplac and what peopl have said   my own judgment is that  if the economi in june had look the way it did in april  we would have made a    to    basi point adjust in the fund rate  and probabl half of it would have been unwound by now   the brouhaha essenti has occur becaus we are right on the fulcrum of a chang in attitud in the marketplac   when we drop our set of conclus on the market  that pretti much exacerb the signific increas that were alreadi occur  part as a result of the ongo convex of delta hedg   the market proceed to put everyth togeth in one fell swoop and attribut it to us   well  thank you  but no thank you   so  i think the answer to your question is that what we   re do now fulfil our oblig in term of what we ought to be do   in my view the problem is how we come to a conclus on the particular statement we should make to the public at the end of our meet
presid pool  r  pool   mr  chairman  if i may  i   d like to follow up on the discuss that tom hoenig
rememb  these are question for     we haven   t gotten to member    view on the substanc
okay   let met tri to sharpen this issu by say that i think we need to make a clear distinct between two type of comment in our press statement   one type is a hint or guidanc about the like level of the feder fund target at our next meet or the one after that and the other is a condit statement about where the fund rate might go depend on how the economi evolv
may i interrupt you   you   re into part two of this discuss   you may have the floor after peopl have ask question or clarif of     there may well be some question or clarif issu  so let   s get those out of the way and then move on
well  i guess i   m say that i didn   t think that distinct was veri clear in what   had put on the tabl
that   s what you   re go to tell us about in a few minut after other have rais their question    paus   well  mayb   has been perfect clear    anybodi els have question for   on the substanc of what he said   if not  presid pool    laughter
i prepar two chart and  if i may  i   ll pass them around   there are certain enough for everyon at the tabl and probabl for those sit on the perimet as well  i   ll wait until the chart are distribut   the purpos of my explor here was to tri to get a sens of how frequent the econom situat has chang over the year  even over a span of     the materi use by mr  pool are attach to this transcript  appendix     hree month  so that we decid to move the fund rate or the market anticip that we will move it   that   s the purpos of this chart   if everyon has a copi  i   ll tri to explain what it show  to tri to keep thing as simpl as i could  the basic data i use were from the feder fund futur market   i   ve plot the daili quot on the busi day closest to the fifteenth of the last month of the quarter and the contemporan forecast in the futur market as indic by the trade for the contract that is three month ahead   so for the march     let   s say  the contract for march is the current  or actual  rate   then there   s the futur rate as of march    for the june contract   okay   the red dot show what the market was anticip on that three month ahead horizon   the black line show what i   m call the actual chang   it   s the differ between the current month   s contract   let   s say the march contract as quot on march      and the june contract as quot on june     what is fair clear is that most of the  e the market predict a rate chang over this three month horizon of about    basi point  and often it is quit a bit less   but over  e there are mani case in which develop have push the rate a good deal more than that   the reason i use three month was that it   or someth in the rang of three month to six month   seem like to be what mani peopl think of as the    forese futur     in term of the languag that we   ve use in the balanc of risk statement   so i   m say that even over a three month period  which is not all that long  histor lot of thing have happen that have led the committe to chang the fund rate   the chart on the other side of the page is just a scatter diagram of the same data  it show how far off the actual is from the predict rate defin in this way  he point that i   m get at here relat to whether provid a tilt is help   when we talk about the tilt languag   i guess it was in late        i was one of those in favor of the decis we made at that  e to announc the tilt at the conclus of each meet   i favor do that becaus i thought it would provid guidanc to the market  look ahead  as to where our polici might be go and what our think was   but i   ve sinc come to a differ opinion on that becaus so often someth happen in the mean  to chang the situat to such an extent that provid that guidanc has as much chanc of mislead as of help the market  i think this is a topic that we should spend some  e on   to what extent do we want to provid inform such as the tilt statement or a hint that is more or less specif about the futur path of the feder fund rate in an uncondit sens   tri to explain how we logic will respond to new inform is an extrem import function  but i think that   s a difficult concept to get across   that   s the topic that i was chomp at the bit to talk about
i   m surpris that the correl is as good as it is
it   s onli a three month horizon
i understand that  but actual i would have expect a wider scatter than your chart show
i think the reason the scatter is as narrow as it is reflect the fact that there are a lot of observ when not much is go on and the market  sn   t expect much  if ani  chang   the first part of      was such a period  when the rate stay in a veri narrow band for a while   obvious  the         period was quit differ  as was       although the market anticip some rate chang in       onc the fomc start to move the fund rate   in fact  the rate chang outran what the market had anticip by a fair amount   rememb  what i have hart here are chang   in the last year or so  the market has not expect us to chang the rate veri much  although on a coupl of occas we did a good bit more than the market anticip  when i read dave     s histori of fomc communic  i was struck by the histor experi go well back   dave cover a long period  and most of it was befor we began to issu a polici statement  but hint about the futur direct of polici were given at  e   primarili by the chairman in speech or tes oni  the instanc when the fomc got itself most tangl up had to do with set up expect in the marketplac about what futur polici move were like to be   we had the biggest difficulti when those expect were not realiz or when they tend to put the committe in a box becaus of a sens that we had made some sort of a commit and circumst chang so that follow through didn   t seem the wisest thing to do
anybodi can jump in on the discuss   i   ll just give my initi respons to presid pool   s observ   i think you   re describ the way the market work and rais the question of whether inform help the market   let me give an exampl of someth not dissimilar to the market we   re deal with  name the long term crude oil futur market   those futur market are interest in the sens that they are larg anchor to a long term equilibrium price of crude oil six to seven year out   that price essenti reflect the convent knowledg of the technolog at the  e and how long it would take to bring new sourc of oil on the market   for exampl  the market current are say that the equilibrium price is     a barrel or thereabout  what that has done  if you look at the futur market  is that the contract are all anchor out there in the               area   as a consequ  irrespect of the short term price  there are those   especi small  independ riller   who have to make judgment as to whether they should in fact drill   it will take a long  e to drill  so they essenti sell in the forward market whatev amount of oil they think they will get   the futur price facilit the decisionmak that is involv at that particular  e  but one thing about those crude oil futur market is that they are aw forecast   you will find that they project the market poor becaus all sort of event that affect the market occur in the interim     that mean that they are of no valu to the function of the crude oil market  i would say on the contrari   they actual affect the futur  they essenti distribut demand and suppli not onli in spot market but over the futur   even though their forecast capabl is veri poor and  inde  far less accur than the predict capabl of the fed fund futur market depict here in this chart  so i think there is a valu  even if it is increment  in our communic in a manner in which the market can understand our think   you mention the      period and the fact that noth happen with respect to fund rate then   well  the fact that noth happen is import   to basic say that the economi is go to be dull for the next sever month and that the feder fund rate is not like to chang is a profound import statement if you believ it   to say someth is not go to chang involv as much risk as say that it will chang becaus our abil to look out there and make that judgment is limit   you may consid your data to indic a poor correl   i think the fact that the quadrant are correct is essenti communic some inform to the market that it did not have previous   in that regard  i think we do a servic to the market by endeavor to communic   as poor as we do it   the general expect of the balanc of risk among the committe member
with regard to anchor expect  i absolut agre with respect to the long term inflat rate   i think anchor those expect is critic import   but ou   ve yet to convinc me that anchor expect on the number of basi point the feder fund rate is go to move over a period of a relat few month is construct
well  if it were not instruct  this correl would be a random distribut or it would be negat   rememb  it   s not negat
no  i don   t draw that conclus becaus even if we didn   t say anyth about the probabl direct of the feder fund rate  the market would have some understand of how the economi is like to evolv   for exampl  there   s a lot of persist in real gdp and employ chang   so the market has some understand as to the probabl of where the economi is go to go and  therefor  where interest rate are go to go   and  of cours  that   s what is built into the term structur of interest rate at ani moment in  e   there is also an extens volum of literatur   and governor bernank can help me with this   on exact how the expect model of the term structur of interest rate work   clear  the term structur reflect market expect about where rate are go to go   that was true befor      and would be independ of anyth that we might have said about that   but what i   m concern about is that we want those expect to respond to the incom inform as accur as possibl
i agre with what you just said   take as a given that the avail of factual inform about the economi is an ongo phenomenon and that the market is respond as it   in a fair sophist way   the question is  if we superimpos on them our view of the outlook  do we do harm  are we irrelev  or do we do good   in order to determin that i would creat this sort of scatter diagram   if the data point were in the wrong quadrant  we certain should stop becaus we   re do harm   if this were a wholli random distribut  i   d say that we   re not do harm and we   re not do good  but we   re wast our ime   i   m submit that the evid you   re adduc this even strike me as confirm that  while we may not be ad a great deal  we are ad someth  this is a posit correl  and it seem reason certain that you have enough observ here that the correl is signific differ from zero   is that correct
yes  of cours
i take that as evid that we are make a contribut over and abov the evid of how the economi is do becaus the market   s assess of that evid is alreadi built in when we make our statement   i grant you that part of what   s built in is an expect of what our statement will be  but this   not strike me as an indic that we are do ani harm   to be as conserv as i can in judg this  i would say that there is no evid here to suggest that we are do harm to the marketplac as a consequ of our action
i would say that provid guidanc on our think about the direct of the real economi and the inflat outlook is construct   what i am concern about is provid guidanc about the like level of the feder fund rate at the next meet or the one after that
well  i hope we  ˜re tri not to do that   i would agre with you on that   we should not be tri to communic what we   re go to do at the next meet  if we believ that an action need to be taken  we might as well do it now
i   m tri to sharpen that distinct
if that   s the conclus you   re reach  i   m on your side on that argument  r  bernank   i also agre with you on that  bill   the technic distinct you   re make  as you mention in your remark  relat to the idea that the economi is in a ration expect equilibrium where everyon has the same inform   in that case  anyth the fed say is go to be redund   on the other hand  as the chairman said  it would be harmless as well  there are sever reason that we might not be in a ration expect equilibrium  one is that the outsid world  sn   t have all the inform we have   they may not have inform about our object   they may not have inform about our view on the economi  which may be relev even if they   re wrong   for those reason  what we say might be instruct to the public   in particular  condit inform that we provid  which essenti give insight into our rule  would be use to the outsid world  i might add a further thought here   i attend a veri interest confer at jack guynn   s atlanta fed in march about learn  which is a big area of research in macroeconom these day   it look at the way in which an economi get to a ration expect equilibrium  as you probabl know  one of the most studi question in that field is whether or not peopl  use all the inform they have but without be given inform by the central bank  can learn   with  say  least squar or other methodolog   the ration expect equilibrium  what we often find in those model is that even veri sophist player will end up in subop  equilibrium   failur of equilibrium to exist  multipl equilibrium   the notion is that becaus peopl do not know the true rule  they will behav in a veri volatil way  which will induc volatil behavior on the part of the central bank  which in turn will make it veri difficult to learn and so on  he point is that there are a number of reason to think that the fed has use inform   i   m actual quit in agreement that we shouldn   t be give uncondit inform about our interest rate set   we should be tri to guid the market by provid condit forecast about which direct our polici will be go in light of our object  our view  or the natur of our rule
and depend on how the economi evolv
yes  condit on how the economi is like to evolv
i think you said    will be go      you didn   t mean to say    will
may be go
yes  may be go    for exampl  our    consider period    statement was intend to say   and did in fact say as origin written and befor it was amend   that we think inflat will be low for a long period and if inflat remain low  we should be abl to keep interest rate low   that was in fact the way it was in the origin draft and that   s how it should be said   as a condit statement about the way our polici is like to be  not an uncondit statement about polici
mr  chairman  i was plan to comment on some of the point that were made by   and by implic you as well   is this the right  e    laughter
we   re now in open session
okay   let me start by note that i have never thought it was clear that the post meet press releas was a statement of the fomc   i alway consid it more the chairman   s statement than the committe   s  and i thought it was present at the meet ost for inform purpos about how polici would be communic to the public  howev  if the statement is to be use as an ongo polici tool of the committe  then in my view it should be draft in a way that reflect the view of the committe in set polici   for exampl  if a risk assess is includ in the press statement  then it should be the same one that was vote for by the committe and not a restat or reinterpret of it   if the word in the bluebook isn   t suitabl for the press releas  then it probabl should be chang
i happen to agre with that and would recommend that heartili  as i   ve been do for year without success   sorri to interrupt
again  i   d feel more comfort vote for a particular risk assess if i knew in advanc exact how it would be express to the public   given this general principl that the statement should be from the committe  the remain question revolv around how the committe will draft it statement   one choic to be made is whether various altern word will be avail to the committe in advanc or whether the statement will be compos and edit dure the meet   my prefer is for the former   anoth choic is whether to reli more on formula word option or whether to use languag basic tailor to each meet   i prefer primarili formula word   i think some of the recent press releas were too nuanc and inadvert inject nois into the bond market   in general  i   m not convinc that includ more word in the releas necessarili advanc the caus of transpar  in term of process  i suggest that we    routin     to use     s term  the word option for much of the statement and circul altern in advanc   edit should be a last resort in which word chang are suggest and then approv or reject by the committe  in term of content  the word of the risk assess is at  e ambigu to me and should e consid a work in process   i feel it has been use to separ the risk  but they still need consider clarif   for exampl  the refer to the risk to econom activ should includ a level concept in my view  and i don   t think the current phrase is up to that task
by level you mean what
some idea that we   re talk about the gap  sort of a taylor rule
if we knew what the gap was
right   but we know at  e that it   s get larger or get smaller   at least we have some view about that  otherwis it   s a littl difficult to make polici
well  we do have view   but you   re go a littl further than i think we actual can   let me rais one question   unless i   m mistaken  it seem that the actual statement of the balanc of risk can be formula   i still don   t see whi it has to be differ in the bluebook and in our statement   what is the argument   i rememb that the statement we use origin had unbeliev archaic languag
the    could        would     and    might
it was bizarr   we got rid of the    would        could     and    might     and we were left with still part archaic languag  in my view   is there ani reason that we can   t make the statement on which we vote the exact statement that is in the draft press releas
none whatsoev  mr  chairman
what are the argument against it
i think we evolv into the current situat by work from what was an imperfect assess of the risk   that is  the balanc of risk languag   we tri first to make that sow   s ear into a silk purs  and it didn   t quit work   becaus the statement were hang  it didn   t seem possibl to be abl to present to the committe the exact word that they   d be vote on   after the decis in may to split the risk assess into two part  with a third sentenc provid the balanc   if the committe feel that   s the appropri structur   i don   t think there   s ani reason you couldn   t agre on a formula present of the risk assess that could be in the bluebook
well  let   s break bob   s argument into two piec   it seem to me  in the context of what you mention earlier  that there is no reason that we can   t have in the bluebook the exact languag for various choic on which the committe might vote  and then that languag would appear in the statement   that   not requir a good deal of effort  as we   ve been discuss  the other part of the statement is essenti the rational for our decis  which we also need to describ   the languag regard whi we came out in a particular direct cannot be formula becaus differ reason occur all the  e   but i see no reason that the staff cannot paraphras in the bluebook differ altern of what might be said in justif for a posit that the committe might ul  adopt   therefor  when we vote  the explicit languag and a generic form of the explan as to whi we are vote that way is part of the vote  after the vote  we would present the draft statement  which would be compos of the exact formula languag and presum a bit more styliz or nuanc languag regard whi we did what we did   undoubt peopl will have differ of view  but in that process we   ve creat the possibl that two third or three fourth of all the inform that a committe member would want to know with respect to the statement is avail in the bluebook   if there is a serious question as to how the statement will come out  i think there   s more than enough  e to communic with   and indic that there are problem   i   m ust tri to think about the  e issu a bit more   how much of the bluebook is tie into the  book
everyth   in the sens that the bluebook has to be produc after the  book
yes  it has to be produc after the forecast  but i   m tri to get at the question of whether there is enough  e to get back to     when   everybodi receiv the bluebook   i know when it arriv on my desk  sever   thursday
thursday  now that it   s sent electron
everybodi get it at the same  e
it   s post electron thursday night
okay  i was think in term of the nineteenth centuri and deliveri by poni express   then there   s no problem   i do think we have to have a mechan  if a signific minor take issu with certain languag  to communic that by  say  friday befor the tuesday meet   we would need some formal mechan to make a judgment as to how that affect or  sn   t affect this process   origin  when we start issu a statement after the meet  we made those statement in my name   i didn   t think that was appropri   if i go out and make a speech  that   s one thing   but no matter what we do  the statement we make about the polici decis at an fomc meet should be a committe statement   we may not be abl to agre to languag about the reason that we took a certain action   the languag in the press releas  if it repres a committe statement  basic say that twelv peopl came to a conclus for the same reason  which is not alway the case   so if we can   t agre on word about the rational for our decis  then i think we are forc to go ack to plain formula languag on what we did without explain whi we did it   in my view  that would be unfortun  but it may be necessari
when you say get back to    i want to clarifi what you mean   for exampl  if we use the current bluebook  the staff set out two altern   i assum there would be a discuss about each and the onli question would be how the verbiag associ with one of those altern should be modifi
yes  you would call up and say  for exampl     i happen to be in favor of altern    but the reason you give in the bluebook are not the one i consid the appropri reason for come to that conclus      if the staff give all the potenti altern  then that   s not an arguabl issu   the onli arguabl issu is that the rational for ani particular posit that we might take is not a valid one
i would hope   wouldn   t have too great a burden as a result of that  i hope the languag would stick to what i   d call the high point   i don   t want to use the word    formula
one thing i would point out is that there   s a lot of inertia in the word of the first paragraph on the descript of the economi   so i think the bluebook could highlight that  if you decid to take this polici option  say  the sentenc character the labor market presum would have to chang   implicit in that is the assur that there would be no reason to chang a sentenc that was still relev given that polici choic   so it might not be that just two third of the word would be predic in advanc of the polici decis but closer to three quarter or more of the word
okay   presid broaddus  r  broaddus   mr  chairman  i would approach this a littl differ   i found     s memo veri use in organ my think about this   so  i   d start with his five principl  and i would add a sixth  which is that in communic with the market about polici and expect it   s import not to put too big a burden on the statement   or tri to do thing with the statement that are not feasibl   i think we might have tri to do that a bit in this period  and i believ that might have been part of the problem   one can argu that point  i suppos   in particular  i person feel that it   s import to resist ani temptat to use the statement to tri to engin expect in the marketplac about what   s go to happen to polici set or to the fund rate at some point in the futur   i don   t think we can do that consist   even if we   re not tri to do it  i believ we need to do what we can to avoid give the impress that we might be do that  let me emphas that in say this i am not argu for reduc transpar but for be transpar about the thing that realli matter and about which we can be confid   with that in mind  it seem to me that the place to start in reduc the burden on the statement is to be more explicit and clearer about our inflat object   for exampl  we could announc our intent to hold core pce inflat in a   to   percent target rang while continu to take account   as we do today   of both inflat and real output   i recogn that the propos to introduc inflat target has been controversi in this committe   but in view of some of the problem we   ve had with communic late  it seem to me that there   s an argument for take anoth look at that approach   if we tie inflat expect down firm with a target rang  then market could routin and continu make inform judgment about how sen ent in this committe   whether inflat is a concern or deflat is a problem   is evolv over  e   market player could assess that by just look at the behavior of actual nflation in relat to the target rang   we might need to add someth to our polici statement about how we intend to get inflat back in the neighborhood of the target rang if at some point it move away from the rang   but we would not need to reli on ad hoc addit to or delet from the statement that run the risk of be ignor or amplifi or general misunderstood in the market  what that mean to me is that we could have a statement that is more formula in charact  along the line of what bob parri was just say  which i person think would be a good thing   also  just as an asid here  your suggest for make the statement the basi of what we vote on is a good one  among the five altern model you   ve shown here     i suppos my approach would be closest to the bank of england model   obvious  clarifi the inflat object and expedit the minut would take the pressur off the statement  which could then be reduc to it essenti   but it would put a burden on the prepar of the minut   norm and   are good friend  and i don   t want to lose their friendship   so i would hasten to add that if we were to go in this direct  we would have to augment our resourc for prepar the minut to whatev extent necessari to make that a feasibl and manag process   i think the addit burden in that area would be justifi by reliev us of the need to use the statement to send detail   and at  e potenti complic or confus   messag to the market   the market would be make it judgment base on a crucial  central phenomenon that it could observ in the context of a veri clear state object that we have announc
let me just comment that we do have an inflat object   it   s call price stabil   it   s not that we don   t have a target  we just don   t announc it   it   s interest that the discuss alway seem to get to the issu of inflat target   the ssue is not the pros and con of announc a target that we actual have but what to do if that target is not be achiev  i want to call to everybodi   s attent the most egregi form of that problem  which is the ecb   s m  problem   the ecb had conclud that an m  target  if follow appropri  would be the most effectu in stabil the european economi  so the ecb had a target for m    m  never work   most of the  e in discuss polici the ecb had to explain whi m  was not do what it was suppos to be do   now  i submit to you that it   s one thing to get out there and say this is what we will do   that we have an inflat target of between   and   percent and this is what we   re go to do to achiev it   that   s all well and good   but what do we do when inflat is right at either   percent or   percent   do we take action to make it stay within the rang   more often than not  as histori has indic to us  that  sn   t work   then we   d have to explain whi it didn   t work   or  if we chose not to take action to keep inflat within our target rang  we   d have to explain whi   suppos the target rang was   to   percent  and inflat was up at the   percent level   the polici would call for us   as in new zealand  for exampl   irrespect of whatev els was happen  to liter rais rate   at that point in  e  all other evid might be indic that the economi is in the process of sag  and the last thing the central bank would want to do in those circumst is to rais rate  it strike me that  if we had a   to   percent inflat target and had not announc it  we would be free at that particular point to make a judgment as to whether to tighten or not   it   s not clear to me   and it has never been explain to me to my satisfact   what the cost   benefit analysi is on announc inflat target   for a central bank not to have inflat target is not to be a central bank   the question is not that   the question is  do you announc the target   if ou do  then you   re confront with the issu of whether you will absolut adher to that rule  and you face the distinct possibl that you will fail in achiev your end  now  presum  we can alway succeed on the upsid   we can tighten enough to guarante that we will bring the economi down far enough to prevent inflat from breach the upper limit of the target   we cannot guarante success on the downsid   the japanes have demonstr that veri clear   as i think all of our discuss about the zero bound suggest  even an inflat rate of   percent creat serious problem   it   s not clear to me what we   d gain by announc a numer target for inflat   everyon say we   d gain credibl   i don   t have a clue what that mean   and there is no evid of which i   m awar that tell me that announc a target improv the perform of the central bank  as i was mention to one of our colleagu the other day  i rememb a wonder littl studi that was done on the bundesbank at the height of it    credibl      somebodi came up with a conclus that the bundesbank   s sacrific ratio was no better than anybodi els   s   i said to myself  well  if that   s the case  what is the valu of credibl   what   it do for you  most import  what   it mean  as far as i   m concern  put togeth the issu of inflat target and announc inflat target as one packag make no sens when they   re obvious divis   to me the cost   benefit analysi of announc has never been demonstr   inde  we don   t even know for sure that those who are practic that approach and announc their inflat target will do better in the next period of inflat   i will put it to you this way   if in the next inevit period of inflat  those who announc their inflat target do better than those of us who don   t  i will chang my point of view  r  broaddus   can we get that in the minut    laughter   could i just make one respons to that  mr  chairman   i certain hear your comment  and i must say that i don   t think that explicit inflat target is a silver bullet or that it   s go to solv all the problem we face   but in the context of this discuss  i would like to use an exampl   and mayb i   m violat the admonit not to get too close to the current situat   suppos we current had a rang of   to   percent for the core pce   we are now at the lower bound and may be push a bit below it   again  have an announc target wouldn   t solv all the world   s problem  but i think it would add someth import   name  that the market and the public should have a veri clear understand that the risk in the outlook with respect to inflat is on the downsid  they would know that it clear would be a condit factor in some way in our polici go forward   it would elimin ani need for us to feel that we must elabor our statement in an ad hoc way   i don   t know that we   re necessarili do this now   at some point down the road   i would be veri concern about the longer run type of steadi state communic relationship between the market and the fed that such an approach might creat
let   s take that exampl   is there anybodi in the marketplac today whom we have fail to convinc that we   re not go to do anyth on the fund rate for a while   look at the feder fund futur market
but we had to make an explicit statement to that effect
okay  but let me go further   the scenario is as follow  the core pce  which is a month seri  pop abov a rate of   percent   we are high accommod   do we go back to neutral at that point or when the pce is at     percent   what do we do   in short  suppos we do go back to neutral and then find that the next month the tatist goe back down   you see  it   s one thing to say we   re go to do someth  but oper we have to deal with number  if you have a rule  either you adher to it vigor and unequivoc  with no except  or you deviat from it and give reason that you are not follow it   but in order to do the latter  you have to have a set of principl that determin when you will deviat from the strict rule   if you have a strict rule then you don   t have to discuss deviat   you liter act in accord with the rule   the rule say when the core pce rate as publish by the bureau of econom analysi fall below   percent  the feder fund rate will be reduc by some formula   if it goe back abov   percent  you revers the action  in other word  if we have a strict rule  the market will know exact what we will be do as a consequ of the rule   inde  we don   t have to have ani meet becaus it   s automat   to the extent that we don   t automat follow the rule  then the question is what principl determin when we deviat from the rule and when we appli it   i submit to you that  if we have that sort of principl  then that is the rule  and the actual rule from which we deviat is not oper   that  inde  is what we do today   i   m not clear what we gain by publish target that we say we are go to adher to when we know we   re not go to adher to them  and when we are not follow them  i am sure we   re go to have to spend a consider amount of  e explain whi   if you think it   s difficult to come to a conclus of this committe as to whi we   re do someth  tri get agreement on whi we   re not do someth    laughter   that is go to be even more difficult  as i said to you  al  i   m not against inflat target per se   if it can be demonstr that it actual work   that the mere stipul of a target that is announc actual condit the marketplac so that inde the target has an effect   i will admit that i am wrong   i will jump o the other side on this issu  as bill pool did on announc the tilt   but there has been no definit test of this   i would suspect that  when inflat occur  those central bank that have not announc inflat target will do as well or as poor as those that have   if that turn out to be the case  then the posit valu of inflat target  sn   t exist   but the negat valu   have to explain whi we   re not adher to the target   creat a veri serious problem   i don   t see what announc inflat target   for us
well  i don   t want to take more than my share of  e  but i would like to respond to a coupl of thing you said   the object you rais are whi i said inflat target is not a magic bullet  there are problem   if we were explain whi we use inflat target  i   d say  yes  there would be issu and we would have to deal with those   as i view such use  though  we certain wouldn   t be react to one month   s data   presum we would be look at a longer period of  e than that   to continu with the current exampl  in answer to a point you rais  if the measur move back abov the   percent lower limit   presum it   s a littl below that by some measur now   that  sn   t mean that we would have to react immedi to bring rate back to neutral
becaus the inflat measur would still be close to the lower limit of it rang   there would still be a risk   this would give content to the statement
suppos bea revis the number from abov   percent to below   percent in the middl of the month   they do revis the number   they could publish an initi number of a     percent annual rate of inflat and find out that they made a mistak  suppos they then revis their data and move the rate down to     percent   what do we do  r  broaddus   i don   t think we   d necessarili have to do anyth in that particular scenario
i hope not
i think we could easili explain that
if we   re go to go with inflat target   where we actual stipul what our target are and say we will act to achiev them   i think we first have to go through a full court press of liter simul all the situat that could aris and how we might respond   we need to decid what principl will determin our respons and how we   re go to convey that principl   the rule that would prompt us to move or not to move  rememb  if we have an explicit rule from which we never deviat  this committe will adjourn   it has no function   milton friedman would have gotten exact what he think a central bank ought to be   to be continu    laughter   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i   m go to back off of al   s point   i have some sympathi for set an inflat object  but i think price stabil is the object   i   m more or less follow up on bob parri   s comment   where i   m have difficulti with this whole issu is that  to my mind at least  we are introduc a new ambigu   i think it happen at the last meet   and that is this idea of market guidanc   i feel veri uneasi with it
do you mean    the consider period of  e    phrase
yes  or anyth like that   we   ve move further away from our boilerpl languag in tri to be more explanatori about our action   as you start out say this even  we can   t predict the futur   none of us can predict the futur   anoth factor is that the market receiv as much data as we do  and they can judg our action or our prospect action base on those data and on our past action   over a long period of  e  it is he action that realli do speak better than the word   so that   s where i   m come from  moreov  it   s my experi   and i think other have found this to be the case as well   that peopl hear what they want to hear   some   and mayb often  the market hear what they want to hear  so we cannot expect to convey condit statement veri success to the market   peopl simpli don   t believ or accept statement as condit in hindsight   thus  we find ourselv have to surpris the market  in a sens  when we tri to be too prescript or forward look  so i would focus on the statement   i think it   s a good suggest to bring the word in the bluebook and the languag of the press releas togeth   and say that this is what our action is today   we can talk about the risk we see today   the risk with regard to econom output and inflat and leav it at that   that mean more boilerpl   my view is that  if we tri to do ani more than that  we will get into a veri complic pre approv process on the press releas becaus we   d be say more than the action itself say   i think that   s a veri bad cours to follow   in my view  outlin our sens of the risk is about as much guidanc as we can provid   howev  if we are go to tri to use our press releas to explain more   and i   ll end with this   i have a veri strong sympathi toward the bank of england model     talk about the possibl of error occur if we use that model  but frank  i think there will be fewer error if we publish the minut more quick than if we tri to write a press releas that repres twelv view in two paragraph   with the latter approach i think we realli open ourselv up to error and rough statement
well  that   s a valid altern procedur
it   s one i think we ought to consid veri serious if we start go down the road of want to expand what we say in the press releas rather than make it more oilerpl   i have to tell you that i think focus on those minut and say that they are an accur represent of our discuss would be veri healthi for the market   with the releas of the minut we are say in effect    these are the fact      the market can interpret our action and our outlook base on those fact
you would go back to announc onli our action  and you would publish the minut fair soon after the meet
i would go back to announc our action
with no further comment
with no comment  right
then move up the public of the minut
i   d releas them as quick as we can   two week after the meet if that   s reason   becaus they provid the explan for our action   the market can deciph the minut   yes  peopl may occasion misinterpret them  but the minut are our represent of the discuss that occur at the meet   and there   s no attribut  so there is no risk to an individu member   i would prefer that to expand the press statement  now  if we go to a boilerpl statement   this is our action  and these are the risk  with the risk clear understood as those we see today and not anyth that hint at our next move   i   m fine with that   but absent that  i think we ought to get the minut out more quick and confin the statement
thank you  mr  chairman   let me pick up where tom hoenig left off and discuss what i think you and   were suggest   first  i do think there will be some benefit in tri to standard or routin the so call risk assess   i   ll leav out the ssue of the    consider period      to me that   s rather close to polici   but as a general matter  i believ our risk assess languag has evolv to where it seem as though it would work for a long enough period of  e  and i think it ought to be routin   and disclos in the bluebook in the way you and   were talk about  i would disagre with tom on the content of the statement   in my view  we do owe it to the world  onc we make a decis  to attempt to find the broad middl ground that support that decis   to explain whi we did what we did   in i don   t know how mani sentenc  mayb two  or three  or four as we do now   i believ is extrem valuabl and  frank  quit doabl  we should put this problem into a broader context  as you suggest  and be a littl care not to be blown off kilter by two month of experi   after all  the feder reserv now has nineti year of experi   the fomc may have made some horrif mistak over the year  but i would say that  over the last twenti four year or so  by and larg the polici set has been right and our abil to explain it has been good   so let   s not get thrown off by two or three month when a number of technic factor plus some communic issu creat a problem   what you suggest in term of chang to the process strike me in concept as a step forward becaus it get the committe involv in the right way in the word of the statement without undercut some of the thing we want to do  to go further and address a point that tom made  i feel pretti strong   and by the end of this discuss i may be alon on this   that we shouldn   t move up the public of the minut   i have two reason   one involv process and one  substanc   first  we have to be veri care becaus  onc we take such a step  we can   t walk back from it   second  i think we would find that mani  e   as has occur even with the minut releas on the  et we use now   there is a phrase or sentenc in there that the market latch onto   the thought onvey may have reflect a view express at the meet  but even with the passag of two or three week it may no longer be accur or it may never have been an accur reflect of the central view   so  given the fact that i don   t think we   re in such horrif shape with the statement the way we do it now  i wouldn   t jump to a new approach   assum we can improv the process of formul the statement   becaus i think the risk by and larg outweigh the benefit   that   s all general a process issu   let me talk a bit about the content  as i   ve alreadi indic  in my view where we   ve end up with this ad hoc approach with respect to the balanc of risk is not so bad   with regard to the question of sustain econom growth   i   m look at exhibit     it mean has evolv over  e  and i think it has come to mean growth that  sn   t creat imbal   it was origin  year ago  growth at close to potenti  but it didn   t contain ani level concept or notion of imbal   it has start to move in the direct of the latter  and i have no object to that    ask whether the word    risk    has a negat connot   we got into this languag  as you may recal  becaus we   d go out and make speech and be ask   at least it happen to me often  and other may have experienc this  too   what the balanc of risk was  so the answer was that we would tell the public about the balanc of risk   i don   t have a strong sens that risk for a central bank are all negat becaus there   s an upsid and a downsid  there are risk in some direct that some peopl think are good but that we as central banker think are not so good   so i wouldn   t worri about that   but if the committe feel strong that we shouldn   t use the word    risk     so be it      s fourth question was  how long is the forese futur   i give the same answer we alway give   it   s this   laughter   how the record is go to demonstr the gestur i just made with my hand  i   m not realli sure   in ani event  it   s an elast concept  and i don   t ave ani problem with that   i think the market have gotten use to it   i won   t at this point answer your fifth question about whether we should make a commit that polici will remain accommod for a consider period  in sum  what i would say is that we need to clean up the process here   we need to creat a way to use the bluebook so the committe can get more involv in the word of the statement   but i   d be a littl cautious about do dramat surgeri on the substanc base on two to three month of experi that we wish had been a littl better   in the context of what we   re tri to do  i think what we have been do is not so bad   while take a step forward from here may look nice on paper  i think it has more risk than benefit   final  somewhat surpris for me  i   m relat conserv on this matter   in my view we   re not far off from the proper approach   we just need to clean up the process
mr  chairman  i   m struck by how far we   ve come sinc decemb       i was a relat newcom at the tabl when roger   s work group gave it report   i didn   t go back and pull the report  but i pull a sentenc from dave     s document   it read      all member of the work group share the object of reduc the close connect between the choic of the bias and the perceiv probabl of near term polici action      mayb my memori isn   t clear  but i recal that we were wring our hand and hope that market would not interpret the bias as a polici forecast   for four or five year now we have let that go unchalleng and appar have becom more and more comfort with that notion without have a substant discuss on the issu   i think what we did at the last meet in term of    for the forese futur    was anoth major step down that road   to my mind that was more than just a communic issu  share the view express by sever other who have spoken alreadi about be somewhat uncomfort with refer to the  e of possibl chang in polici   my sens   from the discuss that we had at the last meet  a few remark that have been made sinc then  and some comment in the  book   is that a number of peopl wish that we could have made that word more explicit   some would have favor our say that polici would be on hold for the next six  nine  or twelv month   that make me realli uncomfort  some of us at the last meet had   and probabl still will have at tomorrow   s meet   a differ view about fundament issu such as product  potenti growth  and the output gap   so the issu involv more than communic and the choic of word   to me there was an under discomfort with the kind of uncondit pre commit to futur polici that i think we may have convey   in my view we need to have more discuss about whether we   re realli comfort with have gone that far with a polici forecast of that sort   i think that   s fundament   if we are comfort do that  it rais some process issu  which is understand   if we   re go to make that kind of commit  it   becom a part of the committe   s action   so that should make us want to talk about the word that we use   it   s go to make us want to edit the minut more care   i found myself alreadi do that on the minut from the last coupl of meet and wish that i could see everybodi els   s comment and see what happen to the entir draft  we had a last minut discuss befor i left atlanta this morn about tom   s idea of an earlier releas of the minut   my first thought was that it probabl made sens   but the more i thought about it  the more concern i had about nineteen of us tri to comment one on one on minut that all of a sudden becom terribl  terribl import   i can   t imagin how that process would unfold   as attract as the idea was conceptu when i first thought about it  i just an   t imagin that it would work well   each of us could send in our comment  but we won   t know how anyon els comment  and we won   t have a chanc to help with the process   i bet we   re not go to be satisfi at all when the minut come out at the end of that process
what   the bank of england do with respect to that
they all sit in the same room and have an edit session   they go through the minut line by line
and how mani member of the mpc are there  sever   nine
we have nineteen
i   d hate for us to spend our  e do that
rememb one thing i said   i said that i   d rather go through this challeng with the minut than opt to expand the press releas   i think there   s more danger in the press releas if we   re go to get prescript with it
as roger said  there are certain thing we can   t come back from onc we do them   this we can come back from   in other word  one of the reason i feel somewhat comfort with what we have been do is that i think monetari polici is at a major fulcrum in the sens that clear someth differ has happen in the world   general global disinfl   it is phenomen signific  and it alter the normal histor respons of a central bank to chang in the econom outlook   we   ve been tri to suggest to the world that the respons  e is differ and that the normal pattern of the way a central bank ought to behav to maintain stabil is differ from in the past   but after have done that and  i hope  succeed   and i think we are succeed  frank   there   s no reason that we can   t just go back to the preemptiv polici procedur that we embark upon a long  e ago   but if we   re alway o to be prescript   if we   re alway go to forecast what we   re go to do for the next six month and lock it in  then we   re in real troubl
thank you  mr  chairman   i had a few more comment but in the interest of  e i   ll quit
thank you  mr  chairman   this has been a fascin discuss  and there are lot of thing to say about a lot of issu  but i want to focus on just a few   first of all  i think anyon who has observ the fed over the last three or four month   includ ani person in the market who has critic us about our communic   would find it a littl odd that much of tonight   s discuss has been focus on what should be in the bluebook rather than what should be in the press statement   i think the real problem is that we take the announc out of the context of the wide varieti of issu we all talk about at an fomc meet   the problem is not just the announc   in fact  the problem probabl isn   t realli the announc at all   though there are some thing that we could do at the margin to improv it   but the context into which the announc is put   to a larg extent we creat that context ourselv   i think you talk about that a bit  just look at the period from januari until the june meet  there were     speech or tes oni   public appear   by member of the board of governor and reserv bank presid   in those speech and tes oni the term    deflat    was cite      e  and     of those refer occur between the may and the june meet   now  i ask you   is that not an environ that   s just ask for peopl to over interpret what was in our offici statement   peopl in the market think that there   s a big communic machin here in washington that tell us all what to say   even when we tell them there isn   t  they still believ hat there is   so i think that   s part what fed into the market respons and it reflect whatev degre we were respons for the market   s overreact either on the downsid or the upsid
they ad up the    remot     as i put it
well  it   s not so much that they ad them up
no  we creat a lot of them   the problem basic is that a number of those in the market don   t listen to the subtleti  they just take note of how much  e we are spend talk about a particular subject
you   re not suggest that we have a politburo here that clear everybodi   s speech
i am not suggest that at all   i   m just say that that was the happenst   we inadvert ad to market volatil
i agre with that   the question is  what are you recommend that we do
my recommend is to proceed veri care   i don   t think there   s so much wrong with the current process and the statement we issu that we should jump immedi to a differ solut   i have some sympathi for presid hoenig   s comment and presid parri   s  too  in term of an easi to handl formula approach   where tom was come out   on the side of the bank of england approach   has some appeal to me  too  although there are clear some downsid risk to that   i would hate to see us move to either of those approach overnight   i would like us to give this more thought and discuss it further  beyond tonight   i hope we will do that  n the subject of inflat target i am veri much in agreement with you  mr  chairman   along the line of look at what might happen when the treasuri bond goe away or at what might happen if we had to use nontradit monetari polici measur  if we kill a few tree look at inflat target  everybodi is go to think we   re go to be move to that   i person feel that it would not be the right thing to do and it would not buy us anyth  i would hope that sooner or later we could come to a meet of the mind on that subject and not enter into a long  drawn out process of tri to find out whether or not it make ani differ to ani polici object we care about   that   s all i will say  though there are lot of other thing i could say
first vice presid stewart
mr  chairman  my approach to this question was to ask a number of top economist for wall street firm over the summer whether in their view  in light of the event of may and june  we have a fundament problem with our communic polici   the answer has been    no      their sens is that the system work and that it   s the best relationship between the market and the central bank in the world   there   s a sens that we continu to have extrem high credibl   there were view on both side on whether we should have inflat target   some argu    yes     and some argu    no     but there was no clear consensus one way or the other   i think the onli clear messag was that they would like to see the minut publish earlier than they are now rather than have to wait so long   but i wouldn   t say that there was an extrem strong feel on that among those that chris cum and i talk to  the other interest point that came out of these discuss was the differ between talk to this profession audienc of economist  mani of whom have work at the fed in one capac or anoth over the year  and talk with trader   the economist listen to us eri care and understood what we are do and the issu that we   re deal with   talk with trader was a veri differ matter   that group is not a sophist audienc in this arena  the economist in the top firm would say that they  too  have problem get the trader to understand their point of view   in effect  they threw up their hand and advis us not even to tri to use sophist econom argument in deal with that segment of the marketplac  so i would end up agre with presid   in term of feel that the exist system is work well   the peopl in the market that i think are the most import decisionmak say we have credibl  they know exact what we   re go through  and they would not ask for a chang of ani signific natur
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the thrust of jami   s and cathi   s comment   i certain wouldn   t suggest ani signific chang  though i would suggest some tinker   some improv in the process that we follow and the languag we use  on the big question about releas the minut earli and just announc our polici decis without commentari  after think about it a lot  i believ the market would view that as a major step backward on transpar   that   s becaus  if we were to do that  all we   d announc on the day of the meet is what we decid to do and there would be gap of  let   s say  two week befor we issu our minut   what would happen dure those two week   right now we have a blackout period that goe until the end of the first week after the meet   would we extend the blackout period anoth week and not give speech dure that  e   with no other inform from us  market particip would look at those speech veri  veri care   so i think announc onli our decis and then releas the minut earlier could lead to a lot of complic  and i would not go down that road at this point  ctualli  the sens of this convers  as i see it  is that we seem to be go in the direct of     s option   in his tabl   that involv put languag in the bluebook that match exact the word we would be vote on at the meet  which i certain agre with  i think the current bluebook alreadi take some use step in that direct  which will be help in our prepar for tomorrow   s meet   also standard the languag of the risk assess is  as roger phrase it  a veri good direct to go in   howev  i would look veri care at the languag   i think we should make some chang in the languag that we   re now use and we should stress test that languag against a whole seri of differ econom conting and see what we would realli say if x happen or if y happen   i   d go back and look at some histor event  too   mayb that has alreadi been done  i don   t know   but in my view  it would be a veri use exercis for all of us  let me mention a few problem that i have with the languag after think about it care   first  there   s the point about econom growth   the way the bluebook is now word it say           the committe believ the risk to it outlook for sustain econom growth over the next few quarter are weight toward the downsid  are balanc  or are weight toward the upsid      i would have serious concern about our say    weight toward the upsid    with regard to sustain econom growth   we ought to explain that type of situat in a much more use way  and i think there are way to do that   i just don   t particular like that phrase    weight toward the upsid       befor we get to a situat   some  in the futur  i hope   that would call for a risk assess of that sort  i   d like to find some better word   also  when we talk about our risk assess we say     against the background of it long term goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth     and then we describ the risk to sustain econom growth   but then we don   t use the word    price stabil     we shift to the term   inflat      we should think care about that   whether we realli want to talk about the risk to price stabil as oppos to the risk to the outlook for inflat   i think that   s a question we should discuss as a group  the other part of option   was that  when a substant chang is contempl  this would be communic to the committe befor the meet so we would have some  e to think about it   i think that   s in line with the convers you were have about the word in the bluebook  and i agre with that veri strong   from a process standpoint  that will be much better for this committe in term of our oper  the final point i would make is on the term    forese futur      we did actual defin it veri specif in the year        we said that although the    forese futur    is    intend to cover an interv extend beyond the next fomc meet     the concept is necessarili elast    laughter
what could be clearer
it clear refer to an elast period that goe beyond the next fomc meet

thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i count myself among those who don   t think that our current polici are all that bad and in need of a major overhaul   i agre with most  but not all  of the comment that presid   just made   so let me offer a few quick suggest and express a coupl of concern   as i understood your convers with bob parri  one suggest is to use the bluebook more extens to spell out some altern and give at least a rough idea of the languag that would go with them   whether that   s altern   n     s materi  i   m not sure   in ani event  i think that   s a construct suggest  and we ought to think about tri to implement that over  e  second  i think we should tri to acceler the releas of the minut whatev we do with the statement   in other word  i don   t think move up the public of the minut is conting upon what we put in the statement   i believ the minut are an underutil asset  we spend a good deal of  e and go to a lot of troubl to prepar them as it is  and then we releas them at a  e when peopl are no longer interest in them   it seem to me that they are an accur represent of what has been discuss at a meet  and we ought to tri to get them out while they   re still relev   in my view they would do a better job of provid a descript and convey the nuanc of what was go on at the meet than anyth els that we could do   so if i would urg anyth strong  it would be the earlier releas of the minut   i person believ that whatev ad resourc it would take to accomplish that would probabl be well worth it
may i interrupt you for one second
that   s a veri interest point  and we need some factual inform   in the event that we move the minut up  a concern that has been express here   i think jack rais the issu   is that we all will start to edit the minut more than we do now  may i just ask for a show of hand on this   those who would probabl do more edit than they current do  would you pleas rais your hand   now those who would do the same amount   i presum nobodi would do less    secretari   s note  those who express an opinion were about equal divid as to whether they would probabl edit the minut more intens or not chang their current practic   sever member express no opinion   ow  what we just saw was peopl   s current intent   but it is a veri interest question becaus  if jack is right  it could be veri difficult to produc the minut more quick  i hadn   t thought about that   it alway struck me that move forward the public of the minut was strict a staff resourc question   but if an earlier releas date inde make it more difficult for us to produc the minut   not just physic do them  but get member to agre on the content of the minut and especi that they accur reflect the meet   s discuss   then i think we have a real problem
that could be   but if jack is right  i won   t take him fish again   laughter
i have a coupl of concern  and one of them michael just express   i don   t know what it mean to say    the risk to econom growth are weight toward the upsid     presum what we mean is that higher growth could lead to higher inflat   but that ought to be captur by the inflat statement   now  mayb some other mean is intend   if so  i must say that it   s not obvious to me what that would be   if we stay with the languag we have here  sooner or later it   s go to come back to haunt us   so i   m concern about the connot of the word    risk     my final thought is a respons to one of the question that   rais   can we sum up the risk to inflat or price stabil and the risk to the real outlook   i   m a littl uncomfort with that   we   ve been do it  and i don   t think it has caus ani serious problem yet   but ned and a few other have rais some concern about that at previous meet  and logic i   m just not sure that it is the best of all possibl approach  hairman  span   i agre with that   eventu  we   ll run into troubl on both of these issu   not at the moment  though   we   re okay for a while becaus the basic point here is that we   re tri to convey whi we did what we did
some of the boilerpl languag with variat    specif split the phillip curv into two   actual was essenti for us to explain whi we did what we did
i thought that was a veri good idea at the  e   but we might want to reflect earlier rather than later on how we may want to chang this go forward becaus i do believ that it could get awkward
there may be an exit strategi issu that we have to resolv
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m glad that you call on me now becaus  the longer this meet goe  the more ball there are up in the air and we   re go to have an unstabl equilibrium   first off  on the process i   m a status quo man   i think the system we have is pretti good   we can fix it up  which i guess put me somewher between altern   and     i would like to leav the minut alon  the one suggest i   ve heard that i think could improv the process is to put more of the statement in the bluebook   i think that   s a good idea   it could be done without cost  and we ought to start do it as soon as possibl  inde  it was alreadi done for this meet  n the statement itself  i view the    consider period    sentenc as a special addit that was appropri for the condit at the  e   although in general we ought to have a fair formula approach to the statement  from  e to  e statement like that are use   so i hope we don   t put ourselv in a posit that we could never have them   we know we   re go to have to take that sentenc out at some point   presum fair soon   and we   ll have to deal with that   but i thought that statement did work   so while i basic favor be fair formula about this  i think everi now and then we have to do someth that is less standard  on the    sustain econom growth    sentenc  there may be an interpret about econom growth that   not creat imbal  but that   s not how the sentenc read the way it   s written   it say     the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal       it   s entir about speed limit and not about the size of the output gap   we may think the sentenc mean someth els  but that just isn   t what the sentenc say  and i think we can do better   i   d convert it to more of an output gap type of sentenc  i   ll make just one more comment  and that is about inflat target   that rais a whole new set of issu  and i think we shouldn   t talk about it now but mayb at the meet in januari   i will rais one issu here  howev  and that is that i   m not sure it   s up to us to announc an inflat target   even a soft rang   on our own   i think we might well have to go to the congress for that   that   make me shudder but  on the other hand  we may be interpret our charter a littl too aggress if we set an inflat target   i can see how have a clear target rang could help us  but that rais a huge new set of complic  and i think we realli have to put that subject off   thank you  hairman  span   governor olson
put me in the categori also of the member who don   t think we need to make a major chang   like a lot of other peopl  i   ve spent a good deal of  e think about what we might have done differ in our past communic   as i   ve thought about our recent communic  it seem to me that over the march may june  e frame we went from have had a success of two part statement to a one part statement and final to a three part statement   i rememb veri clear that one of the theme run through our may meet was that we didn   t want to surpris the market   what happen was exact the opposit   the market surpris us   it had the feel of a   mcqueen movi   you may rememb the one where he start out be chase and then veri clever found himself be the chaser   it seem to me that we were then in a bind becaus at the june meet if we had been follow that dictum   if we had act in a way that would have pleas the market   it would have run contrari to the polici view of the peopl in the room   we seem to have found ourselv in a perfect storm  it was at a  e when we were talk about the possibl need to use unconvent oper mean that we made major chang in the statement   it was a  e also when the economi was just begin to respond to the s ulus that was in the marketplac   i think that situat was veri much an anomali  and in my view we should not overreact to the manner in which that communic was receiv  keep on that theme   and recogn that in januari we   re go to continu discuss this topic   i would hope that we do not make major chang between now and the next  e we talk about communic issu   i want to make sure that we continu to be incrementalist on the subject   but in term of this part of our deliber and look at the altern method of communic  i would tend to support option    hairman  span   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with presid hoenig and presid pool as well that it   s veri difficult for us to talk about the futur   but actual i   m fair comfort with where we   ve gotten   in term of the balanc of risk sentenc  in my view it has been use to get to the three part assess   i think we gave some import inform to the market when we said that we were concern about inflat fall too low  and i believ that has help the market interpret our action and predict our action better   in term of presid pool   s chart  it look to me as if most of the problem occur befor we were make post meet announc   the real miss are in       and        befor we start issu ani statement   i don   t see a deterior in the predict of the feder fund rate sinc we start announc tilt or our assess of the balanc of risk   the market have pretti much gotten the direct right   i think we can be fair satisfi with the result depict in that chart for the period sinc we start announc   so i don   t think it support the notion that provid a balanc of risk or a tilt hasn   t been use   i don   t see that in the chart at all  i think the sum up part of our statement is use   as i   ve said befor  it   s part of the risk manag type of strategi that you   ve talk about  mr  chairman   have that third sentenc will give us an opportun to tell the market how we   re implement that strategi and what we   re most worri about over the forese futur   that elast concept   to me the    consider period    sentenc is a differ matter   there we did make more of a semi commit about polici for some futur period of  e  and i was uncomfort get into that   but i was comfort do it at that point becaus i thought it was  in effect  a kind of nontradit polici   we had the fund rate at   percent   peopl were worri about disinfl  and it was import  particular at that low interest rate  that the market nderstand a littl better what we were do   but i share everyon els   s concern that  go forward  predict a  e dimens with regard to our polici action should not be a part of our regular process   i don   t think it need to be   it was part of an unusu situat  i agre with the dialogu that you had with presid parri  mr  chairman  regard the balanc of risk statement   i believ we can be more formula  and i think vinc   s suggest for put more in the bluebook is help   i also agre with presid   that we need to clarifi our languag   i happen to disagre with some of the statement about what    sustain growth    mean   i think it is about chang in the output gap  just as presid parri want  even though he wasn   t interpret the actual statement that way   so i complet agre that we need to start figur out what we mean by this languag and then make it clear to the rest of the world after we make it clear to ourselv    laughter   that   s someth that need to happen sooner rather than later   these issu could come back to haunt us befor too mani meet go by  so i think we need to work on that befor the januari meet   i think i   ll stop there
you know  i   ve alway thought that sustain meant self sustain   in other word  a situat in which the gear are work in a perpetu motion  that   s closer to the    imbal    interpret  i would suspect   but i never thought of it in term of the two altern that you gentlemen mention   i alway thought it meant self sustain
that prove my point about need to clarifi it
i   m a littl puzzl by it
it   s not onli the market that  sn   t know what we mean    laughter
the english languag is wonder elast   presid pool  r  pool   a point that i don   t think has come up yet is the fact that we   re talk to a number of differ audienc   with regard to our polit account   talk to the congress and the general public   i think we do just fine  and i believ the current public schedul for the minut fulli serv that audienc   in term of talk to the market  cathi and jami mention the trader  and i   d certain like to draw a distinct between the trader and the portfolio manag   the trader make their money from read tea leav  hot tip  and understand littl nuanc   what they realli want to know is what our think is about the feder fund rate at the next meet or the possibl of intermeet chang in the rate   they don   t veri much care about whi or the under reason  to speak to the point that gari talk about  move up the releas of the minut  i think the argument against that is that we   d realli be speak to the trader who are tri to divin what we are go to do at the next meet   they care about the polici action rather than about the under rational for the polici   so actual i think there   s a real advantag in separ the minut  as well as some of the logist issu that we   ve talk about  from the specif meet to which they appli   that allow the minut to be interpret by those who care about tri to understand the reason for the under polici and not just the action we took at that particular meet and a forecast of the action we   re go to take next
that   s a veri interest point
i would also emphas that we   ve use the word    formula    and    boilerpl    in this discuss   those word have negat connot  obvious   what we   re talk about is standard languag with a standard mean   so i want to be sure that we don   t convey ani of the negat connot   i think that   s quit import  n my view  separ the balanc of risk into the inflat part and the growth part is import  but i agre with   that we realli need to stress test the languag   i think we   re go to have a problem at some point say that real growth is too high or the unemploy rate is too low   we have to make sure that we know what we   re go to do when we get to the point that we   re concern about undu pressur on resourc   or howev we want to phrase it  i have a lot of misgiv about the third sentenc   i forget the exact terminolog  but we use the word    on balanc     and i think the market read that simpli as our hint about what we   re go to do at the next meet   so i would like to take that out
let me make just a coupl of comment   some of these point have been cover  but i want to highlight the one that hit me rather hard as i thought about them   first  when i think about what has happen with regard to our communic over the last coupl of month  i think part of the problem was that we were in unchart water   we hadn   t had inflat rate so low   we hadn   t had war or the possibl of war interven with the econom process for some  e   so as we sat around this tabl  we had a lot of knightian uncertainti   but as we heard today  one can learn   as peopl learn about what the fed was like to do  the market adapt   whatev we come out with on communic polici  i think we have to realiz that in  e like we   ve just been through we   re probabl go to have to get out of the box we   ve put ourselv into   such  e demand a differ type of communic  when the market see thing that aren   t normal  we may need to use someth other than our standard type of communic  have becom veri uncomfort with move in the direct of give a forecast  a point some of you have also made   i realli think we need to talk about where we are at the moment that we come to our decis   that   s the import point   without go ani further with ani kind of commit in ani sens of the term   for that reason  i think we should move up the public of the minut   the reason i come to that conclus relat to what cathi talk about  that some of us go out and give speech between meet   what do market observ do  they read the word of the peopl around this tabl who happen to give speech on the economi and from them tri to divin what the committe as a whole is think
and the speech are schedul three month in advanc
so the market   s interpret is base on word from a select number of those around the tabl who happen to have speak engag and talk about the econom situat  to me the minut give a better represent of the divers of view as well as the consensus and lay out whi those who had differ view felt the way they did   i think that befor the minut are releas the market is not get a full represent of how we got to the consensus and how domin that consensus may have been    so i would prefer move up the minut   i also agre with some comment that were just made about the languag   i would like to see us move to standard word   but i also would like us to think hard about put it in plain english   in other word  for econom growth  say  to indic that we see it acceler but we still see a larg gap in unus resourc in the economi
that sound like a forecast to me
well  it   s what we see today   it reflect how we got to our conclus regard polici   i   d prefer that  rather than to say that the risk are up or the risk are down   which i think can be read in mani differ way depend on where the economi happen to e   it   s the first differ both in inflat and growth rate  and with inflat of   percent and go up or inflat of   percent and go into disinfl  we   d get veri differ reaction  so as we think about standard word  we need to consid the differ side   if our word were more in plain english  that might take care of the last sentenc becaus capac issu and other develop we see in the economi would be tie togeth   mayb that would get us out of that awkward final sentenc   i still have troubl with that last sentenc
let me get a clarif   if in clarifi the languag we use straight declar sentenc  i think we   d be make statement as to what we think is go to happen and not what we see as a risk
my impress is  and i may be mistaken on this  that the veri act of write declar sentenc forc you to take a posit of stipul someth quit specif   fall back to a probabilist bayesian type of languag seem to be fuzzi up the statement  but that   s exact what we   re tri to do to creat a sens that these are probabl and not certainti   i don   t think there   s ani question that clear languag is superior to bayesian languag  but can we be that clear without inadvert make a forecast
well  it   s go to be veri difficult   but the lesson i took from the last few month is that use the standard risk assess languag in  e like this  when we   re go through a turn in the direct of the economi  send confus signal
let me make a request   take the last statement and the one we   re go to use tomorrow and rewrit them   take a look at it becaus i   m curious about how you would do it  s  bie   well  that   s whi i agre with the suggest that was made earlier about tri to test ani propos languag under differ circumst
that   s exact the reason that i ask
yes  i think we have to do that
take a shot at it and see what you come up with
okay   those are the main comment i had
mr  chairman  i   ve alway been confus by bayesian thing becaus it seem as if peopl still tri to figur out the probabl of someth happen after it has alreadi happen  which i have some troubl with    laughter   sinc mani of you probabl would like to see the dalla cowboy get beaten up tonight  i   ll be veri brief   i   m with cathi and jami  who basic said that they didn   t think we had a major problem and certain not one worth throw out the babi with the bath water   in my view  misunderstand   especi big one   about what we are tri to communic are rare   frank  this recent one is the first that i can recal   the market may learn from it just as we may learn from it  and the market may come to the conclus that ten pink do not a red make   so this problem may not surfac again any  soon  as you know from my posit over the last coupl of year  if we are go to make chang in our communic practic  i would be in favor of let the polici decis speak for themselv   market particip and other observ understand the context and the circumst we   re in when we make those decis   so i don   t think a lot of explan as to whi we took a particular action is necessari   we should keep thing as simpl as possibl and have as few move part as possibl   ideal  i would like not to have to vote on a bias   then e would not have to report on it  and it would be one less thing we can get wrong   if that   s a movement away from transpar  i think it can be offset by move up the releas of the minut to an earlier date
thank you  mr  chairman   i was about to offer a comment sever hour ago befor mr  parri spoke  but i   m rather glad that i didn   t becaus at that point i would have said that   had laid out an imposs task for us   as far as i could tell  he was ask us to figur out what we should communic  how we should fashion what we communic  and how we should chang our current communic   i figur that would take if not day at least hour more than we had   howev  we seem to have come fair close to a converg on a number of interest and i think valuabl point   so let me just throw in my view on some of them  first of all  i think the parri contribut was to say let   s tri to get it simpl and standard and let   s make it work   i think that   s the right approach   we can move away from the term    boilerpl    or even the term    standard     and we   ll still have a problem explain exact what we mean by the word we use becaus i think we all attach subtl nuanc to them  i don   t think we can make our statement all that clear becaus we need to allow for unexpect event as we go forward   in term of our assess  i think we should keep it simpl   but i  too  have a problem with the balanc statement   on each of the individu element i think we need some wordsmith   i   m not sure that the word we   re use are exact right  whether we   re talk about sustain growth or price stabil   but in my view  make an assess on the balanc of the two risk involv tri to add up thing that are virtual imposs to add up   the most it   is to tell peopl that  on net  here   s what we want to do and not realli ow the risk are balanc or add up   so i think that part of the statement need some work go forward  in term of whether or not we need to chang the word    risk    to    odd    or ani such thing  our thesaurus work on our word perfect program   if we chang it to    odd     we   ll put    odd     we   ll circl it  and we   ll say that it   s fed speak for risk   so i think we just have to recogn that this recent experi involv an unusu circumst  notabl an environ in which a lot was chang   peopl were unclear about what we were say in part becaus of the dynam chang in the market at the  e we were tri to say it  i would be quit cautious about how to deal with the minut and move up their releas   in my view there are question about whether we want a four week blackout period becaus we   re wait for the minut to come out or whether we should be work on the minut in real  e   these are t i issu  and i think we have to be cautious about move in ani direct there  we got into the middl of a fourth subject  inflat target  which wasn   t even on my list   i   d be more than happi to talk about that  but near everyon want to see the dalla cowboy get beat up   so i   m go to forgo comment on that for the moment and say that i think we have come a veri long way toward a converg of view on these issu   to me the comment thus far suggest that we need to take some subtl step but not make massiv chang  that get us to someth like option number   to      and i think that   s a reason place to be
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to support the washington consensus  option number     broad speak  i think the form of the statement is rather good  in particular i think the break up of the output and inflat risk was a veri use step  lthough we can do some fine tune there   i agre that we should do some process improv via the bluebook to get everyon   s input a bit earlier and to get the inform out a littl earlier  i   m as respons as anyon for the confus about the phrase    consider period     so let me just say a word about that   governor kohn put it exact right  i think   the word    consider period    were part of a nonstandard monetari polici   when we get close to the zero bound  we run out of tradit tool  and the onli way that we can influenc interest rate is by manipul expect   so it   s a veri  veri nonstandard and unusu way to address monetari polici   that was certain what i had in mind when i was advoc that approach  we   re now  i hope   and it seem to be the case   no longer at great risk of deflat with a zero bound   i certain hope that   s the case   so i imagin that the refer to those kind of consider will disappear from the statement   but let me warn you that  should we reach the zero bound again  we would be well advis to consid use statement of that sort again becaus they may becom our onli tool  not just an auxiliari tool  let me say someth on the minut   i don   t think presid guynn   s comment about the minut take on undu import was in the context of elimin the press statement   i think we would keep the statement as our central mean of communic   then move up the minut would in fact be use becaus that document    as presid   suggest  contain a lot of use inform   that would not requir ani kind of addit blackout period   one argument that has been made against move up the minut is that their releas would creat an unnecessari market impact   but my experi is   and i think a correct view is    that the market effect of fed action  speech  and so on are more or less continu  there   s no singular impact   so count me as one who think that move up the minut would e a relat effect and easi way to increas our transpar and to provid more inform to the market   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   after the last two meet and even after read the transcript of the last two meet  when we spent a lot of  e talk about the need to improv our communic  i expect to be support major chang in the way we communic   but after get the materi from   and also read dave     s paper  i found myself in the camp of want to make onli some minor chang to what we   re do current   i believ that we should have a statement that announc our action and give the reason for the action   i think we should continu to have languag on the balanc of risk  with some improv such as those that have been recommend by presid  n and     i note in read the minut of our august meet that the languag about our action was clearer than that in the statement  which brought to mind the comment by governor bie that mayb we could be clearer in our languag   the word in the minut still had the risk inform in it  but the statement was just a littl clearer to me   so i think the suggest that have been made about provid some draft languag in advanc in the bluebook and then tie that languag to our press releas will help to make our statement clearer  i also agre with sever of my colleagu  howev  that we should stop short of hint at futur polici and refrain from either deliber or inadvert signal to the market what our next move is like to be   so i would want us to stop short of tri to manag expect about our futur polici action  final  in regard to the minut  i came in here think that it was a good idea to releas the minut earlier   but after listen to the comment tonight  especi the concern that we ould not readili revers that decis and return to our current practic  i think the issu requir a littl more thought befor we make such a move   thank you  mr  chairman
well  thank you veri much   we   ve gone around the tabl  and i must say to you that my impress was that more substant issu were put on the tabl than i had expect and  inde  potenti more conclus   i think it   s fair evid that there are general two school that are emerg   one is the de minimi altern  which i gather we can do without object  of make the languag in the direct conform exact to the languag in the statement   that is someth that everyon could acquiesc to  which would strike me as a way to solv one immedi problem   we thank the presid of the san francisco bank  also  i believ we have cover the issu of the relationship between the statement and the minut in a veri product manner   identifi the possibl tradeoff or altern and the like   final  the issu that has been rais on this side of the tabl about stress test is an import one   tomorrow we will do what we have to do to have continu from the previous meet   but i do agre with the point that     rais   that when we begin to observ an economi that is start to heat up  the languag we have now isn   t go to work  to be sure  we have a communic agenda topic schedul for our januari meet  but i say to you that that   s too late   i think we ought to ask the staff to inde stress test some languag   not for tomorrow   s meet but for the meet thereaft   so that we   ll get some knowledg of altern as to how we might exit from the current situat under various scenario   i never thought of the term    stress test     but it has a certain analog to what we   re look at here  which i think actual work  n conjunct with that  we ought to do what i mention to susan  for exampl   i hope that she can find some word that do not have a probabilist charact   which is alway confus to the averag person   and yet avoid a forecast   that   s go to be a t i problem  and i   m not sure that it is resolv   my own view   and if it turn out that i   m wrong  that   s all the better   is that we can   t get away from the probabilist languag becaus inde that   s the kind of world in which we live   tri to make a determinist world out of a bayesian world just isn   t doabl  therefor  i think we ought to implement as soon as we can the propos to get the same word in both the instruct to the desk and in the statement we make to the public   as quick as possibl  we should tri to formul the actual phraseolog that we might use as the econom condit evolv and in the event of certain develop in the marketplac   we   re all presum as a given  with no possibl of error  that so long as the output gap stay open the rate of inflat will fall   well  as i   ve said to mani of you  i rememb well that peopl held that view even more strong in the late     s  and it was onli a veri few year later that we realiz it was wrong  when nobodi could explain how it was possibl that inflat was rise with a veri larg gap remain   inde  stagflat was someth that was not conceiv in the standard keynesian model that we all adher to befor the     s   so we ought to recogn that  and as firm as we believ we understand the way the economi is grow  we should make conting for it to move in exact the opposit direct   i think that would serv us well so i would suggest that we move forward and tri to communic between meet  not necessarili with an actual meet  but with memoranda from   on various altern and solicit peopl   s view   this is not someth we   re go to have to implement at the ext meet   but we have to start think about how we   re go to phase out of where we are  as inde we   re go to have to do at some point  so i thank you all for a veri thought discuss   it has been quit use   unless somebodi has some close remark  let   s call it a night and conven in the board room at      a m  tomorrow  end of meet
