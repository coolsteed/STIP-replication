with polit crise sudden pop up in hungari and thailand  it may suggest that risk in some of these smaller  less liquid market sector such as emerg market and commod have risen   overnight the thai

 with metal price on the bottom left and energi price on the bottom right   metal price continu to fluctuat but show some sign of have top out for the  e  be   energi price  howev  have made a round trip from where they were at the begin of the year   the retrac of price has fed discuss about whether the so call specul premium in energi price has now been taken out   certain there are sign that specul have been exit some of these posit   those sign are most visibl for natur gas  which is someth of an outlier in the bottom  right   last week   s sharp declin in price may have been relat to the liquid of posit by the larg hedg fund that was close out posit   if the specul money is be chase out  for natur gas but also for other product  then perhap energi price now better reflect under fundament   final  i want to come back briefli to a topic i mention at the last meet relat to the nascent develop of an earli return fed fund market   as background  fed fund contract do not general dictat the  e of the return leg  so  not surpris  most fed fund are return to the lender late in the day   the gses have been interest in develop an earli return facil to meet the princip and interest payment  et given the new psr  payment system risk  rule   the data are spars  and our conclus are tentat  but i want to give you a brief updat   on page    the blue bar in the top panel graph daili volum of regular overnight fed fund contract   the smaller   bar repres overnight earli return volum   the black line show the percentag of overal volum repres by earli return   the  e seri start on august    which is when data first becam     avail to us   this seri   not includ term trade with earli return provis  in general  earli return make up about    percent of overal volum   the middl panel graph the effect rate for those trade with earli return provis in red  the blue line is the      a m  rate   earli return trade are transact in midmorn and thus show a strong correl with the      a m  rate  general trade about   basi point below regular fund   final  as shown in the bottom panel  earli return trade have far less volatil   the reason for the lower volatil is primarili tha   these trade are execut in midmorn rather than dure the late afternoon rush  when the fund rate often can move with larg swing   get back to the gses  they in fact have not been activ user of overnight earli return fed fund   they have  howev  use term fed fund of up to a month matur with earli return provis  e to matur on the date of their larg p i date   for term rate  unlik   for overnight trade  there is no rate concess   mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper for the period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
thank you   are there ani question for dino   presid pool
the earli return rate enter into the calcul of the effect rate for the day
yes  it
it    and therefor it affect the futur market trade
yes  it   affect it   now  the effect that it has is fair small   i think it   s  less than   basi point overal
but should that volum rise  it could becom quantit signific
that   s correct   it could   again  despit forecast by some trader and broker in the market  so far that has not happen   in part  it   s becaus the gses have been use term fed fund more than overnight fund for cost reason
about earli return  obvious what we care about as a committe is the    hour rate   therefor  in calcul and target that effect rate  if that spread becam    substanti  we   d want to adjust for that  i would take it   the spread between the earli return and the regular    hour return is so small that the impli intraday rate in some sens that you calcul is not even close to our daylight overdraft charg   right
i haven   t made that precis comparison  but in general i would say that where you start out was perhap the most interest part  which is that the committe care about the    hour rate   now  that   s someth that i   m not awar has actual ever been articul befor   what has been articul to the desk has been the overnight rate  whether that period is    hour     hour  or some other  e   we have thought about the question of whether the earli return should be exclud  and so far we have been analyz it by track the data and tri to understand what effect it has   but if the committe feel that it should be the    hour rate rather than someth els  then that consider will have to be taken up separ
from the econom standpoint  clear we care about the    hour rate  but if the intraday rate rose  and so for a given    hour rate the effect overnight rate was  lower  that would realli distort the relationship between the effect rate and the longer term real intertempor rate of substitut
just to be clear  right now there isn   t an intraday rate   this is an overnight rate  and the way that it work out  it realli is rough a    hour rate becaus most of this trade  take place in earli morn to midmorn
even with the earli return
yes  most of the trade occur between      and      in the morn    it   s an earli morn market for trade  and it   s an earli morn market for return   so it actual   end up be rough a    hour market   it   s just that the trade take place at a differ part of the day
i see   but do you think of the differ as a risk premium
no  i don   t think it   s a risk premium   it just reflect the   or   basi point differenti for the bank   it just chang their procedur  so it add to their cost in term of return fund earlier and not have addit fund to use for make other payment  therefor  the bank may hit against it cap earlier in the day   so there is an econom cost  but it  sn   t seem to be a huge one
when you say    the bank     which side are you talk about
the bank that   s return the fund
okay   so they   re give up someth   i have a second question i want to ask about inflat compens   the chart you have in the front show that inflat compens has fallen at the front end   yet in the bluebook box on page    there   s a  calcul done from the near term matur tip secur show that  from octob novemb       to octob novemb        inflat compens has not chang much at all   do you have a more detail sens about at what part of the curv inflat compens has come down
at the short end  it   s go to be affect by energi  right
right   that show up in the bluebook as from now to  octob novemb        and that you would think of as a sort of expect carri effect
yes   energi price will tend to have a bigger effect dure the first two or three year of a tip curv
presid    the thing to point out in the staff forecast for cpi   inflat is that they are forecast declin in the cpi in septemb and octob   that   s    reflect in the shift in the bar at the left in that box in the bluebook   so it realli is at the veri front end
the number in dino   s chart are breakeven  so there were no carri adjust   therefor they   re not the same as the calcul in the bluebook  which includ a lot of adjust and are impli inflat number   these are pure the differ between the nomin and the real   one reason that we alway includ the five year five year forward breakeven rate is that it is the forward that is easiest to calcul   but where energi price and carri have the smallest effect   so if you want to get the clearest read from pure market data   it would be the five year five year forward rate
i understand and appreci that   thank   my impress  howev  is that you have someth near term go on becaus of what is expect to happen to the headlin cpi over the next coupl of month   then someth a coupl of year out  not next year but a year or two after that  is pull down the compens   is that a fair character of the market data
i would not be so bold as to go that far
let me see if i can get vinc to be that bold    laughter
yes   there is someth happen at the near end    laughter
that   s not veri bold  vinc
i was will to go that far    laughter
also  look at the relat movement   the first five year it   s move in a much wider rang   the five year five year forward rate has come down a bit but realli not a  lot
but the near term five year look as though it chang becaus of the next coupl of month and then after       and not much in         you   re okay with that interpret
i   m okay with that interpret
okay   thank you
vinc  you gave me a number for two year breakeven of      percent carri adjust    how   that relat to these number
that was the forward rate
the two year breakeven rate  carri adjust
right   the number in the box are the twelv month end in octob and novemb  and they   re not carri adjust   they   re straight read from that portion of the differenti between the two yield curv   so there are two thing go on   the shift in  e and the carri adjust
well  the carri adjust  sn   t affect the octob       calendar year  spread  nor would it affect the two year forward rate
if it was a forward rate  yes
are there other question   governor bie
can you go back to the gses    use of the earli return   you said they   re use the term fed fund but not the overnight   so who is use the overnight earli return
that   s a great question   it   s not clear   it seem to be a wide rang of institut   i don   t know that we   ve seen a distinct pattern yet   again  the size are pretti small as a percentag of the overal market   i   m not quit sure whi it   s be use or whether the bank are use it   there must be some cash manag aspect for which some bank are    use it  and perhap some custom  for whatev reason  are interest in get fund back earli   but i think this is one thing that we need to understand better and one thing that we   ll be look at in the come month   it   s a good question   i wish i had a good answer for you
well  i   m just glad you   re gather the data
may i just follow up   compar with the earli return  the regular fed fund loan is a    hour loan plus an option to extend it for a few hour   it   s an option   you could use it or not  right   so from that point of view  if what we want to get a bead on was the risk free    hour rate  then it look as though the earli return might be the one we   d want to target rather than the other   assum that the market is liquid enough to do that
well  the earli return has to be return earli in the morn   also  we know anecdot  and the data seem to support it  that most of that trade take place rough    hour befor deliveri   now that   s a character of a veri small segment of the market   to have a true    hour market  you would have to presum that       a m  trade are return by       a m  the next day and       a m  trade by       a m  the next day   that   s a level of exact that i   m not sure can be replic   or monitor  for that matter
do you have a question   all right   we need an action to ratifi the open market oper   do i hear a motion
approv  without object   thank you   let us turn now  to the econom situat    dave
thank you  mr  chairman   i cannot recal the precis basebal analog employ by     at the last fomc meet  but i have a vagu recollect he specul that i was either due for a forecast hit or due to be hit by the forecast    laughter   in ani event  sinc the  book was complet last wednesday  we have made sever trip to the plate with consequenti econom    statist on the mound   and how is the team do   i guess i=d say  better than the washington nation  not as well as the new york met   last thursday  we receiv retail sale figur for august   as you know  we focus on the retail control compon of spend  which strip out sale at auto dealer and build materi and suppli store   the august increas in this categori was     percent  a bit stronger than we had expect   but both june and juli were revis down  and on net these data were a touch weaker than those incorpor in the septemb  book   retail inventori for juli also were a bit below our expect   hous start for august were releas ye day   in line with our forecast  singl famili start drop near   percent  to      million unit  and the permit data point to some further declin in the month ahead   but multifamili start declin somewhat more that we had expect   if we had to redo the forecast today  we would probabl lower the increas in real gdp in the second half of this year to     percent at an annual rate   last friday= report that both headlin and core consum price increas     percent in august was right in line with our forecast   the major compon of ye day= ppi actual came in below our expect  most especi the core finish good index  which declin     percent in august   the onli sour note was an increas in the ppi for medic servic   the ppi for medic servic is use by the bea in construct the core pce price index  and it caus our es  of core  pce price for august to revis up from a high     percent to a low     percent    all in all  howev  the incom data over the past week left our forecast pretti much unscath   i am reliev about that  becaus  if i do say so myself  it= a beauti construct forecast    laughter   after all  with no further tighten of monetari polici  the economi eas into an extend period of slight below trend  growth led by a retrench in the hous sector   that slower growth of activ open a small output gap by the middl of next year but   not trigger a more precipit cyclic contract   then  as the downturn in hous wane and the associ multipli and acceler effect larg play out  the growth of real gdp pick back up toward potenti in        meanwhil  the output gap that develop over the next year or so  in combin with inflat expect that remain well anchor and a near flatten out of oil and other commod price  is project to impart a mild tilt down in core inflat   to    percent in      and   percent in        so  what should you make of this forecast   is it a construct as eleg and durabl as say the eiffel tower in pari  or is it more like the eiffel tower in las vega   it look pretti good a few block away but isn=t that impress upon closer inspect    laughter   in that regard  you could not be fault for wonder whether this forecast repres our averag of two possibl more plausibl outcom that we simpli didn=t have the courag to choos between      one view could be that this forecast is far too pessimist   after all  our project for growth in the second half of this year and in      is now well below the consensus   most of the avail measur of aggreg activ remain solid  real gdp is es  to have increas     percent over the year end in the second quarter  about in line with it pace over the past sever year   more recent  despit some notabl month to month swing  manufactur industri product is up at a   percent annual rate over the three month end in august   an even more  e econom indic  the level of initi claim for unemploy insur  has move sideway through the middl of this month and   not yet suggest ani inflect point in activ   moreov  oil price are down  the stock market is up  and financi condit in the corpor sector remain favor   these develop could cast doubt on our project slowdown in real gdp   the other view might be that our forecast is too op ist   cyclic contract are often precipit by larg imbal in the economi that caus a great deal of pain and extens damag when they get rectifi   certain  hous is look increas like a sector that could play that role   start and sale have drop sharpli in recent month  inventori of unsold home are still soar despit cutback in product  and price are rapid deceler   this jolt is occur while household are still deal with the substanti hit to their purchas power from the higher energi price that they have encount over the past sever year  yet all of this result  in our forecast  in onli a veri modest and gradual rise in the unemploy rate over the forecast period   i must admit that there were  e over the past sever week when i felt as though i=d seen this forecast befor   specif  in the summer of      and in the autumn of        at those  e  the staff saw that forc of restraint were in place  and we project a notic shortfal of growth from potenti   but we fail to anticip much in advanc the impend cyclic downturn in the economi   and i doubt that we will when such an event occur again in the futur   i can assur you that we spent a great deal of  e examin both of these possibl critiqu of our forecast  but in the end  we still view someth like our project as more like than either of these two altern   so let me lay out the logic of the forecast and along the way address some of these concern   as i note earlier  we are now project the growth of real output in the second half of the year to be around     percent at an annual rate  about    percentag point less than in the august  book   the lower schedul vehicl assembl announc by the automak were part of the downward adjust   but the major sourc of the project weak in aggreg demand lie in residenti construct  which is now expect to lop off near     percentag point of growth in real gdp in the second half   if it  sn=t realli feel to you like an economi that is grow as slowli as     percent  there may be a good reason   our assess is that  except for the hous sector  the economi is grow at a pace of rough   percent   so far the    collater damag from the downturn in hous has been limit  and for the most part  we expect it to remain that way  at least for a  e   a pickup in nonresidenti construct activ has offset some of the weak in residenti construct  moreov  the recent declin in energi price seem like to cushion some of the near term effect of the hous contract by restor some lost purchas power to household and by help to support consum spend   with overal busi sale hold up reason well so far  the cost of capit still low by histor standard  and financi condit solid  outlay for equip should move forward at a fair rapid clip for the remaind of the year   but it seem implaus to us that the downturn in hous will not have multipli acceler consequ that hold down growth go forward   along those line  we expect employ growth to slow more notic by the end of the year   slower job gain and a further deceler in hous wealth should damp  consum spend as we move into next year   the result is a steadi  though gradual  rise in the person save rate over the next two year of about   percentag point  with the usual lag  slower growth of sale and output caus a mild deceler in equip spend   at the same  e  fiscal polici is becom progress less s ul over the forecast period   these forc are attenu  but not offset  by the boost to spend generat by a higher es  level of labor incom and by a lower trajectori of consum energi price in this forecast   all told  we see these influenc as like to hold the growth of real gdp below potenti over the next two year   still  we are not anticip the weaken in activ to cumul into outright recess   in our forecast  the fact that the implic of the hous downturn for the broader economi are relat limit rest import on two supposit  both of which are open to question   the first is that the slump in hous produc a sharp slowdown in hous price but not a larg nationwid declin in those price   in the past  hous price have been relat sticki on the downsid  with homeown resist price cut and keep their home on the market longer   our forecast envis someth similar occur in this episod   the second  assumpt is that hous wealth affect consum spend like other form of wealth and that there are no other channel of influenc of hous price and hous financ on consumpt   for exampl  we have not incorpor ani signific negat effect on consum sen ent that might accompani a rapid deceler of hous price   we have also made no special allow for the declin in mortgag equiti withdraw to restrain consumpt becaus we find the empir evid of such a connect to be fragil   previous  book simul have demonstr that turn on ani of these channel would amplifi the effect of a weak hous market on the aggreg economi   their absenc in our baselin forecast is one of the reason that the economi bend but  sn=t break in respons to our project hous slump   as you know from read the  book  not all of the action was on the demand side of our forecast   in fact  we revis down aggreg suppli by virtual    the same amount that we revis down aggreg demand  leav the output gap near unchang from the august  book   i would not be surpris if some of you were suffer a littl revers    sticker shock    from the low rate of gdp growth that we are now project  much of which can be trace to the downward adjust that we made to potenti output in each of the last two project   the growth of potenti is es  to be about    percent this year and next and     percent in        although we still could be character as product    op ist    with our project of gain in structur product of    percent per year   a figur that is abov mani of the outsid forecast that we monitor   we are increas look like potenti output    pessimist    becaus of our expect of onli meager gain in avail labor input   as you know  we are project a steepen downtrend in labor forc particip and a slow in the work age popul as the front edg of babi boom retir arriv late in the project period   our view are signific below the consensus here   howev  as we have note in the past  if potenti gdp ul  prove stronger than we are forecast  actual gdp will like be stronger as well   so to a first approxim  the gdp gap and the assum accompani path of the fund rate would be larg unaffect by error in our forecast of potenti labor input  much like the real side of the project  our inflat forecast had some larg move piec that  on net  left us pretti much in the same place as our august project   on the favor side of the ledger  oil price are project to averag around     per barrel below our previous forecast   taken in isol  this develop would have led us to revis down our project of core pce price about     percentag point next year   but there was news on the unfavor side of the ledger as well   on the basi of unemploy insur tax record  the bea revis up the growth in hour labor compens to an annual rate of     percent in the first quarter of the year   onc again  we are confront with a huge differ between the signal provid by nonfarm busi compens and the employ  cost index  eci  measur of compens  which increas at a rate of just     percent in that quarter   such wild discrep have led some inflat forecast to employ reduc form price equat that circumv measur of labor compens altogeth   we are sympathet to that approach  and those type of model are in our stabl of forecast equat   but we think it unwis to ignor entir the issu of labor cost  given that they constitut two third of busi cost   so what do we make of this first quarter jump in hour labor compens   as you know  one of the princip differ between the two major measur is that stock option exercis are includ in the nonfarm busi measur of hour compens but not in the eci   our colleagu at the new york fed have been monitor data on option exercis by compani insid  and those data suggest that an outsiz jump in exercis in the first quarter probabl help to explain an appreci fraction of the jump in hour compens   but that  sn=t seem to be the full stori  as wage and salari were revis up in categori  such as construct  where option probabl do not figur promin in employe compens   in our forecast  we have assum that stock option exercis and other    nonrecur nonwag payment provid a temporari boost to the level of incom in the first quarter  about half of which will be revers by the third quarter    what about the consequ of these higher measur labor cost for price  model that take the data simpli at face valu want to revis up the forecast of core consum price inflat forecast between   and    percentag point in       howev  these data should not be taken entir at face valu  at least as a measur of increment busi cost   as we have argu in the past  option exercis are not like to repres a margin cost of product and  at the veri least  are probabl mislead with regard to the  e of ani such cost increas   thus we have discount the price implic of the first quarter surg in compens per hour  ad just a tenth to our inflat forecast for this factor   this exact offset the negat effect of the lower energi price and leav our project of core pce inflat unchang at    percent in        after that  a further wane of energi and other commod cost pressur  the emerg of a small output gap  and the assumpt that long term inflat expect continu to be reason well behav caus inflat to drop to   percent in        in that regard  the better core inflat figur of the past two month  the fall in oil price  and the drop in various read on inflat expect over the intermeet period provid us with some encourag that  inflat pressur will gradual fade over the project period   but we would hasten to note that none of these develop cinch the case that we have turn the corner on inflat     will continu our present
in the intern economi  the strike develop over the intermeet period has been the rapid and substanti drop in crude oil price and in price for some nonfuel commod   the spot price of wti crude reach a recent high of about     per barrel on august    follow news of problem with the bp pipelin at prudho bay   sinc then  it has declin to less than     in trade ye day  decreas about     per barrel   the far futur price is down somewhat less  near     per barrel  leav a barrel of wti crude for deliveri in      price about the same as a barrel of crude in the current spot market   as has been our practic for mani year  we have assum for the  book baselin forecast that oil price over  e will match those contain in the futur price curv that held when we final the forecast last week   the  e of our forecast this  book and last and the smooth from quarter averag result in our forecast path for the oil import price shift a bit less than did the spot price of crude   the downward revis in the oil import price amount to near     per barrel in the near term and narrow to somewhat more than    per barrel by the end of        some other commod market were remark volatil over the intermeet period as well  the spot price for gold declin more than     per fine ounc sinc the  e of the august fomc meet   mani of the industri metal also move    down sharpli in the past week or two  but in some case these declin mere retrac run up earlier in the intermeet period and result in onli small net chang   regard the implic of the lower oil price for our forecast  it is help to rememb that our assum price for wti crude in the fourth quarter is near  but still more than    per barrel abov  the averag price that prevail in the first quarter of this year  when we regard oil price as veri elev   in addit  the forecast path for wti now rise into      and then is about flat at close to     per barrel through the end of        it also is relev for construct the forecast to ask whi oil price have come down as they have   the new develop that trigger the reaction in market price seem to be import about the risk attach to futur suppli   some  aspect of geopolit tension  such as the conflict in lebanon and the ongo disput with iran over it nuclear program  seem to have eas   the atlant ocean  hurrican season has pleasant surpris  with fewer storm than previous expect and none so far threaten the gulf of mexico   one factor that like influenc the price reaction to the appar lessen of risk to suppli is the high level of inventori of crude oil at the present  e   current demand and suppli plus market expect of futur demand and suppli combin to determin spot and futur price plus desir inventori   with inventori alreadi high  news that futur suppli is less uncertain sharpli lower the price requir to clear the spot market and the premium that buyer are will to pay to ensur futur access to oil  nevertheless  the posit slope to the futur curv over the forecast period suggest that  on balanc  market particip are not expect futur suppli to be as abund relat to demand as is the case current   with respect to the implic for our forecast of foreign growth and inflat  we need to consid the direct effect of lower energi price and also to ask whether actual or prospect slow of global econom activ and  henc  demand for oil and other primari commod have contribut to the downward shift in these price   on balanc  our outlook for real gdp growth abroad general remain quit strong   howev  we do expect a decreas in the averag rate of growth of foreign real gdp from about   percent at an annual rate in the second quarter to    percent in the second half of this year and over the remaind of the forecast period   in both the industri countri and the emerg market economi  the pace of real growth was particular vigor dure the first half of this year and contribut to continu strong demand for oil and other commod   monetari polici has been tighten in respons to concern of inflat and overh in mani countri  measur to tighten fiscal polici have been pass in some case  and offici in china have impos addit administr measur to restrain growth   prospect moder of the rate of foreign growth was a featur of our forecast in august   data from canada and japan alreadi provid evid of a lessen in the rate of growth in those countri   howev  avail data on activ in the euro area  china  and mexico continu to be buoyant        in put the piec of the forecast togeth  we have conclud that the lower oil price are consist with overal foreign growth remain moder strong and will help to ensur that it remain so   at the same  e  the project pace of global econom activ is consist with oil price remain quit elev and rise somewhat into next year   we judg that the implic for foreign growth of the downward revis to the outlook for u s  real output growth were part offset by some boost to foreign growth that we otherwis would have incorpor in respons to the reduc energi cost  although these factor differ across countri   as a result and given data receiv sinc the august forecast  the path for foreign real gdp growth was littl revis on balanc from that in the previous  book   we have revis down our forecast for headlin consum price inflat abroad a few tenth for the second half of this year and next as a consequ of the lower path for energi price   we project that in the industri countri other than japan inflat will move down somewhat over the forecast period   in contrast  japanes inflat is expect to edg up but to remain below   percent   some   emerg market economi in asia still have control on or subsidi of domest fuel price  which delay ani pass through of higher energi price into domest inflat   accord  we project that increas in global oil price earlier this year will push inflat in emerg asia temporarili abov   percent dure the first half of next year   we look for inflat in latin america to remain contain near present rate   we see the risk to this forecast in mani respect as balanc   we have been surpris on the upsid by the strength in foreign real activ dure the first half of the year  and strong domest demand in some region could push off into the futur some of the slow that we are project   altern  foreign activ may be more sensit to the u s  slowdown than we current envisag   we feel especi uncertain with respect to the outlook for oil price  given market reaction to recent event  the sharp chang in price caught us and the futur market by surpris  although we are onc again assum that oil price will follow the path impli by futur price  we recogn that a much larger move up or down is quit possibl    and i will be happi to answer ani question
are there question   presid
first  i want to congratul   on the excel memo on inflat dynam  and i hope that we can circul it more broad to the academ communiti so we can enrich that debat   it was a superb paper      you know how much i appreci your comment on the inflat dynam that you   re see in other countri   i have a question on that front   realli two question      first  in listen to the peopl that we talk to in the energi busi  whether it   s lee raymond or all the oper of the various compani from exxon down to the smaller one  i still hear the issu of how much of this price revers   just as there was an issu of how much of the price increas   deriv from specul activ  nonphys demand   to summar what  i heard over the past week or so  my contact assert that the specul have shift to the short side of the boat   so that we have seen this tilt   i   m wonder how much influenc you ascrib to specul activ as oppos to physic demand and suppli activ   i know we   ve had this discuss befor  but has specul acceler the downturn  or is there someth els at play
to be honest  i don   t know of ani real data that the staff can bring to bear on this question   we have some data on the trade contract and who is trade  and to some degre these data may shed light on a measur of how much of the trade is fundament and how much of the trade is  for want of a better word  specul   but that   s just nonfundament trader  non end user   i don   t know that such knowledg would tell you how much of the price chang is due to which sort of activ   my remark this morn attempt to highlight the fact that the endogen part of this behavior is the price structur and the inventori behavior that emerg   i think that there was an interact in those thing  although as yet we don   t have real formal model of inventori behavior that i want to claim ani systemat truth about   but i think that the volum of trade and the volatil it might induc in price   feed back to demand for actual physic product through the behavior of inventori  so although it   s also true that the specul trader are ad to the upsid and the downsid   they are elicit a respons from the oil produc on the one hand and  to some degre  from the oil consum on the other to chang their inventori behavior   that also feed back on how    the price dynam work   right now  i think basic they are provid liquid to this market   but they may well be amplifi the swing   but i can   t put a number on it  i realli can   t
mayb dino can add someth
there   s probabl some short term effect   i think there may be someth to what you suggest  but my own assert is that it would probabl have a short term effect on  price   whether that   s a matter of day or week or mayb longer  it   s hard to put a  e dimens on it   i was tri to make the point in my remark  especi about natur gas  that most peopl just assum that last week   s price movement in natur gas   i believ a veri sharp drop occur on thursday   were relat to the closeout of some of these posit from the one hedg fund  and the presumpt is that other hedg fund that made money in energi earlier this year were also get out of some of these trade   so that would support what you were say  now  whether that element has an effect on price for a week or two week is veri hard to know  but it probabl   have some effect   i think   is probabl right in the sens that over the long term there are inventori effect  and at some point  those specul effect get wash out
well  again  it   s just someth i   m interest in   it   s not unimport  but i have a more import question      i notic last week that the intern monetari fund forecast global econom growth  non u s  growth  of around   percent   our number is    percent   what is the differ between us   if we   re underes   what would be the polici implic
part of the differ is the weight that they use   first  our number is total foreign  wherea their number is world   howev  the u s  number are probabl below averag   if anyth  we should go the other way  although in the past it has work my way   laughter   second  we use weight base on u s  export behavior   we   re tri to construct a    variabl that we   re go to then put into an equat or use in think about the volum of u s  export   they   re describ global econom activ   so they tend to use gdp type weight  and we use u s  export weight   that put a lot of weight on canada in our number  and canada is on the lower side on growth  relat to the averag   in their case  especi if they use ppp  purchas power pariti  weight   and i believ that they do in most of the number you see    that put a lot of weight on china and china   s growth and more weight on china   s growth than we put   that rais their averag   thus  some of the differ are due to differ in weight  nonetheless  there is a real countri by countri differ in that we are on the low side of their number   for exampl  for the euro area and certain for the unit state  although the unit state isn   t in our total foreign number   but were we go to put it in and mental calcul some kind of averag  the unit state would be a part of that stori  and europ would be anoth part   i guess mayb we   re just read the current data a littl differ  we   re not as persuad that europ is realli go on a sustain growth episod   we have japan do fair well  but we have number in the one and not ani higher   so i think we are a littl bit less op ist  if that   s the word  about the pace at which foreign growth will continu  we see the monetari polici action that peopl have taken  we see the slowdown in the unit state  and we   ve got a slower pictur for the rest of the world
thank you   presid pool
i have an observ and a question   your outlook for employ is growth at just        per month   if that   s what we   re go to see  we   re go to have a major communic challeng to explain it becaus it is go to look and feel like a recess to    almost everybodi who see those number   howev  you don   t have a recess  you have continu slow growth   so that   s just my observ   i have a question about the altern simul and the market base fund rate   if i understand what you do  you have your baselin forecast  and then you just impos a lower fund track  and that yield higher growth   anoth way of look at the market base fund rate is essenti to invert the taylor rule and say how weak econom activ would have to be for the taylor rule to lead us to cut rate   in that case  particular if you take a version of the taylor rule that has a lot of interest smooth in it  it take a lot of downsid surpris  some combin of activ and price  to get us to reduc rate to match the market   i just want to throw out that observ and ask whether you have ani respons to it
view from the appropri perspect         per month is not too bad   view perhap from the perspect of the administr of millard fillmor    laughter   so i will readili acknowledg that  if we   re right about our labor input forecast  there will be some communic difficulti  and there will be mayb even more polit consequ in some sens than under econom consequ   a number of you note  and i think the chairman note in the tes oni or a speech  that mark down of our expect for what would be good under employ growth   i   ve also been surpris in the past few month   if you had told most economist or market comment earlier this year that         a month was go to be a good employ figur  it would have come as a real shock   yet there has been  i think  a mark down of expect for employ growth  in that the recent figur  when they come out at         aren   t view as devast
but there   s a big differ between         and a quarter of that number
i complet agre   as i indic  this piec of our forecast    make me nervous becaus we are far out of the consensus  especi in our expect for the declin in labor forc particip   i   m actual a littl less nervous than i was a year and a half ago  when we first move to this chang in our forecast  becaus at the  e a veri big question was whether there was go to be a larg pool of underutil and unutil worker who would come back into the labor forc as the unemploy rate came down   when the unemploy rate came down  the labor forc particip rate   pretti much as we had expect   move sideway   so i feel a littl more comfort than i did earlier about this piec of our forecast   but ani  e you are this differ from everybodi els  you need to be reason humbl   as far as your observ about the market base fund rate simul  i think you are absolut right   a differ way to interpret it is to tri to understand what the market are tell us about the economi   i would also point to anoth altern simul that i think goe a bit in the direct that you   re suggest   the    less inflat persist    simul  in which inflat come down more rapid and  in essenc  allow the fed to lower the fed fund  rate more signific than we   re assum in the baselin in a way that   s not that differ from  the market   s expect for the fund rate   now  that   s one possibl  or it could be some combin   the market could be look at some combin of a littl less persist of inflat and mayb a littl weaker outlook for activ  although i would wonder about the weaker market interpret   look at the full financi configur  i don   t see indic from financi market that there   s an expect of a lot of financi stress on our doorstep   so i   m inclin to the view that they may be more in that    less inflat persist    camp than in a    much weaker economi    camp
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   dave  i   m tri to understand your forecast and  it evolut   as i read the  book  at least on the demand side  it seem to be larg a hous stori as you cut through everyth   so my question is  if i put myself back in august  befor i knew that incom were go to be as high as they were  that energi price were go to  come down  that equiti valu were go to go up  and so forth  and i plug the current view of hous into that  what would it give me   i assum it would give me growth for the second half of  this year at someth close to mayb   percent and mayb growth next year of less than   percent  i know that there are a lot of move part  but anyway  that is the question   if we had known about hous and not plug in this other stuff  where would we be
i would say you have it just about right   somewher on the order of   percent in the second half and someth certain under   percent in        obvious  in put our forecast togeth we were contend both with weaker hous and with some of these offset  that we factor in that have provid some cushion to the downsid surpris that we have had in hous through greater labor incom  more purchas power from lower energi price  and a littl  higher stock market   in some sens  those effect get us back to just modest below trend growth rather than signific below trend growth
i want to ask you about this    less inflat persist    altern scenario  which as you said bring inflat down to     percent by        as i read the  book and then the altern simul memo  i saw two thing       less persist and     an expect inflat outcom of     percent   it seem as though that outcom was built into the scenario  and i was wonder  given that we have had core inflat over   percent for more than     two year now  whether that is a reason assumpt to put in there   what would the outcom   look like if you had built into that scenario an assumpt of   percent instead of     percent
your   percent scenario is close to what we are forecast in the  book   inflat expect run more like   percent than the     percent  with less  inflat persist   you are right   we creat a scenario in which  if you thought about some of the equat es  that have been present  persist has fallen just about to zero  in which  case inflat pretti quick revert to what it averag has been over the past decad   that was the basi for the    less inflat persist    scenario   we obvious don   t think that is the most   reason under assumpt becaus we   re not forecast that outcom  but we do think that it   s not entir implaus and that you ought to at least have it on your radar screen as a possibl outcom   it highlight some of the tension between the    less persist    view of the world and the one in which we are expect greater persist
so you assum that there is no inflat persist and that we just go down to this longer term averag
well  by        some cost of adjust slow that process  so you don   t just jump immedi to the     percent
so it is just base on the assumpt  and the key is that assumpt of     percent or   percent
it is more than an assumpt  it   s an assumpt that could be  defend with some empir evid   again  in some of these inflat persist regress in veri short sampl period  there is evid that the persist has fallen veri close to zero   taken  at face valu  that could produc an outcom quit similar to what we are call the    less inflat     persist    scenario   as you know from read our memo  we do not think that is probabl the best start point for your consider  but we do not think it is implaus or unreason
i would like to compliment you       and your staff for inclus in this meet   s  book  part    on page ii     of an array of measur of inflat expect  appar in respons to needl from me   i can assur you that this will have no moral hazard effect  and you will get neither no more nor no less needl in the futur than you would have   so this is not go to encourag more needl   i think that effort will help go forward  and i look forward to more step in this direct   you just mention in respons to presid   that close to   percent expect inflat under the  book   s baselin  forecast  and that is use inform   i also want to compliment you on the document about inflat dynam   i think that will be use groundwork for us on the committe   what i hope we do in the next year or so as part of the kohn subcommitte deliber on communic is  to come to some understand of how the pattern that guid our conduct   call it a rule or  systemat compon of monetari polici   relat to inflat dynam and to discuss what inflat dynam we want to bring about
first  on this issu of persist  i want to mention that i think we should have some caution about interpret the result   i do not quit know what the word    persist    mean becaus this is realli a veri reduc form es    a key issu is what mean it is that inflat is revert to  and that can veri much depend on what we do in term of manag expect   it is complet reason for you to have done the simul that you call    less    inflat persist     but i might call it someth differ   so just i think that   s import to   think about  what i would like you to do is to actual go a littl beyond the forecast   i   d like to know what your think is on       mayb        i know you   re go to be a littl uncomfort about  do so becaus there is clear a lot of uncertainti   howev  when i think about what the state of    the economi is and how we should do monetari polici  we need to look at longer period   so i am  not go to hold you to it and say     gee  you have to be abl to give us a great forecast     but i  would actual like to know at least what your think may be on that issu
i am flatter that you ask  given that i am still tri to figur out  what happen in the first quarter of this year    laughter   so let me answer your question first and   then provid some of the caveat or background   basic  we do construct someth we call a  book extens that goe beyond the current  book horizon of        we do that for two  reason   one is that we have to forecast long term interest rate  and we also have to be think a  bit about where the economi is go  and we use that extens to help inform our think   we also use it in some of the analyt tool that we provid to the committe  such as the op  control exercis that we report from  e to  e  there is a logic for the  book   s current forecast period   most of what we are do in  macroeconom forecast is tri to get some purchas with a few gross correl in the data  and their dynam  and a forecast period through the end of      pretti much let those dynam play out   beyond that  the  book extens is what i call a model inform construct   i had actual hope a few year ago that we could start present this more frequent   my model staff wise persuad me not to do it yet   the reason is that the longer run extens   for exampl  of what the equilibrium real rate is go to be in             or        in a model as larg as frb us    often chang for obscur reason   for exampl  it may chang when we re es  the energi  product equat   in that case  all of a sudden we may get a   point chang in the equilibrium real rate that take us a week to figur out whi it happen  and ul  the explan would probabl seem unsatisfi to you   we have been work on a project over the past year to systemat the rule that we use in construct that longer term outlook so that we could present it to you and have more confid that when we do that we could both understand it ourselv and explain it to you   so i think what you are look for is someth that is high on our agenda  now  if we had to talk about      and       we are end this forecast period with a modest output gap   that output gap would  all els be equal  be push inflat down from the   percent rang with which we end up in this forecast to someth below   percent   so you would be on track with that   but when you construct these longer term rang  the first thing you will encount is the need for a dollar forecast   over the length of the  book period    can talk about a dollar forecast that is rough a random walk with a littl bit of a nod in the direct of  some depreci   when we construct a ten year extens of the forecast  we actual have to take  a veri precis stand on that   in these  book extens  right after the end of       we  basic have to build in someth like a   percent real exchang rate depreci of the dollar  then in the extens  even though we are run with an unemploy rate of rough    percent  we are not get ani further disinfl out of it becaus that output gap is just offset the inflat consequ of the anticip dollar depreci  so if i were to character the forecast a few step beyond the end of the current  book forecast  it would be one in which you have a posit output gap  mayb a    percent unemploy rate  and not realli make much progress beyond the   percent inflat with which we end the forecast period
thank you veri much   dave  i found your discuss of the averag to  be interest   that is  the forecast is between the devil and the deep blue sea or  in effect  between recess or much slower growth on the one side and more inflat with perhap higher growth on the other side   it reflect what i have been go through mental and the discuss we had at some length with our staff in boston ye day    just focus on the potenti for recess side  when is it that we have had drop in residenti invest such as the one that you are project  which are quit unusu look  across the whole rang of forecast  particular for this year  in the absenc of a recess   i think  the materi from the brief suggest that the drop is about the same as              which was a recess  and not quit as bad as              which was a big recess   when have we seen that  outsid a recess
i think the answer to that is probabl never in the post world war ii  period   we also have not had a rise in the unemploy rate of    percentag point stretch out over a year  as we have in this forecast  without run into a recess
that usual happen fa
from our perspect   i haven   t said this in year  so i allow myself  this one  e   there is more uncertainti at this point   both tail of the distribut feel wider to me  than they have in the past   now  my have said that  is it imposs to imagin that we could have  someth that we haven   t seen previous   a declin in hous of    to    percent and a modest rise in the unemploy rate   i think you would have to say that over the past six year the economi has shown remark resili and an abil to absorb some pretti signific shock    without trigger a cyclic downturn   so it is not imposs for me to imagin that we will again in this period   monetari polici is obvious not current push hard into the cycl   that is  exacerb the downturn as it was in the earli     s   with the drop in energi price and the  general sound financi condit that we see in the corpor sector  there are some reason for think there is a reason solid base upon which this shock is go to occur   but have said that  i think the situat is uncomfort
the behavior of construct that we are project is unusu  but the predic is also unusu in that we did go through a mild recess but with substanti no attenu in the pace of construct   so it is an unusu path that we follow to get here  and in our baselin forecast  it is an unusu path that we follow go forward
it is interest that  when you plot out all the other major forecast and you look at the under element of them and you look at gdp  inflat  and so forth  the  book is realli an outlier on the low side in term of growth and the fed fund rate   mayb you are right   you have been here befor as an outlier from the rest of the mainstream forecast   i wish i had a good sens of how all of that work out
some  right and some  wrong    laughter  i do have a sens of that
i figur you might  you know
part of the differ stem increas from our more pessimist take  on potenti output   mani of those outsid forecast have the unemploy rate rise to   percent  and we have it rise a bit more   some of that differ is greater cyclic weak that i would attribut to the depth of the hous downturn that we are forecast   but some of it is just that we see potenti output as veri weak as well   that exagger or has the potenti to creat a    gdp illus in compar the forecast  where we look much  much weaker even though our  output gap isn   t that much larger   for what it is worth  in the past week i have seen more peopl who do a serious track of the economi move toward our outlook rather than away from it   so  it wouldn   t surpris me if more outsid forecast weren   t show not someth as weak as mayb     percent in the second half but someth   percent or below
one small thing   on the other side of the devil and the deep blue sea  there is such a sharp contract of residenti invest  which last basic for a year and a  half   the forecast   attenu the rate of declin into        but the contract last pretti much a  year and a half from where we are   could it be fa    could builder see that it is in their best interest to stop build now so that price do not go down on new home fa  than they have gone alreadi and inventori do not build anymor   could that contract be shorter  and could we come out of it fa
the answer to that is    yes     and i think there is some risk   one featur  of our forecast is the fact that we are not project larg declin nationwid in hous price   we are expect a deceler but not ani outright declin   one could imagin that more of the adjust could take place more quick by a big drop in hous price that in some sens clear out that inventori through higher sale and mayb less product adjust   on that side  you would probabl get a quicker hous cycl than the one that we are project   howev  it also bring  with it some downsid risk in that household would realiz how much their net worth had fallen  which could have consequ for consumpt both direct through the wealth effect and perhap through sen ent   that correct could be quicker and mayb deeper  but then the rebound could be fa    that is a risk we have certain contempl   we were a littl nervous about be too adventuresom on the hous price forecast   we are not veri good at forecast    asset valu  we never understood how price got as far out of align as we think they are  and we are not sure exact what the process of correct is go to look like   so we have taken a middl stanc between two model   one model that basic forecast hous price off pure momentum and anoth one that take serious the analyt apparatus  which we show you a  year and a half ago at our special brief on hous  that look at the error correct process of hous price to rent   the latter model actual   forecast outright declin nationwid in hous   price by        we are between a momentum model  which expect hous price to slow less than we are forecast  and this error correct model  which show bigger declin
i was not realli suggest that there would be major price hit but onli  that the contract that you are show in the near term in residenti construct might be enough  given mortgag rate  demograph  and those kind of thing
in some sens our forecast is below our model   our model still say  that the fundament in term of cost of capit and incom are reason support of residenti invest   we thought we actual creat some possibl of upsid surpris with our forecast as   well and not just downsid in the adjust that we made to our forecast
that is exact what i was tri to get at
if there are no more question  we   re readi for the econom go around   for the benefit of our new member  the convent is that you rais one hand to be  recogn and be put in the queue  if you have a comment or question  rais two hand for an  intervent   i   ve notic that there have not been a lot of two hand intervent  particular on  one day meet  when we don   t have much  e   it is perfect sensibl to take account of the   e  and that is fine  but if you do have an import intervent  by all mean  don   t hesit   we start with presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m go to be quit brief   my contact in the  transport industri are give off some veri mix signal   up is invest heavili in capac expans   they have a problem in expand capac becaus they tradit do it by buy use passeng aircraft   there are veri few of these larg aircraft around   they are expect a busi holiday season   my contact in the truck industri say that his firm is now contract   they have cancel order for heavi truck  the rest of them for deliveri this year  and i found these number quit interest   he gave me the heavi truck purchas  these are the big  over the road  heavi  truck   i will read you the number from      through                            and         their  plan truck purchas for next year are      and they have cancel the order for the rest of this year   so the contract is dramat  and they have actual been reduc capac   my wal mart contact said that it   s a bit hard to read the most recent data   they work  entir on a year over year basi   last year was heavili distort by the hurrican season  and he  said that the latest weekend was a bit disappoint   the paycheck cycl that they look at to  understand their custom    liquid situat is veri mute  appar with lower gasolin price take pressur off the budget of mani of their custom   he said that  for the first  e he can rememb  they have drop the construct of new store  they   ve actual cancel seven or eight project becaus of high construct cost increas  which have been run in the neighborhood of    percent year over year   they are have no problem in find labor  and he is not report ani particular great price pressur   i had alreadi comment earlier about my concern about what these employ number are go to mean  and so i won   t repeat that point  thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   my contact call and director report this   round point to moder growth in overal econom activ   both nation and in our district  hous is weak   domest auto product is slow from last year  but activ in other sector  remain on a solid foot  start on the downsid  one of our detroit director from pult home character the   slowdown in hous as broad and deep  and he said that they face a rocki road for the next year or two   with regard to motor vehicl  gm note that their lower product in the fourth quarter larg reflect the retool of five plant for their new truck platform  reduc low margin sale  to rental fleet  and lower desir inventori hold by dealer becaus of higher interest rate   both gm and ford are tri to reduc their relianc on sale to rental fleet  in contrast  a wide array of capit good manufactur report continu strong growth  the two major temporari help firm headquart in the district point to modest but steadi growth in billabl hour   import  no contact was worri about a protract slowdown in the  economi   inde  my director were quit op ist   this is an import chang from six week ago  when we were hear comment that the expans had becom long in the tooth and  concern that we were head for a period of sustain weak   this more upbeat assess was in line with the sen ent i heard at the intern manufactur technolog show  which was held in chicago earlier this month with over        attende from more than     countri   now  i did not have a chanc to talk to all of them   laughter  but the one i did talk to were quit op ist about increas demand for u s  made high tech capit equip   the most amaz  and impress new technolog that i saw was someth that look like a larg ink jet printer  but it spit out metal dust to fabric intric part without tradit tool or die   this was realli quit unusu and impress     turn to inflat  there was littl chang in most report regard price pressur   labor compens continu to increas at elev rate   our contact from temporari help firm note  a further step up in wage for high skill worker  wherea our retail contact said he was pay   to    percent more for entri level sale personnel   of cours  the energi pictur on the cost side look better   sever contact express relief at the recent declin and hope that they would lead to reduct in fuel surcharg and relat cost   turn to the nation outlook  we agre with the  book   s assess that growth in the third quarter appear to be somewhat weaker than we anticip at the  e of the august meet   howev  in contrast to the  book  we do not think the sluggish will persist for long   current financi condit do not appear to be a restraint on activ   labor market are in   good shape  so growth in job and wage should continu to support household spend   we are get a welcom boost to real incom from lower energi price  and given the increas in busi op  that i note earlier  i am less concern that cautious anim spirit will caus busi to pull back on spend   hous remain the major downsid risk  but i get the  impress that thus far the weak in residenti invest is not spill over to the other sector of the economi   of cours  we have talk about this at great length  so our overal assess is that by earli next year growth will be much closer to potenti than the  book project   accord  we do not think that ani meaning resourc gap will emerg to restrain inflat   inde  our inflat model base on data sinc      look for core  pce inflat to be     percent in       and     percent in         the model that use data onli sinc      come out somewhat lower  at     in       and     in        in think about the differ between these forecast  i found the background paper that dave circul quit use  as sever other have said   our model allow for perman shock to     the level of inflat  and as the paper note  such shock appear to have been much smaller sinc        but as also discuss in the paper  we have no way of know whether these perman  shock will be small in the futur   i think the most like interpret of the reduct in the volatil of these perman shock is that polici has done a better job of anchor inflat expect   the public is more convinc than they were in the past that we will maintain low and stabl inflat   but if our action fail to confirm this belief  we would lose credibl  lead to higher inflat expect and impart more persist to the current inflat shock   an inflat shock that is perman rather than transitori is our respons   our forecast remind me of this risk   true  so far this is just a risk   we have not yet seen ani broad base increas in long run inflat forecast by privat sector economist or in the five year to ten year tip inflat compens   inde  tip have even move down recent  this news is welcom   but even if inflat expect have not move up  anoth concern is the level of long run inflat expect   and i thought     rais a good point last  e in remind us about it   long run inflat expect of around     percent for the cpi translat into a core pce rate well abov the middl of my comfort zone of   to   percent   even the  book expect core pce inflat to be abov   percent through         i am concern that even now the public could be question our resolv to bring inflat into what mani of us have said is  our comfort zone   i am alreadi hear this sen ent from some market analyst   even without an increas in expect  it is not clear to me that inflat will settl back to a level that i view as be consist with price stabil without further polici action
presid    go back to the automobil  you  mention the retool   the  book has reduc product plan for the second half   is that  what you heard
yes  and chrysler announc just ye day that they  too  are reduc product in the second half   what intrigu me about gm  which has lower product plan  is the changeov for light truck   they are produc these truck in five plant  and that is the  largest number of plant that produc one type of vehicl   as a result  when they chang these plant  they do it sequenti  the changeov slow product in that plant   then they ramp up   and it take some  e to ramp up   then they go to the next plant and do the same thing   so they are go through a seri of five plant  and that in itself lower their product in the fourth quarter   the other thing i mention would lower it as well
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  the eleventh district economi remain strong and continu to grow at a stronger pace than the rest of the countri  with employ growth continu at  rough twice the nation   s pace   incident  home sale have not turn down in our district  so  we haven   t been sing yet what we call the    coastal blue    as far as the homebuild market is concern   i think that   s enough said about texa and the eleventh district   i would like to talk about what i have learn this  e from my usual sound of some  two dozen ceo and cfos   i have ad a new one  by the way   the largest truck dealer in the  countri  which        billion in sale of heavi truck   just as a footnot  what is drive some of what presid pool report are the chang in emiss standard that are be enforc as of januari  other than that  they do not see much turndown in volum  to summar the report of these interlocutor  i am go to borrow from mark twain   s great quip about the music of wagner   accord to these busi contact  the outlook for  econom growth is better than it sound  wherea the dynam of inflat is wors than it sound     just a few anecdot here for  if not similitud  verisimilitud   by the way  all the interlocutor are fulli awar of the shape of the yield curv   these individu are sophist    and they are especi awar of what is happen in the hous market   as one ceo told me  the onli subject that has been more analyz than the hous situat is the birth of brad pitt   s babi   laughter   accord to this view  if we have not discount what has been happen in the hous market  we have been live on mar  and i think that is an import point to take into  account   if you rememb  dave  i have been more pessimist than the staff in term of the depth of the hous downturn   well  veri quick  accord to the cfo of frito lay  he and his counterpart cfos in consum good compani do not see an appreci slow of growth from the second quarter to  the third quarter   the cfo of up report that  while busi is tougher  third quarter growth is run at a rate of   percent  the same as the second quarter  and their busi project indic gdp growth    in the high   percent or low   percent area    for the rest of the year   the ceo of  burlington northern santa fe report that  despit a    percent year over year falloff in lumber shipment through last week  busi overal    has actual firm sinc the second quarter      from my usual report on the panamax ship charter rate  it is noteworthi that sinc our last meet   when the round trip book rate was         a day  the rate has soar to         a day   by the   way  the rate for carri back finish product like steel from china  in the so call handymax fleet  has risen to         from         a day  where it was at our last meet  all the retail i talk to   from   eleven to jcpenney to costco to home depot   report  that they feel that they have bottom out and that thing are pick up  with one except   that except is wal mart  and i think some of that situat relat to the intern dynam of the way wal mart is posit itself in the market   i think bill   s report was veri accur on wal mart     there are some temper contra indic   the book to bill ratio for texa instrument  and other semiconductor firm has fallen to   or slight below  and advanc book for airlin are somewhat weaker   herb kelleh of southwest airlin  who has to be the most entertain  interlocutor i talk to  temper that by say when we met last  e the advanc book curv     index    was  say        it has now eas to somewher around      a notic but not dramat drop  the ceo of ed summar the growth side of the economi much as did the major of the ceo i spoke to for this go round when he said     we were all expect thing to be wors  they haven   t gotten wors       they were all expect thing to get tougher  and they haven   t gotten tougher  except for one area   the procur of labor   there is a shortag of bank teller and mechan   by the way  a wrench bender  as they call the job in california now   a simpl mechan without the complet of a high school diploma   get          a year   there is a  shortag of truck driver  of oil field hand  of chemic engin  and even of unskil worker  such as retail store cashier in houston  and for the first  e i have heard from the major hoteli  of a shortag of hotel maid   to illustr the point  one ceo mention that  wherea his compani  regular use to get     applic for     truck driver job  they now get     so the bottom line is that our contact are feel more op ist than the economist    forecast   they are worri about some constraint on domest labor   as one contact said  the economi feel like a full employ economi  i want to spend just a minut on the inflat pictur   i   m not go to go through anecdot from the ceo  though it pain me great as the son of an australian to note that anheus busch has told it retail that it is go to rais the price of beer   percent start in januari        but i  do want to explain whi our board vote   to   to rais the discount rate   as you know  we measur    inflat at the dalla fed by the trim mean   our number show trim mean inflat   run at     percent in juli and a twelv month rate of     percent and  not unimport  with    percent of the compon element increas at a rate of   percent or more   now  of cours  we cannot updat those number until the next pce number come out  so you might argu that they are veri stale   but the recent cpi releas was not comfort   dave  you mention     percent  take that at face valu  you can say that consum inflat is unchang from juli   but if you realli look at those number  the rate for juli was      percent  and the rate for august was      percent   if you annual those number  that is a differ between      percent and     percent  so we need to keep in mind that the august cpi read is about midway between juli   s low read and the elev read over the previous four month   at an annual rate of rough   percent  it is better than earlier this year  but it is still uncomfort   i take presid     s point about our credibl  particular against the background of the trim mean  cleveland   s  median rate of     percent  and then our six month trim mean rate run at about     percent   i believ   i mention this simpli to urg the committe that   not onli in our deed  to take presid     s point  but also in our word   we need to continu engend confid about inflat expect and be veri care in the way we state ourselv   we cannot take it for grant that inflat has been complet conquer   thank you  mr  chairman
you mention a third quarter es  of about   percent
that was the up es   yes  sir
i am just curious   the third quarter will be over in ten day  given the data that we have alreadi seen  what would you es  is the rang of standard  deviat around the current run es    if you are look at the third quarter  which is over    short  we have seen at most two third of the data we are go to see   what is the approxim rang of error would you say in term of es  the current quarter
it is still vagu
still pretti larg    laughter
i want to say someth on the order of   percentag point   just the revis in the data are not too differ from that
mr  chairman  if i may  again  this is just one sourc of data   they happen to be in a busi that is  i think  particular interest   in prepar for the last meet  they were talk about a number closer to   percent than the origin es  befor the revis  and  they prove to be quit accur   but i want to make sure i was clear   the cfo was say that  their third quarter is run at a   percent growth rate   the same as the second quarter in their busi   and their es  for gdp growth in the fourth quarter is in the high twos or low three
okay   thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the data bear on the near term econom outlook suggest both slower econom growth and a bit less core price inflat go forward   in term of econom activ  the recent news has been uniform negat   result in a signific downward revis to growth in the  book   inde  compar with  the outlook of other forecast  the  book   s project of real gdp growth for the second half of this year is quit pessimist  it would now rank in the lower   percent tail of the distribut of  individu blue chip forecast   i think this pessim is not complet unfound  howev  larg becaus of my worri about the hous sector   the speed of the falloff in hous activ and the deceler in hous price continu to surpris us   in the view of our contact  the data lag realiti  and it seem a good bet that thing will get wors befor they get better     a major homebuild who is on one of our board tell us that home inventori has gone  through the roof  so to speak    laughter   he liter said that   with the share of unsold home top    percent in some of the new subdivis around phoenix and las vega  he has label these the new ghost town of the west   in fact  he describ the situat at a recent board meet  in bois   he had tour some new subdivis on the outskirt of bois and discov that the hous  most of which are unoccupi  are now be dress up to look occupi   with curtain  thing in the driveway  and so forth   so as not to discourag potenti buyer   the general  assess is that this overhang of specul inventori impli that permit and start will continu to fall   inventori ratio will rise  and the market probabl will not recov until        so   far  builder remain hesit to cut price  fear that do so will caus a surg in cancel rate on sold but unfinish home   howev  builder now routin offer huge incent  and price cut appear inevit   we have been follow the case schiller hous price index  which is base on hous price data in ten larg urban market  three of which are in california   begin in may of this year  futur contract on this price index also began trade  they suggest that hous price will be fall at an annual rate of about   percent by the end of this year   of cours  trade in this new futur market is still somewhat thin  but it is a signal that we need to keep a veri close eye on the incom data and watch whether the hous slowdown is turn into a slump  turn to inflat  core measur of consum price inflat remain well abov my comfort zone  but the latest read on consum price have been modest better   unlik the  book  i think the outlook for inflat has actual improv a bit sinc our last meet larg becaus of the recent drop in commod and crude oil price   the relief on energi price is  of cours  veri welcom  but we do have to be care not to overes  the extent to which past energi price pass through has been boost core inflat   for exampl  airfar might seem like    an obvious case in which outsiz consum price increas reflect energi price pass through   howev  our staff recent calcul the share of jet fuel cost to total airlin oper expens  and es  that the jump in those cost like account for less than half the rise in airfar this year   instead  airfar may reflect strong demand and constrain capac as indic by veri high airlin passeng load factor   still it seem like that energi pass through has play at least some role in the run up of core inflat this year  so ani energi price pressur on core inflat is like to dissip over  e  now  as   note  the  book has complet offset the favor effect on core  inflat from lower energi price by boost the growth rate of labor cost   in contrast  i attach a littl less weight to the recent data on compens per hour   my guess is that most of the  differ between hour compens and the eci   relat to profit link item like bonus and stock option  and that suggest to me that margin cost of product are not rise signific fa    even if they are  it remain true that markup are high   so with suffici competit pressur  firm have room to absorb cost increas without fulli pass them into price   final  i want to add my compliment to those of other to the board   s staff for a veri interest analysi of inflat dynam and monetari polici   as i mention at our last meet  it may be unduli pessimist to assum that the recent rise in inflat will be high persist   over the past ten year  es  reduc form model suggest that core inflat general return to it sampl averag after sever quarter   recent our staff examin persist at a more disaggreg level and found that the same general pattern also hold for each of the major compon of the core pce price index  with price inflat for durabl onli slight more  persist than price inflat for nondur and servic   in the current situat  this suit of    regress model indic that core pce inflat should fall to just below   percent by the middl  of next year   i am not quit as op ist as these simpl model  but on balanc my concern about the inflat outlook have been slight allevi by recent develop
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   new england continu to grow modest  though recent data suggest that some caution is warrant   district employ growth  remain slower than that of the nation   most state in the region are back to their januari       level  of employ  but the largest state  massachusett and connecticut  are not   the philadelphia  fed index of overal state activ  which are base larg on employ  and wage relat  data  suggest sluggish growth as well  with main and massachusett at or near the bottom of the index for the countri as a whole   even with slow labor growth  certain categori of posit are veri hard to fill   in particular  financ  account  certain it specialti  engin  biotech  and  skill labor for manufactur   in fact  one larg aircraft manufactur was quot as say that the labor situat as far as he was concern was insan   cost for acquir certain kind of labor are rise  but in general  we are not see increas across the board in overal expect labor  cost   but given the kind of labor that are veri much an import part of the busi in the  first district  such increas may not be far off  hous market are clear contract   we are part of the coastal situat   through the second quarter  new england hous price escal at onli half the pace of the unit state as a whole  and home foreclosur  while still fair low  tick up more signific in the region than elsewher   permit have fallen sharpli  down    percent from last year and    percent from the year befor  though ye day   s start data were a bit better for the northeast than elsewher   slower build is lead supplier of hous product to project declin busi later this year    as their sale tend to lag a declin in residenti real estat market   consum confid for the region as a whole drop off at a fa  pace than elsewher in the nation in august compar with  the year befor  so there are all those reason for caution about the growth rate of the new england economi  but not all the data are bad   consum price  in general  are escal more slowli  even though energi cost are higher   downtown and suburban offic vacanc rate are down  and  rent are rise   hardwar and softwar busi that were contact or that are repres on our small busi advisori group report fair strong revenu and definit concern about cost  busi confid measur and survey were posit both for massachusett and connecticut  reflect profit trend and stronger sale and even some strength in manufactur   as i mention at our last meet  the growth in person incom in the region  despit slow job growth  is on a par with that of the nation   reflect this and strong corpor profit  state incom  sale  and corpor tax revenu are up  in some case by relat larg percentag   so even though  we have some reason to be concern about new england  not everyth is negat   though that is sort of hard to find in the local media and you certain will not hear the politician talk about it either  turn to the nation  i would agre that most incom data sinc our last meet have been on the subdu side   auto sale  trade data  and certain anyth to do with residenti real  estat market have been more subdu than was expect   of cours  price measur have been  subdu as well  at both the headlin and the core level   but like new england  not everyth is  slow   i would look at employ growth as fair solid  even though it has slow from the begin of the year   the surpris in wage and salari incom may reflect larg the exercis of stock option  but it could also reflect some pressur on overal wage cost becaus hire certain    kind of worker is get difficult   oil price are down  and gasolin price declin act as a kind of bonus to the consum   consum spend isn   t too bad   the latest retail sale data aren   t bad at all  and although confid bounc around a bit  it seem to have recov   at least as much  as gasolin price have recov   industri product seem pretti good  with strong growth in some equip categori   busi profit are good   order and shipment data suggest that busi spend is solid  i am sort of repeat everyth you said     and i probabl should not do that   but i seem to be at the same point as peopl you mention in your present might be   a littl shock by the slow of expect gdp over the next coupl of quarter   in fact  when we in boston look at our baselin forecast  it is a good deal more op ist larg becaus we are not  see as much of a declin in residenti invest   i found the brief ye day to the board  interest  when you track your own forecast of residenti invest   at one  e we were lower than you were  but you far surpass us   in fact  with your declin    percent greater than  our in       and quit a bit larger again in        we get a gdp that is     percentag point higher in          and almost   percentag point higher in         we also see a lower nairu  and we have a bit higher es  of potenti   so it   not affect the gap as much  but it   affect the headlin number of gdp   i understand all the mechan  but the staff forecast is lower than most privat  forecast   i wonder  if growth is that low for that long  whether it might set off a chain reaction of actual higher save rate than you project and lower confid that could feed back more strong than you have anticip   in that regard  i found the recent es  of a rise probabl of recess interest   i do not think we   re go to have a recess  but i do wonder  about it if  in fact  we do realiz the slow growth of the  book forecast      howev  how much do we realli know about how long residenti invest will stay  negat without a recess   mortgag rate are not up that much   onli    basi point or so from  the begin of the year   incom are rise  and nonhous wealth is rise   at some point  buyer should recogn that hous has gotten more afford and resum desir purchas   perhap without further major price declin   certain specul build is off  and investor  have back out of contract  but how much more of that realli will occur   the  book would suggest anoth year and a half  but shouldn   t builder be act quick now to reduc the amount  of overbuild and to preserv price level   under demograph and other fundament have not chang either   so it is hard actual for me to see that residenti invest will be that hard hit that long   i take     s comment about the builder in her district   i imagin that  if i had talk direct to builder in the first district  they might have been pretti gloomi  too   again    given some reflect of the coastal situat   i did talk to nick retsina at the joint center for hous studi  which harvard run  and he was not particular negat   he felt that a correct   is occur but thought that it would be short live   now  he did say that they were go to come out with some revis and that he was still work on them  so his outlook may get more  negat   but i am go to tri to keep tab on where they see thing becaus they do stay in touch with all the larg builder across the countri   again  the knock on effect of lower residenti construct may not be all that great   you mention that nonresidenti construct is up  but the  book say that it will slow soon   a good deal of that is oil relat  and as long as peopl are work  incom are solid  and financi condit remain pretti accommod  consumpt ought to remain solid   so i wonder whether the  book baselin is realli more of a worst case scenario for residenti construct and gdp  though i realiz region effect of the hous slowdown on    employ and spend could be consider   if growth is fa  and if your es  of the nairu and the particip rate are more or less on target  i also wonder about the risk of higher inflat over the forecast period than is the case in the baselin as resourc pressur grow  moder energi cost are help here  but they have been volatil in both direct  and i at  least would like to see a somewhat longer period below recent high befor declar victori   in  sum  the rather benign baselin forecast may be the best  but as you note  there are great rang of uncertainti   there are downsid risk to be sure  and it is imposs to rule out a recess given  the slow growth forecast of the  book   but i realli think the risk to be concern about lie in the area of stronger growth  more pressur on resourc  and higher and more persist inflat  as mani other peopl have comment  i  too  found the materi on inflat persist of  some interest and veri well done  though i take the point that it is hard to be confid either about the definit of persist or about whether it is  in fact  lower or higher   i would argu here that it might be better to assum  as we consid the stanc of polici  more rather than less persist  in part becaus we are uncertain and in part becaus the cost of be wrong are somewhat asymmetr   if inflat is less persist and we assum it is not and take a conserv polici stanc  inflat should retreat quick and help shore up our credibl   choos a weaker stanc   and be wrong about it could be quit cost   given the uncertainti face us  the natur of the incom data  and the fact that we have alreadi paus  it might not be  e right now to take out more inflat insur  but i certain think it is  e to be veri vigil

thank you   presid
thank you  chairman bernank   overal  econom activ continu to expand in the third district   the consensus in the region busi communiti is for moder growth in the month ahead  but some sen ent has turn more cautious in the intermeet period   we have seen a slowdown in region manufactur activ over the past month   our busi outlook survey  which remain confidenti until noon tomorrow  weaken somewhat in septemb with general activ fall just bare into the negat area  at       from an      number in august   this is the first negat read we   ve seen sinc april        the diffus index for shipment  new order  and unfil order also turn slight negat   i don   t want to read too much into one survey   the april      dip was veri short live  and we saw a similar pattern in our survey in the mid     s  when growth slow but then pick back up again fair quick   part of the slowdown in manufactur is at firm that suppli the hous industri  reflect a slowdown in residenti real estat  which has becom more pronounc in our district sinc our last meet   build permit and home sale were down in juli and august  inventori of home on the market  like much of the nation  continu to increas   hous price appreci has slow  but we have not yet seen outright declin   despit an increas in  cancel sale of new home  builder general indic that their backlog will keep them relat busi through the rest of the year   howev  some real estat contractor have begun to lay off employe in anticip of slower activ      a pickup in activ in nonresidenti real estat market has been help to offset the declin in residenti construct   offic vacanc rate continu to edg down  and net  absorpt of offic space continu to be posit   howev  over the next year  some moder in nonresidenti build construct in our three state is expect   in respons to a special question in our manufactur survey this month  about one third of the firm report that they plan to lower their expenditur on new structur next year compar with this year  onli one tenth of our firm expect to rais spend on structur   when we ask a similar question a year ago  about half the firm expect to rais their expenditur on structur in       and  in fact  we did see that this year   for other categori of capit spend  howev  firm by a larg margin anticip expenditur in       to be the same as or higher than those in         at some small bank in our district there has been a recent pickup in nonperform loan  which is concentr in their commerci real estat portfolio   condit in other sector of our region are littl chang sinc our last meet   retail sale of general merchandis edg up  but sale of back to school merchandis  especi fall apparel  did not seem to meet manufactur    expect   payrol employ continu to expand in our three state at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole  which is typic of the region   the unemploy rate  which had edg down slight in june  edg back up in juli but remain below   percent   while mani employ continu to report difficulti in fill posit  the philadelphia staff   s forecast is for employ in our region to grow at a pace of about   percent over the next year  slight lower than this year  unemploy rate in the region are expect to increas modest mayb over the next year   growth continu at a moder pace  but we see littl indic of reced price pressur in the district   the index of price receiv in our manufactur survey edg up in    septemb   there was some minor moder in price paid  but that index remain at an extrem high level   employ in a number of industri in the region report that wage and salari level have been move up at a somewhat fa  pace than they did a year ago    turn to the nation economi  my view is not much differ than it was at our last meet   my main concern remain the outlook for inflat and the risk it pose for our credibl   in my view  the fed   s most import contribut to a healthi economi is achiev and maintain price stabil   as expect  incom data continu to indic a moder in growth to potenti or somewhat below potenti   on the negat side  hous has weaken more sharpli than mani expect  and auto product seem to be turn down for the rest of the year   on the posit side  as has alreadi been mention by a number of other  busi invest and corpor profit remain firm   employ continu to rise at a moder pace  the revis wage and salari data are now more consist with the strength in consum spend that we   ve seen  and continu growth in incom and perhap lower gas price will help offset the possibl negat effect that we may see from a deceler in hous price  on balanc  i am somewhat more op ist than the  book about the growth side of the economi   i  too  see growth somewhat below potenti over the next four quarter  but that   s driven predomin by a slowdown in the near term   that is  in        then i see a return to potenti more or less in       although my es  of potenti is probabl slight higher than the  book   s es    now  given the level of precis of our output measur and forecast of potenti gdp growth  i   m realli not over concern about the forecast at this point   the adjust in the hous sector to more sustain level is forecast to occur without trigger a recess and without trigger much of an increas in unemploy   i believ we should not attempt to    stand in the way of that happen   it   s a mistak to think that the forecast moder in growth will bring inflat back to a level consist with price stabil   inde  the  book   s baselin forecast of core pce inflat remain abov   percent through the end of        even in the altern  book simul of a slump in hous  in which aggreg demand weaken and real gdp growth slow to just     percent in      and bare abov   percent in the first half of       core inflat hard chang and remain abov   percent in        thus  it seem to me that languag from us in the press that indic that moder growth will help to restrain inflat is not realli consist with our forecast   i think it imput a degre of precis to an es  phillip curv that we just don   t have   over the intermeet period  we have had some hope news on the inflat front  core cpi inflat has not acceler further in the past two month  and oil price seem to be down   thus  headlin inflat  as i point out  is like to be way down in septemb  and we will seem quit omnisci   the measur of expect inflat over the ten year period in our survey of profession forecast has not chang   it remain at     percent   the august rise in the michigan survey of one year ahead inflat expect seem to have been revers in the preliminari septemb number  larg becaus of the declin in oil price   howev  both compens per hour and unit labor cost have been trend up  not down as the earlier data suggest  although i will note that the use of the compens number in predict inflat is quit weak   although core inflat has stabil  it level is still abov our so call comfort zone    to my mind  the inflat outlook is quit uncertain   we do not yet know if the posit develop in oil price will stick or not   i hope they will  but certain we   ve seen energi price retreat onli to move back up again  and the hurrican season isn   t over yet   thus  we    should not becom too sanguin about inflat from one or two data point   moreov  we do not know if the upward revis to labor compens will pass through to core inflat  as built into the  book baselin  or if measur of medium term inflat expect will continu to decreas   what we do know is that core inflat has been abov   percent for two and a half year and is expect to be there  accord to the forecast  for anoth two year   put anoth way  there is littl evid in the forecast that polici action to date will bring core inflat back below   percent befor some  in        i think that should concern us   i see two inflat scenario as be plausibl  and i struggl with which one i believ to be the correct one   in the first scenario  core inflat is elev primarili becaus of transitori factor  like the pass through of higher oil price  and reflect an adjust to these chang in relat price   as oil price stabil  assum that they do  we   d expect to see core inflat presum fall and fall fa  than indic in the baselin  book forecast   the  book forecast appear to me to incorpor an assumpt of relat price sticki that is  inconsist with some recent studi on microdata   thus  in this scenario  i see inflat fall  perhap more in line with the  book   s altern scenario of less persist inflat   this stori is appeal and plausibl to me  but it rest on the transitori natur of the current measur of inflat   even in this most desir of scenario   see inflat fall back to   percent or slight less in        we have to recogn that we will have essenti ratifi a higher price level driven by oil price increas  and we should ask ourselv whether or not we are  comfort with that   in the other scenario  s ul monetari polici dure the past five year has been a major contributor to the rise in core inflat   in this case  we wouldn   t expect to see a deceler of core inflat until monetari polici has firm enough to take out the cumul     effect of that accommod   the committe has now move rate up consider from histor level   if potenti growth is now lower  as the staff indic  the equilibrium real rate  may be slight lower  suggest that monetari polici may be slight firmer now than previous thought   even so  it has onli recent reach that level   but given the imprecis with which we es  potenti output or equilibrium real rate  i realli don   t take much comfort from such measur   thus  to my mind  there is a signific risk that polici is not yet firm enough to achiev the desir outcom   regardless of which of these two scenario you think more like  i think we must be concern that our credibl and the consequ of allow inflat to remain abov our comfort zone for so long are at question   if scenario   come to pass and inflat fall fa  than suggest by the  book baselin  then we would all breath easier   but that scenario seem larg a bet on oil price and on the presumpt that past accommod polici is not play ani role  and that make me nervous   i would much prefer to believ that scenario   is the oper one   howev  again  i find it hard to believ that a four year to five year period is transitori  so i have to consid the altern   if the first scenario is wrong and inflat evolv as in scenario    then our credibl is serious at risk if we fail to take further step to curtail price increas   we might be lucki   but we might risk find ourselv in a situat in which inflat expect becom unhing  make it more cost to bring inflat back down   as has been mention  in the  book altern forecast in which inflat expect becom unanchor  inflat remain near   percent with onli a slight declin in       and growth slow below    percent next year and remain well below trend through the  forecast period   to me    percent inflat and     percent real growth is not a comfort place to be and would make restrain inflat in the futur even harder for us      i   d like to conclud my remark by thank the board staff for their research on inflat dynam and the possibl reduct in the level of persist in recent year   i think this is an import area for research  but i encourag the staff to continu it work to tri to identifi structur model of these dynam in addit to reduc form model   i agre with the staff that the monetari polici implic of the reduc form find present in the memo depend on how one choos to interpret them   the result present by the staff and other suggest that  sinc       inflat has becom less persist and appear to be less relat to other macro variabl as well   we do not know whether these chang are due to a more aggress stanc of monetari polici against inflat and to our credibl or to fundament chang in the domest or world economi   if we suppos that lower inflat persist is due to enhanc polici credibl  then it is incumb upon this committe to maintain that credibl   that is  we should not expect inflat persist to remain low if the fed act in a manner that is inconsist with it commit to price stabil or risk it credibl by neglect to take action that return the economi to price stabil in a reason period of  e   we shouldn   t ignor the fact that the longer we allow deviat from price stabil to persist  the higher is the risk to our credibl and the higher is the risk that recent high inflat read will rais longer term expect  therebi put us in a veri awkward posit a year from now   thank you

mr  chairman  i   d character the tenth district   s economi as quit healthi right now   as you know  the tenth district has benefit perhap disproportion from the rise in energi price over the past few year  and this is provid consider s ulus to the local and state economi in the district   we are also see strong manufactur activ    driven by export of district product   although the hous market across the district can be character as soft  we have no report of serious declin in price anywher in the region  retail sale  exclud auto  also are hold up pretti well for us   the other soft spot for us is agricultur  and that is tie pretti much to the drought that we continu to experi   regard the nation economi  the econom inform receiv sinc the last meet confirm a further slow of econom activ this quarter   moreov  weak in hous and auto product suggest that the fourth quarter could be a littl bit weaker as well  at the same  e  we have recent experienc the sizabl and larg unexpect declin in energi price that we have talk about here  which  if maintain  could provid some s ulus over the balanc of the year to offset some of that weaker inform   current  i expect growth to slow to a rang of   percent to     percent in the second half of the year and to  rebound to abov     percent or to   percent next year   general speak  i am more op ist than the  book  especi with regard to hous and consum spend  and i   m not near as pessimist as the  book on potenti output   as to hous  we are in fact  as all have note  squeez out of that sector the specul excess that develop with the low interest rate of recent year   and do so is unavoid if we want to correct the sector   the adjust process has obvious been pain for some  and it has not yet run it cours   howev  we perhap see ourselv get a littl closer to the bottom than we might think right now  and that   s relat to the fact that credit remain avail at reason rate for most homebuy  as suggest by the recent inform on mortgag applic   so  yes  it is pain  and yes  we are go through it  but i don   t think it is necessarili long last in term of the consum   s posit      for the consum more general  the situat is obvious mix   on the one hand  consumpt will like receiv less s ulus go forward from the withdraw of home equiti  and with slower hous price appreci  wealth effect will like be lower as well   on the other hand  higher labor compens and lower energi bill should provid support to the consum in term of confid and the abil to spend   overal  i continu to believ that there are somewhat more downsid risk than upsid risk to the outlook over the next quarter  but i think we are move in a fair consist way as far as gdp growth goe   final  let me provid my perspect on the inflat outlook   my overal view on inflat have not chang materi sinc the last meet   i continu to expect core pce inflat to moder from about     percent this year to     percent next year on the cours we have right now   the big negat on inflat  of cours  is the higher trajectori for labor cost  which has been mention   although the recent revis to compens are perhap somewhat unsettl  such concern are part offset by the recent more favor month inflat number and by the signific fall in the price of oil  gasolin  and natur gas in recent week   although the recent inflat data have not caus me to alter my inflat outlook  i am in one sens more confid in the forecast of moder than i was a month ago or so   on balanc  as we look at all this  i agre that we still have some upsid risk to inflat that we have to remain awar of as we look to the polici discuss ahead   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  i made a special effort to talk with my director and busi contact about two topic   develop in hous market and inflat   my district has been grow at a slower pace than most other part of the countri  consequ  hous price in the district never appreci as much as    those in the hot market in the countri   nonetheless  a major realtor in our region told me that hous in his market  which includ the northern half of ohio and the we n half of pennsylvania  are take longer to sell and that the averag price of hous sold from januari to august is down about   percent compar with the same period last year   his view is that nation the hous market still has a way to go befor condit stabil   nevertheless  right now he see onli a limit possibl that the adjust process will caus serious harm to the u s  economi   appar peopl are not leav much to chanc   i heard a report ye day morn that sale at religi store for statu of st  joseph have been soar    laughter   it seem as though peopl who are tri to sell their home are buy statu of st  joseph becaus he   s the patron saint of real estat  and they   re buri him next to the    for sale    sign   unfortun  there is no patron saint for central banker    laughter   some forecast  like the  book  are expect strength in the commerci construct sector to offset much of the weak in residenti build   one of my director  who repres a larg nation commerci construct firm  has indic that commerci build in the past few year has been boost by the growth of health and educ sector  his entir book of busi increas    percent in real term this year compar with last  and he is look to next year to have the book of busi increas   to   percent   howev  he is expect it to be flat in       and his stori squar with what i am hear from banker as well   name  that the flow of commerci loan in the pipelin  although not rapid fall off  is slow  and it hasn   t been build as it was   the  book baselin captur veri well the pattern that i   ve been describ in it project for nonresidenti invest over the next few year      now  turn to inflat  the two cpi report that we receiv dure this intermeet period have not provid me with enough evid that inflationari pressur have meaning diminish   the report  howev  have encourag me to think that the forward momentum has been broken  but i   d like to see the next few cpi number be at least as good as those for juli  and august  if not better  to be convinc that that momentum has been broken   i   ve heard some hope comment regard inflat in the past few week from sever of my director   just a few month ago they were indic that elev energi price and materi price had provid them with an opportun to get more general price increas  and they had wonder whether that was go to be a one  e catch up opportun or whether it would be persist   now it appear to have been a one  e opportun  which is pass or has pass   sever of my director report last week that they have resort to unbundl their price to cope with the rise price of energi and materi cost   on their invoic  they are break out the price increas that are due to the increas cost of steel  copper  energi  and ship in order to pass them on   appar  their custom are will to accept price increas that are due to those increas energi and materi cost   but the expect on the part of both buyer and seller is that  as energi and materi cost dissip  the abil to pass on price increas will be remov   sever of my director said that they are not plan ani price increas for the next year and that they suspect their commod cost will be lower than  they were this year as well   as other have mention  there has been some interest in the elev unit labor cost in the second quarter product and cost report   as dave note  the compens growth under unit labor cost was boost when the bls took on board the first quarter unemploy insur tax record   there is some suspicion that the dramat increas in    compens had a lot to do with stock option and incent pay  but the under data are not avail yet  so we don   t know for sure   my staff was abl to get some summari figur for ohio   compens has been grow steadili in ohio over the past sever year  but the preliminari figur are flat for the first quarter of        howev  there was doubl digit growth in three sector   manag of compani  financ and insur  and util   these sector are often the one that show substanti growth in the first quarter becaus they pay out stock option and that   s often when those stock option are realiz   so at least in my district there is no evid of ani broad base acceler in compens  and i tend to agre with the staff   s view that it   s too earli to incorpor those higher unit labor cost into the inflat outlook   at our last meet  i express the opinion that whatev weak we would see in gdp was more like to reflect demand factor than suppli factor  and therefor i saw risk to both our object   the current  book baselin project for gdp is even lower than it  was at the  e of our last meet becaus of revis  as dave mention  to both suppli and demand factor   i still think that  if the  book project come true  softer demand is like to be the more domin explan   nevertheless  i would like to see further evid that inflationari pressur have been check  if not actual revers  befor i would conclud that the risk to our object are even balanc   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  presid pianalto  for the new lead indic of religi statu    laughter   i recent gave a speech in south  ina  where they alway have an invoc  and the pastor call for god   s bless on monetari and credit polici   laughter   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc this is my last meet  i want to say formal what an honor it has been to serv under your leadership  at least for a short while  and    under chairman  span   s leadership befor that   and to my colleagu around the tabl and around the room  i want to say what an extraordinari experi it has been to work with you not onli on policymak but also on the other system busi for so mani year   there is a lot  that i will miss  and your friendship is at the top of the list   i will be merci short with my comment this morn   at our last meet  i indic that the data from around our district had final begun to reflect the anecdot report of slow that we   ve been get for some month   the most recent data underscor that trend   but with some crosscurr that suggest that some sector continu to be reason solid   with a total of forti four director in the six offic in our atlanta district  we have an unusu larg complement of regular month to month contact who can often signal a signific shift in sen ent about what may lie ahead   some  ago we began to ask our director each month to give us not onli their view on specif econom issu but also their overal sens of the econom outlook   veri simpli  we ask them to indic whether they think six month out that growth will be stronger  about the same  or weaker   over the past six month we have watch the aggreg of those view deterior to the point that  in our tabul last week  the onli director who expect thing six month out to be better were from new orlean  where econom condit can onli get better   some of the uneasi about the outlook in our region clear reflect the sharp hous adjust that we   ve seen  particular in our onc hot coastal market   that pain adjust continu  with folk in the industri say that they think the bottom may be as much as a year away   i talk just ye day afternoon  befor i left to come to washington  with the ceo of one of the larg nation homebuild headquart in atlanta   mr   chairman  i think he was in the group that came to see you and other just a few week ago   he    emphas that the adjust that   s go on is broader and more signific than the data suggest   he said that sale cancel rate  even in citi like atlanta  now exceed    percent  wherea they had been run about    percent   he underscor someth that we have talk about befor  and it has been mention again this morn  that the fall in the real sell price is often mask by incent and give back that have becom veri widespread   he said the onli except to the adjust in hous that he could see was in the major texa market   the stori out of new orlean continu to be depress  with busi leader now say it may be a decad  rather than a few year  befor the hous crisi there can be substanti resolv   there are simpli not enough habit hous unit to accommod the worker  especi low skill hospit industri worker who are need by busi that are tri desper to reopen and to get back on their feet   as a consequ  more and more job are be move out to other citi  and mani of them are not expect to return   as i mention at the outset  there are also more encourag crosscurr in our region   manufactur activ still look reason solid  transport and tourism do as well   we had some good employ gain in all our state last month  after some disappoint data the month befor   we continu to get report of shortag of skill labor in a number of trade  includ the construct industri   despit continu input price pressur  which other have talk about  we   re told that the abil to pass along those cost in final good and servic is  still veri limit for mani busi   as far as the nation economi is concern  it   s my view that we   re about where we expect to be at this point  with no huge surpris sinc our last meet   evid of slow is now more appar  but mani crosscurr also exist at the nation level   corpor profit are high  invest spend still seem to be reason strong  and consum spend     remain support of growth   while mani sector continu to perform reason well  as my region remark suggest  consider uncertainti   exist about hous  both in term of  how steep the slowdown will be and what the slowdown might mean for consum spend   although energi price have clear fallen back  inflat  as everyon has said  remain abov our prefer rang   we   ve had some encourag month inflat data sinc our last meet  but the hope for moder in price that we expect to see is still most a forecast  still  i take some encourag from the fact that the forecast for lower inflat read over the period ahead is not onli reflect in the  book but also in the model work my own staff has done and in the project of outsid forecast   addit  modest inflat expect seem to be hold   and market are not expect us to deviat from our current polici stanc  at least for the short run   final  mr  chairman  i want to say to you and other that i   m count on all of you to protect the buy power of my hard earn retir save    laughter   i   m go

thank you  mr  chairman   let me make just two or three fair general comment   first of all  i  too  want to compliment the staff for the paper on inflat dynam  i think it was veri well done   it is import  and we need to take it serious  and i view it in some sens as a follow up to some of the work that has been go on at some of the reserv bank in recent year   one of the thing that i think is import about it is that  at a minimum  it  ought to rais a yellow flag about our abil empir to go from measur like output gap  or the nairu  or other measur of capac to the determin of inflat   i don   t want to    exagger that point   i know there are differ way of interpret it  and i know the work isn   t definit   but i do  nevertheless  think that we need to think about it serious and consid it when we discuss the inflat outlook and it relat to econom perform   second  with regard to the econom outlook  i indic at the last meet that i was  somewhat more op ist than the  book  and that gap has open up even further   i am more op ist  although i   m not talk about the current quarter   one way of summar my posit is that i think the posit effect of higher incom  lower energi price  higher equiti valu  and stabl to declin interest rate are greater than you appar do   i say that even though i can readili imagin that the declin in hous activ turn out to be both more protract and deeper than you forecast it to be   by the way  as a footnot  if i did the number right  back in      and       we did get a declin in aggreg hous start of better than    percent without a recess  although       was consid a mini recess  or a paus  or someth   i   ve forgotten what the exact term was
yes  someth like growth recess   but the bottom line here is that it  hasn   t been a good idea to underes  or underr the perform of the u s  economi sinc late        final  with regard to inflat  even if i   m right about the econom outlook and we get more growth  i don   t think that necessarili impli that we   ll have more inflat than is predict in the  book   have said that  i still think that core inflat at it current rate is of concern  as is the outlook that you portray   thank
well  it   s         whi don   t we take fifteen minut for coffe   thank you   coffe break
i think we can reconven   vice chairman
thank you   let me just start with the broad contour of our outlook   growth has obvious slow  the second half is like to be relat weak   but the onli place we see pronounc weak is in hous  and we expect a return to moder growth go forward   core inflat seem to be eas a bit  and it may have peak in the second quarter  if you look just at the three month annual number   but inflat remain uncomfort high  and our forecast assum onli a veri gradual moder over the next two year   in term of number  we expect the real economi to grow at around it   percent potenti rate in       and         we expect core pce inflat on a q  q  basi to come in just below     percent in       and to moder to about   percent in       and     percent in         our outlook is larg unchang from august   it   s condit on a path for polici that is flat at current level for two to three quarter   this put us slight abov the level that is current  price into the risk adjust eurodollar futur curv   in term of uncertainti and risk  we see somewhat greater downsid risk to demand growth than we saw in august  but the inflat risk still seem like to be to the upsid  weigh the balanc among these compet risk  we believ  as we did in august  that inflat risk should remain the predomin concern of the committe  not so much  to borrow the chairman   s formul  becaus the probabl of a higher inflat outcom is substanti greater than that of a much weaker growth outcom but becaus the cost of an eros in inflat perform would be more damag      on the growth outlook  we   re see a somewhat greater adjust in residenti invest than we anticip  but this has not yet induc or been accompani by a signific weak outsid hous   of cours  the outlook for the economi as a whole should not be particular sensit to plausibl es  of the direct effect of the remain adjust  whatev it is  left in residenti invest   what seem more import  of cours   is the potenti effect of what   s happen in hous on consum and busi spend   we just don   t see troubl sign yet of collater damag  and we are not expect much   the fundament support relat strong product growth seem to be intact   the acceler of the nomin compens growth that appear to be under way  combin with the moder of headlin inflat that we expect as energi price moder  should produc fair strong growth of household incom  even with the moder in employ growth to trend   corpor balanc sheet profit remain strong   domest demand growth outsid  the unit state is expect to remain quit robust even though there has been some moder  in current measur of activ in some market   of cours  the level of interest rate is not particular high in nomin or real term   equiti price and credit spread suggest a reason degre of confid in the prospect for futur expans   financi market particip report veri strong continu demand for credit and for risk general and veri ampl liquid   this strength may reflect other factor that are oper on demand for financi asset  but still survey base measur of confid have not deterior dramat   this  of cours  may prove too op ist on the growth outlook  and the risk seem weight to the downsid   on the inflat front  recent data have not alter our forecast or  realli  our assess of the risk to that forecast   although there are sign of moder in under inflat  the    core pce and a rang of altern measur continu to grow at level that are uncomfort high   we expect further moder to occur onli gradual over the forecast period   the latest data have been somewhat reassur  and inflat expect at various horizon have behav relat well sinc our last meet   the acceler in compens growth and   unit labor cost   not justifi a higher inflat forecast in our view  provid that expect remain well anchor  busi markup fall  the ongo moder in growth reduc pressur on resourc util  the futur curv prove a reason accur predict for the path of energi price  the dollar declin onli modest  and so forth   these are reason good argument  but we still think the risk are to the upsid   over the past two year  we have consist revis up our forecast for inflat   i   m not sure we realli yet understand the forc behind the unanticip acceler in under inflat   medium term inflat expect  while not rise at state level  may be higher than is consist with an inflat object in the rang the committe has talk about in the past   contain these upsid risk should be the domin focus of polici until we see a more pronounc moder in current and expect under inflat   as my comment impli  we don   t have a lot of differ with the  book on the contour of the outlook   the  book show slower growth relat to lower potenti but also more inflat than we do   it also show more slack with more inflat and a littl less confid in the strength of demand growth than we do for the reason i hope i explain   i see certain question as key   on the growth front the question is  will weak cumul   if we see a more pronounc actual declin in hous price  will that have greater damag on confid and spend   but the more interest question are realli on the  inflat forecast  and let me just talk veri briefli about two      first    the  book forecast produc enough moder in inflat soon enough to keep inflat expect anchor   the baselin forecast has inflat fall to     percent  at least base on the last  e we saw a long term forecast  onli over a veri protract period   a period that is signific longer than the one mani central banker would consid an accept deviat from an inflat target   we have alreadi seen a bit of  troubl specul from peopl who write about us   this committe may have more inflat toler or a higher implicit target than it predecessor   should we tri to achiev a more rapid moder of inflat   how should we evalu the cost and benefit of tri to achiev a quicker and more substanti moder of inflat  particular given the tenuous state of the evid on inertia and persist   is this gentl and gradual expect moder in inflat op   given the soft of the outlook for demand   these are question that are worthi of a more explicit discuss by the committe  particular if we   re go to talk about move  toward a quantit definit of price stabil with more disclosur around the forecast   the second and relat question is about inflat in our forecast   with the stanc of monetari polici that is now price into the market   this is a softer path than the one in august   how confid can we be that we are like to achiev the forecast of sustain growth and gradual moder core inflat   i think we can be less confid than the confid you might read into current market expect and the uncertainti that surround them   of cours  the behavior of long term inflat expect in financi market suggest that this risk is not particular high at present and that we can take some more  e to get a better handl on the evolut of the economi befor decid what is next in term of monetari polici action   but i think that we may have more to do  and we should tri to avoid fo  too much    confid in the market that we   re done   we need to preserv the flexibl to do more if that prove necessari to keep inflat expect anchor   thank you
thank you   vice chairman    governor kohn    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   whatev you want to call me is fine   laughter   i   m just glad to be here    laughter   i don   t think i can follow that up   given the initi condit   the doubl and more of energi price over the past two year  the overexuber hous market come to grip with a renorm of interest rate  a veri low person save rate  and an uncomfort increas in inflat this spring   a period of modest below trend growth and gradual eb inflat  as in the  book forecast  is about as good an outcom as we can expect  as dave   note   in that regard  sever develop over the intermeet period have made me a bit more comfort with the plausibl of such an outlook   the weak in hous has deepen and is more definit lead to growth of output below potenti   in fact  in my view the behavior of the hous market constitut the main downsid risk to sustain moder econom growth   we   re in the middl of a hous adjust  which has been hard to forecast  especi becaus it involv the unwind of an unknown amount of specul demand   with inventori rise and report of price cut get greater promin  the market isn   t yet show sign of clear and stabil   in the  book forecast  residenti invest  though weak  is support by continu growth of incom and relat low mortgag rate  while hous price basic level out in nomin term   as the  book note  howev  this forecast leav some aspect of the exist disequilibrium intact  most notabl the high level of price relat to rent   also  the cutback in construct  sn   t complet offset the appar excess build of the boom period   as a    consequ  i see the hous forecast in the  book as veri far from the worst case scenario that presid   character it as   and  we are just begin to see the effect of the downshift in hous price inflat on consumpt start to play out   outsid of hous  howev  recent develop should help to sustain continu econom expans   financi condit remain quit support of both busi and household spend   long term interest rate have fallen appreci sinc midyear  and they are low in both real and nomin term   risk spread are narrow  bank have not pull back on busi credit  and equiti price have risen on balanc in recent month   lender and investor appear to remain confid that the economi will continu to expand at a decent pace  higher level of labor incom in the first half of the year  along with a favor effect on dispos incom of a declin in energi price  will help support consum spend go forward   economi elsewher seem to be expand at a solid clip   moreov  they are  probabl less vulner to spillov from a hous led slowdown of growth in the unit state than they were to weak in        that weak was center in a global market for invest good and was reflect in global declin in equiti price   the less robust economi should present busi with a more competit environ in which it will be harder to pass through cost increas   in addit  the declin in energi price  along with the level out of other commod price  will reduc cost pressur on busi and should feed through in some measur to lower core inflat  especi as slower growth damp price power   the drop in energi price has alreadi restrain inflat  expect a bit   for all these reason  i   m also a littl more comfort with the forecast of gradual eb core inflat      nonetheless  i still see signific upsid risk to such a path for inflat   in part  this reflect my uncertainti as to the reason for the rise in inflat this spring and summer   feed through of energi and other commod price must have contribut to some extent  and we can see evid of this in the greater price increas for some of the more energi intens sector  such as for airfar   a portion of the pickup is in the rent of shelter categori  like from a shift to rental hous as expect of hous price appreci have been scale back   but price increas have pick up in a number of other categori  and although energi cost probabl account for some of this acceler  we can   t dismiss the possibl that other forc were at work   for exampl  more general pressur of demand on potenti output   a reduct of those type of pressur is still onli a forecast   on the cost side  as mani have comment  the compens and unit labor cost data  while flaw in mani respect  could be point to a risk that higher labor cost will persist  put pressur on price that might onli be partial and reluct absorb by profit margin   in sum  mr  chairman  i   m a bit more comfort with someth like the path for the economi and inflat in the  book forecast  but uncertainti are quit high   they might even justifi the    higher than usual    descript   the downward path for inflat remain at risk  and as other have note  the cost of exceed that path could be disproportion   thank you
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman  i want to start my remark today by reflect on some result of the latest duke univers cfo survey   this survey is onli about six or seven year old  but the one that was just conclud on septemb    has cfos    op  at the lowest level in five year  and so it   s continu to show an eros of their confid   i found    the cfos    number   worri   weak consum demand   interest becaus it wasn   t there befor  and that uncertainti is part of what the cfos are worri about   their second biggest concern is rise labor cost  which they attribut primarili to the scarciti of labor   they are anticip that the scarciti is go to continu to drive labor cost higher   in term of their hire plan  they are plan now to hire fewer peopl than they hire last quarter   they are expect to increas employ over the next twelv month     percent  last quarter   s survey show     percent  so that   s quit a slowdown   howev  they   re go to increas outsourc employ     percent   thus what is show up is the uncertainti   want to use an adjust labor forc to get the flexibl becaus of the uncertainti   they are also trim their capit spend plan over the next twelv month to     percent  compar with     percent last quarter   thus the survey indic that cfos have grow concern  they are still op ist overal  but i think that caution is there    now  in look at the number myself  i   m perhap not quit as pessimist   again  as sever of you have said   and dave comment in his remark   except for hous  the economi realli   look good   as you know  i   ve been worri about the mortgag market and hous for quit a while   in an endeavor to find someth good to say  i have notic that  in the past coupl of month  the mortgag banker associ index of new loan applic for purchas mortgag look as though it   s start to level off   veri often that could be a lead indic  so that could be a posit sign   howev  as some of you have remark  there   s a lot of specul in the hous market that has to unwind  all the folk who bought hous for invest have to do someth as they see hous price slow and the financ cost to carri their invest go up   how that unwind will occur  given the substanti size of    the specul posit in some market  is someth that will need veri close monitor   i know that our supervisori staff is focus on that  too   peopl are focus on the fact that delinqu rate in mortgag still look good  howev  we   ve seen a veri rapid increas in debt servic ratio sinc        i   m concern  again  with the amount of adjust rate mortgag out there that will repric in the month ahead   if  as we think  some of these loan  particular subprim loan  were made main on the collater valu of the hous and not on the afford of the mortgag  we could see more distress in the borrow    market come forward   if that   s the case  it could have spillov effect on consum spend more broad   on the posit side  payrol growth has been good in the past three month             it  has pick up a bit  and it is signific abov the  book forecast  and that give me some op    it   s put more incom in peopl   s pocket to spend  and the unemploy rate has been stabl   hour earn  howev  are rise fa    while that acceler can support consum spend  it contribut to my concern about where we   re go in the long run on inflat   as i look at the  book forecast sinc may  we   ve been continu to project more and more inflat go forward   the privat sector has basic been do that in their forecast as well   when i look at those forecast  i   m concern that for various reason we have reduc our es  of the trend rate of growth   as we bring down the trend rate of growth    and i realiz that  as sever have said  we   re at the lower end of the privat sector growth forecast   i worri about the disconnect   are we see a slowdown in potenti that other aren   t   or if we   re right that potenti growth is lower and the privat forecast are right that real growth is go to be fa   then we could have more inflat pressur go forward   for    the first  e  we are also look at price in       and they continu to rise at over   percent  they   ve been over   percent for two year   i worri  from the standpoint of our credibl  about what have such a long period abov   percent mean   so i believ we will see moder of inflat  but i think it   s import to preserv our flexibl and be abl to respond if these worst case scenario that i laid out becom more troubl to us go forward
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to make four point  a coupl of which have been state by my colleagu this morn  and then spend a littl  e on each of them   first  like mani of you  i am more concern about the upsid risk to inflat than downsid risk to output and employ   second  the market respond quit posit to the last fomc  so they   ve been go in the right direct   the stock market has been up  the bond market has been up  energi and commod are down  and tip inflat compens measur are down   six month ago i would have taken some comfort from that  now  six month into be a central banker  i   m worri    laughter   so i join the rank of jack and the rest of you who have been here a bit longer than i have   third  for the first  e sinc i   ve been here  i   m a littl less sanguin about the suppli side of the economi in look at the busi base  the cap ex base  and the manufactur base   but i find myself today probabl more comfort  or at least as comfort as i   ve been  with the strength and resili of consum demand   the fourth point i would like to spend a coupl of minut on is that i think we are at  the begin of a major test of market liquid that   s happen in real  e in the fix incom  market   so let me take each of those in turn   first  on the consum side  consum spend appear to be strong and resili   as was note at the outset  there was a strong juli pce read  on par with the strongest gain of    the year  suggest to me that consum demand may actual be acceler from the second quarter into the third quarter   the  book es  of   percent pce for the third quarter and      percent pce for the fourth quarter may actual be underst the strength of the consum  particular with fall gas price   i   m also comfort by incom growth and labor market condit  which i see as like to be far more import to consum spend than hous wealth   consum incom gain appear to be rise   i   ve made note previous of veri strong tax receipt   although they   ve taper off somewhat  they continu to be robust   tax receipt for the year are up about      percent   the past coupl of month would suggest they are in the high singl digit  and though there is some nois in those data  i do take some comfort from them   other recent corrobor of labor incom  with the revis nipa data and other measur  suggest that real wage and salari incom again may be acceler   it has been note this morn that stock option and bonus payment may have had an effect in the first quarter  creat a bit of nois in those data   howev  they should also remind us of the wealth effect of equiti gain  which may partial offset the negat wealth effect from hous  particular with     million member of the investor class   i think that   s someth that need to be consid in our think about the strength of the consum dure the forecast period   final  as i think governor bie note  the labor market remain reason tight   despit the soft in hous  unemploy  insur claim and unemploy rate remain quit encourag    turn for a moment to busi  about which i am perhap a littl less op ist than i   ve been befor  industri product is still reason strong but  perhap disappoint  has flatten for august  even though the juli number appear to be on an upward trend   when i look back over the past    month read for      and       both of ip and retail sale  i    found that each declin about six  e  so i   m not sure that we   re see a new trend here   my  own sens of where ip is in septemb is that it   s remark strong  but  again  i have some caution that i didn   t have befor   one other note   unlik the  book  i sens that export are like to make a real  meaning contribut to gdp dure the forecast period   in term of capit expenditur growth rate  anoth survey i   d like to mention is the busi roundtabl survey that came out a coupl of day ago   it was more negat on capit expenditur than it has ever been   i would say that the group has a mix record in call inflect point  but the survey result  nonetheless  suggest that onli a littl less than    percent expect increas cap ex in the next six month  wherea about half said that cap ex would remain constant over that period   perhap that   s an effort to protect margin with higher cost that could be onli partial pass through   as i   ve note befor  earn growth continu to meet or beat expect  certain through the second and third quarter  and my own sens is that fourth quarter earn will also be fine  probabl still at the doubl digit rate of about    or    percent   perhap that explain some of the take the foot off the acceler in term of capit expenditur   in term of hous  to add a bit to the previous discuss  my own sens is that the residenti sector may have  in fact  crowd out some nonresidenti loan dure the most recent boom and that nonresidenti construct was mark up sharpli in the second quarter  to an annual growth rate of    percent   my sens is also that the market   s capit alloc function is work well   c i loan are grow about    percent or more  perhap the highest rate in the past    or    year  and we   ll probabl see a littl more capit alloc to this nonresidenti sector   wherea the  book assum a signific deceler in this group  i    think that there   s reason for some upsid surpris   as a result  i expect stronger gdp for the second half of       than the  book     turn to inflat  i think that inflat risk have not materi reced  though we   ve probabl seen acceler stop   that is  we   ve seen the top  but the new direct is not clear   one measur that i   ll look to over the next six week is what   s go on in the capit market   sinc we last met  ten year yield have probabl move down about    basi point  and the  book report that there should be a slowdown in busi debt financ   that statement of the  book is probabl reflect in the data that we   ve seen in juli and august in term of the capit market   but the test of liquid to which i refer will be a big suppli demand test over the cours of the next six or seven week   perhap      billion in fund is come to market from the bank loan market  the leverag loan market  high yield and invest grade   admit  in that      billion number  which stack up as a big number even compar with onli a coupl of year ago  when we would see financ over a year of      billion  there are some eleph deal  and they are probabl distort that number a bit  hca is come to market with a     billion deal  as well as a coupl of other major leverag buyout   the liquid in those capit market appear to be incred robust at this moment  there are massiv pipelin   you hear word like    euphoria      i would say that the capit market are probabl more profit and more robust at this moment  or at least go into the six week opportun  than they have perhap ever been   a signific varieti of particip are play   this is a function of huge sovereign debt inflow and of signific liabil manag by issuer   some of the cfos to whom governor bie was speak   investor at this moment appear to have veri littl leverag in term of the price of these deal or in term    of some of the coven protect that were referenc at an earlier meet   previous  i had said that  particular in the invest grade market  we were see issuer hesit to come to market becaus they didn   t want to negoti their coven away   in the event that they were to be taken out by a leverag buyout player  they wouldn   t want to have a chang of control premium   now that these market are as robust as they are  those same brand name issuer are come back to the market  and at this point it seem as though they will like get their price done   so  i do not yet have a final determin of what this pipelin look like  but if all goe through  it will suggest to me that there has been rather massiv liquid dure this period  other measur of liquid appear to be somewhat more encourag from my perspect   the  commod market have been mention   they   ve probabl had some hot money come out of them  with a lot of retail investor  both direct and through pension fund  come in too late and mayb exit for good  as well as some veri encourag news about the tip market  which were referenc previous   in sum  i would say that the market seem to be veri impress by our let the economi develop  particular in the next coupl of quarter  and i   m impress by the market   s confid in us   i think that it put a signific respons on us and is probabl the onli way i can reconcil the rather robust gain in the equiti market and in the debt market over this period   that is  the market believ that somehow we   re go to manag to thread the needl and nail the perfect land   there is  i think  increas a one way bet in the bond market in that they believ that there is a degre of accommod and they have built in a degre of loosen in the forecast period  which we don   t have a proper understand of   onli a coupl of month ago we were describ  and the chairman describ  an economi in transit and    the veri wide tail around that   we still have the wide tail  but the market seem to think that  we   re go to nail this land   i think the minut from the last meet faith captur our concern about the appreci upsid risk remain   either the market didn   t buy that descript  or they were convinc that we were go to act with an incred deft touch to stop that inflat   all in all  i would say that in the market there is less dispers of view than is probabl healthi and  less dispers of view over these differ scenario than we found ourselv discuss some  e ago   so with that  i think we   ll have a more robust discuss in the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   unfortun  i think we find ourselv in an uncomfort posit like that of six week ago  with a continu mix of inflationari pressur and deceler econom growth at the same  e   i think the fundament are in place for a continu moder of growth but not a contract  much as the  book describ   obvious  hous is a risk that everyon has talk about   but the key  as mani peopl have also mention  is maintain contain inflat expect  and that come down to think about whether some of the factor that we   ve been see have been more  transitori or more persist   let me first talk about growth and go through the c plus i plus g plus net export   i would agre with the staff   s character that world econom growth is not quit as strong as some other have put forward   i don   t think we   re go to be see an enorm export boom  also  as briefli mention  i see veri littl on the govern s ulus side   tax revenu  as governor   mention  were veri high   spend is be kept relat tight   on    invest  we   re see some strength in capit spend   my concern is  if consumpt goe as low as the  book suggest  what the return on this capit spend will be   is it go into the right area   i was a littl concern when presid pool mention that the air freight compani is expand rapid but the on the ground deliveri compani is not expand at all  so are they go to have to invest in parachut to get these in    laughter   but that is precis the concern that i have   that capit spend may not conform perfect to what consumpt demand is go to be   we certain saw this in the late     s and earli     s   i   m just a bit worri about that now  especi given the potenti tension between slow consumpt and robust invest growth   now  regard consumpt   we   ve talk about the potenti support from lower energi price and some posit wealth effect from stronger equiti market  but obvious hous is one key here   it   s a key partial in overal invest but also in the uncertainti that it caus in consum    mind   hous is one of the worst area for data   it   s veri difficult for us to have ani concept of what price are do becaus it   s not a market like ani other   we do have the case schiller index  and we do have some better index that peopl are now bet on  but they   re still veri poor indic of price relat to the indic we have in other market   we also know that there can be queue and that extra can be thrown in  so there   s a lot of uncertainti with respect to where price are go   that concern me quit a bit becaus i think we just don   t have a good handl on it   permit and start have continu to come down from where they were at our last meet and are now at level of the begin of      or even start to slip into        if they flatten out there  the hous sector is still histor reason good   but there   s no indic that we   re necessarili at a turn point and that thing are go to flatten out   there is the wealth effect  the direct effect on peopl   s    consumpt behavior of lower wealth go forward  and also the confid effect   we don   t have a perfect analog with the previous  e in which we   ve seen these hous downturn    we have a differ context in that the economi is broad more robust   and so i think it   s less like that we   re go to see a major hous problem   but i think it is a real risk  and we have to be sensit to it    on the inflat outlook  we have to come back to transitori versus more persist compon  as mani peopl have mention in the discuss   obvious  peopl are hearten  that energi price have come down  but i certain would not put the same bet on the energi market that one trader did in a hedg fund that got into a littl troubl recent becaus we know  that energi price can move in way we don   t expect   so i don   t want to take too much from that   i think it   s appropri in the  book to use the market   s expect   what measur do we have other than market expect   if we did have a better measur  then we   d be run one of those hedg fund   howev  there   s a lot of uncertainti around that measur   so i certain don   t want to bet on better inflat go forward just becaus we   ve sudden seen a    percent declin in oil price over the past six week   that said  it   s hearten that energi price are unlik to lead to greater inflationari pressur go forward than those when we paus six week ago   the rise in compens is obvious troublesom   not if you are an employe receiv the higher compens  but from our point of view   howev  a lot of tension is in those data becaus we have the compens number versus the eci   there   s a big statist  discrep between gross domest incom and gross domest product   it   s possibl that some of the increas in compens will be revis away  and we   ll see actual higher product growth   we just don   t know  and it may be a while befor we see it   also  as we discuss a lot    last  e but not this  e  the continu fair wide margin that busi are experienc may come under more pressur and may absorb some of the increas in labor compens  how much is uncertain  but that may be one potenti offset    as mani peopl have said  we can   t becom complac   inflat expect have behav reason well sinc we paus at the last meet  which is hearten in that the market believ that inflat is reason under control in the near to medium term and even in the longer term   it   s hard to find evid of increas in inflat expect  but as mani peopl have said  that   not mean that we don   t have to worri   we have to worri a lot becaus the key is keep those expect well contain   i think we   re in a situat in which we can do that   slow growth is not go to give us more of a benefit   the flat of the phillip curv  which peopl have talk about  is what the data have been over the past ten to fifteen year in the unit state and most other countri   so even if there is a bit more slowdown  we are not necessarili go to get the potenti benefit in signific lower inflat pressur   mayb a littl but not veri much   so we still have to worri about the upsid  on inflat  and that   s whi maintain our credibl is of utmost import
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i just should say that it   s a great pleasur to return to the feder reserv system   i have so mani friend here at the tabl and around the tabl   it   s also veri nice to move to a slight more comfort chair    laughter
it   s call the hot seat    laughter
mani of you know i have an upbeat person   some might actual say loud   but certain upbeat   the way i look at the forecast and the situat with the economi is quit posit in the sens that what we   re see  realli  is a return to normalci and    a more balanc economi   the excess in the hous sector seem to be unwind in an  accept way  so i think it is quit reason in term of the  book forecast to think that the spillov here is not go to be a big problem becaus we   re actual move resourc from  a sector that had too much go into it  into sector that need to have more resourc at the present  e   so in that sens  i   m actual quit posit   the other thing that i am quit comfort with in the  book forecast   though  clear  there   s uncertainti   is that we   re go to see a deceler core inflat rate   furthermor  when we look at inflat expect  they seem to be veri well contain and seem also to have respond well to the paus at the last meet   howev  i should say that  although we   ve seen that inflat expect are well  anchor  there   s a question about whether they   re anchor at quit the right level   they seem to be anchor somewher around     percent on the cpi  and that is probabl with a differenti  between the cpi and the pce of about    percentag point  or    basi point   it still seem to be somewhat on the high side in term of what mani peopl on the committe have express is their comfort zone   so i think that is a concern   there is a signific probabl that thing may not turn out so rosi on the output front   we should have a concern that thing could go somewhat wrong in term of the hous sector   if that happen  we might see much lower output growth   there is a reason probabl of recess   it   s mention in the  book  i think your number are quit reason   so in that context  we could actual have lower output  a wider output gap  and some actual deceler of inflat   i agre veri much with the conclus that you came to becaus it   s reason to think that the long run inflat we   re move to is around   percent unless we get one of the scenario with a lot more soft   that    the deceler is not go to go much below the  book forecast of around   percent by        caus me a bit of concern   i   m not sure that i would describ the risk as unbalanc   for me  in term of a forecast  probabl i would be comfort say they   re balanc   howev  i think inflat is too high in the forecast and  in that context    requir much more vigil   of cours  that will be reflect in the discuss later today   thank you
thank you   let me just summar quick what i heard around the tabl  and then i   d like to make some addit comment of my own on the economi   the sens is that  on the real side  there   s a two tier economi   there   s the hous sector and mayb auto  and there   s everyth els   on hous  there   s agreement that a signific correct is occur  but the view of the risk vari among particip   in particular  some feel that this still could be a quit deep correct  and other say that the fundament  such as incom  interest rate  and so on  will ul  support hous   with respect to the rest of the real economi  there were some mix report  but on the whole  peopl character it as a full employ economi   we   re general more op ist than the  book both for later this year and for        in particular  peopl note higher incom and stock price and lower oil price  which should support consumpt growth and busi activ   at least for now  i heard onli a few particip be particular concern about the possibl knock on effect of hous on consumpt and invest   the labor market remain solid  and as we   ve been note for a number of meet  attract more high skill worker  remain difficult   on inflat  some note somewhat better intermeet news  with the possibl except of the higher compens data   but a lot of uncertainti was express about where inflat    will go  reflect in part our incomplet knowledg of the determin of inflat and also some mix anecdot evid   howev  i hear veri clear a definit unhappi with the level of core inflat and with the amount of  e that is project to return it to a level of less than   percent   the princip concern is that our credibl will be damag if inflat remain too high for too long   so i would summar the discuss   i hope reason accur   by say that inflat remain the predomin risk but there is still quit a bit of uncertainti about  the evolut of the economi in the next few quarter   let me add a few comment to this   first about inflat and then about the real economi   i do believ that the intermeet news on inflat was more good than bad  particular relat to the fact that inflat is a lag indic and that it would not have been  incred surpris if we had gotten     read the past two month   i   ll talk first about some of the posit news  and then i   ll address some of the risk go forward     first  there is evid that the momentum of inflat has revers   when i gave my speech on june    which mani of you follow up on  i emphas the three  and six month rate of inflat as indic that an acceler  a rise inflat pattern  was occur   it now appear that the three month rate of inflat peak in may   so  for exampl  in may  the core pce was      on a three month basi  in juli  it was        the market base core pce was      in may  and in juli it was        the core cpi was a high      in may  and as of the last  read in august  it was        so in some sens the direct has turn  and the momentum has been broken  and i think that has been reflect in view in the marketplac   now  there hasn   t been much discuss of the detail of this inflat report  and i think it   s actual quit signific   in particular  a veri import factor in both the level and the chang in inflat is owner    equival rent  oer   we   ve discuss this issu befor   oer is       percent of core cpi and    percent of core pce   although oer has been deceler recent  it   s still at a three month rate of     percent  relat to an annual rate of      percent in        so that differ account for a great deal of the chang between where we are today on a three month basi versus where we were in        the good news is that oer and other measur of rent of shelter have been come down more quick than mani outsid economist expect but in line with what our staff more or less expect  inde  the number was   percent  for august   so if it just stay there or came down a bit more  we would see better short term number for inflat go forward   other posit news on inflat obvious includ energi and commod price   for energi the domin factor are suppli side factor over which we have no control   hurrican or the lack thereof and geopolit factor   but it   s also interest that metal and some other commod are off their peak   that suggest to me that  at least on the margin  some prospect of slow econom activ and rise interest rate around the world may have taken a bit of the pressur off the commod price   we also have had some indic sinc the last meet that the economi will be slower than we thought   clear  the news on auto and hous was in a negat direct  and grant the flat of the phillip curv  all els be equal  that will take some pressur off util and price power   final  i would argu that expect are  in fact  realli quit well contain   around this tabl  we   re get use to talk about core inflat   the inflat that peopl see  of cours  is headlin inflat  and ul  that should be our target as well   over the past year or two  headlin inflat has gone well abov what we would consid reason level  and yet tip indic  survey indic  and outsid forecast have not mark chang their long term inflat forecast   so i take the    credibl issu veri serious  but i don   t think that there is much evid yet that our credibl has been serious impair   on the negat side  the main piec of news was the higher compens in the first and second quarter   there is not yet much evid that labor cost are affect inflat   we   ve alreadi discuss the issu with the measur of compens per hour   let me just note that  if you look at the compon of inflat that have move the most  you get thing like rent  airfar  use car  and thing of that sort   you don   t see much movement in servic  for exampl  which are more labor intens   so i don   t think that labor cost have yet infect the inflat rate  inde  we know there   s a weak correl between these labor cost measur and inflat   howev  and let me be clear about this  i think that the key risk to our inflat forecast is that market will be tighter  labor market will be tighter  and wage will grow more quick  and that will produc more inflat than we would like   so i would summar the inflat situat as have had some modest improv  some encourag  but i certain agre with the general sen ent around the tabl that the level of core inflat is certain too high   on the real side  we paus at the last meet to observ the lag effect on real activ of our previous interest rate move   the evid suggest that  inde  interest sensit sector did worsen over the intermeet period   we saw the second signific markdown in a row by the  book for hous  and we   ve seen auto declin as well   to this  point  i agre that the economi except for hous is reason strong and that there are factor support consumpt particular  go forward   so as we look forward  i think there are two issu   the first is how sever the contract in hous will be   to be honest  we don   t realli know   we   re talk  again  about    an asset price correct  and it   s difficult  in principl  to know how far that will adjust   the second issu is how much spillov there will be from ani hous correct to the rest of the economi   i don   t have quit as much confid as some peopl around the tabl that there will be no spillov effect   ani spillov effect would be a lag effect  and it remain to be seen how much effect there might be   but i agre that the economi except for hous and auto is still pretti strong  and we do not yet see ani signific spillov from hous   pleas look at the figur that was distribut    i want to talk a bit about the risk in both direct as we think about polici   let me just describ the two panel to you and then draw a conclus from them   the top panel show the four quarter differ in the unemploy rate   that is  the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of this year minus the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of last year  go back to about        the blue bar show recess period   the dash line is at zero  and the solid horizont line is at     percentag point   what you see is that  without except  everi  e sinc      that the unemploy rate has risen as much as     percentag point over a year  it has continu to rise  and we   ve seen a recess  that suggest that have unemploy rise just a few tenth and keep it there is not quit so easi as our linear model might suggest   in the bottom panel  you see four quarter chang in the growth of real gdp   the dot line show zero  and the solid line arbitrarili show   percent real growth   again  these are four quarter differ   with the minor except of       again in no case was real gdp growth below   percent sustain for four quarter without an nber recess   i think a veri interest case is           the famous soft land that was engin in the mid     s   you   ll notic the line just touch the   percent zone without cross it    laughter     the figur to which chairman bernank refer is append to this transcript  appendix           so what am i say here   i   m onli say that  if we believ that we need to have output below potenti to help arrest inflat pressur  it is a delic oper  and we may have a veri narrow channel to navig as we go forward   we should pay veri close attent to how the economi is evolv at this particular moment becaus i think the uncertainti and the potenti nonlinear at this junctur are greater than what we normal face   i   ll stop there  and  we can begin our second round   oh  i   m sorri        laughter
i onli speak when ask  mr  chairman    laughter
that is a good practic    laughter
sinc when    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman and some particip   laughter  over the intermeet period  tumbl oil price  better behav inflat  and the minut of the august meet  which convey a more widespread disinclin to tighten than investor suspect  pull nomin interest rate lower   as can be seen by the solid line in the upper left panel of your first exhibit  the rate on three month eurodollar futur expir this decemb declin a touch  on net  and is now consist with the feder fund rate remain at    percent for the remaind of the  year   investor seem to expect polici eas thereaft  in that the contract expir one year later has a rate about    percentag point lower   this can be seen most clear by the black line in the upper right panel  which show that the path expect for the feder fund rate over the next two year has a decid negat slope   as indic by the shift from the black dot to the black solid line in the lower left panel  this revis to polici expect was associ with a rough parallel step downward in the term structur of nomin treasuri yield over the intermeet period   the yield curv for index secur move up closer to it nomin counterpart   the shift from the dot to the solid red line   impli that the differ  inflat compens  declin   these relat movement can be made more precis by put them in term of chang in impli forward rate  as at the right   nomin forward rate  the top panel  declin in a relat uniform fashion  from   to    basi point   the rotat up in the real yield curv  howev  was associ with sizabl increas in short term real forward rate and declin at longer horizon   the arithmet differ between the two is plot in the bottom right panel   inflat compens fell notic at short horizon  but the declin taper off as the matur lengthen     materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix          one way to tie these dispar movement into a neat packag is to argu that the substanti declin in oil price in recent week repres a disinflationari impetus that is anticip to be onli part offset by you   that is  nomin rate will move lower but by less than the drop in inflat so as to keep real interest rate higher for a  e   in this stori  the declin in oil price repres an opportun to disinfl   an opportun that investor expect you to take by be slow to lower nomin interest rate   the same stori  howev  can take on a darker hue if it is argu that the fall in the price of oil and other commod evidenc a slow in global activ brought on at least in part by your previous    polici firm   that is  this opportun for disinfl could be one of your own make   either explan   one of omiss or one of commiss   produc a moder in spend and a drift down in inflat that would seem to be consist with hold the fund rate at    percent for now  a possibl examin in more detail in exhibit     at it august meet  the committe assess the risk to be such that it could hold polici unchang given it expect that growth would moder and inflat declin   the inform receiv sinc then would seem to strengthen that determin   as shown in the top left panel  inflat compens measur in the treasuri market is about unchang at the longer horizon  the red line  and distinct lower in the near term  the black line    how much of this declin  repres a drop in inflat expect as oppos to a declin in inflat risk premium is hard to say  but the evid at the right may be suggest   merril lynch conduct a month survey of global fund manag about their view of macroeconom risk and portfolio inclin   more than     of them typic repli  and last month an increas share of them were of the view that inflat would be lower  rather than higher  than in recent month   this view seem to be underpin by the expect that econom growth will moder so that resourc slack will open up  perhap as in the staff forecast in the middl left panel   inde  when ask about global econom growth  the fund manag survey by merril lynch most expect it to slow  as at the middl right  with more of them of that view than earlier in the year   as can be seen direct below  the slow is not anticip by investor to be so precipit as to tip the world economi into recess   more than    percent of the manag view such an outcom as unlik   thus  they wouldn   t seem to be put much weight on the flat of the yield curv  plot at the bottom left  as a lead indic of recess   nor would you if you   re inclin to keep polici on hold   in that regard  as the chart make clear  the yield curv has had some predict power for recess over the past forti year   for instanc  the invers of the term  structur in      was send a signal that  in retrospect  might have warrant a respons   this indic may seem less compel now for two reason   first  a flatten yield curv has sent fals signal as well over the year  includ of recess that didn   t occur in the mid     s   second  much of the downward tilt of the term structur seem due to a declin in term premium  which might be a sign of reduc uncertainti rather than a sign of increas econom vulner      inde  some committe member may be far from see the economi as vulner   perhap to the point of inclin them toward firm polici    basi point  as in exhibit     in particular  financi market particip do not seem to have heard the messag of the august statement that the risk were tilt toward higher polici rate   rather  as shown in the top left panel by the spread of the decemb      eurodollar futur contract below the decemb      one  about    basi point of eas is expect next year   this expect of eas may be contribut to low credit spread  the top center panel  and the recent rise in equiti price  the top right panel    this financi impetus might be seen as a reason that spend will not moder suffici to make a notic dent in inflat   even if those expect are wrung out of financi market price over  e   as in the staff forecast   the result path of inflat may not be accept to the committe   as shown in the middl panel  core pce inflat is project by the staff to remain abov   percent through the end of       which would mark the fifth consecut year of such an outcom   the survey expect of cpi inflat    plot at the bottom left   similar remain well abov   percent   while survey respons came down over the intermeet period  you might discern a slight uptrend in the past few year that could be taken as an eros of the public   s confid   in such a circumst  member may believ that more accept progress toward price stabil will like involv a firmer stanc of polici  a judgment that would be strengthen if you thought the spike in the growth of compens per hour plot at the right was not as like to roll back as the staff project   the bluebook live up to it titl     monetari polici altern     by offer the five differ option given in exhibit     three formal one and two variant  which are shade  that were discuss in the text   if your intent is to solidifi current market expect of eas  switch to balanc risk  as in a  probabl has

we are readi for the go round now   would anyon like to  speak   presid pool
am i the onli taker to be number one    laughter   thank you  mr  chairman   i want to start with two observ   first  the distribut of the market   s outlook for  the feder fund rate six month ahead   and the brief paper that appear in my hotel room last night has that shown on exhibit     is pretti symmetr  although it actual has a bit more   probabl weight on declin in the rate than increas   but rough speak  it accord with my own view   a one third chanc that we will stay where we are  a one third chanc that it will be appropri to eas  and a one third chanc that we will want to increas the rate   i come out with a veri symmetr view myself   i think of the view around the tabl   some peopl are probabl  there  some peopl are probabl skew on one side and some on the other side  but i come out veri  much in the middl   my second observ continu a point that     made a few minut ago   i had sever convers at jackson hole with wall street economist and journalist  and they said  quit frank  that they realli do not believ that our effect inflat target is   to   percent   they believ we have morph into     to     percent  and no one thought that we were realli go to do  anyth over  e to bring it down to   to     i think that is veri unfortun becaus so mani of us have talk about   to     also  it seem to me that in the futur it would be easi for peopl to say      well  it is go to be inconveni   let   s just sort of settl at   to        they have alreadi said that they would be at     to     effect by the behavior of the committe   now  if we get data in the come month that are unfortun on the inflat side and lead us to increas our inflat  forecast in the absenc of ani further polici action  i would certain be on the side say that we ought to act   we should firm polici so that we do not allow the forecast inflat to rise from where it is now     one reason that i do not want the explicit refer to hous to be in the statement is that i  would take that posit even if hous were continu to struggl  becaus i think it is extrem import that we not allow inflat to ratchet up   if hous is a casualti of that polici  we had  better accept that situat   i would not like to see a mix market signal becaus i would not want the market to believ that continu weak in hous would deflect us from act as necessari to keep inflat from rise further   i think the explicit refer to hous in the statement condit the market to think about our polici go forward in the wrong way  at the same  e  there is a clear possibl that we could see data in come month that  would be weaker than we now anticip in the  book forecast   what i know about forecast error say that you have to think that come in weaker on the real economi is a real  live possibl   i hope that we do not get unfortun news on inflat and a downsid on the real economi togeth  but i do not rule out that possibl   i think it is unlik  if we receiv substanti weak data on the real economi  that we would be rais rate into a recess   but quit frank  i would like for us to condit the market   to accept this symmetr view of the risk that we face go forward and for us not to have languag in our statement that tilt us toward tighten   my own sens is that an asymmetr tilt  toward tighten would not serv us well should we get downsid surpris in the real economi  inde  we should be quit happi to see longer term rate weaken in the event of weak data on the real economi   to have the market respond that way help to serv as a built in stabil for econom activ   it would tend to support hous and other interest sensit sector  and we should encourag rather than discourag that respons in the market  let   s see   what els do i want to say here   i would observ that the  book forecast of  a prolong period of an invert yield curv has no histor preced   usual the yield curv is    invert in the process of go from here to there  and you do not just sort of settl there   so i think that this situat is like to be resolv either in the direct of higher long term rate  as  news on the real economi or inflat come through in that direct or in the direct of lower short term rate  for reason i was just outlin  and i don   t know which direct it will be  my view of the current stanc of polici is that it is moder restrict   money growth  whether measur by mzm  money zero matur  or by m   has been modest  and in fact  real balanc have been flat to declin for a year or more  which would be a rather tradit sign that our polici is restrict   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i appreci your pass out this sheet and talk about it   i think the lesson here is that these thing do not alway go as gradual as forecast  and onc thing get go in one direct  there is more momentum than is built into our longer term forecast  in term of polici  as you know i would have prefer rais rate at our last meet  and i think the overal contour of the resourc gap and the inflat forecast are pretti much the same as they were last  e   i still think that polici will need to be tighten further to bring inflat  back into my comfort zone within a reason period of  e   but given our decis to paus last  month  i do not feel that we should move today   we told the public that we paus to assess incom data  and i think it requir more than one meet   s worth of data to assess that   in fact  if we did move today  it would be a signal that we are just react to littl snippet of inform  and we are tri to dissuad peopl from think that   but i am concern about how market  view our last meet   we talk last  e about a hawkish paus   general the market didn   t interpret it that way   they may be more op ist about inflat  but as we know  the futur      market is expect us to cut rate   i share a sens of what presid pool talk about   that  market analyst and other are say that we are not realli serious about this   to   percent that   mani of us have talk about  they think our zone is somewher higher   so when you look at these option from a to z   a to c  laughter   there are lot of option   that vinc has distribut  i am in the b  categori   but i think we should not put that phrase    polici is more like to firm than eas go forward    in the statement   howev  i think  that it is the sens of this committe  and i think it should be reflect in the minut
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  so far it look as though our decis to  paus at the last meet was a sound one  and i emphas    so far    becaus we obvious have not receiv a lot of addit inform   i think the reaction in the financi market has been encourag in that  as best as i can judg  the news was receiv that it is a sensibl decis   inflat expect have remain well anchor  and so forth   my take on the incom data has  not chang my view of the decis to paus last  e  which i favor  and i think we are well  posit at the moment  especi when we continu to allow for the lag presum stem  from our previous action   so i favor stay where we are today  as far as the languag is concern  i favor the languag of altern b  as written   vinc indic that perhap financi market particip did not quit receiv the messag  but i thought the messag was fair clear   it talk about    ani addit firm     which is quit explicit and allow  as far as i can see  flexibl if we need it to go in the other direct with the last phrase in the risk assess in section     so i am comfort with the languag and think that at this stage we should just stay where we are
well  mr  chairman  i am somewher between mr    and our  distinguish presid from minneapoli  but i am bias toward b    my board  as i indic earlier  was in favor of ratchet up the discount rate   one of their concern that i did not voic in our discuss previous was about how perman or  rather  how temporari this reduct in  energi price is like to be  and as you know  we have a heavi weight of signific oil oper on our board   the onli statement one can make with assur   and   refer to this dure the analysi period   is that we are like to have volatil   we cannot take or assum great confid in term of continu direct  in altern b  section    the word that i find most objection are    reflect reduc impetus from energi price      it is a littl too soon to tell  and the languag send a mix signal  becaus we spent  under our previous leadership  a tremend amount of  e emphas core   pce  which exclud energi   i take your point  which is absolut appropri in my view  that we  need to be awar that the rest of the world look at the cpi and   not necessarili think about core pce ex food and ex energi becaus they have to eat and they have to drive   i would be in favor of  the b  column  mr  chairman   i would consid strike the word    polici is more like to firm than eas go forward     but vinc make a good point   there is some valu to the forc of repetit   what i worri about most is expect creep  and i do agre that what i am hear from outsid and what i heard not just at jackson hole but elsewher is that we are too will to  accept an inflat target that rang up to   percent   i would be adam against accept that  kind of inflat   so i think it is import to reiter our bias and to do it with a deft hand   we should not do it in such a way that tilt us into the risk that you point out in your chart of trigger recess  but we nonetheless should indic that we are firm   so i am a b  man  even at this tabl of a  student
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m in favor of maintain the current stanc of polici   i think that is the best chanc we have at this junctur for have growth modest below the  growth rate of potenti and inflat gradual eb   i am not as dissatisfi with that path as  mayb some other around the tabl   after the inflat surpris of earlier this year part relat to  an energi shock  a gradual declin in inflat is about as good as we can expect to do  and i do not think that is go to impair our credibl if peopl see that happen  now  i admit that that credibl may be built around a slight higher inflat rate than other want to see   in that regard  i think we are in desper need of the convers we want to  have at the next meet about what our target should be  how we should enunci them  and onc we are away from ani target if we do enunci it  how we should get back   but at this point i do not see ani risk to our credibl from someth that look like the path that i expect to happen with keep polici unchang for now  until hous weaken further and begin to spill over into other sector  the risk to our dual   mandat come primarili on the inflat side   so i am veri comfort with the inflat risk  languag   i do not think our refer to hous in section   undercut our sens that we are worri about inflat and would act against it   i think it help explain section    which say whi we think inflat would moder   so it   not bother me that much  i am somewhat puzzl by the behavior of financi market with respect to the expect polici   i am not puzzl so much by the downward tilt   that is rough consist with growth below potenti and a gradual retreat of inflat and is not all that differ from some of the taylor  rule simul in the bluebook  includ some of those with a     percent inflat target   it is also consist with the committe   s past action judg from the forecast base rule   but it      not seem to give much weight to the upsid inflat risk that we sens or to the committe   s prioriti of seek assur that inflat is moder   more perplex   and i think vice  chairman   brought this up   is the appar certainti with which market particip seem to view this expect path  they do not seem to share our uncertainti or at least my uncertainti  about the futur cours of polici   at some point  expect volatil will rise  and some market particip will suffer loss  but for now the impli path of rate or the low expect volatil is not realli imped our abil to achiev our goal  and i would not attempt to use the announc to chang expect in market   i do not think they are so far off that they   re  stop us from get where we want to go   so i would not favor b    i would favor the languag of b   thank you
mr  chairman  base on my assess of the econom outlook  i think we should maintain the fund rate at    percent  which as other have said is modest restrict    and i counsel what i would refer to as ration patienc here as we work through this   i continu to  hold the view that the current polici stanc  along with the lag effect of past tighten  will lead to a moder of inflat go forward   and that   not deni that upsid risk to inflat do  in fact  remain  just quick  i would like to say that i think credibl is extrem import for the feder reserv and that we risk the issu of credibl much more when we are at   percent than when we are at    percent  which is where we are now  in term of upsid inflationari risk   we are moder restrict  and we do not want to overreact   with that in mind  although there are also downsid risk to growth  i want to be veri clear to the market and to the public that ani near term eas in polici is not like   inde  i believ  first  that we should maintain our current polici    stanc until we see evid of signific systemat declin in inflat   we should make that  clear   second  if we get evid that inflat is not moder  i would be prepar at that point  to support addit tighten  but i think we should have that evid befor we reengag in ani polici tighten  on the press statement  i am in favor of b    we should be veri firm about our inflat  posit and about our commit to bring inflat down   we should not overreact  and with  the moder tight polici that we have now  we can see inflat come down systemat over  e   thank you
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   i don   t know how we would ration or explain a departur today from the paus that we decid on at our last meet   also  i think that  what we have learn sinc our last meet   not substanti alter our medium term forecast  therefor  i strong favor anoth hold decis today  along with a statement that continu to  make it veri clear that  if our forecast chang  especi with regard to the expect of moder inflat  our polici posit would also be reassess  i also want to echo the earlier observ of presid  n on the evid in the memo that were circul befor the meet   despit the lack of correl between resourc util  and inflat and a declin in the influenc of energi price on core inflat  we continu to put  consider weight on these relationship in our statement   i think there are issu here that deserv a good discuss at some point  final  it seem clear that we are realli struggl to understand inflat dynam and see a need for a more empir robust framework to guid our decisionmak   i assum this area will receiv even more research emphasi and will be a fundament part of the upcom debat    you will have on how to target  forecast  and talk about inflat and the inflat outlook   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor a paus at the last meet  and i haven   t realli heard or seen anyth sinc then that would caus me to chang that view   consequ  maintain the paus seem like the right thing to do  and i favor the languag in altern b in communic that decis   i would also like to add that i share the concern that most have express today that the trajectori of inflat may not head downward fast enough  howev  i favor the current polici stanc becaus i believ that the rate we have alreadi  implement will bring the inflat rate down and becaus  as i said earlier  overtighten when  the economi appear to be moder more than we anticip even just a coupl of month ago is a concern to me   mr  chairman  the chart that you hand out today reaffirm that concern   even though i am convinc that the inflat rate will fall  i am less convinc about how much and when   right now  i am satisfi with break the momentum in the inflat process and will wait to see whether the moder in the economi   stabil   i can envis  as other have said  today  a point in the futur when our polici will have to be more ambiti to bring the rate of inflat down over  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet  my inclin was to   favor an addit    basi point increas in the fed fund rate   in my view  there has been veri littl chang in the econom case for some addit polici firm   the incom data have not  persuad me to think that growth would be consider below trend in        although i do think that there will be moder over the next coupl of quarter   i do not think that a    basi point      chang in interest rate one way or the other will have much effect on the hous market at this point  and i do not believ that we should stand in the way of the adjust to the hous sector to move to a more sustain level of activ  thus far the committe has maintain it credibl  and long run inflat expect have been stabl   that is veri good   my concern  howev  is that the longer we toler inflat abov our comfort zone  the more risk we have that those expect will becom unhing   their becom unhing  as i note in my earlier comment  could lead to some veri unpleas outcom  and we would find regain our credibl veri difficult   becaus of the weak in residenti invest  a rise in the fed fund rate could be view as potenti cost  but that potenti cost increas the valu of the action as a signal of the fed   s commit and it effect in keep inflat expect firm in check  as the discuss around this tabl in august and today show  reason peopl do  sound econom analysi can have differ view about whether further polici firm will be  need   i understand and respect both side of that argument   my goal at this point is to stress  as mani peopl have stress  that we shouldn   t lose sight of the import of our credibl and to state that i am unhappi with the level of core inflat and with the pace at which it seem to be  declin  at least in the staff   s forecast   credibl is difficult to acquir and easi to lose   if we  convinc ourselv at each junctur of the decisionmak process that at the margin we can risk sacrif a littl credibl to achiev some other loos defin and perhap illus object  we may find our capit signific deplet   onc that is obvious in the data  it is too late  the decis to paus in august was a close call  but the paus cannot be ignor  i think  in  decid the appropri action for today   while i believ the languag we use in our august statement give us the flexibl to rais rate  i think do so today would pose a veri differ    and difficult communic challeng   i argu last  e that  if the data for august and septemb continu to evolv as they had in june and juli  it would be hard to chang our polici stanc if we paus in august   that seem to be exact where we are   i might argu that anoth six week of inflat abov our comfort zone has increas the risk to our credibl  but i think that initi a rate increas so soon after paus  given the data we have receiv  could be misinterpret and pose it own risk to our credibl for sound monetari policymak   thus  i come down on the side that it would be better to remain on hold for this meet but to have strong enough languag in today   s statement to enabl us to initi rate increas in the near futur unless the incom data are signific differ from what we   ve expect   the languag in altern b  come close to do that   it is import that we continu to say  as in section    that inflat risk remain   i would not like to cite factor restrain aggreg demand in the list of thing that would potenti help moder inflat   i do not think we can measur the tradeoff between growth and inflat precis enough to depend on a moder deceler to bring inflat down over the forecast period   moreov  and even more import to me  such languag fo  a belief among the public and other that we have a desir and an abil to engag in fair precis fine tune  i am oppos to altern a languag   first  i do not think that we can say with ani great confid that inflat risk appear to have diminish   second  i do not think that say      downsid risk to growth have becom more signific    is help at this point   say that is  like to lower the expect path of futur interest rate  as has been point out  and to reinforc the  idea that interest rate are like to come down sooner than is built into our forecast   to the extent   that the assess of risk languag is suppos to help with the public   s understand of the    monetari polici process over the come month  i think the languag in altern a would be counterproduct  final  i would like to reiter a point that has been made around the tabl sever  e   when we look at the longer term survey data and at what the market are say  they seem to be read the fact that we do not actual have a target zone of   to   percent   the target zone is realli mayb   to   percent or   to   percent   if in fact our comfort zone is   to   percent  then we should communic that fair direct rather than speak one way and act anoth way   of cours  as governor kohn and sever other mention  that point bring us right back to the communic issu  which i think will be a veri import agenda item in the come meet  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
after look close at the new data sinc the last meet  i do not see a compel reason to materi alter my assess of polici   i still think that the fed fund rate  should be     percent to bring core inflat down rapid enough   my prefer is base on an assumpt that we want to bring core inflat down to       that is how i think thing through    when i come into these meet   i have not been told to do otherwis   and  without a firmer  polici path  i think that core inflat is like to declin no more rapid than the glacial pace of the  book  i acknowledg that there are risk to real growth in the outlook and that rais rate may add to those risk   but the risk strike me as toler small part becaus my baselin forecast stay a littl further away than the  book from your point of no return threshold  which i think  are legi  concern   but sinc you have put that on the tabl and presid pool has echo this  let me add to his statement that toler a rise in inflat to avoid a point of no return and    recess is  i think  a grave error  and i think that the experi of the      s is strong evid of that   besid that  i think these risk can be signific lower to the extent that tighter polici shift the public   s expect regard our futur conduct   a lot of comment around the tabl just now have indic that the public has substanti uncertainti about whether         or     percent is where we are realli interest in bring inflat to  i am not as concern about a rise in inflat right now   we have experienc increas in core inflat in respons to energi price shock  and i am concern about the possibl effect on core inflat from the next round of fluctuat in the oil market   the process is repeat  and just like the inflat dynam that the  book staff analyz  the respons to energi price shock is a reduc form  and it embodi what peopl expect about how we are go to react to  those shock   i think the major danger is that we allow core inflat to persist abov    percent  for a substanti  e   the longer we allow that  the more like it is that the public   s expect  will collaps around a high rate of inflat and the harder it will be to bring core inflat down to     percent  if that is what we settl on want to do
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i note earlier  given the relat subdu pace of incom data  given the rang of uncertainti that have been talk about  and given that we have alreadi paus  i would continu to paus   i thought the exposit you gave about the point of no return was close to my own think  without my quantifi it in that effect fashion   there are downsid risk  and i do take serious the  book   s forecast of  slow growth   howev  if we do continu our paus  we need to continu be fair strong in the way we communic   now  i have gone back and forth about how exact to do that   i am a bit  attract to michael     s formul of be essenti in the area of b  but have the    statement look like b   that   s the way i interpret it   but also have the minut emphas the  concern that i sens around the tabl about inflat risk go forward  i  too  was a bit disappoint in the market reaction part to our statement but most to the  minut of last  e   perhap the market was over influenc by the incom data at the  e the minut were releas  but it did seem to think that we thought the risk of rise inflat had  moder consider   i don   t think that   s a general view of the committe   i take serious the concern that mani have rais about our continu seem complac about the level of price escal over a fair long period   four or five year or so   unless our prefer is for inflat that center on   or     percent rather than on     percent   person  i don   t see anyth wrong  with   or      and i do not know whether we have ani compel data that suggest that a lower rang is obvious prefer   i rememb the day in which we had inflat at a littl abov   percent  and we were realli concern about deflat   so i think a lot of in and out and up and down here are get kind of confus  in that regard  i never thought i would be look forward to yet anoth discuss of  inflat target    laughter   i think that the tension between the comment of mani peopl  regard a comfort zone of   to   percent and the expect slow moder of inflat that is  implicit embed in our public comment and in our public forecast over the next coupl of year is becom more evid to market analyst along the line of what sever peopl have  mention   there probabl is a need for more clariti here  and so i guess i am look forward to it    laughter
thank you   i assur you that the minut will reflect the tenor of the meet   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   it is still too earli to know whether our current polici stanc will succeed in lower inflat to an accept level over  e  but the data sinc  our last meet reassur me that our decis to step off the escal was wise  and i think we should remain on the sidelin today   recent inflat read have contain no advers  surpris   inflat expect remain contain   i think the inflat outlook is slight improv becaus of the reduct in energi and commod price  and growth dure the second half of the  year now appear quit like to fall short of trend   i view the risk to the attain of our  object as more balanc than they were in august  and i certain judg the downsid risk to growth to have increas   your discuss of nonlinear  mr  chairman  was interest  and it is import to be sensit to that possibl   that said  i think that the upsid risk to inflat still  outweigh the downsid risk to growth   with inflat project to remain uncomfort high over a sustain period and with the economi still like oper beyond potenti  i favor altern b and think it   s import that we do at least hint at an upward bias for fed fund rate chang  with respect to the languag  i prefer altern b to altern b  becaus the latter point to a greater possibl of a near term tighten   i am concern  howev  that market appear to  think that the fed fund rate has peak and that cut seem veri like by next spring   i do not think altern b would shake that view in the market   in contrast  i find myself more in agreement with the  book baselin for the fed fund rate  suggest that we   re like to want to hold it  near it present level for some  e to bring inflat down   now  market obvious may turn out  to be right   but if  as the month go by  develop rais our confid in the  book baselin view  then i think it would be use for us to think about way to signal to market     possibl through some forward look languag   an extend polici path in somewhat clearer  term than ani of the option in tabl   current allow
thank you   governor
from a prudent risk manag perspect  i think we made the appropri decis to paus at the previous meet  and again from a risk manag perspect  i think we should continu to paus at the moment   certain there are downsid risk   to the outlook that we have talk about   the lag effect of the interest rate increas are still not in  and there is a lot of uncertainti with respect to the hous market  with respect to the way the market react to our statement from last  e  i am somewher between presid  n and the person former known as the vice chairman of the fomc  governor kohn    laughter   i think that the market react broad reason in term of  the level of expect to what we had said  but i find it a bit hard to understand their appar think that there is littl uncertainti about where we are go or where the economi is go   so i am somewher between those two   certain i have had peopl say  as mani peopl around the tabl have heard peopl say     where exact is your comfort zone on inflat   is it move up     but if you look at the survey  you do not see that  and if you look at the tip spread and other place where peopl are put their money where their mouth is  you   re not realli see that   so i am not quit sure how to weigh those reaction   obvious i do not want inflat expect to becom unhing   that would be veri  veri cost  and certain there is a nonlinear in tri to   put the hing back when the hing has come off   but the situat we are in is veri differ from  that   even though i think that we need to convey to the market our concern about inflat risk  i would not favor altern b  becaus it take away some of our flexibl go forward and also suggest more certainti about what we will do next   there was a lot of uncertainti around the tabl   and our concern that the market are think that we are too certain might push us in the other direct      howev  i would like to put on the tabl a suggest for a chang   in altern b  section    we have ad the phrase    on balanc    in the first sentenc      read on core inflat have been elev on balanc      the innov of the two word    on balanc    is perfect  reason becaus  as the chairman said  the data on inflat sinc the last meet have probabl  been slight on the lower side of expect rather than on the higher side and mani of the  three month measur of inflat peak earlier   but i am a bit concern that  with just the small  amount of data that we have seen recent  by say    on balanc    we are make the qualif  that it is onli on balanc and that we are not so concern about the elev level   i think this also  reflect some of the concern of the peopl around the tabl   so i put out for discuss that we  consid delet    on balanc    becaus  from my prudent risk manag perspect  i think we  shouldn   t be make a particular commit about that at the moment  i would object to the b  languag  i think it take away some of our flexibl  which is not  a prudent thing to do at this  e   on the point that was rais about the differ between the first sentenc and the subsequ sentenc in the discuss of energi  i think the energi discuss clear relat to headlin inflat and that there certain is some effect of energi price on headlin inflat   i do not think it is inappropri to acknowledg that at that place
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i support no chang today   i do not believ there has been enough inform to chang my mind from the last meet   i support altern b becaus i am concern that b  is more of a commit that we are go to do someth  and i am not readi to go that far   howev  i agre with presid     s comment that the   long term inflat level abov   percent  especi now that we have      in the forecast  is  worrisom becaus of where we are with resourc util and potenti growth and the potenti    conflict that i see there   i also rememb that i was veri nervous when inflat was drop   it  was below   percent   go between the short run spike down and short run spike up get one  nervous   so not onli do we need to think about the rang  but also we need to think about what we  mean by the medium term in which to gaug it   i look forward to this discuss becaus it may help me put those thought togeth at the next meet   but for today   s meet  i favor altern  b as it is and no chang in rate
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   given our decis at the last meet  i favor maintain the paus today  and i favor altern b   the judgment to paus  as well as the languag around that    in fact constrain our flexibl  and i think most of us recogn that go into our last meet   in review the languag  i think that b  has some superfici appeal  but the appeal realli  is in understand that   s what we meant to say or that   s how we meant the market to react last   e   that is  i do not think our statement today should redo  correct  or tri to reinterpret the last  one   we had one shot in august   we now have a shot in septemb   some of the appeal of b  is tri to drive those market reaction that we expect   given what the market has done  it strike  me that chang the languag about what we said last  e carri a larg burden   the languag in the statement repres a relat blunt instrument  and our view that it is somehow nuanc or that we can play nuanc through it is hard to prove in the marketplac   i read altern b as somewhat less hawkish than our august statement  and i would strong support governor      s recommend to strike    on balanc    becaus  again  i do not want to over  encourag the market behavior that we have seen over the intermeet period   so with that i  recommend altern b with the strike of    on balanc
well  in contrast to some peopl here  actual i   m quit comfort with   the  book forecast as to the most like path of inflat   i am more troubl about what is further out beyond the polici horizon   i think that the most like path of inflat is to hit      percent on the cpi and stay there  which is correspond around   percent on the pce deflat   so i do have some discomfort there  but i do not think that pursu someth like b  or  rais rate at this  e is the right way to deal with this problem   how we manag expect realli is an issu  and we can   t do it with the apparatus we have now   i am veri much look  forward to the discuss of communic at the next meet  laughter  becaus i think the issu here is our overal strategi about monetari polici   we have to think about how we put it all   togeth in term of what we do at a particular meet and in term of how we manag expect go forward  so at this particular junctur i am veri comfort with b   i think that the right way to express the fact that we are uncomfort with the current rate of inflat and with what will  happen more than two year out is to do it through the minut   i am sure the minut will show that the sen ent of the committe is that we   re not comfort with have a situat in which   if inflat   not moder along the line of the  book  we keep rate the same   in that context  we would like have to rais them  or if the economi weaken somewhat and inflat   not declin the way we hope it will  we might actual have to maintain rate at the current level longer than the market might otherwis expect   so we can do it that way at this stage  and we   ll just have to see where the committe come out in think about how we manag expect in the futur   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
i was fair comfort with our decis in august  and i am fair comfort with that decis in retrospect   whether we were wise or we have been  lucki is someth onli histori will judg   i would be more comfort if there were a slight posit slope to expect about the futur path of polici and less certainti around that path  but  i don   t know how to achiev that respons with languag today   as governor kohn said  despit  whatev discomfort one may have with that path in market today  we can   t say that path is  fundament get in the way of our confid or the world   s confid in our capac to  achiev our object   so i   m comfort with not move today and basic fine with the languag in altern b   i have just two other observ to make   it is strike that we have an asymmetri in the growth paragraph and in the inflat paragraph in that we have slip into give a forward look view about the like path of inflat in a qualit sens but have not done so in  the growth paragraph for lot of reason   i think that the asymmetri creat a bit of a problem for us  today in tri to explain how we view the outlook and the risk to the outlook   the absenc of ani languag about the futur path of growth make me more uncomfort than i felt about the path today  and so i think we should come back and think about whether we want to correct that  correct that asymmetri might help a bit in explain to the world ani differ between the staff forecast  which will be clear reflect in the minut  and the implicit forecast of the  committe  my second point is just about the minut   i think that there is an issu regard the  minut in that the staff forecast get express with a clariti that is not express about the committe forecast   the committe forecast is necessarili describ more vagu   it   s harder to find what the center of graviti is  and even the tail don   t necessarili come through   we probabl     saw the reaction we did to the minut last  e becaus  even when the committe   s judgment is much differ from the staff   s  that differ is hard to character in the minut   that is anoth topic for futur discuss   thank you
thank you all   our paus at the last meet was a benefit cost calcul   the benefit of paus was to give ourselv more  e to assess the state of the economi and the effect of our previous interest rate action   the potenti cost of paus was that we would lose some credibl  that inflat might move advers  and we would get behind the curv in term of that veri import goal   the intermeet develop have shown a somewhat weaker economi in real term than we had expect and  i think i can safe say  no reduct in uncertainti   although inflat remain abov where we would like it to be  i think we can   t say that the inflat situat has deterior dure the intermeet period   therefor  it   s reason for us to continu to paus to get more inform and to evalu the state of the  economi   we can  of cours  maintain our polici stanc at this level for a while if we deem it suffici restrict  or we can move it as new inform come in   at this point we will have a veri high degre of flexibl in futur action   i   d like to make a few other comment about some of the convers around the tabl   i   m bemus by the de facto inflat target that we have becom here  laughter  with the     percent goal   let me just make a coupl of comment on that   first  flexibl inflat target   respond to thing other than the target itself   in particular  we saw a surpris increas in inflat earlier this year  which took us abov or further abov our implicit target   the op  respons to that is to return to target  but onli slowli and with the amount of  e to take to get back to the  target depend posit on the initi deviat   second  the speed at which you return to the target ought to depend on the state of the real economi   the extent to which we   re concern about    potenti recessionari effect should make us be a littl more cautious and make us move a littl more slowli   i would add that  although a number of us  includ myself  have mention this   to   percent zone  it has also been note around this tabl that it may not  in fact  be the right zone   if  we do determin that we want to announc a target and it is     percent  we should lay out a plan for get to that level over a period of  e and not immedi   but we might choos as an altern possibl  for exampl      to   percent  in which case we would be somewhat closer to that target in a shorter  e  let me also say a word about credibl  which is a littl subtl  and i am probabl go to mess it up   i think there are two definit of credibl   the first is the one we are all familiar with  which paul volcker gave to the feder reserv and for which he is one of my person hero   that is the kind of credibl that involv do what you have to do to get inflat where it need to be   let me be complet clear that  if inflat condit begin to deterior and our credibl come under serious threat  i certain will support do whatev it is we have to do to maintain that credibl   there is anoth kind of credibl  howev  which i think was brought to the feder reserv by alan  span  which is credibl and confid in our abil to  analyz and forecast the economi suffici well that we can achiev our object in a way that   not induc undu harm to the economi   i think that the  book forecast  if it come true   would in fact be a quit posit accomplish for this committe becaus it would have us  bring inflat down to a reason level in a moder way and avoid a recess   that  outcom would actual be veri good   in fact  our task is go to be more difficult than that  as i   ve indic   part of our task go forward is not just to show that we   re commit to fight inflat  which we are  but also that we are veri deft evalu the state of the economi and make good judgment about what need to be done     let me turn to the statement   i would like to discuss certain element of it   i   d like to propos that we use altern b  and let me note a few point   first  i   m sure that everyon note  that in section    in the phrase    reflect a cool of the hous market     we are elimin the word    gradual    and do so indic a somewhat stronger degre of cool   second  in respons to presid pool  i think this is not intend to be anyth other than a pure descript of the economi and our sens of what is happen in the economi   it actual   have a bit of a forward look aspect as well  vice chairman    and it is factual in that  if you look at the forecast  the slowdown in construct account for almost all the declin from potenti   so i don   t think it   s in ani way focus our polici decis on the hous sector   in section    the addit of    reduc impetus from energi price    is use  i think   we have been critic for  among other thing  be too sanguin about the disinfl and argu  implicit that a modest amount of slow in the economi would be suffici to achiev  disinfl   we do not actual believ that  and one of the reason we forecast a declin in  inflat is that we expect to see a reduc impetus from energi price go forward   we now have actual seen the fall in energi price  and so we don   t even have to appeal  for exampl  to the  futur market   we can simpli state that we have seen this declin in energi price  and i think that make our stori a littl more complet and make it look more understand to the public about whi we think that inflat should declin slowli over  e   i propos to keep the assess of risk as it stand   it   s veri clear that our bias is toward  resist inflat   i   m not even sure that b  would actual be a more hawkish phrase becaus it admit the possibl of eas  wherea this statement actual suggest that it   s unlik that our next move will be anyth other than upward   i am torn about the phrase    on balanc      the intent of the phrase was to note the slight better read but to emphas that the overrid     view is that inflat read are still elev   howev  sever peopl have suggest take it  out  and i am will to do so   are there other who have a strong view one way or the other
i would agre with take it out   it   s a good suggest becaus  when you chang the languag from the last  e  peopl focus on that  and put it in will overemphas the import of it
i get a sens of nod around the tabl  so let   s strike the   word    on balanc    from section        in part    was chang back to    part    just to be the same as last  e   we consult with the style editor  and she assur us that there was no substant differ between those two    laughter   so my recommend then is no action today  and  altern b in the statement is amend by elimin the phrase    on balanc      may i have your reaction   all right   if there is no further comment  then pleas call the roll
i will be read the languag from page    of the bluebook direct first     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent     then the risk assess      nonetheless  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk  will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform     chairman bernank  vice chairman    governor bie   presid guynn  governor kohn  governor     yes ye   ye   ye   ye   ye      presid    governor   presid pianalto governor   presid        no yes  yes yes  yes
thank you veri much   our next meet is a two day meet  and we will have the long anticip discuss of inflat target  laughter  on octob    and      the meet is adjourn   end of meet
