would somebodi like to move approv of the minut of the march   th meet  which also cover the confer call of april   th and   th
without object  they are approv   dino kos  you   re on
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the chart that were distribut this morn    the top panel of the first page depict u s  cash and forward   month rate   the cash rate is down about     of a percentag point sinc the day befor the committe   s intermeet move on april   th   the   month forward rate has declin a bit less  by about    basi point  and the   month forward rate is rough unchang   the   month and cash rate are rough on top of each other as we speak  and the   month forward rate is actual abov the cash rate for the first  e sinc last septemb   perhap the market is look forward to the end of the eas cycl   move to the center panel  cash and forward rate in the euro area have exhibit a saw tooth pattern  as the market first becam convinc that the ecb would eas after the march ifo survey and then revers it view after the ecb convinc the market it would not eas   of cours  that was just in  e for last week   s    basi point reduct in the refinanc rate   the bottom panel reflect the downward pressur on japanes money market rate across all tenor sinc the march   th chang in the bank of japan   s  boj  oper target   but it   s not just money market rate   the two year japanes govern bond  jgb  yield is current yield   basi point   move to the second page  the top panel show the          and    year u  s  treasuri yield sinc decemb  st as well as the target fed fund rate  the   year rate has come down more than     basi point while the    year has drift up and the    year is rough unchang   that has led to a steepen of the yield curv on the one hand  and also to a situat where      copi of the chart are append to this transcript               the     and    year yield are abov the target fed fund rate for the first  e sinc may of       the chart in the bottom panel depict the fact that this is not just a treasuri yield curv phenomenon   the u s  swap curv has steepen substanti as well sinc last decemb  as have the u k  and canadian yield curv  although by a lesser amount   the euro area swap curv has remain more or less unchang  although it also has steepen in the last day or two   move to the third page and take a somewhat longer term perspect  i have shown the    to    year spread from januari of      through march   th of this year   the shade area repres period when the fed was eas polici   the sharp steepen of the curv from about       to      basi point in the last few month has put the curv at it steepest sinc januari of       as the bottom panel show  despit that steepen and the backup in yield  the absolut level of     and    year yield is onli slight abov the cyclic low  which was reach in        the chart at the top of page four show domest credit spread to u s  treasuri of compar matur   the red line is the merril lynch high yield spread  which is on the left hand scale   the a  industri corpor  the u s     year interest rate swap  and the    year fanni mae benchmark are on the right hand scale   in general  spread have been narrow sinc januari  st  although high yield spread are still wider than they were last summer  perhap affect by the weak equiti market and the higher risk premium that compani with more leverag balanc sheet are be charg  nevertheless  issuanc remain strong in the first quarter  especi in the invest grade sector   the bottom panel show the spread between a  p  and a  p  paper  which has been drift lower for both    day and    day issu   in part  that may reflect a bit less risk avers   but it may also reflect in part the fact that some of the weaker a  borrow are have troubl roll over their commerci paper and have drawn on other sourc of credit  such as backup credit line   or more like they have issu high yield debt  a vehicl that has remain open for mani of these borrow   turn to the next page  i thought i would provid a quick review of the tax season  now that it   s most behind us   in the top panel  the blue bar show the growth of tax receipt for the last three tax season  that is  for april and may   the red bar is the forecast for the current year  which is inclus of actual data through may   th and thus actual reflect most of the period  the growth this year has been a bit slower than last year  but it is slight abov what we saw in                   in the bottom panel  the red line depict the treasuri   s general balanc between april  nd and may   th of this year   the treasuri   s general balanc top out at about     billion in earli may  but it remain comfort below tt l capac   therefor  we were abl to avoid the larg reserv drain and the associ buildup in the treasuri   s fed balanc that had becom the norm in the last few year   in fact  we look back at histor data and found that this was the first  e in at least    year that the general balanc did not exceed the tt l capac and therefor spill over onto the fed   there were two reason for this   one was that the treasuri made more effici use of cash manag bill  second  the treasuri and the st  loui fed success campaign with bank to bring addit collater into the tt l program and thus rais capac   final  on the last page i thought i would give the committe a quick updat on our outright oper   it has been almost a year sinc we establish singl issu limit for soma hold   and as the top panel show  we   ve had an increas in our outright oper   the blue portion of the bar repres net portfolio expans   the gray portion repres the amount that has been purchas to offset the effect of redeem secur  as you can see  befor      redempt were relat infrequ   but with the sharp reduct of the size of auction combin with our singl issu limit  soma is have redempt basic everi month   in      and in      to date  as well as in our project for the rest of the year  more than    percent of our outright purchas are to offset the effect of redempt   the bottom panel depict the number of outright oper that our desk has conduct sinc        we are now oper on near one out of everi three busi day   perform is hold up  the bid to cover ratio on our oper has stay at   or higher   but the scale of the desk   s activ is grow at a  e when the size of the market is shrink  and that is place somewhat of a burden on our outright oper   we will be look in come week at way we can eas that pressur on our outright oper  with one of the most like way be the expand use of long term repo  for the  e be we   re plan to maintain the size of the repo book at     billion but we will be examin the scope for expand that  and i will report back to the committe after we conclud our analysi   mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper in the intermeet period   i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper  and i will be glad to take ani question
question for dino
mr  chairman
this is a question for dino or for don kohn   as shown on page   of dino   s handout  the yield on    year and    year treasuri bond actual hit a low point at rough the  e of the march fomc meet and  of cours  have move up sinc then   it   s rather interest that sinc that  e in march the  book forecast  and also i think most privat forecast  has becom a littl more pessimist about the economi   s prospect  at least for the shorter term     this mean that the movement in rate is realli due to a reevalu of longer run expect for inflat
especi recent  with the steepen of the yield curv  there has been chatter in the market about that as a possibl explan   i don   t know that forecast of inflat are actual rise   at least in my read of the research and commentari  i haven   t seen that peopl are rais their expect for inflat   but it may be that they   re use that explan to explain a steepen of the yield curv that they otherwis can   t quit explain
well  usual there are two reason   your answer impli one  which is that the declin in the fund rate rais the prospect that the economi will recov   and the other is the possibl that inflat could becom more of a concern
there is a third  which may in fact be relev here  sinc our march meet  if one listen to the discuss come out of treasuri and the white hous  the presumpt of elimin the treasuri debt is becom less vocal and more attenu   henc  the reduct in yield attribut to a scarciti premium is veri clear chang   that  sn   t elimin the possibl of increas inflat premium   inde  we see some of that in the tip yield
there may be more involv in that issu than we know
i think there has been an interest dispar over the intermeet period between the view of the market and the view of economist   the market seem to have becom more op ist about where the economi is go and it potenti for recoveri  wherea the economist  not just the economist in this build  but those on wall street as well  have becom a littl less op ist   the market has built in a bottom for the feder fund rate of somewher between      and   percent   the market particip are not even sure that you   ll need to do the extra    basi point and move to      percent  should you do    basi point today   but if one look at the forecast of economist  mani of them have the fund rate go down to at least      percent  veri few see the fomc stop at   percent   there are mani at       mani at       and some as low as   percent   i think this differ between market particip and economist has open up quit a bit over the intermeet period   i believ the market view has been encourag to a certain extent by the earn report of busi  which at least were not wors than the downward revis expect they alreadi had built in   they   ve react a littl  as you saw last friday  to what they view as posit news on sale and consum confid   so they seem to be look for the plus side of the news for a chang instead of the minus side  and they   ve rais their es  of the low for the fund rate   i think the rise in rate reflect both real factor and inflat expect  and that would be perfect consist if the economi is go to be stronger   particular if you look at the tip spread  market had built in a declin in inflat when they were especi gloomi about econom prospect  and they   ve taken that declin out   i   m not sure they realli are expect inflat to rise from here  but i think they   ve taken out what they previous saw as good odd on a declin
rememb  there was a bulg in the spread against the staff   s off the run synthet yield measur in april of last year and it then came all the way down
we   re just back to where it was
of cours  the  book forecast would suggest that the price pressur  if anyth  are like to be a littl less
right  but that   s part of that dispar we   re talk about
further question for dino   if not  vice chair
move approv of the domest oper  mr  chairman
thank you   without object  they are approv   dave   and    son  you   re on  sever   we need anoth motion
we have one more issu to consid  currenc swap
oh  i beg your pardon   not that i wish to get beyond that issu    laughter
a littl psycholog here
well  if we move fast enough  mayb nobodi will notic    laughter
unfortun  we need a motion
sorri about that   dino  whi don   t you explain the          issu
thank you   i   ll tri to be quick   i circul a memo late last week with some housekeep item relat to our foreign currenc reserv   two item were for inform   one item  the renew of our swap line with canada and mexico  requir action by the committe   i think everybodi will rememb that all of the other swap line that we had with the european central bank  the bank of japan  and the bank for intern settlement were discontinu coincid with the launch of the euro   the two that were retain were with our nafta partner  canada and mexico  with the chang in administr     son and i initi convers with treasuri offici to ask them about their view of the swap and the util they saw in the swap  they were veri open to the idea of have discuss with their counterpart in mexico and canada to see whether they could perhap be cajol into view the swap in the same way that mani peopl here and some at the treasuri do  name  that perhap they have outliv their use   the mexican in particular have some difficulti with end the swap this year  although in principl they were open to the idea that the day may soon come when the swap arrang are no longer need   the canadian are still have some intern discuss about the swap issu  but i think there   s a good chanc that they may come around to that view as well   so it seem that some more discuss is need until everybodi agre   i think we may be close  with    close    measur in month rather than week   so we may be there soon     do you want to add anyth
yes   i think your comment summar the situat   i would just add that the mexican want the end of these swap to be part of a seri of action they are          plan  have to do with some intern reform they   re attempt   their hope is to get a   ccl relationship establish with the imf  which would be a veri logic and natur point to end the swap with us rather than have their demis hit the market out of the blue as an isol event   the mexican are not yet at that point  but we   re agre that that is where they are head and  hope  they will get there fair soon  we don   t have a firm commit from either the mexican or the canadian on discontinu the swap   so in some sens it   s not a done deal   but there   s a share object   i think it   s simpli a question of get it done as oppos to tri to persuad them to do someth that they fundament don   t want to do
yes   in my convers with the mexican  i was not surpris at their posit   inde  it   s fair clear that they   re will  though obvious reluct  to unwind this   and they understand where we   re come from   i found the canadian posit realli a surpris  given their float exchang rate
i think it differ among the various peopl involv in the canadian situat
well  i have not had a chanc to speak to paul martin on this  but i cannot imagin that he would resist this   they don   t have a fix exchang rate   they don   t have a need for veri larg intervent that they can   t support   so the logic of retain the swap just seem to be utter miss
well  from the point of view of those in the central bank who were describ to me as have at least paus when this was suggest  the swap could be a use          instrument   if they never use it  that was fine   but the view was   whi give it away if they   don   t have to
and there   s the chang of central bank governor   this issu has come up at a  e when he   s adjust to his new job and i think he  sn   t want to chang anyth right now
he   s dodg all bullet    laughter
i wouldn   t lay it at his feet   as i understood it  the hesit came more from the oper peopl  those who carri out polici  rather than those who make polici
they see the swap as an extra sourc of fund they can use if they ever want to  so whi give that up   i don   t believ there   s realli ani thought resist
it   s just not credibl   you may recal that when this issu came up a year ago  we indic that with a new administr we   d have to get it readdress becaus the old administr rais obstacl in certain regard   as far as i can judg  the treasuri has been veri much engag with us on this and i think we will final put it behind us   and i won   t have to dodg anoth item on the agenda
so even though there is no great ideolog puriti in our posit  but rather a need to renew these swap for anoth year while the negoti take place  we do have to approv them again
yes   ani comment  question  or concern that anybodi wish to rais
i just want to get some sens of the  e frame we   re talk about   you said it would take sever month   can we anticip  it   s such a wonder opportun and i   d hate to see us
i don   t want to make a forecast   in part it may depend on how quick the mexican can negoti a ccl with the imf  and that   s veri difficult to judg   the canadian need to have their own discuss   so again  i wouldn   t make a forecast in term of week  i think it may take longer than that   but i believ we all three  ourselv  the canadian  and the mexican  are on the same plane in that the  e has come or will soon come to end the swap
the mexican have to get a fiscal reform through their congress  and that has been slow down a bit   i think they are still like to get that done  but they certain would not want to move on this as an isol event until that happen
okay  would somebodi like to move renew of the reciproc currenc arrang
so move  mr  chairman
are there object   hear none  i will assum it   s by acclam  though not exact   now we turn to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   in read our discuss in the  book of the multipl sourc of revis to our project this round  you might have sens a desir on our part for you  as policymak  to share our pain  as econom forecast   we did  inde  have to cope with mani signific develop of consequ for our project   a heavi flow of data releas  crosscurr in financi market  chang in monetari and fiscal polici set  and new inform bear on our es  of structur product growth   rather than inflict that discuss on you again  i thought i would simplifi and focus my remark this morn on two princip messag   first  we believ that the economi  at present  is veri weak  not in recess  but not far from it either   and second  in both current             econom develop and polici action  we see the seed from which an econom rebound could emerg later this year or in        as has been the case sinc last fall  the most intens weak remain center in the factori sector   ye day  we publish ip  which show anoth     percent fall in manufactur output in april   that drop come on the heel of some hefti downward revis to previous month that now show output as have declin       percent at an annual rate in the first quarter   despit sizabl reduct in product and  in some case  outright liquid of inventori  mani manufactur still find themselv with stock that are too high relat to the recent pace of sale   even the automak  who had manag to make substanti progress in bring stock into better align with sale  seem to be backslid a bit  especi with respect to light truck   in the technolog sector  produc of comput  communic equip  and semiconductor have been slash product  but soft demand and excess inventori continu to be a problem   wherea we had earlier anticip that the product adjust in manufactur would be complet by midyear  our current project   not anticip an upturn until the fall   while the weak may be center in manufactur  there are now sign in the labor market that we may be see some spillov to the broader economi   the drop in privat payrol employ of         in april was still heavili concentr in good relat sector   howev  the servic industri also experienc a drop last month  even abstract from the declin in temporari help employ  much of which is suppli to the factori sector   as the growth of real output shift down after the middl of last year  employ move quick to curtail hour by cut workweek   with the period of sub par perform prove to be more persist than mani initi thought  firm now appear more will to shed worker   to be sure  we think the april figur overst the degre of weak in labor market   season adjust difficulti  especi in construct  may have been a factor   but most of the labor market indic that we look at have soften appreci in recent month   survey measur indic that household perceiv a deterior in labor market condit  and employ report fewer difficulti find qualifi worker   in addit  help want advertis has plung in recent month   our most  e indic  initi claim  has averag more than         in recent week  a level that we es  would be consist with ongo declin in payrol employ  the unemploy rate  at     percent  alreadi has move up more than     percentag point  and unless the economi reacceler much more rapid than we  or virtual anyon els anticip  it is difficult to envis how the jobless rate will not move higher in come month               with labor incom weaken  consum sen ent still down notic  and  by our es   the wealth effect like to be exert consider restraint  we are project onli a meager gain in consum spend this quarter   we were not impress by last friday   s report on retail sale   the     percent gain in the retail control categori was like inflat by a steep rise in gasolin price  and there were some larg downward revis to the es  of previous month   all told  real spend in this categori in april was a bit below the first quarter averag and consist with our project   moreov  after last quarter   s surg  motor vehicl sale soften in april and earli may   even servic consumpt has slow of late  and we expect onli small gain  on averag  over the next few month   the biggest surpris to us on the spend side over the intermeet period was the weak in capit spend   the    high tech recess    that we had highlight as a risk in our march project is now our baselin forecast   order for nondefens capit good fell virtual across the board in februari and march  and shipment of these good were also down  on net  over the two month   as a result  we now expect real e s spend to declin again this quarter   the bulk of the markdown in our forecast was in high tech spend  but we also deepen and extend the declin we are expect for spend on other type of capit equip   these seri are so volatil that even two month of data form a shaki basi for a signific revis in the forecast   but other read on invest demand paint a similar pictur   the purchas manag in their semiannu survey report a substanti downward revis in plan invest spend by manufactur  and anecdot on capit spend  especi for high tech equip  remain downbeat   in the end  we believ the downward revis that we have made to invest spend better balanc the risk to the project   put all of the piec togeth  we now anticip that the current period of weak will extend through the third quarter   howev  there are sever reason for anticip a pickup in the pace of activ later this year   for one  inventori dynam are like to support an acceler of product at some point in the next few quarter   while mani industri are struggl with bloat inventori  the evid suggest that product cut have been larg enough to produc an outright liquid of stock in recent month   inventori liquid are self limit  and at some point  the level of output will move back closer to that of sale  provid a lift to product and employ with further posit feedback to sale   we expect this dynam to be shift in a favor direct in the second half of the year  though that pattern is a bit difficult to discern in our project becaus of the drawdown of inventori that we project to accompani a tax induc surg of sale in the fourth quarter               and that bring me to our fiscal outlook  anoth posit for growth  i   m not sure i can recal an element of our forecast go off track as quick as the fiscal polici assumpt that we incorpor in this  book  recogn the uncertainti  we wait as long as we could in the process and then took our best shot   unfortun  our eleg construct fiscal program had a half life of about    hour   as you know from read the  book  we coupl a more generous perman tax cut than we had previous assum with the introduct of a sizabl tax rebat to be deliv later this year  such a packag is consist with the budget resolut   although the uncertainti is still far from resolv  develop immedi subsequ to the  book suggest that polit sen ent may be shift toward a larger perman tax cut and no temporari rebat   if someth like the plan introduc by senat grassley and baucus last week were implement  instead of a program that employ tax rebat  the consequ for our project would be more one of  e than magnitud  we would like trim growth of real gdp a bit in      and boost it by a similar amount in        but the point to be stress is that  regardless of which approach is final adopt  fiscal polici is like to be more s ul than we had incorpor in our march forecast  and it almost certain will provid a notic boost to activ go forward   the same is true for monetari polici   to be sure  the strength of the dollar and the weak in stock price have like act to offset some of the s ulus that you might have expect from your action this year   of cours  it is precis these kind of develop that caus polici lag to be long and variabl   while one need to be cautious about interpret the calcul of the equilibrium real interest rate that were display in the bluebook  i think it   s fair to say that with the addit eas we have assum  the fund rate is like to be in territori that impli a consider s ulus to econom activ over  e   one alreadi can identifi some of the channel through which easier polici is set the stage for a pickup in activ   busi and household  for exampl  are take advantag of lower rate to shore up balanc sheet  and ani soften in construct and spend on durabl good has been limit by the drop in interest rate   as overhang of inventori and capit good are work off  a favor cost of capit can be expect to encourag a rebound in these form of capit spend   the magnitud of the reacceler in real gdp will depend import on the cours of technic progress and structur product   in that regard  we are still anticip that ongo improv in structur product will support a return to more vigor growth in household and busi demand   that said  we have reduc our forecast for structur product this round   in part  we were respond to the smaller             contribut from capit deepen implicit in our lower trajectori for busi invest   but we also took on board the smaller gain in multifactor product appar in the recent publish data for      to        this suppli side revis to our forecast affect aggreg demand relat prompt through a reduct in expect growth of household and busi incom   the reduc pace of structur product also under the upward revis that we have made to our inflat forecast   in essenc  the increas in nomin compens that we are project impli more price pressur than we had previous forecast   in that regard  the incom data on wage and price have just about uniform been to the high side of our expect   the quarter figur can be noisi  and we have not read these data as signal a mark deterior in the perform of inflat   but the recent data suggest some upsid risk to the inflat project   we still expect that inflat will slow between this year and next  as resourc util loosen up and energi price retreat   but the level of inflat is a bit higher throughout the project period than in our previous forecast   the risk around our baselin project remain larg  but they seem to us to be reason well balanc   we highlight a number of these risk in the  book  i   d just like to mention two   on the up side  final demand may not be as weak as we are project   if that is the case  then more signific progress is be made on the inventori front  and the posit inventori dynam that i laid out befor could lead to a sharper snapback in activ not that far in the futur   coupl with the s ulus we are expect to show through from monetari and fiscal polici  a more rapid recoveri of demand could provid quit a kick to activ next year   this type of outlook would seem to be consist with market expect of substanti tighten of polici over the cours of        on the down side  if the substanti near term cut in payrol employ and the accompani rise in the unemploy rate come to pass  consum may final throw in the towel   the    delic balanc     as we call it in the  book  may not hold   a signific retrench in household spend would feed back to an alreadi weak busi sector and could signific prolong the period of below trend growth or possibl push the economi into recess   while the risk remain consider  i would like to conclud with a pitch for the general thrust of the  book  that is  a period of small increas in real output without a true cyclic downturn   the economi has alreadi absorb sever blow over the past year that have not yet trigger recess  among them  a larg downturn in the stock market  a             run up in energi price  a pronounc inventori correct in the manufactur sector  and a sever slump in the technolog sector    of cours  these shock have not fulli play out  and the recent soften in the labor market will add further strain   still  the resili of the economi over the past year in the face of some pretti big negat has been impress  and we remain cautious op ist that it will continu     will now continu our present
our outlook for real output growth abroad this  e has been revis down  particular in the veri near term  as data for sever key region suggest more weak than we had previous incorpor in the forecast  we still look for the project rebound in u s  real gdp growth  along with past and prospect s ulus from macroeconom polici abroad  to contribut to strengthen growth later this year and next in other region of the globe   there are import differ in the risk we see in our forecast for sever countri or region  and my remark this morn will highlight the vulner we see as loom in some case and the upsid risk we see in other   the staff   s forecast for japanes real output growth remain pessimist in this  book   the latest indic of econom activ  includ industri product  machineri shipment  and new car registr for march  suggest that the japanes economi is stall   the momentum necessari for strong privat invest to be sustain has not develop  and the march tankan survey show further declin in busi sen ent  especi in the manufactur sector   consumpt spend has shown some resili  but not enough to spark real recoveri in domest demand   with global demand soften  the outlook is for export growth to remain weak until late this year or next year   that said  there are develop in japan  both on the econom and polit front  that we are uncertain just how to factor into our forecast  the spate of bad econom news trigger yet anoth round of polici announc by japanes offici  includ the move taken by the bank of japan on the day befor the march fomc meet   and public support for reform appear to be the reason for the surpris elect of koizumi as the new head of the ldp and prime minist   he face a daunt challeng in move the ldp and the govern bureaucraci to embrac and activ implement aggress reform   with an upper hous elect loom in juli  he appear to be push for the reform agenda but has yet to provid detail of what is to be done and when              meanwhil  we remain of the view that the measur announc by the bank of japan will not by themselv boost growth secur into the posit rang soon   overnight interest rate have return to zero  but the boj is experienc difficulti inject it target level of liquid through repo auction   with bank underbid the desir repo quantiti  the boj will have to consid use outright purchas more intens   we do not see these latest polit

question for our colleagu   presid broaddus
you point out  as is well known  that spend on equip and softwar has been veri weak and continu to be weak   but i notic in go through the  book that nonresidenti construct outlay are still quit strong   i know some of that reflect drill activ and  of cours  the invest process has a lag that is differ from spend on equip   but the differ still struck me as an anomali   how do you evalu that     this present some signific downsid risk go forward
well  the continu strength of those data has been a bit of a puzzl   as you point out  some of it is explain by the surg in drill and mine activ that has accompani the run up in oil and gas price   we are not expect that current pace to continu go forward   we anticip a rather signific slowdown in nonresidenti construct activ  and a lot of that slow occur in the offic sector where some tentat sign give us a sens that that market is begin to top out   howev  it is still the case that in general the overal health of the construct sector in the nonresidenti area has been reason good and we   re not expect declin go forward   but i think it   s a risk
i have a question for you   you start out your comment by say the economi is veri weak  though not in a recess   and then i think you said we are not far from a recess   yet when i look at the altern simul in the  book  none of the downsid scenario appear to put us into a recess   in fact the most negat in term of an impact is a product slowdown where monetari polici has less of a posit effect on the outcom   so i was just wonder whether you could be a littl more specif about what it would take to push us into a recess
a new model    laughter
gee  i was go to say that  mr  chairman   i would caution that in some sens we can make the model produc a recess   that is  we can give it a larg enough shock to push the economi into recess   but  in fact  i think it is a featur of most linear model of the economi that they do not captur the kind of process that occur as the economi goe into a true recess   one can take a look at the pattern of forecast error around recess  and it is almost alway the case that the recess are steeper than model can          explain   so  the recess often occur becaus there is a collaps of confid that    accompani them   part of what i was tri to convey in my remark was that one thing that might push us into recess would be that  as the unemploy rate rise  we start to see a period of more signific layoff and payrol employ declin   that tend to trigger a real pull back in consumpt   it is more than might be suggest just by the lag effect of past incom growth or a pull back in invest spend in the face of uncertainti   it is greater than would be expect on the basi of output growth or the cost of capit   so i see those risk as be genuin and i see our model as probabl not be abl to captur those risk adequ
so the most like scenario would be higher unemploy that trigger weaker consum confid  which feed into weaker household demand than is actual shown here
yes   and that  combin probabl with some retrench in busi spend and some more signific cutback in product  could lead to someth that is a genuin cyclic downturn
so the miss factor is consum confid
confid  one way or anoth   it could be busi confid  anoth possibl is that the high tech    meltdown      we   re go to have to start invent new name for these phenomena as we revis down our forecast more and more    not produc a recess  but lead to a shift in busi confid   and that in turn could lead to a more signific retrench in invest spend than the model suggest   so it could be either consum or busi confid   i did want to highlight the fact that we   re enter a somewhat new period here in the forecast with payrol employ declin   we   ve had a rise in the unemploy rate so far that has been associ with a slowdown in employ growth   we          think that over the next few month we will see outright declin in employ and a continu    rise in the unemploy rate   and that at least rais the possibl of a more signific negat effect on consum confid   that   s not our project   in fact  we think consum confid has fallen so much alreadi that it look consist with this period of payrol employ declin   but there   seem to be a real risk that confid could deterior
is it correct to say that we just don   t have enough episod of recessionari period to be abl to infer what happen to the coeffici and nonlinear  as you put it  dure those  e   i gather that is correct  is it not
well  that would certain be one reason whi a recess is veri difficult to forecast   we realli think of each recess as be onli one data point  and there aren   t that mani recess in the postwar period to begin with   anoth factor just may be the type of quantit model that we   re deal with   our model  at least  are not abl to fulli captur the psycholog effect and confid type effect that seem to play an import role in busi cycl   that   s not to say that we couldn   t discov data sourc or way of measur that go forward   but i don   t know how we would do that current
i have a coupl of question about japan   the  book project indic that by the end of      consum price will have declin in japan in each of the preced four year   and the quarter tabl has consum price declin in everi quarter over the three year through        what would you say are the implic of such an outcom for the bank in japan  given the problem they face  and for the equiti market   have          polici been put in place that will end this downward spiral    if not  what do you feel the    japanes should do
well  as you saw in the  book  we think this deflat will continu for at least the six quarter that remain in our forecast horizon   there aren   t too mani more step that the bank of japan could take in a monetari polici sens   and i am impress by the fact that they have basic driven the cost of liquid to zero in that economi   we could see that in mani differ way   one avenu  of cours  is the exchang rate   that is  this liquid could have as a consequ further declin in the yen  which could at some point help in this respect   we got a bit cautious i suppos  or took a middl cours  in think about the dollar this  e and we have basic extend both the yen and euro at a fair flat rate   we are just veri reluct to put into our forecast at this point a big appreci of the dollar and a big depreci of the yen becaus there are so mani reason whi that shouldn   t happen   on the other hand  from the point of view of the japanes economi there are mani reason whi it should
it seem larg caught up in market expect on the one hand and the polit of the situat on the other   and the polit extend not just to the dollar yen and u s  japan relationship  but to various trade partner and the concern they express from  e to  e about what a big depreci in the yen would do   we still see the fundament problem in japan as a need for serious reform on the structur side of that economi   we would like to see those reform in some respect bring relat price in japan  particular between trade and nontrad good  back in line with the level we see elsewher  and yet for that to occur without further deflat becaus that   have consequ   but i don   t have realli          specif answer to offer you in term of a solut and how they could bring that about   the    bank system  consum spend  and household incom are all negat affect by the ongo deflat   we still see statement by japanes offici that they can   t do certain thing or they can   t do them quick or they can   t do them one way  they have to do them anoth way becaus of what they view as polit constraint on the option they face   so  basic  i am inher still pessimist about how this will play out
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  was struck by the same distinct that don mention earlier between the real economi as portray in the current  book forecast and the real economi as view by the financi market   the financi discuss in the staff brief materi we receiv last night was quit interest in term of the differ mention in how the board staff and other economist see the economi versus how the market see it   the financi market do seem to expect a bottom out and then an upturn   all that play into a question that i   ve been ask myself becaus depend on who is talk  particular among our busi contact  we hear either a lot of doom and gloom or some sens of op    the feel of gloom and doom seem in some way  and i   d like your perspect on this  to be tie to where thing were a year ago and how bad they seem now in comparison  and the op  seem to be come from peopl who have gotten over that and see that in fact some order are come in  i was also struck by chart   in the materi we got last night  which show manufactur capac growth rate in the high tech area   that sector was ad capac at an annual rate of    percent from      to        high tech capac now is expect to grow at a          rate of someth like        percent  almost    percentag point better than the experi in    the decad befor        so i   m wonder where it is that activ is realli so slow   or is it the comparison to how fast the economi was grow that make the real economi seem so bad now   is that tend to shade the way we think about thing
it could also be  as the economi has erod so much  that the prospect of get back to a more moder growth path start to look more reason  just becaus one would expect some rebound given how far product has alreadi fallen   it   s certain possibl that we   re look in the rear view mirror  look at develop in term of where the economi has been  and mayb other econom forecast are  too   perhap we are focus on how we   ve been revis down our project and view that in some sens as a sign of impend weak  and mayb the market are look forward and see a much stronger rebound  i could not in the end convinc myself  given the recent data  that the best forecast is a more vigor rebound in activ than we are current anticip becaus  for one  we are see still veri signific cutback in the manufactur sector   and we have seen more troubl sign that less progress has been made in get inventori into better align with sale   inventori sale ratio have been hang up more than we thought   in addit to that  with the rise over the intermeet period in initi claim for unemploy insur and other sign that the labor market is weaken  we came to the conclus that the economi is current in a veri weak and somewhat vulner state   and as i indic earlier  given that we can see these trend go on for a few more month  those vulner will continu to be there   we see a signific rebound come  though in our forecast the economi still will be run below potenti through most of the project period   anoth possibl is that we          have mark our product forecast down too much   it could veri well be that mani market    particip are still see sign of strong product growth that are go to give even more impetus to a reacceler of activ and earn potenti go forward   so  i see a varieti of risk   there certain are tension between our view and the way that both the equiti and bond market have behav in the intermeet period   but we are still reason comfort with our forecast of fair weak growth  for at least the near term period  follow by some recoveri
what would the product number in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year look like if the volatil pattern in self employ hour had been smooth
rough they would be a littl better than a percentag point in each quarter   and we are expect a   percent increas in the second quarter
what would that be with a similar smooth
i think that would be about   percent instead of   percent   so it would be a smoother pattern  obvious the data seri was affect signific by the veri sharp swing in the report hour of self employ worker   nevertheless  look at the past four quarter  we   ve had       percent growth in nonfarm product in a period when three of those four quarter were quit weak in term of overal activ   so  again  that is lead us to be on the relat op ist side about product go forward
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid jordan
thank you  mr  chairman   first  let me relay a comment by one of the banker in our district who oper in quit a few state in the great lake region   he said          that a year ago the bad news was that there was littl e commerc in the region   this year the    good news is that there is veri littl e commerc in the region   he also mention discuss he had with other banker at a meet on the west coast  it was probabl the montgomeri secur annual event  for larg bank   the typic question he was ask by other banker  especi those from the we n part of the countri but even some from the east coast was  how on earth did your midwest bank compani make ani money when the economi in that region is in the tank   and he told them that his bank   s profit are veri good  it loan are veri good  and that he felt peopl   s percept about what is go on in the midwest was quit differ from the realiti   anoth director made a report that i would put in the silver line categori   he said that the golf cours he occasion play is still charg the same        fee as it did last year  so there   s no inflat there   but the cours is not near as crowd as it use to be    laughter  last week there was quit a bit of news on the district   the wall street journal had two front page stori on our region  one about cleveland and it labor market and one about the coal situat in pikesvill  or more general ea n kentucki   that latter articl dwell on the shortag of coal miner and the reluct of younger peopl to consid coal mine as an occup even at signific higher start wage than the altern avail to them  the discuss then got into issu about how much technolog is go into that sector   a director from the region said that the mine compani are expect two year of good  strong demand for coal but they are unwil to undertak invest that would requir a longer period of higher coal price and volum  the articl about the cleveland labor market gave a littl differ impress of it than our own so we call some of the peopl who were cite to check up on that   the articl          general gave the impress that manufactur has lost more job than we can confirm and    that the health care sector has creat more job than we can confirm   it is the case that manufactur has been weak  but it is not continu to worsen   and we have found notabl express of op  about the second half of the year and beyond   the health care sector is invest heavili in new technolog and the facil to hous it but it is not ad much in employ  in part becaus of tight in the labor market for that sector   it was report that just in the cleveland metro area alon there are open for over       regist nurs and that mani staff support posit for health care facil also continu to go unfil   for all of ohio  state offici are now skeptic that the employ unemploy number are accur  the last two month for which we have data  februari and march  show the unemploy rate drop to     percent and     percent respect  the lowest sinc      for the state  recreat destin report that this spring   s attend has been much stronger than even last year   s record level   but our contact also specul that becaus of the energi crisi peopl might be seek their entertain closer to home   so  odd enough  they say the high attend at these place might be a sign of some econom weak  retail were tell us that the stori on import is mix   some of them say that the long lead  e in order abroad mean that merchandis they order last summer and fall is still in transit and that if they do see final demand weaken  they will cut domest order  they could then end up with a mix of good that is differ from what their custom want  but other have assert that it is easier to cancel or postpon deliveri of foreign sourc good than it is domest sourc good  so  where are we in the district   residenti construct remain veri strong   motor vehicl product is down from last year but is better than the manufactur thought it would          be for the second quarter   govern infrastructur spend on road  bridg  build  and    so forth is well abov last year   s pace and is still constrain onli by the limit avail of contractor  subcontractor  and worker   the health care sector is build facil and seek to hire peopl but the lack of avail worker is a constraint   the general impress  base on what we hear and what we see in the news  seem to be that some other peopl someplac els must be have a hard  e  let me comment on the nation construct situat  and he report not onli on the region but on his firm   s experi and outlook from a nation perspect   he said that this will be a record year for them and they expect      to be even better   he note that while there is some weak in and around what he call the rust belt region  it is more than offset by strength elsewher in the countri and outsid the unit state   in the south and southeast part of this countri  construct is boom   those are area where they have all the busi they can handl in the construct of facil for elementari and secondari school  colleg  and univers due to veri strong demograph and region shift   he said that health care facil construct is veri strong nation   and there has been no slowdown in spend on entertain facil  his compani is build a number of museum  aquarium  and sport and fit center   he   expect a slowdown in profession stadium construct  given the fact that most major citi now have their two brand new stadium   but he believ that is be more than offset by a rise in construct of sport facil for colleg and univers  a trend he expect to last for about a decad   and he forese continu strong bond issuanc by construct compani such as his to financ the organ that are build some of these facil              let me turn to the nation economi   listen over the intermeet period to the view of director at our head offic and branch as well as some advisori council member on what it   s go to take to turn this economi around  i was struck by how differ percept are on main street versus wall street   a signific minor of our contact  not a major but still quit a few fair strong voic  have said that they think we have alreadi gone too far in our polici effort to promot recoveri and s ul growth at the expens of potenti higher futur inflat   rough one third of our advisori council member and director indic that no further eas action were desir   of the other two third  view seem to be about even split between those who thought that an end to the eas should be near and those who thought that much more eas would be desir   we can usual identifi their polici prefer just by know which compani they are talk about  the latter view is especi true of metal manufactur  the current fed fund rate is now more than    percent below where it was four and one half month ago   the bluebook present a rang of es  of where the equilibrium overnight rate should be  and i hope the staff continu to refin that framework  i found that veri use   so far what it say is that we have drop the overnight rate in lock step  with onli a veri short lag  with at least an implicit notion of where the equilibrium real rate is   and the current rate is now at or even a bit below the bottom of that rang of es    that say to me that from this point forward extrem caution is warrant in contempl further eas action   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i have had an opportun in the last sever day to talk with differ group  includ our econom advisori council and our          board of director  and i would say that the view is still that econom growth in our district    remain sluggish   busi have been put some of their capit spend plan on a wait and see basi  not becaus they can   t find fund but becaus they want to see how thing develop   there was veri littl talk of recess in the discuss with our contact   i was also a bit surpris by the fact that a minor of those individu comment that they wonder whether addit discount rate cut would realli help with our problem  which are relat to energi and over invest in some high tech and telecommun industri   so there was a sens of how far the eas has gone and a question of whether it   s perhap enough or more than enough  more specif  turn to our manufactur survey  that sector continu to be weak   the product index  though  did rise slight from it januari low   and on an anecdot basi  a minor of manufactur talk about have made some veri fast and harsh cutback earli on so that their oper are now profit again and they are more op ist go forward  consum spend is mix in our region   retail report that sale of big ticket item have been weaker than desir  which has offset the moder strength they have seen in sale of other item   the attract mortgag interest rate environ has underpin residenti real estat   there are some sign of slow in the residenti sector but veri modest slow  and price are still rise  although not as rapid as they were in our denver market  for exampl   commerci real estat remain strong but also is soften   and labor market condit have eas obvious and notic   energi remain our strongest sector  with further upsid potenti veri clear   there is a lot of activ in that area and compani are tri          to get  as they say  iron and labor into the field   the farm outlook is unchang from the last     e we met  with grain still in surplus and cattl and beef veri strong right now  let me talk briefli about the nation economi   obvious  as has been point out here  the economi has slow and certain will continu to grow slowli in this second quarter  there are also obvious downsid risk  which have been point out   mayb we will have further slow in busi fix invest  for exampl   what are the effect of slower earn growth  foreign demand  consumpt  and so forth   and the psycholog is negat  but there is no panic  we   re not talk about an overal sens of gloomi   perhap more import  i believ  there is signific s ulus in the pipelin and with it i think the outlook for the nation is general rather posit  despit the power crosscurr affect the economi   accord  i would suggest that the staff   s forecast is a littl too pessimist on growth and a littl too op ist on inflat   i would certain acknowledg the exist of downsid risk   but gdp growth in the first quarter was stronger than peopl had expect  sale figur  despit the downward adjust for march and februari  have been better than peopl had thought   and a lot of inventori adjust appear to be well advanc at this point  the outlook has been help by our chang in polici   our action appear to have cushion the deceler in activ   the declin in short term rate  the declin in risk spread  and doubl digit rate of growth in m  are have benefici effect in the short term   moreov  our polici eas has yet to be play out fulli and will be felt more complet as the chang in monetari polici kick in with a lag  all this taken togeth lead me to conclud that the economi will strengthen dure the second half of this year and into       especi with the polici we now have in place   my forecast is inde much stronger than the staff   s   and financi market  as we   ve discuss           indic that they also may be look for a stronger outcom  given the steeper yield curv and    the declin in credit risk spread  with that background  let me talk a minut about the inflat outlook   the gradual increas in core inflat over the past year is a concern to me   while much of the increas may reflect the pass through of energi price to core inflat  the current fed fund rate is accommod  in my judgment  and that heighten my concern for the longer term outlook  even assum that energi price declin somewhat and that core inflat stay at it current level  our more accommod polici may veri well lead consum  labor  and busi to ratchet up their inflat expect   there is some evid that this is alreadi occur  and it is like to becom more pronounc if we pursu polici that are increas accommod and aggress   for exampl  the michigan survey saw  in the steepen of the yield curv that i mention  an earli sign of this upcreep in inflat expect   my judgment is that core inflat could rise later this year and next year as our accommod polici move forward  for these reason i think the relat risk between weaker growth and higher inflat has shift sinc our last meet   the economi remain vulner to downsid risk in the short run   certain  the behavior of busi invest and anecdot report about rise layoff suggest that we are not out of the wood  and i   m not suggest that we are   howev  our prompt and aggress polici action have serv to address these develop to an import degre  and the risk have begun to shift toward higher inflat as we move later into the forecast period   becaus of this chang in relat risk  i would prefer to shorten our stride and be more cautious as we take action go forward   i have state on previous occas that i believ we should front load our polici action and make our aggress move earli   and          after four move of    basi point each over the last four month  i believ a more cautious    approach may be in order this  e   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district remain sluggish   mani report are quit gloomi   sever contact even told me that condit in their sector were as bad as they had ever seen   and these weren   t the    year old at dot com firm but peopl with    to    year of industri experi   in fact  a recent poll of the ceo of chicago   s     largest corpor reveal a veri sharp downturn in busi sen ent   near half the respond expect an outright recess  howev  with inventori pare substanti  there are some tentat sign that the worst may be over for the tradit manufactur industri whose difficulti have made the current slowdown especi sever in the midwest   and consum spend  though veri soft in sever sector  has shown surpris resili  provid some ground for op   unfortun  there are also sign that the slowdown is have a grow impact on capit invest and commerci real estat   more widespread employ cutback may be next on the list of difficulti  lead to a subsequ declin in consum confid as we discuss earlier  on the posit side  the auto industri   s signific inventori reduct and subsequ product rebound ought to provid some support for the rest of the midwest economi   of cours  our big three contact remain concern about the rest of the year   they have been lose market share to import and all expect sale to slow as the year progress   but relat to a few month ago  the outlook for auto is much improv   and though publish data continu to show deterior in some of our other import manufactur industri  contact in the          steel  heavi truck  construct  and agricultur equip sector report at least some sign that    condit may be near the bottom  the slowdown in consum spend we   ve seen in recent month has shown up in mani way  one of which is slimmer period and catalogu   earli last year i report that printer just couldn   t squeez ani more page of advertis into magazin   but postal statist show that  e clear have chang   total piec of class a and period mail are down and the total weight of such mail is down even more  with the differ due to the shrink size of catalogu and period   one well known busi public is down to about     page from     last year   publish even have been delay their print run  hope to book a few more ad befor they go to press   recent  howev  a magazin execut report the first glimmer of a pickup in advertis schedul for fall public  though i guess mail carrier won   t be pleas  this is probabl a good sign sinc ad tend to track consum spend fair well   an even more hope sign was the improv we saw start in april in district retail    report  of cours  the recent employ trend could still undermin consum confid and spend   we spoke with execut of two larg temporari servic firm headquart in our district   both confirm that the recent employ reduct have been concentr in manufactur  especi automot and electron assembl  other busi line were hold steadi or actual increas   one also report that the pace of contract in their industri busi had slow signific  though client firm remain deepli cautious about expand even temporari workforc   we also learn that the manpow survey of hire intent  which will be

thank you  mr  chairman   our district continu to present the mix pictur i   ve report at recent meet  though it may be a littl less mix this  e than earlier   there are some posit develop   sale of nondur good and servic were actual up a bit in april  they increas at a somewhat more rapid rate   tourist activ in the earli part of the holiday season and the summer season along the north and south  ina coast has been strong   the new panda at the nation zoo up the street are bring an even larger number of peopl into washington than is normal the case at this  e of the year  overal though  i would say that the situat  sn   t look so good   automobil and other durabl good sale  sale of big ticket item  have been quit soft pretti much across our region   manufactur activ weaken sharpli further in april and in other recent month  accord to the report we get   furnitur manufactur is a big industri in our district  as i   ve          said mani  e befor  and it is veri weak   moreov  almost all the comment i hear from    peopl in that busi  and i get a lot of inform from that industri  are quit pessimist about the outlook   labor market have soften in our district as elsewher   and we are see rise vacanc rate in the offic sector  especi in northern virginia   i gather that   s also happen in some other part of the countri  and we certain see it in our region   so on balanc  i would say that condit in our district are notic weaker than at the  e of our march meet   and general i think attitud and confid  especi among our busi contact  are signific weaker   a coupl of month ago peopl thought   yes  there   s a big slowdown and it   s go to take a coupl of month to get out of it  but by the  e we get to the second half of the year thing are go to be move up   we don   t hear that view much anymor  we survey approxim    firm in our district across a broad rang of manufactur and servic industri about their capit spend plan   as elsewher  compani are cut back on these plan   where invest is go forward  often it   s becaus of stiffer environment regul rather than an improv econom outlook and more op  about the futur  i   ve mention the weak in manufactur in our district  and i have to tell you that i   m becom increas concern about what i read and hear regard the weak in manufactur nation    like other  i was encourag by the progress in the automobil industri   it appear that the situat in that sector was improv and inventori were be brought under control   but as the  book point out  quit clear there is a signific overhang in a wide rang of other manufactur industri  especi high tech and other equip manufactur   the prospect of correct this overhang ani  e soon strike me as          not terribl good   spend on equip  of cours  declin in the first quarter for the second    consecut quarter   as     note  the latest data on new order suggest that we   ll have anoth declin not onli in the growth rate of such spend but in the actual level of expenditur   also  i was struck by the mention in the  book of the purchas manag    diffus index for manufactur    expect capit spend   accord to the  book  that   s now at it lowest level sinc may       which was not a veri good month   it was the bottom of the deepest recess in the postwar period  so that particular statist realli got my attent  all in all  i don   t think there   s a lot of evid yet that the contract in manufactur is bottom out   some peopl appar have a differ view   but from my perspect at least  especi at the district level but also on the basi of what i read about manufactur nation  i don   t see much evid that it   s bottom out   more import though  as you point out     the sharp drop in overal payrol employ and the breadth of that drop across sector and industri of the economi rais the prospect that the weak in manufactur is now spread to other sector of the economi  so  like bob parri  i think the downsid risk in the current situat is substanti   of cours  we   ve had some good news late  the retail sale figur for april was better than expect and equiti market have stabil   that to me suggest that the soft is be contain  at least to some extent   we   re not in a free fall   and i think that   s probabl becaus of the aggress action we   ve taken with monetari polici   but in that context i think we need to recogn and keep in mind that the reason we have been free to move as swift and aggress as we have is that we   ve built up a substanti amount of credibl for low inflat in recent year   and i think it   s precis at  e like these that the valu of anchor inflat          expect is most evid   with this in mind  we need to be care not to let our credibl    and the sooth effect it has had on inflat expect  to date at least  fool us into eas polici too much   we   re alreadi see some warn sign   long term treasuri rate have move up by near     point sinc the march fomc meet  despit the further eas we   ve put in place   that rise in long rate probabl reflect some increas in financi market expect of stronger growth in the economi  as we have observ alreadi   but the evid from index bond rate suggest that inflat expect may have increas recent   either way  the market is tell us  i think  that we   re at risk of overdo it  boil this all down  what it suggest to me is that we need to eas further today but we need to do it in the context of a clear vision of where we   re go   jerri jordan   s comment on this reson with me   we need to think about the ul  end of this process  what the end game is  so to speak   i hope we can return to this point when we discuss polici later   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as best we can judg  econom activ in our southeast region has not chang materi sinc our march meet   a general sens of caution and uneasi about the yet to be seen sign of improv probabl best character the sen ent about the economi   overal growth in the region continu to be underpin by our largest and strongest economi  georgia and florida   but even there  recent state revenu data suggest some soften in activ   as elsewher  subpar perform in manufactur continu  with some further employ reduct   our region auto industri  includ our now signific number of assembl and part supplier  is deal with a slow april after have experienc relat more strength in earlier month of the year              we  too  made a special effort again this month to probe  through our director  the strength of invest spend   the clear messag is that it remain larg sidelin   a privat breakfast meet i had with the ceo of the larg  drove home for me how busi execut are think and behav   that ceo told me he simpli was sit on sever larg and veri strateg invest spend propos that were on his desk   they involv spend for long term infrastructur that the compani will clear need  but he just wasn   t go to turn them loos right now   he went on to say that a year ago he would have gone ahead with that spend without ani hesit   general  what we   re be told about invest spend is that it   s not be postpon while wait for further interest rate reduct but rather for sign that past rate reduct and other adjust will reviv demand   as one director explain  peopl are simpli say     show me the order     consum spend has post onli sluggish growth  but we   re not hear ani substanti concern about inventori at the retail level   and our banker  while continu to worri about addit syndic credit  are not report ani new concern about consum credit qualiti  homebuild continu to be one of the big engin of econom activ in our region    a recent report show that the        build permit issu in the atlanta msa in the first quarter eclips by more than       the next largest permit growth among msas around the countri   and residenti construct so far has remain relat strong   have said that  and despit the fact that the inventori of unsold home has not risen materi  we are now hear some concern about a falloff at the high end of the market   in south florida  real estat market          are be buoy by the influx of buyer from argentina and columbia who are come to the    unit state becaus of fear of econom turmoil and or polit instabl in their home countri   those immigr repres signific drain of both human and financi capit from those two countri  in commerci real estat  the level of specul activ remain low   we   re also see some pressur on the offic space market  some space has been turn back as compani tighten their belt   more than   million squar feet of space have report come back on the market recent in the atlanta area alon   a larg nation commerci real estat broker and leas agent with a region headquart in atlanta report that sever larg custom recent just call off their search for addit space   and the lead partner in that real estat firm told me that despit his own firm   s recent merger and their need for more space  he has decid to hunker down and make do with exist space for a while  our import tourism industri remain reason upbeat  but our contact are report some slowdown in busi travel and some concern that futur book may be flat and not suffici to fill the substanti new capac brought on in recent year  the pictur is obvious bright for our energi sector  but a larg major of the rig at work are engag in natur gas explor and extract rather than oil drill   interest  the support busi of the oil and gas industri do not seem to be share fulli in the energi boom sinc new explor and extract process are more effici and less labor intens and  therefor  can do more with less  final at the region level  labor market have continu to loosen and price inflat remain subdu with except in a few area  includ nurs    salari  pharmaceut  and health and insur cost general  area we have heard about befor              at the nation level  like other  i continu to push off until later in the year ani signific turnaround and i now anticip a longer than expect period of veri slow growth  in addit to the inventori correct that still continu in some sector and the dramat invest funk that show no sign of turn around quick  we   re now see an employ slowdown  and it implic for consum spend are of concern   of cours the flip side is that the accumul postpon of spend must be build a grow amount of pent up demand  which will show itself at some point   inde  most of our forecast as well as those of other outsid the fed look for a signific pickup late this year and earli next year   and sure the veri substanti and veri aggress eas that we   ve put in place over the last four month will help to fuel that rebound   despit our continu skeptic about whether fiscal polici action can be  e to contribut to addit s ulus at the right  e  that still appear to be at least a possibl  i think one has to conclud that the near term downsid risk remain signific and probabl have increas margin sinc our last full meet  and the  book simul did a nice job of help us to think about those risk   nevertheless  there seem to be littl disagr in the forecast about the like path beyond the next coupl of quarter   while our longer term inflat forecast have not been anyth to brag about  and i recogn that inflat is not mani peopl   s chief worri at the moment  i think we may soon find ourselv back to a more balanc set of risk   to be sure  the prospect for extern shock persist   core inflat by mani measur has continu to drift up and  given the liquid that has been inject into the financi system sinc the first of the year  we may well have to give more weight to inflat risk as we contempl our next polici move   clear  there are argument for still anoth aggress eas move today  but a case can also be made that it might be the          right  e to make our next eas move more measur and more modest   and at least for the    moment  i am in that latter camp   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the outlook for our region economi sinc march   econom activ continu to edg up overal and manufactur activ is still declin   our busi outlook survey for may  which will be releas this thursday  show littl chang from april  with the diffus indic of general activ and new order still show small negat   manufactur were continu to cut inventori in may and more firm report declin in employ and hour work than increas  our may survey includ a special question about firm    capit spend plan  thirti five percent of the manufactur we survey said that they plan to reduc capit spend this year     percent indic    by a signific amount      fifteen percent report that they had rais plan capit spend sinc the begin of the year  but for most not by a signific amount   go forward  more firm report that over the next six month they plan to increas capit spend from the current reduc level than to decreas spend   this is a slight improv sinc april when the firm were more even split between increas and decreas spend in the six month from the survey date   inde  most of the indic of futur manufactur activ in our survey pick up somewhat in may  retail in our district have express some concern about their sale go forward  they report some decreas in foot traffic at the mall in the region   april sale look slight better than march sale  but inventori have continu to rise and retail are reduc their plan for inventori over the balanc of the year              the construct sector has been one of the area of strength in our region   residenti real estat activ is fair strong   construct activ of all kind continu at a high rate  as   employ growth  at least through march  the most recent month for which we have data  given the sharp declin in nation payrol employ in april  the region   s overal employ pictur is like to worsen in the near term  turn to the nation  the economi appear to be in a more fragil condit than we thought it would be by this  e   it turn out that the first quarter came in a bit stronger than we had expect  but econom activ is like to be weaker in the second quarter   the most recent data suggest that retail sale and residenti real estat seem to be hold up fair well   and the mid may read of consum sen ent were up   but those posit sign must be weigh against april   s employ report  which indic weak across mani sector   in januari i said that the one question we were face was whether the economi in      would behav more like the economi of      or the economi of        prior to the april employ report  i would have said that the economi in      would resembl that in        but the most recent news on the labor market   rais the specter that the economi   s perform will be more like that in       in our second quarter survey of profession forecast  which is schedul to be releas next week  on averag respond to our special question about the likelihood of a recess put the probabl that the economi will fall into recess this year at    percent and next year at    percent   the employ report make it hard to argu that the inventori correct is over   the strong drop in employ suggest that firm plan further cut in product to bring down inventori   if consum spend hold up  then this correct could          be finish relat quick   but how confid can we feel that the consum  face    deterior job prospect  will continu to spend  that said  i think the committe has act appropri to forestal bad outcom  we   ve cut the fed fund rate     basi point this year   that drop in rate was aggress but not over so  in my opinion   inde  a philadelphia staff analysi suggest that the fomc   s recent behavior is consist with it behavior in the past   we have lower the fund rate substanti but that is a reflect of the speed with which the econom outlook and es  of the output gap have deterior sinc the begin of the year  not a reflect of more aggress action than usual by the committe in reaction to develop   in assess the economi   s outlook  howev  we must rememb the mantra of     long and variabl lag      analysi and experi suggest that we should onli now be expect to see the initi impact on the real economi of the interest rate reduct that we made at the begin of the year   we need to rememb  and we need to remind the public  that we will like get sever month of weak econom data even after the committe has stop reduc rate   we also need to rememb that the fed   s long term goal is price stabil   i   ve becom increas troubl by the slow upcreep in most measur of inflat over the past few year  it has occur despit the strong upward trend in product growth   those measur may reflect nascent sign of inflat becom a concern  as short term interest rate have fallen  long term rate have increas   the steep in corpor and treasuri yield curv suggest either that market particip are begin to have some concern about inflat or that they view the current period of econom weak as like to be short live   either way  it suggest that the committe need to be more cautious go forward and even more awar than usual of the need to balanc concern about near term econom weak against the longer term goal of contain inflationari pressur
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   the latest evid and anecdot inform suggest that the district   s economi is not terribl differ from what we   ve been hear for some  e  nor   it differ from the situat the nation statist have depict  the pictur is rather mix   the manufactur sector continu to contract   labor market condit appear to be eas and  as one look around the citi and the countrysid  the preval of help want sign has clear diminish   on the other hand  construct activ  both residenti and nonresidenti  remain strong   if anyth  it has probabl pick up a bit recent  with the announc of anoth major project or two in the twin citi metropolitan area   consum spend appear to be grow modest   the agricultur sector also would be describ as mix  depend on weather and  of cours  on price   in fact  it may be a littl better than i would have expect becaus we are hear scatter report of some pickup in capit spend by produc  they are buy new equip such as pickup truck and so forth  and  of cours  the energi sector has benefit from higher price  as far as the nation is concern  my view of the prospect for the nation economi is rough similar to that of the  book   i think the next coupl of quarter will be slow as busi firm continu to work through the inventori correct process   after that  i would expect a gradual improv in the rate of growth but certain no sharp acceler  as best i can judg the outlook at the moment   if this pattern materi  i would expect the unemploy rate to continu to move up gradual   and my view of the outlook for inflat is that it could well stabil  with consum price inflat in the neighborhood of       percent and the pce a littl below that              i think the risk at this stage are rough equal balanc   i say that becaus i don   t consid the outlook all that ebulli and it   s not difficult to imagin it be better than my forecast   on the other hand  i do believ there is some risk that we may encount more inflat than i  at least  expect and hope for   in the short run  my concern are focus on my read of the compens and eci data for the last coupl of year   but in the longer run  it   s realli go to depend on what polici we pursu   have said that  i   ll resist the temptat to say anyth further about polici until later
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the overal messag from the eighth district is flat  flat  flat   hous remain on the strong side and manufactur on the weak side   no dramat chang in either direct   bank loan demand  depend on which banker one talk to  is either up a littl or down a littl   the banker do say that lend standard are be tighten modest  to some extent in respons to pressur from regul   but they are tighten them on their own as well  my contact at                                       busi is run about    percent below a year ago   on a year over year basi  april was down   percent and may so far was down    percent  shipment of high tech item                                of comput compon  and auto part have been particular weak   the ground busi is up  the compani   s custom seem to be substitut ground shipment for air express becaus of the lower cost   as for intern busi  u s  outbound shipment are now negat year over year and inbound shipment are veri low but still show posit growth   european busi seem to be hold up fair well but asian busi was especi weak                     ad surcharg becaus of increas cost    of cours  are face with higher wage for pilot and mechan as well as          higher cost for fuel   so  both compani are experienc signific cost increas along with    the declin in the level of busi  the overal reaction                                    was one of surpris about how weak thing are   his firm had expect some resurg but that  sn   t seem to be take place  point out that he had been with the compani for    year and despit all that experi he feel veri surpris and concern about the situat face   again  there are a lot of cost pressur  pilot  mechan  fuel  and a declin level of busi   probabl the best evid of the                       the situat is that the compani is realli veri much in a hunker down mode   it has defer deliveri of two new aircraft out of    that were on order and plan to park four older aircraft and take them offlin until they are need   he point out that a buyer probabl can get a good deal from boe now becaus a lot of passeng airlin are also defer or cancel order   in term of it manag of the cut back employ  the compani has a hire freez and is not fill vacant posit  capit expenditur are down   special project of all sort are be delay or on hold  manag have tighten up on  corpor travel and travel onli on urgent need   as my contact put it  they are tighten the belt across the board  expens account  reloc  and all those adjust that compani make when they experi a lot of pressur on profit  the stori from                                      was quit differ                            see problem in find good sale associ  for exampl   turnov is down signific  perhap becaus of the softer labor market  but the compani is still encount some labor market pressur   my contact said he found current demand condit confus  not consist with the usual kind of recess or downturn pattern   in particular  the averag size of a sale ticket is up   to   percent from a year ago and the split between what they call discretionari and nondiscretionari          expenditur is about unchang   nondiscretionari item would be thing like toilet paper and    diaper  i suppos  and discretionari item would be applianc and thing like that   when peopl are under a lot of pressur  it   s the discretionari purchas that get squeez out  veri close and has seen no chang in that split   my contact see the data as suggest that the situat is not get wors and is perhap slight better   what they see in their store   not correspond with the veri weak employ report that we got  consum behavior  sn   t seem to match that   he said that the compani is debat whether to ratchet up order a bit to reduc the frequenc of out of stock situat in certain good they sell   they regard inventori as in veri good shape  that   s not an issu   price pressur are minim   they just price off the cost of good  and vendor price has remain veri well control   he did mention energi cost   of cours  everybodi is affect by those cost  on the nation economi  let me tri to make a coupl analyt point   i think the downsid risk are veri obvious  but somehow it seem to me that the upsid risk are not quit so obvious   so i want to talk about the upsid risk  not as a certainti but as a possibl   i believ the staff forecast make a lot of sens as a point es   but it is subject to risk in both direct and i want to discuss the upsid risk  we   re all uncertain about the economi   s potenti growth   the board   s staff has mark down it es  of potenti growth a littl  but we know that that number is subject to a great deal of uncertainti   if it turn out that potenti growth is less than our current best guess  we could find ourselv press a lot of monetari s ulus into an economi that  sn   t realli have the potenti to produc good at that rate   that s in term of the growth rate   in term of the level at which the economi is oper  certain five year ago we would not have es  that       percent unemploy was abov the natur rate  and we might still not want to make          that es    it may be that the labor market is in the process of converg to an equilibrium    rate of unemploy that is  given the structur of the labor market  even higher than the current rate   and if we tri to press  we   re just go to get more inflat out of that situat and not  at the end of the day  more employ  i think the output mix is clear chang   we   re probabl go to see less invest  perhap for some  e to come  in the high tech part of the economi and a lot more invest in the energi produc area of the economi   we know  for exampl  that a lot of new electr generat project are under way  and for veri good reason  except in texa  i gather  which has excess capac   and coal is at capac   i mean by that not onli coal mine but coal miner and coal transport   the chairman of our board run a larg electr util  he say that typic they tri to burn coal at night to save natur gas  which is much more expens  in run the turbin   but coal is in such short suppli that they   re even burn natur gas at night   there is no avail rail capac to ship more coal from wyom to the midwest at the moment  it   s run just flat out   so there   s go to be a lot more invest over  e in that area and probabl less invest in some of the high tech area   the chang in the mix and the fact that there is a depress  if you will  in the high tech area is not someth that monetari polici can do anyth about   that   s a real adjust that is go to have to take place over  e   and if we press hard becaus of all the stori about the dell and compaq and the dot com that are suffer hard  e  at the end of the day we   re not go to get more output out of those firm  i think that   s all i want to say at this point   my view is that we   ve got to be care that the monetari s ulus  sn   t spill over into price   sever other have comment to that effect          alreadi and i think that   s a critic issu   if that should happen  our situat is go to be much    more complic a year or two out   thank you
thank you   coffe is avail and i think it would be reason to recess at this stage

thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve been say for some  e that new england was not experienc the depth of the nation slowdown   this was occur  i thought  for a varieti of reason  industri mix  the extrem tight of region labor market  and even what turn out to be a power impact of a great ski season on local tourism  just to name three   it now appear  howev  that new england is begin to catch up  or is that catch down   with the rest of the countri  though in general the region continu to experi somewhat less soften than the nation as a whole  employ growth continu to slow in new england and the unemploy rate has risen sinc the march open market committe meet   howev  the rate remain well below that for the nation   and connecticut  with an unemploy rate of     percent  again record the lowest unemploy in the countri   inde  the recent soften in the region labor market was welcom by mani contact and was seen as a whole new ballgam for hire need staff   one connecticut manufactur said that potenti hire are now behav in a more normal way  that is  not hold out for a bmw or other sign bonus   manufactur is the onli sector cut job in new england and  unlik the nation  busi servic in our area continu to expand  although at a slower rate than earlier   within manufactur  industri in which new england has a tradit concentr  industri machineri and electr          equip  have slow mark in the nation as a whole but not so much in the region     inde  in massachusett these industri are still expand  look forward  howev  the region   s increas concentr of inform technolog compani  softwar busi  and particular telecommun and internet  relat industri   not bode well for a continu of the region   s compar good fortun  depend on the extent and depth of retrench in technolog spend nationwid  new england  and especi boston  may well experi an increas sever in their downturn  clear  this is the region   s largest area of vulner and uncertainti  busi confid in general drop in april to a level not seen sinc       after recov some ground in march   the index  howev  is sharpli divid between current and futur sen ent   the current index is below     indic a negat assess  while the index for condit six month ahead  though lower than in march  has remain abov     most of the manufactur contact for the beig book are cut or postpon capit spend project  especi plan expans of capac   howev  in research and develop  expenditur are be stretch out  not elimin   belt tighten  either in the face of declin busi or simpli in anticip of it  seem to be the order of the day  consum confid also drop in april and is now much lower than it was a year ago   and unlik the view of busi execut  consum see the current situat as relat posit  probabl becaus of a continu strong job pictur  but the futur has not look as bleak to them sinc the earli      s   retail sale in the region seem to have flatten out in recent month and retail are cautious about the futur   in this relat high incom region  concern was express about the negat wealth effect of lower stock market valu  but retail did see continu support from new england   s relat low unemploy level              in short  while busi may be hold off on spend  household may continu to be a sourc of strength in new england   the potenti for this is clearest in the hous market   here price continu to rise at rate abov those of the nation   all six state experienc such increas  while a year ago three of the six lag behind the nation rate  beig book contact saw region real estat market as strong in april  and inventori seem to be a constraint  not weak in demand   inde  the rise in consum price  as reflect by the boston area   s cpi  remain well abov the nation rate  larg becaus of increas in the hous portion of the index  sinc our march fomc meet  we at the bank have held a meet of our academ advisori council and a seri of meet with banker in the region  along with our usual director    meet   the academ were  with few except  surpris unfaz by the current slowdown   they saw some resili in the consum and some likelihood that busi capit spend might resum sooner rather than later  given the continu pace of technolog chang   a few saw inflat concern on the horizon but the major agre that the risk remain a bit on the down side   it was hard to see ani sign of slowdown from the report we heard in our meet with banker   small bank in the region continu to benefit from the strong ski season  strong mortgag refinanc  vibrant hous market  and good prospect for the summer season   in fact  one banker with the region   s largest beer distributor as a custom note that in  e of serious econom problem  beer drinker typic move down the food chain from expens import like heineken to bud or even genese    laughter   in that regard  he report that case of heineken still fli off the distributor    shelv  let me turn to the nation data and the  book project   they should give heineken distributor and drinker some paus   our project are quit similar to those of the           book  a slow second quarter  hope abov a negat number but like below   percent    growth  a slower second half than we had earlier project  and stronger growth in       though below our earlier expect   our es  of the economi   s potenti remain a bit below that of the  book  though less so sinc the  book   s downward revis in near term structur product growth   thus  our unemploy es  tick up a bit less than the  book   s  under an assumpt of unchang polici  and the cpi move sideway  it   s also clear that the risk remain predomin on the down side   the length and depth of the downturn in technolog spend and the relat technolog invest overhang remain extrem uncertain   rise unemploy and sideway stock market cannot help but affect consum spend   and the foreign pictur is increas negat as well   thus some further polici eas may well be necessari   but like other  i also believ it is  e for serious reflect on the pace and size of polici eas  a consider of how much is too much   i think this for at least three reason   first  inflat is not dead   recent data clear are driven by energi cost  but the energi situat  sn   t show sign of go away soon   in the near term such cost  along with rise benefit cost  may simpli bode ill for profit margin and contribut to rise unemploy and lower stock market price   in the medium term  howev  nine month to a year out  if demand acceler more than project  inflat rise from it current level may well be an issu   inde  the recent steepen of yield curv may reflect some rise in inflat expect  though i realiz that is by no mean clear  second  even if higher inflat is not a concern  financi market excess should be  as we saw in      and in          extend period with interest rate that are arguabl too low for too long or are perceiv to move in onli one direct can produc a predilect for one          way market bet of one sort or the other   concern for the stabil of growth in the period    follow the current slowdown seem to me to argu for some caution now  last but not least  i think the fiscal pictur is a wild card   it has been a while sinc fiscal polici has been avail for use as countercycl tool   the  book   s es  may or may not be right  but with both govern spend increas and tax cut in the mix go forward  i think a measur of uncertainti abound here   let me be veri clear  i don   t disagre with the  book   s assess of current and near term condit   they do seem to be weaker than is op   even recogn that the slowdown the economi is experienc is one that was need   moreov  the slowdown now seem to be hit the economi   s primari sourc of earlier strength the hardest  name high tech invest   and that has a potenti rang of effect that go well beyond spend and perhap into product   but now is also the  e to begin to consid care the environ nine to twelv month out and to reflect on what the level of real interest rate should be to ensur that that environ is a good one  some would argu that it   s easi to revers the final polici move if it seem to be one step too far   i think that is hard to do in part becaus so much of the data we see are backward look  not forward look   it could also be argu that we are one or two move away from go too far   that may be true but  like other  i think the  e has come for caution   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s economi continu to perform rather well  especi in relat to the rest of the nation   it has expand sinc the last report  though it growth has slow somewhat   inflat remain subdu and price pressur actual appear to have eas somewhat   job growth taper off in march but unemploy rate remain at or near cyclic low  edg down to            percent in new york and edg up to     percent in new jersey  or at least in our half of new    jersey   retail sale were describ as somewhat sluggish in april but notic stronger than in march   retail    sell price  merchandis cost  and wage were littl chang  but cost of employe health benefit and util have risen sharpli over the past year   purchas manag note some weaken in busi condit and eas in cost pressur in april  construct and real estat have been mix but remain general buoyant   we had a moder declin in singl famili hous permit in the first quarter but that was more than offset by a surg in the multifamili sector   there has been a bit of soften in manhattan   s apart market but price are still up more than    percent from a year earlier   the new york offic market slacken in the first quarter but demand and leas activ remain fair brisk and space is still said to be in fair short suppli   local bank report widespread increas in demand for home mortgag  further tighten in commerci loan standard  and veri littl chang in delinqu rate  shift out of the second district  let me start with the intern side and then work back to the domest   i think the intern situat is quit worrisom   i veri much share    son   s observ on the subject  but let me add some of my own   fortun  i recent finish the last of my intern trip as    sale manag    for the new basl capit accord  visit four countri in europ about a week or    day ago   although the slowdown in europ   s growth is attribut somewhat to the effect of the slowdown in the unit state  the problem is that way too much blame for the weak in europ is be place on the u s  slowdown   that mean that the author in europ are not do what they should be do in term of improv the structur of their own economi or make appropri polici decis              in japan  yes  we have a possibl of someth differ with the new prime minist  but the new prime minist is talk about use his polit capit to bring about two chang   one is the direct elect of the prime minist  despit the fact that a direct elect of a prime minist in a parliamentari system is a sure formula for even less decis  not more decis  govern action   the second is that he wish to stop call the militari    self defens forc    and to call them what they are  which is an armi  navi  and air forc   that propos is a part of a consider more nationalist approach   one is hear veri littl from the new prime minist about actual fix the economi  which is desper in need of fix   after    year of a problem bank system  the net progress in improv that system round to zero   the level of problem loan is extrem problemat   the possibl of their take aggress action is actual in the talk stage  but it certain   not appear veri like to hit the action stage   the except is that some of the under collater of the most troubl loan may be move into the market in an effort to begin a veri belat clear of the market   it is not easi to be op ist about the situat there   the begin of a slight slowdown in china is report in the most recent data  that is problemat for two reason   one is the effect on china itself   second  especi relat to other countri in asia which compet with china in the export of consum good  the chines are veri capabl of solv their problem at the expens of their neighbor simpli by drop price   they can do that easili and take market share  thus weaken their alreadi weaken neighbor  as   point out veri well  the situat in turkey demand a lot of think  perhap even wish think in term of the success of their formula   it demand a degre of fiscal chang that is veri difficult to imagin take place  even in a countri with a veri strong          govern and a veri disciplin popul  for exampl  that their veri deep bank system    problem are go to be resolv in two year   that is high unlik   so we have a program that is possibl  but veri difficult to find convinc   the situat in argentina is rather similar in that on paper it work  but it demand a degre of polit leadership and polit cohes that also call for a rather creativ imagin  structur  i think our new administr is make the right decis in think that intern problem like those of turkey and argentina should be tackl through the intern institut  particular the intern monetari fund   that is the approach the administr has taken  and i believ correct  in both argentina and turkey   howev  in the last two or three week  senior manag of the intern monetari fund have essenti announc that they are leav  so we have a new manag director whose senior staff colleagu are leav the organ within the next few month   that mean that the key institut in intern problem solv is go to be look for capabl new senior execut and it   s veri difficult to imagin that the qualiti of the replac will be as high as that of the incumb   all of this lead me to believ that the intern situat provid a backdrop of downsid risk for the nation economi  our forecast is rather like that of the  book   we think it   s veri easi to exagger the import of the it workout  which probabl will take sever year   we believ that the rest of the economi can continu restructur and move ahead  and that therefor a recoveri in the latter part of the year  probabl about the fourth quarter and into       is the best forecast   but it certain seem to me that the balanc of risk is immens on the down side              let me just talk about the up side   yes  the economi could snap back fa  than we envis   but if it    we would be abl to spot that quit earli on   i don   t think we would have to wait for the data to see that happen  we could discov it through anecdot evid  and certain if it happen  we know veri well what to do about it   we do not have a credibl problem with respect to this institut and this committe be appropri concern about inflat   nobodi doubt that we   re concern about inflat   so we don   t have to be rais a big flag say we know inflat is a problem becaus everybodi know that we know that   i think they also believ that we know what to do about it   rememb  this is the same fomc that doubl the fed fund rate between februari       and februari         our track record of attack inflat  includ our do so befor it exist in the data  is quit robust   and our resolv to do that is someth that i think the market assum  howev  on the down side  as has been veri clear present in the staff brief  the forecast depend enorm on the willing of the consum to keep spend   yet the histor data indic that if there   s anyth to which consum confid is tie  it is the confid in have a job  hold one   s job  or find a new one easili   and with a rise unemploy rate  it   s not veri difficult to envis that at some stage the consum is go to think this is all too good to be true   it  sn   t have to be quit as dramat as wile e  coyot race furious along thorough op ist until all of a sudden he realiz there   s no ground below him   but it  sn   t take a whole lot of chang in the consum   s view about buy a new car  a new hous  or the item to put in that new hous to produc a veri signific downturn in consum spend   as dave   point out effect in respons to bob parri   s excel question  our model don   t work in assess the effect of a loss of consum confid or a loss of busi confid   and in the current environ the latter is even          greater than the former   the level of busi confid  low as it is  is rather appal   so it    seem to me that the downsid risk are veri consider inde and our abil to model them is low   accord  we will have to watch veri care for sign that the downsid risk is materi  even if we do not judg it likelihood as high  let me talk a bit about the market  which have their headquart in the great citi of new york   one of the reason market particip think that the economi may be a littl better is that they were in such an enorm funk about six week ago that they were thorough convinc that the end of the world would happen between the  st and the   th of april   well  that burst of immatur has been replac by a swing in the opposit direct  which i don   t think tell us a whole lot about what we should read from the market   main what it tell us is that the market is volatil   market particip are tri to figur out where the economi is go   they understand the upsid and downsid risk and they don   t know what is go to happen   so they bounc the market around veri rapid  some  with a lot of volum and some  with veri littl volum   in my view the main messag the market is convey is that it is extrem uncertain   so am i   therefor  i would caution that we should not read more into what the market is tell us than is realli there  in summari  mr  chairman  i think the downsid risk is extrem serious   i hope veri much that it will not materi   but if it    the outcom could be quit grim inde  thank you
when i look across the eleventh district economi for sign that the economi is pick up  i   m hard press to find ani   the bulk of the statist and anecdot suggest an economi whose growth rate is bare percept and not chang   to be sure  there          are pocket of strength  notabl hous and energi   but the rest of the pictur that emerg is    far less encourag   the unemploy rate has been edg up   and initi unemploy claim  togeth with an almost constant drone of layoff announc  portend addit increas in unemploy in the month to come   until recent  most laid off worker were be absorb  but the layoff are current swamp the demand for hire   the rise of job search engin has probabl reduc somewhat the impact of the job turn in this cycl in comparison with previous downturn in labor demand   so  even dure a recess in the high tech sector  inform technolog advanc of recent year may be help to cushion the impact  for texa and the rest of the eleventh district  the first coupl of sentenc of our beig book report summar the situat   our januari beig book was the most pessimist report ever written by the economist who has been work on that document for the last dozen year   this  e she report that econom activ deceler in march and earli april and that contact in most industri expect activ to remain sluggish throughout the year   cut through all the code word  our analysi suggest a no growth region economi in the second  third  and fourth quarter   she also note that    there were more report of price declin than price increas     suggest that the inflationari risk in the month ahead are somewhat minim   the report from mani other district reflect a similar tone  so the dalla district is not an isol exampl  turn to the nation economi  i   m struck by the revers in  book forecast  the staff has been revis down it forecast of econom growth in much the same manner as it was revis them up just a few year ago   i   m also struck by how the progress wors outlook as reflect in the  book is follow the same pattern  with a lag  that appear in          the anecdot inform in the beig book   as i look to the rest of the economi go    forward  i don   t see a lot of room for polici error  given the current state of the economi   we need more eas  and the question is onli one of degre  the intern outlook continu to soften   busi invest continu to weaken   and personnel manag have been stand in the hallway in order to get the pink slip out fa    under the circumst  consum spend is hold up reason well  the hous market is steadi and refinanc have help to offset some other negat factor for household and for invest grade corpor   the impact of our four previous eas should begin to kick in soon  togeth with an expansionari fiscal packag  over the last week or two i had thought that lower rate by anoth     point at this meet would be go     point too far  given what we had alreadi done and the way consumpt spend was hold up   but the  book commentari suggest that consumpt activ might alreadi have start to weaken has caus me to reconsid my reconsider   perhap my strong certainti as to the need and direct of a polici move and my less strong certainti as to the appropri degre of eas suggest a differ type of action this  e   after what we   ve alreadi done  mayb we can have a compromis that would reduc the fed fund rate by more than the discount rate  thus narrow the spread and take a small first step toward make the discount rate a penalti rate
thank you  mr  chairman   in review the incom data and market condit in prepar for this meet i  like other  was struck by the appar disconnect between the marketplac and economist   sinc our march meet  with some zigzag  equiti indic  which are thought to lead the real economi  have in fact experienc          growth of   to   percent  perhap signal an expect turnaround in the not too distant futur     the dollar also has remain strong  again suggest that mani think the unit state is the place for their fund to be   final  fix incom investor are demand return that suggest they have a more op ist assess   and  inde  busi are issu bond to fill their coffer   therefor  one could argu that the market actual are forecast a somewhat brighter outlook than most economist   howev  one must also ask what interest rate assumpt are condit market behavior  and for the answer i think one can turn to the fed fund futur market   that indic suggest that the market are expect a decreas in the fund rate at this meet on the order of    basi point   so if one is look to the financi market for some guidanc on what the futur is like to be  it   s also import to ask what interest rate assumpt are built in  we should contrast this moder more upbeat outlook from the market with our own dour assess  base on what i   ve heard around the tabl   our economist have talk about the reduct in the  book forecast and i   ve heard three or four reserv bank presid suggest that their own forecast have been mark down   it   s alway hard to go against the market  but i think in this case the staff who produc the  book and other economist probabl have a slight better sens of what is ahead of us   it is tempt to think that the bottom has been reach  but in my view it is far too earli to have much of a convict that the bottom is at hand or that the futur is clear   therefor  i find the  book quit credibl and i believ the downsid risk describ in the  book should not be taken light  incom data seem to indic that the econom weak that start with motor vehicl is now relat widespread   although motor vehicl product now appear to be hold up  there is inde a risk that product in that sector will fall back later this year if          sale do not pick up   but it also appear that the output of high tech industri and product in    the remain sector of the manufactur industri continu to be restrain by excess inventori   inde  the inventori shipment ratio is up for manufactur overal   this weak in manufactur in turn is hold down capit spend and capac growth  both current and probabl for next year as well   as long as busi are suffer from what is call a classic profit recess and they continu to withhold plan to increas capit spend  the onli engin of growth seem to be consum   the most recent retail sale number  with downward revis to februari and march  suggest that consum may well pull in their horn a bit too  in respons to the wealth destruct they   ve alreadi experienc and the drumbeat of unemploy announc that they are hear  by my es   the risk around the  book forecast is also clear to the down side   with an economi grow  and like to continu to grow far below it potenti  the risk of a shock  be it domest or intern  push the economi into negat territori is  for my tast  uncomfort high   we cannot rule out a wors outcom than the baselin forecast  perhap one approxim the    weak household demand    scenario describ in the  book  given this outlook and the risk i believ we face  the obvious question is   what is the proper polici respons   in answer that question  we should be clear about what we are tri to do and what we are not tri to do   we   re not tri to stabil unemploy at unsustain low level   nor in fact are we tri to speed up the invest acceler  becaus i don   t think we can do that   the most i believ we can do is to cushion the economi to allow busi plan to gel more firm and to maintain some semblanc of consum confid  while i recogn that we have move aggress and have front load our action  i think we should not slow our pace of eas move at this meet   we must alway act in the          context of our long term goal of price stabil   but i do not believ that there is a veri great risk    of an unmanag outbreak of inflat dure the relev polici horizon   inde  as i look at market expect and various survey  the market in general are tell us that they also don   t expect inflat to pick up to unmanag level in the near term   howev  we do need to have some guid or anchor and in that regard  like jerri jordan  i found the chart in the bluebook veri  veri help   what that chart suggest is that with inflat expect anchor around   percent  the current real interest rate is probabl just about neutral   given my outlook  which is not too dissimilar from the  book   s  and the balanc of risk that i see  i think we should be will to move to a slight s ul stanc of polici at this meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   earlier in the year  there were various indic that the economi could have been on a sharp downward slide   by this  e  we   re probabl past the  e of greatest risk  but the economi is still in a veri fragil state   the high tech sector is in a state of over capac  with pc sale down  communic order down  and fiber optic equip sale down   overal industri product is down  capac util rate are at    year low  and inventori outsid of transport and high tech are build up  as yet  consumpt has not drop much and the person save rate is still negat   the baselin forecast has person save turn around  in which case the growth of consumpt is like to soften   the scare stori may be over and there are certain point of strength  but the domest economi is still in a veri fragil state  i   d like to join bill   in talk about the intern economi  but i want to focus on the relat healthi economi   there is a haunt similar between what is          go on in this countri and what is happen in the euro zone countri  canada  and the    unit kingdom   each countri is in the midst of a signific inventori correct   industri product is drop  there may be a capit overhang  and busi and consum confid is off   in each countri the forecast is pretti much the same   excess inventori will be work off  the capit overhang will be work off  and growth will resum   but what if that  sn   t happen   what if some countri cannot quit achiev the growth toehold and then drag other down   and this stori refer onli to the healthi economi   the outlook  as you   ve heard  is much more problemat for countri like japan  argentina  turkey  and the high tech export of southeast asia   again  the messag is not necessarili one of overwhelm weak  but rather one of fragil and signific downsid risk  on the other side of the ledger  sinc the start of the year the fomc has alreadi lower the fund rate by     basi point   isn   t that enough   not necessarili  that depend on where the fund rate was when we began lower it   it is easi to fall into the trap of think about polici in term of chang and not level   in that connect  i   d like to join sever other in refer to the bluebook analysi show the real fund rate in comparison to a number of altern measur   as compar to the long term histor averag  the real fund rate right now is just bare below this benchmark   as compar to a forward look tax adjust measur of expect futur fund rate  the margin is greater   the same is true in comparison with a number of indic design to measur the full employ fund rate deriv from model simul   the basic messag i take from that is that even though we have lower the fund rate a lot  in real term monetari polici is not yet lean against a recessionari wind by all that much   in view of the risk mention abov  a further downward adjust could certain be justifi              one arriv at the same conclus from the  book model simul   the baselin case assum a reduc fund rate at this meet and still has unemploy rise to     percent at the end of this year and to       percent at the end of next year   these unemploy rate are well abov the rate necessari to control inflat  in my view   the simul use the feder fund futur path arriv at essenti the same result   those simul have built into them a reason strong respons of spend to interest rate chang  contrari to mani argument we   re hear that question that respons   the lesson i would take from these simul as well is that there is still a strong case for monetari polici eas  on the inflat side  as everybodi is well awar  the news has not been veri good  energi price have risen sharpli and various measur of core inflat have risen slight  perhap reflect difficulti in measur and filter out the energi price from the overal price index   product is down and unit labor cost are rise more rapid  again perhap reflect noth more than the drop in capit spend   the tip nomin real spread has risen rather sharpli   but i would still argu that long term inflat risk are basic well contain   commod price are stabl to down   inflat expect in the michigan and philadelphia survey are stabl   the blue chip forecast are anticip a slight dip in inflat  as is the  book   inflat measur in other countri are stabl  well within the target zone for inflat in canada and the unit kingdom  and for core inflat at least in the euro zone   there is still deflat in japan   one can never be sure  but on the whole i would say that the inflat pattern we are observ is a seri of blip larg relat to energi price and not a damag trend              my bottom line is that i am awar that we can   t forev keep on eas monetari polici in larg step   i   m awar that if we get the real fund rate too low we will have to rais it again at some point   i   m awar that measur core inflat has crept up   but it also seem to me that the economi  both domest and intern  is current in a veri tenuous state  with still signific downsid risk   both from a short term and a longer term perspect  i think we can safe lean harder against these recessionari wind
thank you  mr  chairman   are we beyond the crisi stage of our deep slowdown and are we now enter a firm and turn period   much of the market   s recent action and sen ent indic that that is like the case   and certain if increas difficulti in arriv at a firm convict about monetari polici is symptomat of a sea chang  then i  along with bob    probabl am an indic that we are there   i hope and cautious believ that that is the case and that the economi is bottom out   recent incom data suggest that it is   last week initi claim fell   april retail sale were robust   consum sen ent show an improv   both headlin and core cpi are move upward omin  possibl suggest renew strength in the economi   the inventori correct seem well advanc   our high tech problem look to me more and more like anoth episod of sector roll recess that we have often seen befor in industri such as energi  construct  defens  agricultur  auto  and other   they seldom drag down the entir economi by themselv  so  thing are start to look better   but a closer inspect reveal that much of this news is quit tenuous   initi claim are a help but volatil seri  and we have onli one favor week to go on   obvious  we   ll need much more to know if the rise pattern is          revers   and with unemploy like to go higher  that seem question   april   s strong    retail sale were accompani by downward revis to previous month   stronger consum sen ent need a lot of confirm   while the cpi is rise  the pce and other price seri are not   and while a great deal of inventori reduct is take place  inventori sale ratio are still veri high in mani sector  as for the roll recess in the high tech sector  it could prove to be more troublesom than most of it predecessor   it is occur simultan with a number of other problem and imbal in the economi includ  in addit to the concern alreadi mention abov  record household debt burden  over invest by busi firm and over  spend by consum  higher energi price  a bear market for stock  and a worldwid slowdown   can all this be handl at the same  e that our most dynam sector of recent year is go through it own roll recess   it is a concern   possibl fiscal and certain monetari polici could help provid the need extra boost to pull us through to renew growth  to sum up  mr  chairman  i believ we are win  but the fat ladi has not yet sung  i suggest we would be well advis to keep the eas pressur on now  hope this is the last  e it is necessari to do so aggress  and then we will be free to focus more clear on price level stabil in futur period
thank you  mr  chairman   my view of the outlook are veri consist with both the qualit stori and the general detail of the  book forecast  relat to that forecast  the risk in my view have becom more balanc   i also share the view that sever other have express today  that given that forecast  we   re approach the point where it would be appropri to becom much more cautious about further eas              in the near term  the negat wealth effect and the retrench in high tech invest appear almost certain to be signific drag on the economi   as a result  growth look like to remain veri weak in the second and third quarter and then to gradual  and onli gradual  move back toward trend   the prospect for a gradual improv reflect in part the s ulus expect  but not yet evid  from the aggress eas move over the first part of this year   clear  there are still downsid risk  we have approach the point where we also have to pay more attent to the upsid risk   that may seem odd given that so much of the rise in the unemploy rate in this episod may still lie ahead of us   but the decis to move aggress toward s ulus in    basi point increment  and includ two intermeet move  mean that we may also need to end the eas sooner   inde  we may get to the point where we have put in place an appropri degre of s ulus even befor much of the effect of that s ulus becom evid  the modest rise in core inflat and the upward adjust to the staff   s inflat forecast support this assess   these develop confirm  in my view  that inflat risk were inde build befor the economi slow so sharpli   in addit  these develop point to what might lie on the other side of recoveri   after recess  the buildup in slack often allow a period of disinfl dure the earli cyclic rebound and  at the veri least  a consider period befor concern about rise inflat surfac   the slowdown in this case began in my view with output abov potenti and growth in demand abov the rate of growth of potenti suppli   in the  book forecast the slowdown under way result in output fall below potenti  but not veri far below  by the  e growth return to it potenti rate some  in        inde  in the  book forecast  the unemploy rate rise to about the level of the staff   s es  of the long run nairu in       with the staff   s es  of the short run nairu          lag behind  but not veri far behind  and still converg with the long run nairu   at ani    rate  more so than in most cyclic downturn  there is potenti for overshoot  let me conclud with a few comment on the role of the product assumpt in the  book forecast   we have new data   the staff revis the es  for      go forward  and the project now suggest that structur product growth stabil in      after ratchet higher over each of the preced eight or so year   the continu rise in structur product growth in earlier year renew each year the temporari bonus associ with rise structur product growth  specif  the s ulus to aggreg demand and the restraint on inflat   the appar stabil in structur product growth in      may  therefor  have contribut at the margin to both a weaken in aggreg demand and to the upward pressur on inflat  the second featur of the product stori is the declin in structur product growth that the staff now project for this year and next year   just as the staff was quick to revis upward it es  of structur product growth in respons to revis data and prospect for capit deepen  they   ve been quick to revis it lower   assum the staff has that right  the declin in structur product growth could also reinforc both the downdraft on aggreg demand and contribut to upward pressur on inflat
thank you   don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman  by some measur  the committe   s cumul eas of     basi point this year has alreadi made monetari polici accommod   the bluebook highlight one way to calibr that judgment  the level of the real feder fund rate relat to an es  of it equilibrium valu   the real fund rate is as low as it has been sinc mid       and it is at the lower end of a rang of plausibl es  of it equilibrium level   but it has onli veri recent dip into or toward that accommod zone   the fund rate was restrict late last year  and a portion of it subsequ declin was need to keep up with             decreas in the equilibrium rate owe to lower product growth and higher equiti premium   the eas of polici is show up in other way in financi market  although nomin yield on longer term treasuri note and bond have risen a bit this year  longer term borrow cost for mani privat borrow have drop appreci as credit spread have narrow  and these cost have fallen sharpli in real term if inflat expect have increas by anyth like the amount suggest by the widen spread between nomin and real yield in the treasuri market   favor condit in bond market have s ul a larg volum of issuanc  provid altern sourc of fund for those busi face constraint on the avail of credit in the commerci paper market and  more broad  facilit a strengthen of corpor balanc sheet   and the shift toward polici accommod has been associ with a consider buildup in liquid on household balanc sheet  judg from the sustain surg in the growth of m    but these financi condit do emb expect of a further eas of polici   moreov  the movement of some asset price  in particular the declin in equiti price of   percent this year and the rise in the dollar of around   percent  have offset a portion of the effect of monetari eas  reduc the amount of financi s ulus in the pipelin  and  the  book and dave   s brief identifi a number of forc that are quit like to be damp the expans of aggreg demand relat to the growth of the economi   s potenti  work against the natur tendenc for the economi to respond to relat easi monetari polici   if the committe  like the staff  see a high probabl that these advers forc will not be dissip veri quick  then a somewhat more accommod polici might well be call for to bol  demand sever quarter out  the  e frame in which polici can have an effect   against this background  the question for the committe today would seem to be how much further polici need to adjust to take account of declin in the equilibrium real rate and to becom accommod enough relat to that rate to fo  satisfactori econom perform over  e   sever factor might be seen as argu for implement a more cautious approach to further eas at this meet  by lower the fund rate    basi point   if product growth and equilibrium real rate remain fair high  polici is alreadi to the accommod side   in that environ  the impuls from previous declin in interest rate  along with the support to incom and profit from continu technic chang  should bol  the rate of expans of consumpt and invest over  e  moreov  the recent uptick in a number of measur of core inflat may tend to support the hypothesi that an unemploy rate around   percent             was perhap too low to be sustain onc product growth level out  judg from market measur of inflat compens  investor do not see the higher unemploy rate that have come about this year as like to produc ani decreas in price pressur   in these circumst it would be import that the economi not snap back so strong that labor and product market begin to tighten again  inde  they may need to slacken further  as in the staff forecast  to avoid a persist intensif of price pressur   that market have built in consider odd of a further    basi point of eas today and some chanc of anoth    basi point declin in the fund rate by year end may be more a comment on percept of your polici strategi than on what particip see as desir to achiev satisfactori econom outcom   market also have built in a percentag point of polici tighten in       appar reflect op  about the resili of the economi   inde  judg by the rise in equiti price and bond yield all around the industri world over the intermeet period  the pessim that has been restrain spend plan may be start to dissip  which would give a further boost to demand   a    basi point eas at this meet like would chang expect about polici in the near term and would rais interest rate along the yield curv somewhat  but in addit  by alter percept of the trajectori of your eas  it could help to damp market reaction to incom data and reduc the risk that market will build in more eas than you would find appropri   even if you suspect that ul  you will need to eas by a full    point but are far from certain  the smaller action would enabl you to accumul more evid about the strength of demand and the respons to earlier eas   if  howev  you believ that the forc hold down demand could well be strong enough to requir a more definit accommod polici for a while  you might go ahead with a    basi point reduct in the fund rate at this meet   the staff forecast would seem to support such an action as it see the unemploy rate rise anoth percentag point even after a    basi point eas today   in that forecast  a relat easi monetari polici is need to counter the effect of an adjust of household and busi spend to the downshift in wealth  incom growth  and the perceiv profit of capit invest  and that adjust is expect to be exert notic restraint over some  e   moreov  if the committe harbor suspicion that the unemploy rate did not need to rise so high to contain inflat     basi point would seem justifi even if you see aggreg demand not quit as weak as in the staff forecast   the committe may be especi inclin to    basi point of eas if it believ that the new found op  in market and the uptick in consum confid could be fragil   with weak in employ             hit household  and with the full dimens of the soft in the demand for certain high tech equip still be incorpor into attitud and spend plan  the committe may prefer the potenti s ulus of a small further ralli in market in respons to a    basi point reduct to the possibl restraint of a backup in interest rate owe to disappoint with a    basi point action   prefer in this regard would seem to be consist with a view that  even after a    basi point eas move  the risk still would be weight toward econom weak  although the    basi point action would put polici more definit into the accommod zone  there is littl concret evid that demand is yet respond appreci to previous eas   with sluggish growth like to be reduc pressur in labor and product market in the period just ahead  inflat should be damp and econom growth below the growth rate of potenti could still be seen as the main risk to satisfactori econom perform   judg from the path of expect fund rate built into market  encompass onli a moder further eas and substanti tighten next year  your aggress polici action seem most to have affect veri short term expect and they have not short circuit the potenti for financi market to stabil the economi as they react to incom inform   henc  if you think    basi point of eas is quit like to be requir  there might be littl gain to adjust the tilt of your action to a more gradual slope just to affect financi market expect  polici action at this meet  particular if you reduc the fund rate    basi point  impli that you will have put in place a veri accommod polici stanc relat quick  rais the risk of polici overshoot   you have  in effect  engag in somewhat forward look policymak   although you wait for definit sign of weak befor you began to eas  you have respond to those sign quit strong  reli more on forecast that the forc at work will persist than on actual output and inflat data to key the cumul size of your move   and  you have continu to eas befor see how the economi was respond to your previous action   front load action  either tighten or eas  should help to stabil the economi  provid the shift in demand or suppli occur as you anticip  or at least polici react    prompt and forc    when circumst chang   it will be especi import to continu to be forward look as polici becom more accommod   you may well need to stop eas even as the economi continu to demonstr sign of soft  and you may need to tighten prompt onc growth show more definit indic of pick up   this would be a differ pattern than polici has often follow in the past  but it would be consist with your action to date and with the argument you have made for a less gradual polici strategi   thank you  mr  chairman
question for don   if not  let me get start  as best we can judg  the declin in industri product  modest though it was in april  occur in the context of a signific rate of inventori liquid in the non high tech area of the economi   inde  rough es  suggest that the rate of liquid in that area continu much as it had proceed sinc earlier in the year   an except obvious is motor vehicl  specif light truck  where there has been some recent backup in inventori after earlier reduct   unlik the experi in what we might call the tradit part of the economi  inventori liquid in the high tech area probabl did not start until veri recent  and it has a long way to go becaus high tech sale clear are still fall   obvious  the extent of further inventori liquid will be signific attenu if growth in final demand start to move up   that  more than inventori liquid  is the effect tool for bring inventori sale ratio down to where they have to be  which mean return them to a path consist with their earlier downtrend   although the ratio actual have risen onli modest abov that trend  they now have a long way to come down   the liquid in the non high tech area like will continu for a number of month  but that in the high tech area will requir a more protract period  fortun  inventori in the high tech area are not that larg a part of total inventori and henc further inventori correct will not constitut a signific drag if busi firm can get the non high tech inventori liquid out of the way  the inventori correct process is the basic stabil forc in this type of economi  if demand hold  then clear  as dave   said  product must start to rise at some point becaus there is a limit to how low inventori can get   inde  in a period when inventori are run off at a veri signific pace  firm tend not to anticip when a sudden need to scrambl          to fill some order will materi   that process i would say has not start  but that   s what we    have to look forward to as the major forc of recoveri in busi activ  the key question is whether this recoveri will start prior to ani further  cumul weaken in the profit and capit invest area   profit expect continu to erod  although the data in the last coupl of week show a lesser declin than in the previous period  nonetheless  it   s veri difficult to know whether we are over analyz a seri such as this  rememb  what is involv is a thousand analyst report their profit expect compani by compani to either ibe or first call  and their report are invari a reflect of what they hear from corpor manag and not a reflect of ani great insight on their part   so  at this stage we don   t know whether the slow in the rate of declin in profit is an indic of some stabil  but it is a precondit for that stabil   if profit expect do not stabil  then it is veri like that the ongo capit good retrench will be far greater than in the  book or in other forecast  despit all the negat thing we hear about capit invest  which is devast in the dot com area and almost as bad in the telecom  the actual level of capit expenditur is still quit high   this mean that the downsid possibl are not small   if we are think sole in term of the way busi cycl have behav in the post world war ii period  then our presumpt is that the potenti extent of downsid adjust will be relat limit  that is  we have not had a realli sever correct in this economi in the post world war ii period  even in        but when we begin to look over a longer histor period  the potenti correct look rather scari   now  such a prospect involv a relat low probabl forecast  but if we are look at loss function in our determin of polici  it weight is realli a lot more in my judgment than i think we have put on the tabl   one of the reason is that  by          ani relev measur  stock market price are still probabl higher than what our model say    would be consist with their fundament determin   the troubl that we have with a stock market declin is that it never stop where the model say it should  it continu lower   implicit in all stabil forecast  and inde that is my forecast  is that stock market price will hold at higher level than the model would expect  larg becaus long term rate of return and product increas are onli veri modest diminish   if we believ that  we also have to say that price earn ratio will tend to remain higher than averag   i believ that  but i   m fulli awar of the fact that it is a forecast  i hope it will occur  but it is still a forecast  the data in may so far are not give us ani realli new insight into the futur cours of the economi   sale of auto and light truck for may are run modest below where they were in april   the weak is entir at domest produc  the big three   import are sell except well this month  as they did last month  and are continu to take market share   that   s not veri help for american product  but it   indic that consum demand is still reason good   and inde the chain store sale data are not bad so far this month   the data releas this week suggest that sale are run better than last month  not a great deal  but they are not go down  which is veri import  my guess is that industri product is run a shade lower   the reason is that high tech output is doubtless put downward pressur on overal product becaus the rate of inventori liquid in that sector must assur be rise   the unemploy rate is clear on the way up  and with demand weak or on the soft side  it   s realli a question of a tradeoff of rise or acceler product and rise unemploy or the revers   rise product and rise unemploy impli a favor long term profit outlook that i think has          veri import implic  but obvious it mean shrink consum incom and consum    confid  the confid issu in this outlook is realli quit crucial   the michigan survey actual show a degre of strengthen  and i suspect there   s an element of realiti in it   i don   t think it   s a phoni statist  but clear the confer board number  which will come out short  will either confirm or disput that there has been some stabil   i think the abc week index is a littl question  it has been except weak  but i   m not sure what degre of confid i would put in it  the problem that bother me particular is that the risk are realli differ from ani i   ve ever seen  and they are of concern larg becaus they are intern   we do know that the extent of the interact of the unit state and the rest of the world is greater than we can defin veri accur   in other word  the correl between  say  growth in europ and that in the unit state is a good deal higher than we can explain in the trade flow or in exchang and interest rate   in fact  the implic  as    son like to say  is that global portfolio adjust probabl are involv and are serv to integr the total system to a greater degre than we can specifi   and it   s fair appar that ani negat interact is necessarili self reinforc   this type of environ is someth we haven   t seen for a veri long period of  e   it  sn   t mean that the economi is go to implod   it   mean  howev  that the risk is there   and i think it would be a mistak not to keep a close eye in our evalu on this particular process  the crucial argument in support of forecast that econom activ will  acceler and inde pick up toward a   percent or more growth rate next year larg rest on the notion that profit will stabil and that the stabil will in turn stabil capit invest and          allow the termin of inventori liquid to trigger a recoveri   i do think  as   the     book  that that is the best point es    my concern is that the risk distribut is not symmetr   inde  it has a fair worrisom tail at the wrong end   a good part of this outlook rest in my view on the veri substanti size of the worldwid wealth effect  which current is take a larg chunk of demand out of the world econom system   here i think we depend to a veri signific extent on the prospect that the stock market will stabil and perhap even rise and that gradual the negat wealth effect  which has not yet creat ani serious evid of consum weak in our economi  will begin to revers   i don   t think we know yet how this will come out   i do believ that we should probabl be wait   the wealth effect come out of hous  which is still veri solid and still quit strong  is greater dollar for dollar than the negat wealth effect that is come from stock price or equiti valu general   but again this is not an issu that we know veri much about becaus we haven   t dealt with this type of economi previous  the concern here is that even if we do get a turnaround  the presumpt that we can somehow get a    v    type of econom perform involv some signific acceler over the nearer term i find veri much to be an outsid probabl   in my view  the economi has to absorb a veri larg amount of negat wealth effect that has to work it way through   so  the outlook is for a soft recoveri in the sens that a veri quick recoveri seem to be extraordinarili unlik at this stage  given the exist wealth effect  the issu that has been rais quit proper around the tabl about inflat  which we tend to disregard when we   re in a period like this  is quit import   i person am not terribl concern about the outlook for inflat for a number of reason   one is that the contractionari effect in the economi are realli quit substanti at this stage and are suppress the abil of          the busi communiti to pass through what unquestion are rise cost   energi cost have    gone up signific   busi firm have been abl to pass through veri littl of those cost  which is one of the reason for declin profit margin   the virtual stall in product growth in the context of general rise averag hour earn or averag compens is clear increas labor cost that now have to be spread across a smaller number of unit of output  here again i think that the price power of busi firm is veri limit at this point  judg from the widespread anecdot report that the capac to rais price in an environ such as this is extraordinarili restrict  how do we relat that veri strong and widespread consider to the fact that our price index seem to be acceler   i believ there are sever explan   first  i would discard the consum price index   i think it is a flaw statist   but we are see rise core inflat in the person consumpt expenditur deflat and other measur   as i have discuss mani  e in the past  part of the problem with the reconcili is that servic price inflat is exagger in our index   if inde servic price were rise as much as the data suggest  we would in fact be get a declin in product in the health servic area  in legal servic  and in busi servic   i don   t mean a declin in the rate of growth in product  i mean an absolut declin  which is just not credibl   when we do specif evalu in health price  we invari find that everi singl statist goe down and that one cannot explain the rise in overal health inflat except by a flaw procedur   the latter involv measur input as though they were output   there is an endeavor to move away from that procedur  what i conclud from all this is that the  book forecast is the most like outcom  my concern  howev  is that there is a veri signific asymmetri to the downsid in the risk to that forecast   accord  the appropri polici posit for this meet in my view is a          further    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate and a balanc of risk statement bias    toward econom weak   i would hope that a   percent fund rate is as low as we will have to go   if stabil forc begin to emerg  which will happen if the  book forecast is correct  we should be abl to hold at   percent in june and either then or thereaft remov the bias   in line with the fact that the economi   s adjust process are acceler  i think we should not hesit to start move in the other direct if and when the indic requir that  in my judgment  it is prematur at this point to start discuss in the statement we will issu today the steepen yield curv and it possibl root of grow inflat expect  it   s not that i think that it is incorrect or fals   it   s just that i believ it would be suffici at this point to remov ani market expect of anoth intermeet move   but as we approach the next meet  assum that stabil is emerg  we should begin in speech or interview to address the possibl that     basi point of eas  assum we move today  may be enough and at least rais the notion that inflat may not be dead   i will  for exampl  be make a speech at the econom club of new york on the   th of this month  and i will be rais some of these issu   but i would hesit to argu at this stage  given the fragil of confid and the fragil of the outlook  that we are at a point when we might begin to chang our polici posit  even though i believ this polici issu will be resolv within two or three month   i do think we probabl can stop our eas move here  assum we move the fund rate    basi point lower at this meet   but i do not think we ought to show our hand becaus i think the potenti consequ in term of market reaction could be signific and of no help to us   so i would put that on the tabl   vice chair
mr  chairman  i endors fulli the entir packag  includ your idea that some  between now and the next meet we probabl          should begin to shape the record   and i would suggest  sinc you alreadi plan to do that on the      th of this month  that we all remain veri silent until then
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend general   if i may  let me make a few addit comment to indic the way i   ve been think about this  as i said earlier when i made my econom statement  i believ it   s import to put what we do in a context   and the context that i   m think of is the amount of overal leeway we have on the real feder fund rate   it seem to me  given the outlook today  that we certain should not move the real fund rate below zero   i realiz that there are some differ of opinion about inflat expect  but the michigan survey  for exampl  is say that one year ahead inflat expect are about   percent   if that   s the case  with the nomin fund rate current at       percent  the real fund rate is someth like       percent   i know one can argu about that but if that   s about right  we don   t have a lot of downsid leeway left  in reflect on what we ought to do today  i found it help to look at the econom situat the last  e the real fund rate was at zero  which was rough between septemb       and septemb        and to compar it with the current situat   in that earlier period  inflat was   percent and drift down  long rate were come down  and we were run up against financi headwind   the unemploy rate was at   percent  higher than it is today   and trend product growth was still weak  this was befor we got into the late     s   the govern deficit  rememb those   was still a problem then and there was talk about a tax increas to deal with it  today we have a veri differ situat   inflat is about   percent and has been drift up  and long rate have been rise   lend institut now are well capit  so          we   re not look at the financi headwind we were experienc then   the unemploy rate    is drift up  but at       percent it is still at a relat low level   we may have the advantag of a coupl addit point on trend product but we have a budget surplus and peopl are talk about tax reduct   the zero real fund rate polici that we had in the earlier period work well  i think   in my view it help to lay a solid financi and monetari foundat for the fine econom perform that we had in the late     s   but my comparison of the two period suggest to me that if the overal economi were at a bottom now  a zero real fund rate might be too low in the context of the leeway target i mention earlier   i think that   s import  in ani case  this led me to think about our decis this morn in the follow way  though i guess no one has thought veri serious about the    basi point altern that was in the bluebook  clear  against the background that i   ve tri to lay out  that would be too much  it could push the real rate lower than we would want it to be onc the economi hit bottom and began to turn up   on the other side of the argument  i believ a case could be made for a reduct of onli    basi point today   and there   s a big part of me that think i ought to be make that case   but obvious that would disappoint expect   it would risk prolong the  e befor the economi get to a bottom and might make the bottom deeper than we need it to be   so by process of elimin i come out where you are  with    basi point as the right move today  for me a realli key point is that if we reduc the fund rate by that amount  we   re go to reduc that leeway  base on the way i   m look at it  signific further   and this might be where i differ with you a bit   have reduc that leeway  i think we ought to be veri care with respect to the expect we fo  about where we   re go from here   in my view  it would be help to signal the market now that there   s a limit to this process and that we          may be close in on it   we could go to a symmetr or balanc risk statement  i think a case    could be made for that   but if we drop the rate    basi point and keep the asymmetr risk statement  which is  of cours  expect  at a minimum i would hope that the press releas languag would suggest that we may be close in on the limit of this eas process   i believ we should begin to get that idea built in  within the context of where we are go in the long run  thank you
i agre with both of your recommend  mr  chairman   but i would like to associ myself veri close with everyth that presid broaddus just said   i could have support a move of    basi point with a balanc risk statement  i could have support    basi point with a statement that the risk continu to be weight toward econom weak   i could have support and argu for  although al did a much better job than i would have  either one of those posit  i think it is critic  though  if we are go to send a signal  that we send it in a messag from the committe and not in various speech   i am not in ani way denigr your effort in that regard  mr  chairman  but if we want to send a messag from the committe i believ it is import that we in fact send it from the committe   so i would reiter
i was actual suggest that we send it in june
instead of now
well  i think al broaddus has a point  and it may be worthwhil in the statement we put out today to say someth about the limit on how far we can go in one direct
mr  chairman  i believ that it would be prudent to cut the rate further and i support your propos reduct of    basi point   for this meet i also prefer to retain a balanc of risk statement weight toward econom weak   howev  i think we are get close to the point where we should serious re examin that stanc   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend for a    basi point cut and an asymmetr direct toward econom weak   i do think it   s import that we start get the word out  as suggest in the comment by al broaddus and cathi     let me make sever point   one is that we should start indic that     basi point of eas may be enough  that it will take some  e for these cut to have some impact on the economi   we should make it clear that we may decid not to eas further dure that  e  but we will be wait and watch and monitor care  and also that inflat is a concern longer term   we could put this in the statement today   or  your recommend to start talk about it in your speech on may   th and then put it in our statement in june is fine with me   i think that   s a reason way to proceed go forward
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman   howev  given my view of the econom outlook  i think it would be use for us to tri to telegraph some messag that indic we   re get close to the end of this process   if i had my druther  i   d probabl go    basi point today with the tilt toward econom weak and indic that we would be prepar to respond to further indic of weak   if we go    at this point  i          believ it   s still necessari to leav the tilt   nonetheless  in my view it would be use at least to    includ some word in our press releas that indic we have inde eas a lot
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i   d like to amplifi a coupl aspect of my posit   with regard to the april   th rate cut  about which i express reserv  i haven   t chang my view on that   but that rate cut is a fact   to me that committe action indic sever thing   first of all  it suggest a great sens of urgenc   the press statement releas at the  e of that action indic a great deal of concern over weak invest   in my view it was practic an announc of anoth    basi point cut at this meet   that   s the way the market interpret it  the fed fund market quick bid in a high probabl of anoth    basi point at this meet   sinc april   th  we have seen a veri weak employ report  industri product is down  and we   ve heard lot of news about weak invest and layoff   i think we have to do    basi point today becaus it reflect what we said we were go to do and it would make no sens to surpris the market in one direct on april   th and surpris them in the other direct on may   th   so in my view it   s critic that we do    basi point today   when the  e come to move the fund rate up  it   s not go to make ani differ whether we start from a rate of   percent or       percent  we   re go to face essenti the same kind of issu   but to be consist i think we do need to cut the rate    basi point today  and i feel veri strong about that  in term of the futur  i would say a coupl of thing   first of all  when we develop the balanc of risk languag  we tri to make it a statement about the outlook for the economi and not about the outlook for polici   we might want to remind peopl of that   and we might want to remind them that  given the lag in polici  we might still see some econom weak          ahead but they should not necessarili interpret that to mean that it would call for addit polici    eas   second  i would like to put the outlook for rate in the come month this way   i don   t know for sure whether further rate cut are requir   i think the probabl are more or less even that the next rate chang is go to be up as down   we   re in a veri uncertain situat  and i believ it would be a mistak to say that we know for sure that our eas process has come to an end   after all  we gave lot of reason whi the outlook could be weaker than what is now our best guess   so i don   t think we should say that the eas process is necessarili at an end   in my view we should say that we now believ there is more or less an equal probabl that the next rate chang will be up as down becaus we don   t know how the futur is go to develop   that would be my take on the sens that we should tri to impart to the marketplac becaus someth could come along veri quick and wipe away ani suggest that this process is at an end  thing could happen abroad or wherev   thank you
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i share mani of the general sen ent that presid broaddus and   express   in fact  i think i could go a bit further and make a reason case for whi we ought to paus today   but given the tide  i won   t belabor that issu  nevertheless  a key issu for me is the lag question   it   s certain well acknowledg that there is a lag between our action and their effect on the economi   at some point we   re go to have to remind market particip  probabl in a relat forc way  of those lag   and at some point we   re go to have to take that paus  probabl well befor there is altogeth convinc evid that the economi is stabil and improv   i think that day is  if not here  not all that far away   as a consequ  i believ we need to be quit cautious at this stage
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i would add that i am concern that too overt a comment today about the possibl end of this eas process might well be a bit prematur for two reason   first  it would be prematur if some of these downsid probabl that we   re concern about materi  if they do  it could be a problem to have said that   second  if this releas will have an asymmetr tilt  as i think it should becaus it   s the onli honest thing that we can say now  then that coupl with too strong a statement about end this process could send the market a veri confus messag and have a counterproduct impact
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support your recommend for a    basi point eas today and a statement that the risk remain unbalanc toward econom weak   on the other hand  i could also have join presid   and broaddus in support a case for slow the pace of eas today and move onli    basi point   that might have been a veri effect way of signal the sen ent that we now need to move toward a more cautious monetari polici and that we may not be far from end the eas cycl  but more import  mr  chairman  i agre with you on what i believ is the realli import issu  and that is the prospect that we may be near the point  and perhap after this move at the point  where we have to be veri cautious about ani further eas
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend  i   m fortun in my speak order becaus i can agre with some of what the four peopl who spoke prior to me had to say   first  i think presid pool is absolut right to remind us that the languag on the balanc of risk has to do with the economi and that we clear tri to get          away from predict what we might do in term of polici   i happen to think that as of today the    balanc of risk is more toward the down side and  therefor  that the current languag should be retain   i agre with presid  n that there is alway some risk of overshoot   and in that sens i will also join governor   in that i  too  don   t know what the futur is go to be  so i don   t think we should tri to signal one way or the other   becaus there is great uncertainti  i agre with what governor   had to say  which is that we shouldn   t tri to send a messag about the futur in our press statement becaus the futur is unknown   contrari to the fact that we use the word    forese futur    in our statement  it actual is not forese    laughter  i don   t know who suggest that we should use those word   but veri serious  i don   t think we should tri to signal too much in this statement   and final  there is a point on which i honest have to disagre with you  mr  chairman   while you should certain feel free to present your view in an upcom speech  i would be veri concern if there emerg a percept that through speech we are tri to do anyth just yet   there is a desir  i suspect  to make clear that inflat is a concern   we don   t want market to think that we aren   t concern about it   but given the prevail degre of uncertainti  i   d prefer that the press statement speak for itself and then when we get back togeth have anoth statement that speak for itself
as mark anthoni said when he burst into cleopatra   s bedroom  i   m not here to make a speech   so i agre with both of your recommend
care  sir   governor
bob  that   s a tough act to follow    laughter   i was plan to make a speech
you   re not go to let my comment discourag you  though
first  i support both of your recommend  mr  chairman   at the same  e  i agre with mani other around the tabl that we can   t continu to eas monetari polici in such larg step   i see the wall loom out there   i don   t see it quit yet  as i said earlier  but it   s out there and we should be awar of it   there are lag and we should be mind of that  as for the press statement  i think my view are closest to       s   it   s too soon to go to a balanc risk statement   in my view  if this make ani sens  we should have a relat unobtrus statement today  the last comment i want to make is that a lot of us found the bluebook exercis with the real fund rate comput in various way veri use  and i would like to propos to don and other that they continu to provid that analysi   in my view it   s a good way to think about monetari polici   if we keep look at it  we   ll get use to it and we   ll get a sens of when we ought to be wander out of the gray band and when we should not be wander out of the gray band   so  i would propos that the staff keep that exercis
mr  chairman  i   m most comfort with the comment of al  cathi  toni  and gari   i actual would prefer to come out of today   s meet with some clear signal that we have slow the pace of eas  not that we   ve stop eas but that we   ve slow the pace   i did not read the announc of our intermeet action a month ago as signal that we clear were go to move anoth    basi point today   i  too  thought about how we could give a signal come out of today   s meet and conclud that we could not chang to a balanc risk statement   but it seem to me that a    basi point eas would be a cleaner  prefer action   it would call for fewer word in our press statement and caus less confus          than the other approach that have been suggest   i   m not sure how we go from five    basi    point eas move to cold turkey withdraw from the eas process   so  i was of the view that a    basi point eas today would be a clean way to get on a differ trajectori for the reason discuss around the tabl that we may need to do that   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i think we should pull back on the throttl today   over the past four and one half month we   ve move polici in a veri aggress way to an easier posit   in my view an addit    basi point cut will move us to an over accommod posit   we   ve ad signific liquid to the market   now we should let it work through and we should be far more cautious about further move   i think we have an opportun with a    basi point move and an asymmetr risk statement today to give the signal that you   re suggest   so i   m of the view that a    basi point cut  with retent of the statement that the risk is weight to weak in output  is what we should do now   i certain agre that the risk of weaker growth continu to domin over the risk of inflat for now   but a lot of eas is in train   an addit    basi point would onli continu the eas  it wouldn   t stop the eas process   and polici  as we all know  work with a lag   thus the relat risk have shift sinc our last meet  though not to the point where the predomin risk is inflat  which is whi i think it is appropri to reduc rate   my prefer approach would take us on a less aggress trajectori down and prepar the market for our act in either direct
thank you   not onli do i not think that disappoint the market  not do what is alreadi built into the market  is a bad thing  i think it   s inevit   we stop eas in      when market particip were say we would move the fund rate down to            percent   we didn   t   we stop tighten last spring when they said we were go to rais the    rate to       or   percent   we didn   t   and i think there   s go to be anoth  e when we will disappoint the market   s expect   i   m afraid the messag here will be seen is the same old messag  anoth    basi point  anoth balanc of risk statement toward econom weak  and the fomc will come back and do the same thing again in june   so i   d be happier with no chang or a     point reduct today   but if we   re not go to do that  then i think bob     s idea that the board should consid take the discount rate down onli     point might at least send a differ messag out of this meet rather than just reli on speech to chang that expect
okay   the seem major is for a cut of    basi point and a statement that the risk are asymmetr toward econom weak   could you read the appropri statement
yes  mr  chairman   i will be read from page    of the bluebook  the direct word is      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent      the balanc of risk sentenc for the press statement is      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
call the roll  pleas
yes yes yes yes no yes yes yes yes yes chairman  span  vice chairman     governor     governor   presid hoenig     governor     governor   presid       presid   presid pool
i now suggest that the feder reserv board retir to my offic  while we recess this meet temporarili  and vote on the request from the various bank   meet recess
the board vote unanim to approv the request from sever reserv bank for a reduct of     percentag point in the discount rate to       percent  we now have a draft statement in front of us and i would appreci everyon read it and give your reaction after you   ve had a chanc to review it   it is essenti the same as the last statement  with all the refer to further action delet
i think this statement as draft is veri like to build into the yield curv anoth    basi point move at our next meet   our statement  sn   t have to say anyth about our be at the end of the eas process   if it simpli indic that with this addit move we have put a signific amount of s ulus into the economi to tri to deal with the downsid risk  which get so much emphasi in the draft  it would be at least a weak signal that this process can   t go on forev   repeat what i said earlier  i would love to see some word that would give some sens of that  becaus i think it might serv us well go forward   that would be my thought on this
i   ll echo that
may i have comment from everybodi  pleas  governor
actual  i think that would be a good idea   i also would like to see two part of the statement adjust   i   d suggest that the veri last part of the second paragraph  which read    threaten to keep the pace of econom activ unaccept weak     be tone down a bit   it could say these factor    continu to weigh on the economi    or someth like that   the propos word seem a littl too sharp   and perhap we could add a refer  mayb after the sentenc that say the reduct in excess inventori seem well advanc  to the fact that consumpt and hous expenditur have held up reason well   we might also note that the consider eas over the last half year should begin to support econom growth
mr  chairman  consid how the european central bank manag to complet confus the market and hurt it own credibl veri recent  i think tri to say thing that are essenti contradictori  or that can easili be interpret that way  has to be avoid   if we wish to give a signal that the eas move are like over  then the balanc of risk statement becom question  even though we all know that the balanc of risk statement has to do with futur econom activ   the market would clear believ we were tri to have it both way  tri to say that on the one hand we might eas becaus the economi might be weak  but on the other hand we might have finish our eas   if we wish to destroy our credibl  that kind of word is what i high recommend to you  and i assum that is not what we are seek to achiev              there will be a veri larg signal receiv from this statement  which is that we   ve remov ani notion of an intermeet move   and that is go to sound a big gong   it will say that the eas move may slow or may be over   at a minimum the committe has slow the pace and is fair close to where it want to be   in my view that is how this statement will be interpret   but it will be interpret becaus we allow the market to read it   that is prefer to tri to give two signal  one that say yes and the other that say no  and wind up with a statement that say mayb   i think that would be veri destruct to our abil to carri out our respons   also  given the view that some of us have  particular you  mr  chairman  and i  too  i guess  about the downsid risk  the last thing we want is to have a central bank that look confus    if we want downsid risk  a confus central bank will sure bring them
first  to pick up on a point that presid   made  i think anoth signal will be the fact that the list of reserv bank request a discount rate decreas is an incomplet one  that will be interpret as the feel within the committe   in my earlier comment i suggest that we should not indic to the market that we weren   t go to move again  which i think for all the reason just state is counterproduct  but rather that we have move     basi point   that is a more neutral statement that convey a fact   and it can be interpret as an indic that we feel we have taken substanti step   that   s the onli way i think we could construct amend this statement  but that   s your call
i have two suggest   first  take the second and the third paragraph out and go from the statement of action to the statement of risk   second  add a          sentenc to that last paragraph which say     in that regard  the committe recogn that        basi point of eas is now in the pipelin      period
my suggest are along the line of presid     s   i would shorten the statement
i guess i come in on the other side  in that this seem to me an accur statement of fact   i think the market will understand what we saw that led us to make a move   i also agre with the vice chairman that we shouldn   t tri to send too mani signal   i believ this statement is a fair accur descript of our discuss and i would keep it veri much as it is
mr  chairman  i   d like to support governor    particular on soften the statement at the veri end of the second paragraph   i believ    threaten to keep the pace of econom activ unaccept weak    is a bit stronger word than we need to use   i think the languag he suggest     continu to weigh on the economi    is both accur and adequ
yes  the languag in this draft was from our previous statement  as you know
well  i think it would be good to have a differ statement   that   s a good reason to chang it
ani other comment at this stage   governor
i basic support the statement   i might note that there are actual three chang from the previous statement  as i rememb it   first  we drop the    alert    sentenc   second  as toni mention  fewer bank are list as have put in for the discount rate reduct   and third  unlik the last statement  this one at least mention the word inflat  and that is a signific chang as well   i like that sentenc   so i   m essenti happi with the draft   perhap we could make some chang in the adject on that last sentenc in the second paragraph   but  as i said befor  i   d like to keep this statement fair unobtrus and general in the pattern of our recent statement   we have chang it in a few import way alreadi
let me suggest the follow   frank  i think governor     s suggest is an improv and unless there   s an object  we   ll just make that chang and put in his word   let   s then have a committe decis on two possibl  one is to go with this statement with that correct  the other is to craft a statement that basic tri to captur what al broaddus said earlier about be close to the limit of the eas process   we have various version of this draft statement   so  don  whi don   t you read the relev one
i happen to have someth handi  just in case   this one modifi the end of that sentenc at the bottom of page     it say      although measur product growth stall in the first quarter  the impress under rate of increas that develop in recent year appear to be larg intact  which togeth with the effect of lower interest rate this year should support econom growth over  e
and we offer that in the month of june
that   s the key question  whether in fact we move to a statement in line with al broaddus   s propos today or in june   i think it would be help to get member    prefer  i assum everyon is in agreement that we ought to do it  for may or june   let   s quick call the roll and see what we get
what is their express of opinion
may or june
yes  just say may or june on includ this sentenc
okay   chairman  span
may   i beg your pardon  june    laughter
mayb you   d like a punch card ballot    laughter
that   s better than a butterfli   sorri about that
the chairman vote june
i vote june
june june june may june june vice chairman   governor       governor     presid hoenig   governor   governor
is that includ the chang i suggest in that paragraph
we   ve got your chang in
presid   presid   presid pool        may may may
i   d just remind peopl that we said essenti the same thing at the end of januari  so it   s not new
six four  close
the vote was six to four in favor of june
so be it   yes  presid
could i just add a comment   i   m get increas nervous about these statement   they are get longer and longer and we have a total of five minut to look at them yet they end up make a big differ in how our polici action is receiv   we spent it seem to me month work on a statement of risk  which now get total lost in the wordag that is be ad to the statement   and as a committe we don   t realli get a chanc to talk about that enough   i   m veri concern about that
yes  i think that   s a valid point   what we probabl ought to do is cut these statement all the way back   we can   t do it now becaus we   ve alreadi vote   but your point  which i think is a relev one  is not that this should be short   you   re say that to the extent we are use the statement as an indic of our view  which we are  and frank appropri so in my view  that we should either circul it befor the meet or cut it down
i think we have to do one of those two thing   and send out statement around here would just be aw
i think it would be veri hard
i believ we ought to consid cut the statement back veri substanti   okay  the next meet is june   th and   th   rememb  we are invit to the british embassi on the even of the   th  end of meet
