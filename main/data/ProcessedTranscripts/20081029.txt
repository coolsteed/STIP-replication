thank you  mr  chairman   today my attent will be narrow than usual  given the brief by bill bassett and linda kole that will follow cover the broader develop in the equiti  fix incom  and foreign exchang market in the unit state and abroad  which have been consider over the past six week   i will focus on three topic       the impact of our new facil and other govern initi on market function      the consequ of the expans of these facil on our balanc sheet and our abil to hit the feder fund rate target over  e  and     the travail of the hedg fund communiti and how    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     octob                of     this could potenti add to market dysfunct   i will be refer to the chart packag that should be in front of you   as you all know  the lehman bankruptci led to sharp outflow from prime money market mutual fund into treasuri onli fund  exhibit      the result was a collaps in treasuri bill yield  exhibit      at the same  e  the cost of financ treasuri secur via repo fell sharpli   this is illustr in exhibit   by the drop in the overnight general collater  gc  repo rate   this increas the incent for treasuri trader to short treasuri secur that were alreadi hard to obtain becaus the effect cost of borrow such secur is determin by the level of the gc repo rate   as a result  treasuri fail  which repres treasuri secur that are not deliv as promis to their buyer  soar   treasuri fail were also exacerb by the withdraw from the secur lend market of some larg holder of treasuri  includ some major foreign central bank   although treasuri yield fell sharpli and treasuri bill were in great demand  the rise in fail result in a sharp diminut of trade and liquid in the treasuri secur market   the fact that there are sever market function problem in the asset class that is in greatest demand   treasuri   underscor the scope and sever of the market    broader dysfunct   at the same  e  the outflow from prime money market fund led to a sharp drop in the demand for commerci paper  a signific rise in commerci paper rate  and a shorten of commerci paper matur  exhibit   and      term bank fund spread rose sharpli  with the one month and three month libor   oi spread increas to level that make the earlier peak look like modest speed bump  exhibit   and      the lehman bankruptci caus counterparti risk concern to intensifi   moreov  the lehman bankruptci disrupt a number of market becaus particip in these market were uncertain how to adjust their long  and short posit exposur that offset their open posit with lehman   the result was a sharp drop in the willing of counterparti to engag with one anoth  especi at term   essenti  the result was a massiv coordin problem that has led to a veri unattract equilibrium   i would put it this way      i won   t lend to you even though i think you   re okay becaus i am not sure other will lend to you either   i need some assur that other will lend to you in order to have some assur i can get my money back if i need it      even though it has been in the interest of all parti to engag  no parti has been will to go first   in respons  the feder reserv dramat expand it program of liquid support   the size of each taf auction has been rais to      billion   the same size as the entir taf program just six week ago   fix rate tender dollar auction were implement by the boe  the boj  the ecb  and the snb   the asset back commerci paper money market mutual fund liquid facil  amlf  and the commerci paper fund facil  cpff  were implement  and plan for a money market investor fund facil  mmiff  were announc   the feder reserv and other central bank step forward to engag in transact with a broad rang of bank and  in the case of the fed  nonbank counterparti   the hope  of cours  is that octob                of     this willing to engag will reduc rollov risk and therefor encourag other to re engag with their counterparti   at least for now  the escal in the size of the taf auction appear to have been suffici to satisfi the demand for dollar fund in the unit state   as shown in exhibit    the first two auction of      billion have been slight undersubscrib  current  about      billion of taf credit is outstand   demand for dollar fund in europ has increas sharpli even though the cost is much higher than in our taf auction   wherea the two most recent taf auction were stop out at the oi rate  which is the minimum bid rate  the foreign fix rate tender oper have been conduct at a rate of oi plus     basi point   as shown in exhibit   and     swap outstand have grown to near      billion current   the ecb swap size is current about      billion  more than half the total amount of swap outstand   the amount of outstand swap is like to climb sharpli when the first    day fix rate tender oper are conduct in europ next week   the cpff facil is anoth import element in the fed   s program of liquid escal   as you know  this facil provid a backstop for domest issuer of a  p  rate commerci paper   issuer can sell commerci paper to the facil at three month term for an effect cost of oi plus     basi point for nonfinanci and financi issuer and oi plus     basi point for asset back commerci paper  abcp    this facil complement the amlf  which lend fund to bank at the primari credit facil rate against the abcp purchas from money market mutual fund   ye day was the first day that the cpff was open for busi  and a number of borrow issu commerci paper to the facil total more than     billion   at the close of busi last week     issuer had regist to use the facil  pay    basi point  or      million  to cover the potenti issuanc of commerci paper   the    basi point fee provid a littl equiti to get the program off and run   final  the most recent facil  the money market investor fund facil  was announc last week   this facil will provid liquid to five conduit that will purchas commerci paper and certif of deposit of design issuer from  a   money market mutual fund   it will like be sever more week befor this facil is oper   the escal in the provis of liquid and some of the other initi i will discuss short have led to a grudg improv in the interbank fund market and in the commerci paper market   review the earlier exhibit  most term fund spread have narrow  but the improv is modest relat to the earlier deterior   it is unclear at this stage whether the modest extent of improv reflect the limit abil of addit capac and breadth in term of liquid provis to restor confid  especi at a  e that the macroeconom outlook has deterior global  or whether it will just take  e for these liquid facil to restor confid and some semblanc of normal to the money market   octob                of     the expans of the fed   s liquid provis has been accompani by escal on two other front   first  the fdic announc a bank fund guarante program   although the term and condit of this program have not yet been final  the program is like to guarante most of the new senior debt oblig of particip depositori institut and their associ hold compani up to a cap of     percent of the matur oblig through june            import  new interbank fund will be cover   how this affect the feder fund market remain to be seen   second  the treasuri has commit      billion of fund from the tarp program to inject as prefer stock into the bank system   nine larg bank announc two week ago that they will accept      billion of prefer stock invest from the treasuri   over the past few day  the treasuri announc that an addit     billion of capit has been commit   the fdic guarante announc and the tarp capit infus have been effect in shore up confid in the major u s  bank   as shown in exhibit    and     credit default swap spread for most major u s  financi institut have narrow sharpli   but the guarante of the senior debt of depositori institut and their associ hold compani has generat some unintend consequ for those firm not cover by these guarante   in particular  the credit default swap spread for major nonbank financi have narrow less than those for the bank  exhibit      moreov  the fund cost for the gses have climb  especi for short term discount note issuanc   the fund cost for fanni and freddi for both long term and short term debt are shown in exhibit         and      howev  the fear that fund would flow out of prime money market fund back into bank asset guarante by the fdic has not been realiz   at least not yet   the expans of the fed   s facil and the open end natur of the fix rate tender dollar oper by the foreign central bank that we are fund by swap have led to rapid expans of our balanc sheet   exhibit    provid a snapshot of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet at differ  e befor and dure the crisi  dure the first    month  the size of our balanc sheet was littl chang   we accommod our liquid program main by sell treasuri secur   dure the next stage  which began around the  e of the lehman bankruptci file  we expand our balanc sheet but drain the reserv addit primarili by have the treasuri issu supplement financ program bill and place the proceed on our balanc sheet   howev  the capac to continu to drain reserv via sfp bill was unlik to be a long term solut becaus the treasuri would ul  be constrain by the debt limit ceil   the passag of the emerg econom stabil act of      grant the feder reserv the author to pay interest on reserv immedi   this was veri import becaus it meant that we could expand our balanc sheet size by un il reserv addit but at the same  e keep the feder fund rate from crash to zero by pay a posit interest rate on hold of excess reserv  further rapid balanc sheet expans appear inevit as the takedown from the taf auction and the fix rate tender expand further and as our new facil  octob                of     such as the cpff and mmiff  begin oper   although the es  shown for year end in exhibit    are indic   the actual size will be driven by the use of our various liquid facil   it   seem like that the feder reserv system   s balanc sheet will grow veri rapid through year end   we are now near three week into the new interest on reserv regim  which was implement on octob     as you know  the board of governor initi set the spread between the target feder fund rate and the rate paid on excess reserv at    basi point  policymak er on the size of a wide margin given unsettl market condit and the lack of experi with the new regim  recogn that the spread could be reduc if the feder fund rate trade soft relat to the target   as shown in exhibit     despit the payment of interest on reserv  the feder fund rate has continu to trade soft relat to the target   as a result  the board narrow the spread to    basi point with the start last thursday of the second reserv mainten period under the interest on reserv regim   it is too soon to assess the effect of the narrow spread on our abil to push the feder fund rate back up to the target becaus the interest rate paid on reserv is base upon the lowest target feder fund rate dure the reserv mainten period   so current it is hard to separ the impact of the narrow spread on the effect feder fund rate from the expect for further cut in the target feder fund rate that might occur at this meet   there are two complic in fix the interest on reserv spread at a level consist with the target   first  some of the gses  which hold balanc at the fed  are not allow to earn interest on their balanc   thus they have to sell feder fund to bank that  in turn  hold the fund and are paid the interest on reserv rate   second  some bank have also been sell feder fund below the interest on reserv rate   we expect this to diminish over  e as they gain more experi with the new regim   howev  other factor  such as concern with their overal leverag ratio  could caus this phenomenon to persist   as a result  there has been a signific amount of feder fund rate trade below the interest on reserv rate   this is illustr in exhibit     in which the circl are size to reflect the amount of trade at a particular rate level   this trade of fed fund below the interest on reserv rate has two consequ   first  it blur the mean of the effect feder fund rate with respect to it relationship to the stanc of monetari polici   conceptu  the interest on reserv rate  rather than the effect feder fund rate  could be view as repres the default risk free invest rate for bank   second  it impli that we may have to narrow consider further the spread between the target feder fund rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserv in order to push the effect feder fund rate up to the target   in principl  if fed fund sale were to continu in larg volum below the interest on reserv rate  the interest on reserv rate might need to be set right at the feder fund rate target in order to support the feder fund rate close to that level   befor turn to a discuss of monetari polici and inflat expect  i want to make a few comment about the hedg fund industri   befor this crisi octob                of     began  most of the fear about a market meltdown were focus on hedg fund  until now  these fear have been most misplac   howev  the risk that hedg fund problem will now exacerb the crisi have increas substanti recent  the under problem is that the recent perform of the hedg fund industri has been veri poor and hedg fund viabil is not veri robust when net asset valu slip consider below their high water mark in individu fund   septemb was the poorest month in the past    year  and so far octob return are on pace to be even wors   net asset valu for the entir hedg fund industri is down more than    percent year to date   the averag perform  shown in exhibit     mask substanti dispers in return and particular poor perform for certain strategi   in particular  convert arbitrag  emerg market arbitrag  and fix incom arbitrag strategi suffer doubl digit loss in the month of septemb  and further loss are like in octob   poor hedg fund perform has been exacerb by sever factor   first  polici shift such as the short sale ban have caus big problem for convert arbitrag  statist arbitrag  and long short equiti strategi   this has been an import factor behind citadel   s travail   second  prime broker continu to pull back in their willing to provid financ by rais their haircut assess against hedg fund asset as market volatil rise  exhibit       third  investor are pull fund out of hedg fund becaus of their poor perform and a general increas in risk avers   as a result  hedg fund are rais cash to meet actual and potenti redempt  and mani hedg fund are either hit or approach their net asset valu trigger point   let me say a few word about net asset valu trigger   hedg fund often negoti agreement with each of their prime broker that set the term for their access to financ   these contract give the prime broker the option to seiz and liquid collater if the hedg fund net asset valu fall by more than a certain magnitud   say  a    percent declin in asset under manag over a three month period  that   s a veri common trigger   obvious  if onli a few hedg fund are close to these trigger  there is littl problem as there is no potenti flood of asset sale into the market   but when so mani hedg fund are under pressur at the same  e  the risk of broader asset liquid increas   the prime broker may have a lessen incent to waiv it right to liquid collater when a greater proport of the industri is troubl becaus the first mover advantag of sell collater like becom more import under such circumst   i anticip that the pressur from the liquid of hedg fund asset will continu to weigh on financi market over the next few month   some major fund of fund manag anticip redempt between now and earli      of at least    percent of the total industri  or about      billion base upon the es     trillion size of the global hedg fund busi   market particip continu to price in addit cut in the feder fund rate target   of cours  it is a littl harder than usual to tell what they are expect base octob                of     on futur price becaus the feder fund rate has trade soft relat to the target and those expect are also embed in the near term rate for fed fund futur contract   regardless of the caus  if you look at exhibit    and     there has been a fair sharp downward shift in the feder fund rate curv and the eurodollar futur curv   they have shift downward about     basi point   moreov  the curv are consider flatter than they were a few month ago  indic that market particip expect that the fomc will be slow to rais the feder fund target in        our primari dealer survey indic that most survey respond expect the committe to lower the target feder fund rate over the next two meet to around   percent and keep it there through most of        this also repres a downward shift of about     basi point from the survey conduct befor the septemb    meet  exhibit    and       when the survey was conduct more than a week ago  the major of respond anticip a    basi point cut   sinc then  the consensus has flip  with most now anticip a    basi point rate cut at this meet   on the inflat expect front  normal relationship between tip and nomin treasuri have been distort by the illiquid of tip relat to nomin treasuri and the high level of chronic fail in the five year sector of the nomin treasuri market   as a result  tip yield have climb sharpli relat to nomin treasuri  lead to a sharp fall in breakeven inflat measur  exhibit       the fact that breakeven inflat rate have fallen more sharpli in the five year sector than in the ten year sector has generat a rise in five year  five year forward measur of inflat  exhibit       the distort in the u s  treasuri market suggest consider caution in interpret the rise in these measur   interest  our desk survey of primari dealer show a slight drop in long term inflat expect sinc the septemb survey  exhibit       befor conclud  let me note that the staff recommend approv of a     billion foreign exchang swap line with the reserv bank of new zealand to help satisfi the dollar fund need of bank that oper in new zealand   as note in the memo to the committe from nathan sheet and myself that was distribut on friday  this would complement the swap agreement that we have alreadi enact with other advanc economi and would have the same technic featur as those with the smaller advanc countri  that is  australia  denmark  norway  and sweden  with fix swap line limit   nathan will be discuss the potenti for addit swap line author for four emerg market countri recommend by the staff that were discuss in a second memo to the committe on friday   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper of the system open market account that have been undertaken sinc the septemb    fomc meet   nathan will continu our present
thank you  bill   nathan
in respons to intensifi global financi stress  the central bank of four major emerg market economi   mexico  brazil  korea  and singapor   have recent express interest in temporari liquid swap line with the feder reserv   for the reason outlin in our background memo  which was circul on friday  the staff recommend that the committe approv these request   we propos that the line be size at     billion for each of these four countri  similar to our exist line with canada  sweden  and australia   we envis that these line would expir on april           as is the case with our other swap line   we also recommend that these line have sever safeguard relat to our line with central bank in the advanc economi   notabl  even follow initi fomc approv  the propos line could not be drawn on without further author  and individu draw would be limit to    billion   we recommend that the fomc deleg to it foreign currenc subcommitte the author to approv these draw   the subcommitte would ensur that the dollar drawn would be use in a manner consist with the purpos of the swap agreement   the central bank in these countri would also agre to public announc the fact that they had drawn on their line and the mechan that they had use to alloc the dollar liquid   these safeguard are design to provid protect for feder reserv resourc and to ensur that the swap line are use in a manner consist with our envis object   these safeguard  howev  are not intend to be so oner as to discourag the use of the line if the situat warrant   we see the case for these swap line as rest on three import observ  first  each of these economi has signific econom and financi mass   mexico  brazil  and korea are all larg economi with gdp of around    trillion  and singapor is a major financi center   given the structur interconnected of the global economi and the financi fragil that now prevail  a further intensif of stress in one or more of these countri could trigger unwelcom spillov for both the u s  economi and the intern economi more general   our interdepend with mexico are particular pronounc   second  these economi have general pursu prudent polici in recent year  result in low inflat and rough balanc current account and fiscal posit or  in the case of singapor  sizabl surplus   accord  the stress that these countri are feel seem larg to reflect financi contagion effect from the advanc economi  includ sharp reduct in risk appetit  rapid deleverag by global investor  and a dri up of liquid in dollar fund market   third  there is good reason to believ that swap line with the feder reserv would be help in defus the econom and financi pressur that they now face   these line would promot financi stabil by help to ensur that financi institut and corpor in these countri have access to dollar liquid   dollar fund pressur in brazil and korea appear to have intensifi signific   such pressur remain less acut in mexico and singapor  but the author there view these line as valuabl protect should such pressur intensifi  particular over year end   in octob                 of     addit  the author in these countri have express the view that these line could provid a signific boost to confid  although such outcom are admit hard to predict   i turn now to two question that have been the focus of energet deliber among the staff as we have formul these propos   first  is there some better approach that we could recommend   second  what are the risk associ with initi swap facil with these emerg market economi  or eme   as for the first question  we could ask these countri to reli on their sizabl stock of foreign exchang reserv   across mani conting  we believ that these countri do have suffici resourc to address financi pressur on their own   consist with this observ  they don   t have ani immedi plan to draw on their swap line   in this sens  the line serv as a backstop   howev  in the event of intensifi stress  we believ that it would be desir for these countri to abl to meet the dollar fund need of their institut by draw on the swap rather than by go into the treasuri or agenc market to liquefi their foreign exchang reserv   altern  we could ask these countri to go to the imf  tomorrow  the fund is like to approv a larg  rapid disburs facil that might be appropri   that said  we see the imf   s effort in this area as broad complementari to those of the feder reserv   meet the potenti liquid need of these larg countri would strain the avail resourc of the fund   convers  the fund is much better place than we are to judg the liquid need of smaller  less system import countri   as an addit consider  these top tier eme that we are recommend for swap line are veri reluct to return to the imf   given the strength of their polici  they no longer view themselv as client of the fund and would prefer to go it alon rather than seek imf financi support   we note that there are inde risk associ with our recommend   one obvious concern is that the swap might not be repaid   howev  given the larg reserv hold of these countri  their prudent polici  the weight they place on good relat with us  and the safeguard built into the swap agreement  we judg the risk to feder reserv resourc to be veri low   more notabl is the risk that approv these line might caus us to be flood with request from mani addit eme   nevertheless  in propos line with these four countri  we feel that we have set the bar quit high   their import to the global economi and the qualiti of their polici set a standard that few  if ani  other eme can match   in addit  the potenti imf liquid swap facil might be help to us in limit the risk of a slipperi slope  as addit countri that request line with us could be ask to go to the imf   similar  european eme seek swap line could be encourag to approach the ecb   in assess these issu  the staff has confer with senior offici at the u s  treasuri and the state depart   in both instanc  these agenc emphas the global econom signific of brazil  mexico  korea  and singapor   howev  they also caution that expand the swap line beyond this group could leav us octob                 of     increas vulner to a    pile on    effect  which might manifest itself either in a larg number of addit swap line request or in polit pressur   given these consider  the staff would benefit from some signal from the fomc regard it willing to consid swap line with other emerg market economi   we see two broad option in this regard   first  the fomc could indic that it is not inclin to establish swap line with other eme   inquiri from addit countri could be forward to the imf   altern  the fomc could emphas that the bar for ani addit eme facil is high and that swap line would be extend onli if the case is seen as be compar to that of the four countri that are be vote on today   under this second approach  the fomc might consid grant the foreign currenc subcommitte the author to establish swap line with the central bank of other larg and system import eme   bill bassett will now continu our present

thank you   i   m go to open up in a minut to question  for bill  nathan  and bill   i want to say just three brief thing about the emerg market swap  first  we have been talk with these countri for some  e  and i think when the convers began it was more of a prevent measur than a respons to condit   but the eme are now at a flashpoint in the financi crisi  and as i think linda kole will probabl discuss  the urgenc has increas  and the risk to the broader global economi are probabl higher than they were a few week ago   second  with respect to the choic of four countri that nathan propos   as he mention  we have talk to the treasuri and the state depart   i spoke to secretari paulson and rice about this   there was an interest confluenc of agreement that  if you are go to do this  these are the right four countri and we probabl shouldn   t do more  both from an econom perspect and a diplomat perspect in the sens that these are the countri that among the emerg market are the most import from a financi and econom point of view   third  as i think nathan also mention  the imf is plan to creat a liquid facil  which will be a low condit facil avail to a broad rang of countri   so there has been some discuss back and forth about the relationship between this  if we do it  and the imf facil   i had a convers this morn with dominiqu strauss kahn  the head of the imf  and we agre that the two facil are complementari   that our would provid import addit resourc to the total avail of liquid resourc for these countri   if we decid to take this step  we have agre that tomorrow  after the imf board approv their facil  we would joint announc these two action so that it would creat an impress of cooper and coordin between the feder reserv and the imf  octob                 of     so those are just a few addit piec of inform   i   m sure that you have plenti of question   who is first   no one   ah  presid
just to follow up on your note  mr  chairman  i spent four year as the senior trade negoti with all four of these countri  and i   d just like to comment on their import to us   mexico is obvious   it   s a nation secur risk   we   re interlink econom   they have a sophist central bank and a veri good central bank governor  and i think that would be number one on the list   singapor is uniqu   i doubt that singapor would ever go to the imf   it would be beneath lee kuan yew   s digniti   it is a vital link in term of that sphere of the world   you made the case earlier  or at least nathan made a case  as to the uniqu of singapor   in term of brazil  i   d say that is the dodgiest of the lot  howev  we should rememb that    percent of the gdp of latin america south of the yucatan is produc by that one countri and rough    percent of the popul is repres by that one countri   it has made signific progress sinc cardoso was presid  and it is a robust economi relat speak   everi economi in latin america border upon it   it   have a uniqu negoti histori   and   know this as well as i do  have spent a lot of  e negoti with them   but i would say that it is a critic part of our hemispher and that is the justif for includ them in the packag   final  we have been tri to negoti a free trade agreement with korea for some  e   korea is an underrepres countri in term of discuss about develop in that part of the globe  and yet it is inordin success   i would argu that it is also a strong case to make   the onli other countri that i would includ under the rubric that we might ever consid is chile   even though it is tini  it represent is import and it natur uniqu   i think you could justifi do this by virtu of their immedi impact on our economi  their uniqu role in our hemispher  and the fact that i doubt that they octob                 of     would want to go to the imf in the first place   therefor  it is complementari to the packag you announc earlier   my onli discomfort in the discuss would be the idea of alloc to the foreign currenc subcommitte the author to approv addit countri   as to the supplement for these four countri that has been propos  i would be in favor of that   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought there was some pretti good risk manag describ in the memo  but i didn   t realli follow or don   t understand exact the process by which we would generat a loss through these swap line   could you take us through the state of the world in which we would actual generat a loss   i rais this question befor with the industri countri  and the answer was that becaus those are veri high qualiti countri  we don   t realli have to worri about that   i understand that they follow pretti reason econom polici dure normal  e   but what are the safeguard  and what would be the process by which we would generat a loss
i veri much agre with the thrust of the question   it would take a veri sever state of natur for us to sustain loss on these   we are protect by the full faith and credit of our central bank counterparti   in addit to that  when we give them dollar  we take their domest currenc   so i suppos  in some veri extrem state of the world  one could imagin that the loan that was made in dollar default on the central bank  the central bank chose not to make us whole  and the currenc that was escrow for us had depreci signific in valu   but i   d say that you are multipli three veri small possibl  particular the last two  that the central bank would choos to default on us  and there would octob                 of     have to be such a substanti fall in their currenc that it would reduc the valu of that effect assur or collater or whatev you want to call it
okay   but it would be that we have their currenc and presum that would be a state in which it had depreci
absolut   these would function veri similar to the swap line that we have with the advanc economi   in addit  we are go to allow them to draw onli    billion at a  e at the discret of the foreign currenc subcommitte   when the foreign currenc subcommitte make the determin as to whether or not a draw should occur  it has the scope and the mandat to look broad at what is happen in the economi and make sure that the resourc are go to be use in a manner that is consist with the term and the expect of the swap agreement
a clarifi question  mr  chairman   nathan  on page   of the memo  at the last bullet  you say     frbni would have broad   ˜set off right
yes  inde   mayb trish and bill want to jump in here as well   what this mean is that  in extinguish ani oblig that aris from the swap agreement  if the central bank for some reason  sn   t pay us  we can take other asset on the book that are be held by the feder reserv bank of new york to extinguish those liabil     that make sens   so if the brazilian are hold some addit asset at the new york fed that are unrel to the swap and they are not make good on the swap  we can draw on those other asset to extinguish the oblig from the swap
but there is noth that prevent them from withdraw those asset befor that  right   presum  if they   re in a situat of default  they would withdraw ani treasuri secur held here first
they could do that   but ani draw under the swap agreement would be no longer than three month  and some draw would be much shorter   so they would have to move veri quick  given the short natur of these transact   but there are certain state of natur that are so sever that we couldn   t rule it out
let me just state my understand of this so that i can be correct by nathan or by bill   these countri hold substanti amount of their reserv in dollar   they hold a substanti fraction of those dollar in account at the new york fed   if they default on their piec of the swap and the fall valu of their currenc left us with some exposur  we would have the abil to take asset from their account to cover ani loss   so it   s better than the fact that this is a sovereign credit and it is better than the fact that we have an asset on the other side of the swap  becaus they hold substanti foreign exchang reserv with us   the way to think about this is just as a mechan to help them transform the composit of their dollar reserv in a way that might be more effect in respond to lender of last resort need in dollar  rather than have to sell treasuri or agenc into the market in a period of panic or distress to meet that cash need   i meant it as a confirm question
but i thought we were concern about a shortag of treasuri collater in the market   so whi wouldn   t we want them to sell  and in fact  what are reserv for if they don   t use them in these circumst
i have never stood in their shoe  so i   m not sure i fulli understand it   you are right that the world is a littl short of the risk free asset now  and so a greater suppli would be terrif in some sens   but they have a general view  which i think our peopl share  that to meet the kind of lumpi  unpredict  potenti larg need for lender of last resort purpos you may face in our currenc  you have to manag reserv in a way that you can meet those need without sell treasuri or agenc   it would not be so terrif for the world   i have never stood on the other side  but that   s my basic sens   anoth way to think about this is that the privileg of be the reserv currenc of the world come with some burden   not that we have an oblig in this sens  but we have an interest in help these guy mitig the problem they face in deal with currenc mismatch in their financi system   we have an interest in help them meet that in some sens   it   s not our oblig  we have the same basic interest that led us to be respons to the european need in some case  these guy are differ in that they actual have manag the countri    balanc sheet better becaus they at least have a huge amount of their asset in dollar   that should make us in some way as comfort as   mayb more comfort than   do it with the european becaus they ran a bank system that was allow to get veri  veri big relat to gdp with huge currenc mismatch and with no plan to meet the liquid need of their bank in dollar in the event that we face a storm like this
presid    you had a two hander
yes   presid    you describ the eme as motiv by a desir to transform their reserv from illiquid treasuri or from treasuri to some more fungibl and more conveni form of dollar   that strong suggest collater their swap octob                 of     line with the treasuri rather than their own currenc   what would be the disadvantag of do that
i think effect we have done that by the way in which the thing is structur
but the point that presid   made is that we   re not constrain them to not withdraw the reserv
do you mean that you want to put a reserv floor on them  too
the question is whether  in an unlik but possibl state of the world in which they don   t want to pay us back  they could withdraw their treasuri in advanc of default
or we could lend to them  collater by the treasuri rather than by their own currenc
well  lot of thing are possibl   i think this is a pretti good conserv balanc
that would basic be a repo agreement  i guess
for what it   s worth  the ecb has enter into someth similar to that with the hungarian  in which the hungarian are abl to repo to them long term euro denomin stuff and get euro back
thank   i think i   d be a littl concern about stigmat the swap by say that we have enough doubt about these other countri that we need to take collater   we don   t have confid that their central bank will meet the oblig that they have taken octob                 of     on   so my prefer would be to stick with the extens of our current swap agreement to these countri   i think they all are use their reserv to some extent alreadi  so this is not a case of them not touch their reserv and instead take the swap   they say they don   t intend to use them  but they could veri well use them   they   re alreadi use them  the other market that the treasuri has express some concern about is the agenc market   if they were just meet a huge demand for treasuri by sell treasuri  that might be one thing   although intermedi  and longer term treasuri yield themselv have move up presum becaus of suppli pressur there   but the agenc spread have widen quit a bit  and i think forc them to sell agenc in a kind of lumpi way would feed back on our mortgag market   it would not be in our interest
presid    a two hander
just respond to presid     i think it would be an insult to these four parti  particular given the fact that we appear to have negoti  again  the abil to attach other asset   i am  frank  surpris that singaporean would go along with that   if we got that  i   d use it and pocket it   but i would argu  especi for the case of mexico  that i don   t see ani reason that we should differenti between them and canada  for exampl   it would stigmat them in a way  and it would be an insult to these peopl   at the same  e  as i think i understand the explan from vice chairman   and from nathan  we do have some ramp up secur here   so it   s a special arrang   i think go further than that would not be appropri
let me say just a coupl of quick thing   one is that this would requir renegoti the whole thing from the begin  and we would like  if possibl  to do this tomorrow with the imf   the second point i would make is that we do have octob                 of     consider secur  and we will be dispens this   under strict condit   in limit tranch   i think we could monitor pretti well what was go on   but the point is well taken  presid
i have just a clarif   this is a question   don   t we alreadi have a swap line  a stand facil  with mexico as a part of nafta   so we don   t have to add it
we do have a swap line with mexico   it   s a stand swap line   it   s    billion under the north american framework agreement   it   s the counterpart to nafta  under that agreement  we also have a    billion swap line with canada   here we would be ad a new temporari liquid swap line  so it would be a new legal construct
i guess my question is whi we can   t use the swap line that is alreadi in exist
in principl  if you were so inclin  you could probabl just rais the size of the exist swap line to     billion   howev  we built in a varieti of mechan and safeguard in this propos   in addit  the structur of what we   re put forward is tailor particular to meet the kind of challeng and liquid pressur that exist right now   so in some sens this one is structur to meet the challeng that the mexican are most like to face in the current episod rather than the more generic one that alreadi exist on the book
let me go to presid    who has been wait patient
i have two unrel question   one follow up on this  but the other one is on the term auction facil   first  given how much we have expand the term auction facil  is there ani consider to have a minimum stop out rate  given that the last two have had fair low stop out rate   i wonder if that was be consid at all  given how octob                 of     much we expand the size   then the second question get to the stigma issu relat to the swap line   there was quit a lot of discuss about how to differenti the countri   i had the same thought that presid   had   if we could have set off right that enabl them to collater the swap   i do think go to the imf will attach a fair amount of stigma to the organ   so i am worri that the spillov benefit to other countri will be negat  not posit  becaus of that stigma   one option would be to say that either you could go to the imf or we would provid collater loan for other than these four  sinc it sound as though these four are a done deal   but rather than tri to draw the line and figur out whether chile or some other countri is appropri  we could collater it   if they held enough treasuri secur at the new york fed  then it would seem that we would have no reason not to do it   if they didn   t have treasuri secur  which would probabl part reflect some of their own mismanag in their countri  then they wouldn   t be abl to use the facil and would have to use the imf   but it would seem to be a way to get around some of the stigma issu  if someon chose to come to us and fulli collater it   that might be an altern way to draw the line rather than tri to come up with criteria that seem a littl difficult to understand  as i went through the memo
under the term auction facil  there is a minimum bid rate  the oi rate   so when we have a      billion auction and let   s say there are proposit of      billion  the win bid rate is the oi rate for everybodi
but i   m just wonder  as the oi rate has come down  when you think of the band that we have for excess reserv  it   seem that the oi provid a much bigger band  for exampl  than what we have even for excess reserv   i wonder whether  dure octob                 of     period in which peopl are consid a reduct of as much as    or more basi point  the oi end up be a veri low lower bound
yes  right now it is a veri low rate becaus the market is build in futur rate cut   so i think the oi rate is now below   percent on a three month basi
but as we narrow the target for excess reserv and have a narrow band there  you wonder whether the stop out rate  have a lower band that is a littl higher than the oi  might be an altern way to think about it  now that we have the excess reserv option as to the lower bound
i think that is someth worth consid   the emphasi right now has been get term fund out in as much size as possibl and not worri so much about whether the cost of the fund is or is not at a penalti   so i think the emphasi of the program did shift a bit over the past six week   obvious  if thing settl down and the demand at the taf auction subsid  then you can have the option of cut the size of the auction or increas the minimum bid rate or some combin of the two
mr  chairman  may i make an amend to eric   s question or suggest   i think that  when we have a chanc to breath and we feel as though we have achiev some durabl stabil in the panic  then we will want to reassess not just the basic complement of our facil and how we think about the futur but the relat econom of what we   ve done with the dollar swap and our exist open end auction facil for institut   ideal  we want a situat in which it is more attract for them to borrow from their foreign central bank   the dollar we provid through the swap   than to come to us in our auction and other area through their u s  affili  octob                 of     i am a bit less troubl by the point you made than i am by the fact that we have set up a regim in which the incent for them to come to our facil are still substanti when they have now the abil they didn   t have befor to go to their foreign central bank for dollar in larg scale   as we think about consolid and not just exit   about how we prepar the ground for a shift over  e   i think we want to come back to look at the relat econom between our dollar facil for u s  bank and u s  affili of foreign bank and what is open to them from their home countri central bank now   as part of that  we could think about size  reserv price  and price in our auction
the awkward thing right now is that we are tri to add liquid as power as we can   so to rais the minimum bid rate or do anyth that somehow suggest a pull back would be a bit inconsist with the libor   oi spread widen that we have seen and the fact that it still remain veri  veri elev   you might want to do exact what you suggest  presid    at some futur date  but i think that do it now would send a veri mix messag to the market   i think peopl would be confus about what we are do
presid hoenig   i   m sorri  nathan had an answer
could i just respond to presid     s second question
i think you put your finger on two veri difficult judgment that we made when structur this facil   i don   t see the risk of creat stigma for emerg market economi that are not in our swap network as be a first order concern   it is broad recogn that the folk that we are recommend are larger  more system import  and as well manag as anybodi els   if you were sit down to make a list   and the fund has recent done this   the economi that we   re recommend would be at the top of the list  and i octob                 of     think that is recogn by essenti all observ   so i see what we   re do here as realli ratifi percept rather than creat new one  on the second point  the choic between the swap versus the repo  that one is particular t i   i veri much agre that the repo would give us a littl more secur   on the other hand  the swap framework give the emerg market economi a littl more flexibl  as to how they are go to proceed  as presid   mention  it also creat symmetri between the industri countri and the way we   re treat them and the emerg market and the way we   re treat them   given the success of mani of these economi over the past ten year  i see this as be an appropri step   nevertheless  i admit that the choic between the swap and the repo is a difficult one   anoth thought is that the repo structur might provid a bit more secur  but we have tri to get that secur through other way   through tranch  care review  and so on
presid hoenig  i   m sorri   go ahead
no  no   in fact  it follow right on with what nathan was just answer  that is  for the moment we are creat kind of a broader in list for these four countri and stigma with the non accept group at this point   what will happen  then  if we do have an issu that involv   pick a countri   chile   are we go to send them to the imf   are we go to have our subcommitte make a decis as to whether to give them a swap   if we do that  will that then creat uncertainti about other   are you realli not concern about the stigma and the implic of this  especi   i guess they are ask this in anticip of the possibl  even though they think it   s fair remot   would we not be increas the probabl of a problem by do this now   i know these are tough question  but in this environ  i am anticip a bad event   so what do we do in the case of that bad event
i would hope that initi these swap would reduc the probabl of bad outcom in the emerg market economi   certain  if brazil  mexico  and korea are up against the rope and experienc signific financi stress  my sens is that it would be an environ in which mani other eme would be experienc negat spillov   so to the extent that we can backstop these major linchpin in the emerg market world  i see that as have veri posit effect for other   that would be one point   second  the decis as to how to handl chile  if chile come to us for a swap line  i think is veri much a polici decis for the committe to determin   as i said in the remark  we as staff member would veri much appreci some sort of signal from you as to whether you want to say four and that   s all we   re will to do  and everyon els   chile  india  and south africa   goe to the fund   or is the committe open to have potenti a few other larg  import emerg market economi have swap line with the feder reserv   i see that as be a polici decis
but it   s someth that we ought to think about sooner rather than later becaus the likelihood is that  if you take care of these four and you get anoth request  you are go to get three other and not one other
wherev you draw the line  there is go to be somebodi who is just a bit away from the line that say     i am veri similar to those folk      i am reason comfort with where we draw the line   here there is as much gap as you   re go to find   in my mind  the next one for which you could make a case would be india   howev  india   s financi system isn   t as develop as is the case with these folk   they are not as integr into the global financi system as is the case with these  so there is a bit of space there   but these are admit hard judgment  which we tri to flesh out regard some of these issu in our memo
have we been approach by ani other countri
yes  inde  we have   we have been approach by
but we have not encourag that
we have done everyth we possibl can to discourag it
just to be clear
that   s right   we   re not advertis
anoth question for nathan on swap line is how this work exact   if the pattern hold and mexico  for exampl  support it bank system   in the case of mexico it is a littl differ from other  in that all of the larg bank are foreign own  citibank own banamex  and the spanish bank own the other two or three larg bank    where   our respons stop and their begin   is it possibl for the subsidiari of a u s  bank or a spanish bank to draw dollar liquid in mexico and with fungibl dollar move that around the world   or   it in one manner or anoth stay in mexico
a coupl of thought   certain these home versus host issu bedevil mani  mani discuss of bank issu right now   they are true in mexico  as you suggest  and they are true in spade in central and ea n europ  where instead of u s  bank there are european bank in the tension between the home and host   so these consider are veri relev and also exceed complic  if the bank of mexico or the mexican author move to address tension in their financi system  the standard that has been set by sever feder reserv action  the brit in octob                 of        u s c   b      and we have had veri inform inquiri from a coupl of other countri  includ     u s c   b     the thing they have done  and i believ a number of the other countri is to includ subsidiari of foreign firm that are oper in that countri   so  for instanc  for the unit state  deutsch bank   s u s  subsidiari has had access to our various facil  and that has been the coin of the realm in the announc today   so my feel is that banamex  which is own by citi  would have the same access to these kind of facil as other mexican institut  now  there is no guarante of that  but that would be my feel   regard the question of  onc a mexican institut get it hand on dollar  what happen to those dollar  my understand is that they can move around   in fact  in a discuss  guillermo ortiz indic that to date mexican institut were net supplier of dollar to the unit state rather than the other way around
so in the case of a foreign bank   they lend to a foreign bank in their countri  in mexico in this case   default  whose problem is it   is it the home countri supervisor   s problem  or is it mexico   s problem vis  vis us
i would guess that it is a joint problem
i   m not sure that this is help  but mayb i can give a slight differ exampl from anoth perspect   we have a bunch of u s  affili of some of the weakest european institut that have face veri substanti dollar fund need and have come to us and ask for substanti ongo access to liquid   when they have a substanti amount of lendabl collater  collater with substanti market valu relat to the need  we have been comfort meet those need   when their need have substanti exceed or might potenti exceed the market valu of their elig collater  then we have talk to the home central bank   we have said that  in effect  if you want us to be abl to meet those need and they octob                 of     have collater in your market that is substanti relat to those need  then the better way for us to do this is for the home countri central bank to meet their dollar liquid need against the collater there or meet the liquid need and we provid the dollar   s worth of guarante from the central bank  so this home   host thing is a delic balanc  and as nathan said  it shouldn   t all fall on the host central bank   the best thing possibl is for the home countri central bank to take most of the respons for meet the liquid need and for us to help them facilit that where necessari  but when those need exceed what we would normal give in term of access  then you have to have a convers with the foreign central bank   so  for exampl  if a weak u s  institut in mexico face substanti need in mexico well in excess of their elig collater in mexico  i suspect they would call us and say     we want you to meet those need      we would have to consid at that point where they are in the liquid solvenc spectrum and how comfort we are in meet those need
veri good   presid
i have a question for the staff   you note that the countri believ that this would help market confid   so the choic of extend a line is potenti consequenti here   i have a two part question   first  what do you think the risk is of the uncertainti surround whether particular other countri will or will not in the futur be abl to obtain a swap line from the feder reserv   second  what would you suggest that we say if ask by the public or if the chairman is ask in the congress about what criteria or principl we use to draw the line between the countri that have swap line and those that don   t   i know that you pose the question to us  but what would you suggest that we say
as outlin in the memo and then also my remark  the first is that we are look for economi that are larg and system import   the second is that we are look for economi in which their polici have been strong and it appear that they are larg be influenc by contagion   the third piec is countri for which we believ that the swap line might actual make a differ  now  let me just give you a concret case of the third criterion becaus that   s a littl more abstract than the first two   iceland came to us and request a swap line of approxim    billion to    billion  which would have been   to    percent of iceland   s gdp   so it was fair larg relat to the size of the countri   but the liabil of the bank system were on the order of      billion  and the under problem was realli that there was a loss of confid in it bank  we came to the conclus that a    billion to    billion swap line was veri littl ammunit to use against a potenti loss in confid in this      billion financi system   for that reason  we as the staff recommend against a swap line for iceland  those are the three condit that we   d emphas   sort of subsidiari to that is that i think it is veri appropri for all the european eme to report to the ecb for their liquid need   that would further constrain the list of countri that we   d look at   as we work down the list of countri  i think it get easier to say    no    in that fewer and fewer of the countri can make a case that they are larg and system import   with the risk of creat stigma  some countri are big  and some aren   t  and that   s pretti darn object   now  you can debat about  well  what   s big and what isn   t and where you draw the line  but it just so happen that these three major economi that we   re put forward all have gdp of around    trillion   that seem like a reason line to draw   again  there   s an element of arbitrari here  but ani line you draw will have an element of arbitrari to it
and the first part of my question
oh  i thought i got it   what was the first part
what sort of uncertainti might this engend about the likelihood of other countri qualifi   my recollect is that mani economist have claim that the imf had this troubl in the     s  when intervent would give rise to uncertainti about subsequ intervent in other case
well  i guess i   m not sure i know exact what you   re drive at   are you concern that  by move on these  we   re send a negat messag about the one we   re not move on
i   m just wonder about the uncertainti that might be creat about the lack of clariti about who   s in  whether this is the final list  and so on
our press releas that we are negoti list  as clear as one can in a press releas  the criteria that we were look at   that they are larg  well manag  fundament sound  system import countri   so we are tri to communic that   in addit  in convers when these folk come to us   and especi if we get some direct from the fomc as to how you   d like to proceed on this issu   we can be veri  veri blunt with them in tell them whi the answer is    no    or    yes     depend on which way the fomc goe
vice chair  did you have a two hander
well  i just want to point out that i think these are absolut the right kind of question about this   but i think these concern are substanti mitig by the fact that the imf is put in place a facil at basic the same  e  which will be there with relat littl stigma for a rang of other countri that need it   there will be a univers of other countri that would not meet the test for elig for this swap type of facil  octob                 of     for the imf or us  that will have to go through a program with condit and a bunch of adjust such as iceland is go through or hungari will go through  so it is right to rais these question   but the boundari problem around our swap line are substanti mitig by the fact that there is a new facil come out that   s go to the same place   rais the question of whi we need to do our swap is good  too  but you   ve heard lot of good argument for that  and i think that realist there   s a natur divis of labor between what central bank have classic done with each other in the swap context and what the imf     what we   re do is a natur extens of what central bank do   the imf is move a littl further in from where they are in this case  and i think that will mitig some of the signal problem and uncertainti creat by have this evolut in the scope of swap line
i guess i   m worri about this for all of the consider that presid hoenig and presid   have just been talk about   i don   t know where we draw the line  and when we have to go to the state depart and start ask what countri we can or can   t develop swap line with  i   m not sure those are the criteria we want to be use   we mention the countri alreadi   what happen when     you can just go down the list
we have alreadi said    no    to some of those
i understand  but if you realli follow the logic of the argument about be larg and system import  if we draw a line somewher  we start expand this now bit by bit and we draw a line somewher  and the question then becom  will market begin to question other countri on the peripheri and creat problem   it   s not that ani one of them      i don   t know  pick one   is larg and system import  but by do what we   re     u s c   b        u s c   b    octob                 of     do and creat the uncertainti that presid   was refer to  mayb we are forc to go and do it collect becaus they all band togeth and as a group say     we   re all face this problem   whi can   t we have the same access      part i like presid     s suggest about use repo with secur  which we have here as a mechan   altern  if the imf is creat a larg uncondit or low condit type of program  whi not just say that everybodi els goe to them first   if they tap out of the imf access  mayb then we might consid be a backstop rather than their come to us in the first place   i just don   t know where this end  i think that  with all of the question you rais and tri to answer  you hit it right on the head   on all of them that you said were kind of margin  you went one way  and i   m lean the other way on the same criteria
presid    a coupl of thing   the imf has veri limit resourc   they   re not remot abl to meet the need of
we don   t know what the need are yet  do we
well  the resourc are veri limit   the other thing is that the staff ask for guidanc on the limit here   i   d like to propos that  when we get to that point  to ask the voter to suggest how they stand and what qualif they might have   one thing that you could do  for exampl  would be to say     i do or do not support this  but if i do  i think a veri sharp line should be drawn at this point and be communic that way      the legisl histori can be part of this  and we can communic to the staff how we feel about potenti extens
just to put some number on imf lend capac   total imf lend capac is about      billion   to get even that high they have to call in some special arrang that they have with a varieti of countri   the maximum capac is      billion   so the      billion that we   re propos today would be essenti half of what the imf could do   in that octob                 of     sens i realli see what we   re propos as our take off the imf   s hand some of the largest potenti liquid need  which then allow them to focus on a whole rang of addit countri  a relat point is that i understand that  in an imf execut board meet today  the manag director indic that they are get a fair amount of interest in this new facil   it realli is a differ kind of facil  and frank  even a week ago if you told me that the imf was go to be abl to put this facil togeth in this quick a  e  i would have said     no way   there   s no way that the imf can move this quick      so it is about as good as we could expect and mayb even better than what we could have expect from the fund   i think that they are do what they can to minim stigma   on the other hand  they don   t have enough lend capac to realli handl these folk that we   re talk about today
thank you  mr  chairman   in the bluebook here  it say     addit  the swiss nation bank announc plan to draw on it swap line to help financ up to     billion in purchas of asset from a major swiss bank      so is that realli what you have in mind here for a countri like brazil   that they   ll draw on their swap line to purchas asset from bank
no  and mayb the folk in new york want to talk a bit more about this  the transact with the swiss nation bank was a veri special transact that occur outsid the typic constraint of the swap line that we   d be agre to with these folk   in the swap line with these folk  they would have to tell us up front how they   re go to alloc the resourc   we would envis that it would be done in someth similar to an auction  in a veri transpar  on market sort of way   but it would not be that kind of a transact  which was a special case in order to help a particular financi institut
well  if you think that there are system import institut in these countri  whi not
again  we   re draw line here   i am not prepar to give these folk cart blanch   that   s whi we   ve ad addit safeguard and addit govern structur to these facil   mayb the committe has a differ view on that  but i wouldn   t be prepar to let them do whatev they want with these resourc
to continu to grill you  nathan
i   m earn my pay today
you know  the atmospher right now is larg precautionari on their part   they are well capit with foreign currenc reserv   but if we want to deal with hypothet  let   s assum that some of these recipi of the swap line get into a liquid crisi  is the european central bank be approach for swap line   i recogn that they need dollar liquid  but in a general liquid crisi  the euro would do as well to help   do we have ani sens of whether the ecb is consid swap line for some of these emerg market
i don   t have detail on that   as i   ve mention  i know that they have creat a facil with the hungarian  a  ‚¬  billion facil   they were also approach by iceland at the same  e that we were   i would specul  but i don   t have ani basi for that specul  that given the emerg tension in central and ea n europ and northern europ that they probabl are be approach  but i don   t have ani detail on that
my understand is that they have been approach   i don   t know what decis have been made other than the one that may have been mention   in addit  they have open a swap line with the danish central bank in euro  which was virtual ident to the octob                 of     dollar arrang that we have with the danish central bank   so they definit have been approach for swap line   on how mani of them they   ll put into place  we don   t have ani particular inform at this point
i just want to clear up the question   i think   and nathan may have both answer this  but it   s a question that presid   rais earlier   in mexico   s case  for exampl  where almost all the major bank are foreign own   eu bank  spanish bank   those bank clear have access to dollar through the ecb swap line   there   s no reason that the dollar fund need of those bank  to the extent that they can move these thing around  can   t be satisfi by access to dollar from the ecb   is that a correct or an incorrect assumpt
the collater isn   t alway in the right place   you are absolut right if the collater could be easili move  but the collater often  isn   t in the right place
let me ask nathan a question to follow up  if i may   obvious you   ve been approach by the governor of the central bank of mexico   ortiz has been here to visit
so what   s his argument   i would assum that you ask these question
yes  absolut
so inform us as to what his justif is
mexico is experienc increas financi stress  particular in it corpor sector  where recent some bad bet on structur financ product have emerg  and ortiz was veri concern about continu confid in the mexican economi   now  that said  from what he had to say  dollar fund pressur had not yet emerg  and he was emphat that octob                 of     they would not draw on these until the  e that those fund pressur emerg or until the  e that they saw a signific further deterior in condit in their economi   he was veri specif about the fact that they would use their own reserv as their first  second  and third line of defens
just to add to that  he said that  to deal with the issu that nathan rais about the problem with their busi and the kind of dollar need they had  they were meet those need out of their own foreign exchang reserv   so they were not go to engag in a swap with us in order to meet that particular problem  but they were concern about the dollar pressur more general on their financi segment  particular as year end approach
if it   s okay  mayb we could just go ahead with the vote on this   i   d like first to do the open market oper  which i hope are not too controversi   there was no discuss of the new zealand swap line   i   ll ask to see if there is ani comment on that  then on this issu  i   ll take a set of posit from the voter  if that   s okay   so let   s go back to domest open market oper
i move that we approv
without object   the new zealand swap
i move we approv that  too
is there ani discuss or concern   all right   without object   now  turn to the resolut on the eme swap  in the interest of  e i propos   and i hope it is okay   to go through the voter and ask each one to state whether you are in favor or oppos   you can say what you want and  if you want  whether you have some argument to make or if you   re condit in favor   for exampl  i   m in favor if x or if we do y   but just to get a octob                 of     sens of where everybodi is  and then we   ll decid what to do   okay   so let   s go down the roll here   i   m in favor
i think we should be fair tough at this point   vice chairman
i   m in favor   on the basic question of how you would deal with other request beyond the four  nathan gave two option   one is that you deleg to the subcommitte discret to make those judgment   the second option was to say     no  not without come back to the committe      i do think it make sens to see how the imf thing work and how it is receiv  how much particip they get  and how these boundari problem and the signal problem play out  and it is probabl a good idea for the committe to have at least a brief about how that is play out so that there is some context go forward   i would be in favor of your deleg that author to the subcommitte  as you would expect me to be  just becaus some  these judgment need to be made quick   but i certain understand whi peopl would want to have a better sens of how this is unfold and how we deal with it   the boundari problem are go to get wors if we have to go broader than this
i   m in favor
i   m in favor mr  chairman  and i would also favor  in term of the screen devic for futur request  that you come back to the full committe   thank you
okay   that   s understood   governor kohn
i   m in favor  mr  chairman   i think these boundari problem are difficult   i agre with the vice chairman that our have the imf there mitig them   i was encourag by nathan   s sens that there are some peopl interest in the imf  so there might not be much stigma there   i would be in favor of veri strong encourag other countri to go to the imf
i  too  favor the facil   i think it   s veri import that we are tranch this and use somewhat differ way of provid the money to these countri than we have with other countri becaus  as presid bullard and other mention  if we   re not care  this could be use for purpos with which we are not comfort   it could be use for support a currenc  and i don   t think we   d be particular comfort with that   obvious  we have to be realist   money is fungibl   they have veri larg reserv   they could be use the reserv for these other purpos and use the swap for purpos that we find accept   but i think  given the circumst  it make sens to be come up with someth that   s complementari to the imf facil and make sure that the imf facil and our facil togeth are suffici to deal with the pressur in this environ   i would be satisfi to deleg the author to the subcommitte
i   m also in favor of the program  and i agre with vice chairman     s comment that this announc along with the imf program should be suffici   but if there are other request  i think it is import to bring them back to the committe
understood   presid
i guess i   ll approv  but with reluct   i think this is a veri slipperi slope   i   m worri about other central bank gang up on us as a group  say that they have to have this   i would prefer that even these larg countri use some combin of the imf facil octob                 of     plus their own reserv to meet these need   i think that would be a better outcom and better for us in that regard   so that   s a veri reluct    yea    vote   i   d also insist that ani further expans come back befor this committe
presid  n
i   m reluct in favor of this   i won   t elabor veri much   i   m just not persuad that this is a veri valuabl contribut  as best as i can judg it   i would be in favor of limit it to these four countri   i don   t know if that   s credibl  though   certain i would be in favor of ani addit consider come back to the full committe
mr  chairman  i support the propos on the floor   i think the safeguard are meaning and real and should help   i think the bar for further consider  as nathan describ  should be high  but we shouldn   t overst what that bar is  given how circumst can chang quick   i wouldn   t want to have to chang that rule in the middl of the game  but i think the high bar languag work   on the question of deleg to the subcommitte  i think in the interest of speed it would be appropri  but given the sens around the tabl  certain make sure that the folk around the tabl were at the veri least brief as to the thought process might be a prudent path forward
okay   thank you   so the sens i hear is that peopl are will to accept it  but the bar for addit countri should be high   we should bring ani countri that we propos to add back to the fomc for approv  and we will keep you well brief on the condit  the draw  and anyth els that happen   okay   may i have a motion
i am go to say without object becaus we had a unanim view   okay   thank you   let me go on next to the econom situat
mr  chairman
do we have  e for a brief question for the manag about the fund market   it has behav a littl unusu in the last period
thank you  mr  chairman   i appreci this   i have a three part question  as you said in your present  the effect fund rate  the averag of broker transact  has been below the interest rate on reserv  and there are all of these institut that appar aren   t elig to earn interest on reserv   one  what   s the polici reason for exclud them from elig for interest on reserv   i understand the polici reason for exclud them from credit  but this is the opposit  and so i   m not quit sure whi we screen them out   second  as i read the data on your oper  it seem to me as though we have ad enough reserv to drive the fund rate virtual down to the interest rate on reserv   i want to know if that   s a fair character of the state of open market oper and the fund rate   third  i   m interest in know  especi if that   s true  whi don   t we just give up and say that the interest rate on reserv is our target rate
okay   let me take them in revers order   i don   t like to give up  but if i could just exclud that portion of it  it   s possibl that you might want to consid the interest rate on reserv or some reason facsimil thereof as your target becaus that is essenti the risk free rate that bank face   that may be the purer measur of what you   re realli tri to accomplish in term of it link to monetari polici than the feder fund rate   it   s possibl   there are obvious import govern issu that surround that choic  though  in term of what   s the board   s octob                 of     prerog and what   s the fomc   s prerog   but that   s a complet reason thing to think about  just as long as we don   t character that as give up  have we ad enough reserv to drive the feder fund rate down to the interest on reserv   well  i think not   i wouldn   t look at it quit that way becaus the gap in principl  if other thing are not go on  should be the differ between us as a counterparti and a bank as a counterparti   one is an unsecur loan between one bank and anoth bank  and the other is us as the counterparti   so normal there should be a spread between the interest on reserv and the feder fund rate   now  obvious what complic that in the current environ is the feder deposit insur corpor   s guarante on interbank fund go forward   so feder fund may be cover   in fact  they look as though they could be cover by that guarante   in that circumst  one might argu that the feder fund rate and interest on reserv should probabl be the same rate becaus there   s no differ in credit risk
excus me   without interest rate on reserv  there   s that spread plus a scarciti factor  and we   ve essenti driven that scarciti factor down to zero   that   s how i meant the question
right  but i still think that general a bank face with a choic of have risk with the fed or sell fed fund to anoth bank would want to be compens for that risk of sell  so they are go to get some posit spread
i understand that
i would say that we may well be in a situat where the interest rate on excess reserv is the effect tool for control the feder fund rate  and there may be a spread  as bill said  we are in the process of learn how this work  and it may well be the case that we need to push that interest rate on excess reserv veri close to the feder fund rate
it would not surpris me at all if  when we are finish with this process   i hope over the next six week as we go through a coupl more reserv mainten period round   that that margin might be zero and we might see the feder fund rate trade right on top of the interest rate on reserv   but we are go to have to see   i think our presumpt at the current  e would be to recommend to the board next round to narrow that spread further   it is    basi point today   anoth thing that we don   t know is how much learn is go to go on by bank  so the sell of fed fund below the interest rate on reserv is not just the gses  it is also bank  and so it   s a littl hard to understand exact whi they   re do that unless the leverag ratio is what   s drive that behavior   mayb they are just not veri well inform or they haven   t gotten their first check for the interest rate compens  so i think it   s a littl too soon to be certain about how they   re go to behav go forward   you had one other question about the polici reason for exclud the gses
there   s not realli a polici reason   i would say there   s a legal reason  the statut allow us to pay interest onli on balanc held by depositori institut   my own view is that it would be a good thing if we were abl to pay interest to the gses exact for the reason that we   ve been discuss   it might be someth we could seek author for at some point in the futur
just a clarif   if we were to take that step  are there ani other institut that particip  other than the gses
chile  mexico
we would have to look at that   i think there are more than just the three gses that we usual think of   but they   re the biggest institut that particip in the feder fund market
it is not at all clear that their behavior is go to persist necessarili  becaus they may decid to manag their short term liquid in a differ way than sell at a veri low feder fund rate to bank
mr  chairman  if i could
oh  yes
as part of my prepar when i talk to the bank  i ask them specif this question about interest on reserv  and everi singl one of them said     we haven   t had  e to even focus on it   we don   t even know what   s go on with that   we   re not chang anyth     there   s so much go on right now   so i think we   re realli go to have to wait until some of the other decisionmak has work through befor we can draw ani conclus as to what behavior this might drive

low level   exhibit   summar the enorm chang to the key condit factor that we confront in put togeth the staff forecast   as shown in the top left panel  reflect the recent plung in equiti price  the stock market path in this project is mark below the path anticip in our septemb forecast   this downward revis  togeth with the project declin in hous price that bill bassett present in his brief  leav the level of the wealth to incom ratio  plot to the right  substanti lower than in the septemb  book   as a result  over the next two year  household wealth exert a much greater drag on consum spend than we assum earlier   yield and spread on corpor bond  illustr by the baa rate in the middl left panel  soar over the intermeet period   we expect the higher cost of capit in this forecast to weigh on busi capit spend over the project period   a further drag on econom activ in the medium term is the recent jump in the exchang valu of the dollar  shown to the right   while we expect the dollar to declin a touch more quick than in the septemb  book  by the end of      it remain more than   percent abov the level assum in our previous forecast   in addit  as linda kole will discuss short  the outlook for foreign activ has deterior   a partial cushion to these factor depress activ is the plung in oil price over the past few week  the bottom left panel show the spot octob                 of     price of west texa intermedi crude oil   the path for oil price over the project period  base on futur quot  averag near     per barrel below the septemb  book path and should provid some countervail support to household purchas power and consum spend   as note to the right  accord to our standard forecast model  the lower level of equiti price  the higher bond rate  and the higher exchang valu of the dollar   all of which are intertwin with the intensif of financi turmoil   exert a consider drag on real activ over the next two year   through convent wealth  cost of capit  and term of trade channel alon  these develop would lead us to revis down real gdp growth about    percentag point  on averag  in      and        but these effect like underst the full extent of the fallout on real activ from financi turmoil   this is becaus our standard model do not explicit account for the addit effect of such factor as tighter lend standard and heighten uncertainti   consequ  for some  e we have been use supplementari analys to tri to account for these credit channel effect in our judgment project   your next exhibit provid some detail on how we updat these adjust in light of the intensif of financi stress dure the intermeet period   two measur that we have found use for measur the extent of financi turmoil are plot in the top row of your third exhibit   on the left is an index of financi market stress  and on the right is an index of bank credit standard deriv from the senior loan offic opinion survey   both index have skyrocket late  reflect the sharp deterior of financi condit   as discuss in the past two  book  we use two basic empir approach to tri to quantifi the effect of financi turmoil on real activ that are not captur by our standard model   one is base on the histor correl between these financi turmoil measur and error in frb us spend equat  and the second method incorpor these indic of turmoil into small scale vector autoregress   the middl left panel show es  of the cumul effect of our judgment adjust for financi turmoil  outsid the convent channel note earlier  the effect are shown relat to the level of real gdp in the fourth quarter of each year   the solid black line is the judgment es  built into the current  book forecast  wherea the red dash line plot the es  use in the septemb project   the shade area show the rang of result from the model base es  detail in part   of the octob  book   as you can see by compar the black and red line  we now expect that financi turmoil  outsid the usual channel  will impos a mark greater drag on real activ than we project in the last  book   for       we think that much of the unexpect weak observ recent in the spend data reflect financi turmoil effect  which put our judgment adjust near the bottom of the model base rang   in contrast  our adjust for      is in the middl of the rang of model base result  wherea for      our adjust is near the top end of the rang   we are more op ist than the model for      in part becaus none of the model base es  fulli account for what we assum will be the like restor effect over  e of the action taken by govern to mitig the problem afflict the financi system   as shown in octob                 of     the middl right panel  these restrain influenc  taken togeth  led us to mark down our assum path for the feder fund rate   we now assum that the fund rate is lower to    percent by earli next year and is held at that level until mid        although the path for the fund rate is appreci lower than we had assum in the septemb  book  the addit monetari eas onli partial offset the greater restraint on activ from the other factor shape the project   all told  as shown in the first line of the tabl at the bottom of the page  we project that real gdp will fall at an annual rate of near   percent in the first half of      and then turn up modest in the second half   in        with the drag on activ from the strain in financi market

domest spend categori to chang in real gdp are shown in line   to     as you can see  we think that consumpt will begin to recov next year and that the drag from hous will diminish over  e   in contrast  we expect busi fix invest to remain quit weak next year  reflect in part the lag effect on invest of declin busi output  the high cost of capit  and heighten uncertainti   although each of the major compon of privat domest demand contribut to the acceler in econom activ in       the contribut to growth from net export  line    is expect to turn slight negat late next year   as shown in the top panel of exhibit    the margin of slack both in labor market  the panel to the left  and in the industri sector  the panel to the right  is expect to remain substanti through the end of the

total pce inflat  line    is project to run at about the same rate as core pce inflat in both year   turn to exhibit    a critic featur of the staff forecast is our assumpt that the strain in financi

be more sever than in the baselin project   specif  risk premium on loan  corpor bond  and equiti jump a further    basi point and are slower to fall back over  e  in addit  the level of hous price fall an addit    percent relat to the baselin   we also assum that credit channel and other nonconvent effect are even more restrict in      and      than those built into the staff forecast   to a degre more in line with the bottom end of the rang of empir es  i present earlier   as shown by the red line in the middl left panel  with the intensif of the financi turmoil and the larger judgment

econom weak abroad   appar  onli a few of you assum that addit fiscal s ulus would be enact   most of you project that the unemploy rate will peak at around   to     percent in      and declin gradual over the subsequ two year   howev  you general expect that  even by the end of       the unemploy rate will still be at or abov     percent   moreov  most of you anticip that the unemploy rate in      will remain well abov your own project of the longer run unemploy rate that were provid in your trial run submiss   the central tendenc of your project for overal pce inflat is about    to   percent for      and about     to    percent for      and        rough the same as for your forecast of core pce inflat   about half of you project inflat octob                 of     rate in      close or ident to your own individu assess of the rate of inflat consist with feder reserv   s dual mandat for promot price stabil and maximum employ  where we have again judg the latter from your longer term

than   percentag point  main reflect the lag effect of weak econom activ and the relat sluggish pace of recoveri   in your forecast submiss  sever of you indic that the appropri path of monetari

pace than in the  book   exhibit   present your view on the risk and uncertainti in the outlook   as shown in the top left hand panel  all of you now see uncertainti about growth as elev relat to histor norm   as shown to the right  most of you continu to perceiv the risk to growth as weight to the downsid even with the downward revis in your modal project   sever of you point to the possibl that financi market turmoil might not subsid as quick as anticip and to signific risk of an increas negat feedback loop between credit market and econom activ   as shown in the bottom left hand panel  most of you also continu to see an elev degre of uncertainti about inflat   in june  most of you judg the risk to the inflat outlook as skew to the upsid  but as shown to the right  near all of you now see the risk to the inflat outlook as either balanc or tilt to the downsid   exhibit   summar the result of the trial run on longer term project  these project were intend to repres valu to which variabl would converg over  e  say five to six year ahead  under the assumpt of appropri monetari polici and in the absenc of ani further shock    for real gdp growth  your longer term project have a central tendenc of     to    percent and a rang of about   to   percent   for the unemploy rate  your longer run project have a central tendenc of    to   percent and a rang of about     to    percent   for both variabl  the central tendenc are veri similar to those of the project for      that you made in octob       shown in the bottom panel  a point at which mani of you view the modal outlook for      as be fair close to the balanc growth path of the economi   for pce inflat  your longer run project have a central tendenc of about    percent and a rang of     to   percent   the rang of these project is ident to the rang of two year ahead inflat project that you made last octob  the minut from that meet indic that those project were influenc import by your judgment about the measur rate of inflat consist with the feder reserv   s dual mandat of promot price stabil and maximum employ   octob                 of     the request for the trial run project suggest that converg might typic occur over a period of five to six year   one of you note that the converg process this  e will like occur over an even longer period becaus of the sever of the econom crisi   howev  appar most of you thought that converg would occur sooner than that  suggest that the configur of this trial run produc a good represent of fomc particip    view of the steadi state valu of gdp growth  unemploy  and inflat   as usual  the staff will be prepar a summari of econom project  sep  and will be circul draft to you over the next few week along with draft of the minut   the publish sep  and henc the draft  will not incorpor the longer term project from the trial run   the staff will provid to you separ a version of the sep that has been modifi to incorpor the longer term project generat by the trial run   the subcommitte will consult with the chairman about next step   one possibl would be for the committe to discuss experi with the trial run at it decemb meet and make a provision decis at that  e as to whether to proceed in januari with regular longer term project  a final decis could be made in januari   thank you   that conclud our present
thank you   befor we go too long  we   ll take a coffe break   but now let   s take some question   presid
in the forecast  the feder fund rate goe to    basi point  and i take it that   s essenti as low as you think it can go   you treat that as sort of the lower bound on nomin interest rate   is that right
that   s how we were think of it   the    basi point  howev  was not done on the basi of ani deep analyt analysi of whether that  in fact  is the zero bound  and i think that   s an issu that the staff will need to address pronto   but the messag in the forecast with that fund rate path was that we think this shock is larg enough that you will need to lower the fund rate as low as you think it can feasibl go
well  whatev that lower bound is  i have a question that   s kind of hypothet   i wasn   t a member of the committe five year ago   my understand  though  is that much thought was given to how we would conduct monetari polici if we need to reduc the nomin feder fund rate to zero or it effect equival   my understand is that the general octob                 of     conclus   and my understand is that this is mainstream economist    general view as well   is that the way we would do that would be to expand the monetari base  perhap by buy asset outsid the normal rang of asset that we would buy   now  the first question is  is that correct  then i have a follow up
may i   you can answer  but let me just make a suggest  which is that there were a number of memo and studi done in        i think we ought to look at them  updat them  and circul them fair soon   so we   ll do this in some detail  but by all mean  let   s hear the answer
presid    i would say that there are a number of strategi that the committe could think about if it were at the point that it felt it couldn   t lower the feder fund rate ani further  be that zero or some higher level   one would be communic that suggest to market particip a willing to hold short term rate at veri low level for a veri long period of  e   of cours  one could view the      experi as implement that strategi with the    consider period    languag   but obvious the idea is to tri to hold down the longer term rate that matter for spend to a larger degre than might be impli by market particip    view that you might instead begin to firm monetari polici sooner  there are a number of other possibl   as you suggest  one would be simpli to expand the feder reserv   s balanc sheet further   engag in a sort of quantit eas   the effect of that could be debat   anoth possibl that was discuss  at least in the period in which the studi were done  would be to chang the composit of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet   of cours  we   ve alreadi done a lot of that with the various lend facil  and so the scope for addit expans there would need to be thought through
the reason i ask is that my understand is that the strategi of expand the monetari base would work through increas inflat or reduc deflat
that   s not how i would think about it   i would think about it as give  if it work  depositori institut increas incent to expand their lend by provid them with a great deal more fund than they actual need and therebi increas spend propens   i would see this more as part of a packag of various way to s ul spend by reduc real interest rate but not as someth that would feed through direct to inflat   rather this would more proper be view  at least in the way i think about thing  as fight deflat rather than tri to caus a higher posit rate of inflat
my understand is that economist such as woodford and other who have studi this believ that  by use monetari asset to purchas other asset  we can make the price level and thus the inflat rate higher than it otherwis would be   is that a fair understand
i don   t think that   s right   i think the thrust of the elementari approach to quantit eas is the old milton friedman idea   that chang the composit of money and other asset chang relat return   so it   s a way to bring down return on other asset and creat s ulus even if the polici rate is down to zero
the mechan friedman sketch ul  produc a proportion increas in the price level   sn   t it
eventu  but through the aggreg demand mechan
we should look at the woodford thing  but i don   t think that   s quit the right character of his view
well  the reason i ask all of this is that  with an interest rate on reserv abov zero  that   s effect equival to a zero lower bound on nomin interest rate   so we are effect do this quantit eas
we   re pretti close  yes
right   so the thought that spark is that  if the mechan involv creat inflat  then i   d wonder what check we have on the scale of open market oper now to ensur that we   re not  by expand our balanc sheet as much as we have  risk an increas in inflat
i don   t think that   s the right character  but i   d be happi to talk about it off line   presid
i have a question   as you character the forecast in the  book  it is realli the result of veri larg adjust to the financi constraint piec   in fact  they   re about doubl what they were in the septemb  book   and those adjust or factor realli account for a larg portion  mayb not all  of the downward revis in the forecast   now  one of the input in the financi factor are spread of various kind in the var that you use to es  those   but those spread we   ve learn are veri  veri volatil   they can rise veri quick  as we   ve seen   they also can fall veri quick some    spread have actual come down a littl in the last few day  which is the good news   if our facil are success  they actual may fall further   knock on wood  that would be veri nice   but i get a littl nervous make our forecast be driven so much by someth that   s potenti veri  veri volatil  now  we get a bit of a pictur of this   and i want to applaud the staff   in i guess it was exhibit    where you were compar the baselin forecast and the two altern scenario  particular the one in which you get quicker recoveri in the financi sector   i thought that was a octob                 of     veri use exercis  and i realli appreci it   my interpret or intuit is that the    more rapid financi recoveri    scenario is what the forecast would look like had we not done the addit add factor in octob and instead held them to what they were in septemb   that suggest that the real data  whether on spend or other thing  have driven the forecast down a littl  but not a whole lot   in fact  in that scenario  you impli that the fund rate would actual be held constant at     percent   so  in look at those two scenario and tri to pars out how much risk or how much probabl to attach to them  what is the staff   s view   obvious here   s what you thought the baselin would be  but if i ask you what you think the probabl are on some of these differ scenario   in particular  i   m interest in this sort of fa  recoveri   do you have ani sens of what the probabl of these two differ outcom might be and how one might think about that   they impli veri differ path for the fund rate and veri differ forecast profil  but their differ depend on variabl that are veri  veri volatil   so can you give me some probabl of how you think about those two scenario
i can give you some probabl  but i don   t know how serious you should take them    laughter
you can give me a distribut
what we want to convey in the altern scenario that we show this  e   and we reduc the number becaus we thought the possibl littl risk that you might be face were be swamp by some realli big one   was our sens that the likelihood function is pretti flat around the baselin and the two altern scenario that we show here in exhibit     i share your discomfort   as i was tell presid   at lunch today  i feel a bit as though the forecast is go to depend a lot on when the clock stop  given how much volatil there has been in the stock market and in corpor spread   when the clock octob                 of     stop  we had close to a    percent weaker level on the stock market      basi point higher on the baa spread  and a   percent higher dollar   there were a whole lot of negat forc oper on this forecast   inde  both the convent wealth effect and cost of capit channel account for about one third of the downward revis we made   the special nonconvent credit channel effect account for a third  and a third of the downward revis realli is a combin of the stronger dollar and the weaker foreign outlook  the part that i feel most comfort with in this forecast is that there has been a veri signific negat shock to the economi and that it is difficult to imagin that activ will not be affect import by that   the part that i feel most uncertain about   and  as you point out  is relev to the polici decis that you are go to make over the next sever meet   is that i have no idea about the  e or the manner in which this will fade away   so we have it fade away gradual over the next two year   i think that a more rapid recoveri is certain a possibl   as you note  even that scenario  sn   t go back to where we were in septemb  one  the incom data suggest that the under economi is start out at a weaker place  and even if condit were to improv veri rapid over the next quarter or two  you have still sustain a hit that is go to take some  e to play out through the system   by the same token  i don   t think that you can discount the more extend and deeper financi fallout here  we have certain been surpris over the past year in mani way by just how virul and persist this shock has been   two  look at the current state of aggreg demand and aggreg activ  i think we are probabl still just at the front edg of the credit constraint effect on actual spend   so you could still be face with some veri substanti restraint on spend   and more than we have built into the baselin forecast  octob                 of     so  and as you note  the differ in the polici prescript there   the wors scenario is that the fund rate stay as low as it can stay for sever year   the other would be   put too fine a point on it   that op  control  even with the more rapid recoveri  goe down to   percent on the fund rate and then start recov to     percent   but that is obvious a veri differ polici pictur   i just don   t think that  at this point  scienc is go to allow us to put a lot of probabl mass on one of those scenario versus the other two
one quick follow on comment   in exhibit    in the middl left panel  if you look at our financi turmoil effect  with the gray shade  the bulk of the markdown in      actual is what we   re label the financi turmoil   but those are data we pretti much alreadi have in hand   we are call much of the shortfal in consumpt that we expect to see in the third quarter as    financi turmoil      so much of the weak in the second half of this year isn   t just take a flyer on what we think turmoil is go to do  some of it is alreadi in the data
i was look at the tabl in the  book  at the bottom   that   s where i was tri to back out some of this   thank you veri much
i have a question and a statement disguis as a question
not anymor    laughter
a quick question on fiscal polici  both domest and intern   be struck  ms  kole  by your verb    whack    and    disintegr      veri forc languag   what are your assumpt about fiscal polici in term of staff project  first  for the domest economi and  second  for other economi   that   s the question part
right now  although the odd are that there will be a fiscal packag next year  it is not a featur of the baselin forecast   we discuss two altern simul for differ packag  but addit fiscal s ulus is not a featur of the baselin
we made a deliber decis in construct the forecast  given the enorm uncertainti about both the size and the composit of those fiscal packag   we had so mani move part in our baselin forecast that we want to present you with that and then show you what the consequ might be  first  of a s ulus packag that look a lot like the one we had this year   which we think probabl gave a shock  but a veri short live shock  to aggreg demand and then fade away   that  sn   t realli have mani import consequ for the outlook   the second was a much larger packag that deliv some s ulus over the next two year   that had a bit of an effect in term of rais gdp growth and lower the unemploy rate   but even that      billion fiscal packag wasn   t enough  in our baselin forecast  to lift the fund rate assumpt off the floor   so i think one of the messag would be that  to have a fiscal packag that would actual influenc your current polici discuss  you have to think both that it would be extrem larg and that it would deliv s ulus over an extend period of  e to be effect that way
i think that in mani of the major foreign countri there is room for fiscal s ulus   that may be a bit of an upsid risk to our forecast becaus  for exampl  china has alreadi put some thing in place   they have increas export rebat  and they are also put more money into homebuild and tri to prop up the construct industri   japan just announc a bigger packag   i   m not so sure if it will go through   korea has announc   and even some of the oil produc are announc   plan to put money into the system   i don   t octob                 of     think we have fulli incorpor that   mayb we have thought about it in china   s case becaus we think that they will do everyth they need to do to keep that economi grow at a
so it   s possibl that we might have margin higher rate of growth than
right   i think that the unit kingdom  too  is expand fiscal polici  europ hasn   t realli announc much yet  but perhap they will do more as well
the second thing goe back to this busi of the judgment effect of financi market turmoil   do you have ani concern that the financi turmoil may have reduc the margin effect of chang in the fund rate   in other word  if you think in my simpl way of a patient on the oper tabl  we have an iv tube into them  we titrat the fed fund rate   we have been cut rate   but the tube has been crimp   the flow  i would suggest may not be as full as it would have been befor   is it possibl that we haven   t felt the full effect or  all thing be equal  we haven   t felt the same effect that we would have felt if the pipe hadn   t been crimp   i   m curious as to your view on that
the answer to that is    yes      it is certain possibl   obvious  it is veri difficult to separ thing that might actual have chang the transmiss channel of monetari polici from just big financi develop that have offset the benefici effect of eas polici   we built an assumpt into the baselin forecast that gdp respond close to the averag respons to a fed fund rate reduct  as would normal be the case   the one small technic area in which it seem as though the effect almost certain would be smaller is that  with the equiti premium so high right now  ani given chang in the fund rate is like to result in a smaller chang in the requir return on equiti and probabl a smaller stock market respons than you would normal get   so i think  basic  it is certain possibl  but in our forecast we octob                 of     have assum that the addit reduct will have gdp consequ along the line of the normal respons
okay   whi don   t we take fifteen minut for coffe  and then we   ll do part of the go round   thank you   coffe break

thank you  mr  chairman   most of the anecdot inform from the sixth district is consist with the downbeat pictur that has been emerg in the nation data   the sen ent of director and their contact has turn decid more pessimist regard current econom condit and the near term outlook   bank contact indic a further tighten of credit standard  while stress on household and small busi financ have result in increas credit card usag   a state econom develop offici note that some bank have halt their       sba lend   banker activ in the vrdn  variabl rate demand note  market note that municip are under pressur with declin revenu and higher financ cost   nonresidenti build contractor note a larg increas in the number of cancel project   advisori council member describ a substanti declin in domest ship and transport activ for most good  other than energi product  and some slow of export volum through region port   final  retail contact  in anticip of the come holiday season  note that order are down  and heavi price discount has begun alreadi  themat  atlanta   s forecast is consist with the  book  but we are project a slight more sever and protract downturn in busi activ than the  book baselin  my assumpt is that the cascad dynam at work in the financi market may take longer octob                 of     than project in the  book to come to an end   as a consequ  i view the  book   s scenario entitl    more financi fallout    as the most plausibl storylin among the like rang of outcom   i should acknowledg that we   re in an interv between the announc of the tarp and it full implement   the encourag improv in credit spread and term fund we have seen in recent day may acceler onc the tarp is oper  with inflat abat more or less as expect and with such uncertainti surround the play out of continu and recent worsen turmoil in the financi market  i have to view the balanc of risk as more negat for growth than upsid for inflat   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i think it is clear that inflat has been roll over by the steamrol of the credit crisi   i am not go to belabor what i have heard from the ceo i have spoken to   basic  the best summari is that thing have gone from interest to unbeliev   we have had an implos of econom activ   busi women and men  not have ani price power  are do what you would expect them to do   they are cut their cost of good sold  which mean they are shed head count dramat   they are stretch out their roi assumpt  and they are cut back on cap ex and  basic  assum pro cyclic behavior on the downsid   i doubt that ani of us are go to report anyth differ  particular sinc i think i am in a district that  relat speak  is still strong   i would hope that dure our discuss today we would each take the  e  or at least ask  for some respons   i would like some respons from you in particular   the situat is dire  there is no question about that   we are in dire strait   there is no inflationari tail  or if there is  octob                 of     it is complet flatten in term of the forese futur   the risk are to the downsid on econom growth  a question i have is  what do we do next   actual  i should address the issu of what we do first   i don   t think do dribbl and drab is an answer   i think we just do noth   and i could make that case becaus we   ve done an aw lot   or we do someth that is a firm statement   but in respons to that statement  the question has to be  what do we do as next step   i   m particular curious about whether or not we address dure this meet  and tonight and tomorrow  not onli next step but what the end game is   where do we want to be   how long are we go to be there  and eventu  how do we exit   but that is  of cours  the ul  question that i think we can delay   so  mr  chairman  i   d like to suggest that we not go through our standard ritual of read about our district and so on becaus i don   t think there is go to be a whole lot of differ   the real question is  what do we do about it  and what   s the cognit road map from here   thank you  mr  chairman
well  i for one will certain give my respons to that at the appropri  e  and we need to hear from everybodi   but everyon is obvious free to talk about whatev they want to talk about   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the run up to halloween  we have had a witch   s brew of news   sorri    laughter   the downward trajectori of econom data has been hair rais   with employ  consum sen ent  spend and order for capit good  and homebuild all contract   and condit in financi and credit market have taken a ghast turn for the wors   it is becom abund clear that we are in the midst of a serious global meltdown   like the board staff  i have slash my forecast for econom activ and now forese a recess with four straight quarter of negat growth start last quarter   i octob                 of     wish that i could claim that i place a lot of confid in the sober forecast  but i am sorri to say i can   t   in fact  i think we will be lucki if the advers feedback loop that is under way  sn   t wrench us into a much more pronounc and more protract downturn   the outlook for inflat has shift mark  too  with the day of heighten upsid inflat risk behind us  in fact  i am concern that beyond next year we run the risk of inflat fall below the level consist with price stabil  even befor the extraordinari deterior in financi market condit over the past few week  there were numer sign that the economi had weaken dramat   i won   t recit the litani of disappoint data but instead tri to touch upon some high  or i guess i should say low  note base on what my contact tell me   they are consist with presid     s observ   consum purchas of durabl good  especi motor vehicl  have been particular hard hit by the one   two punch of tight credit and reel consum confid   the mood on showroom floor is downright grim   one auto dealer in my district report that he is now experienc the worst period in his thirti plus year in the busi   a home applianc retail add that he has never seen more uncertainti and gloom from both the retail and the vendor   this sen ent is echo by a larg retail who say simpli     the holiday shop season is go to stink     busi are under sieg from weak

becom more cautious in manag liquid and in commit to capit spend project that can be defer   they are even cut back trade credit to custom   even firm that are current in good shape report that they are hunker down  cut back on all but essenti spend  and prepar for octob                 of     the worst   our ventur capit and privat equiti contact tell us that they are instruct their portfolio compani to cut cost  put expans plan on hold  and draw down exist credit line   the market for commerci mortgag back secur has all but dri up  and lender have also becom less will to extend fund   with financ unavail  i am hear talk about substanti cutback on new project and plan improv on exist build  as well as the potenti for distress sale of properti whose owner will be unabl to roll over debt as it matur   the deterior in overal financi condit sinc the septemb fomc meet is truli shock   even with today   s     point increas in the dow  broad index are still down about    percent  and the latest data suggest hous price in a freefal   baa corpor bond are up about     basi point sinc our last meet  low grade corpor bond are up a stagger     basi point  and to top it all  the dollar has appreci near    percent against the currenc of our trade partner   the sharp deterior in financi and credit condit will weigh heavili on econom activ for some  e   in addit  prospect for the one remain cylind in the engin of growth   name  net export   are bleak owe to the slowdown in global demand and the appreci of the dollar  we now expect real gdp to declin at an annual rate of    percent in the second half of this year and to regist two more negat quarter in the first half of next year   that forecast is predic on cut the fund rate to    percent by januari  as assum in the  book  and also is premis on anoth fiscal packag   an absolut critic pre condit for the economi to recov next year is for the financi system to get back on it feet   in that regard  i have been great hearten by the import action that the treasuri  the fdic  the fed  foreign govern  and other central bank have taken in recent week to improv liquid and inject capit into the financi system   but we are fight an uphil battl against fall home octob                 of     price  an economi in recess  and collaps confid   it is not clear whether these step will reopen credit flow to household and busi  especi those with less than  l credit   under the  book forecast we will see further larg declin in hous price over the next two year   bank and other financi institut will like suffer larger loss than mani had anticip  and that will mute the impact of recent capit inject   the interact of higher unemploy and rise delinqu rais the potenti for even greater loss by bank and other financi institut and for an intensif of the advers feedback loop we have worri about and are now experienc   such a sequenc of event plausibl could lead to outcom describ in the    more financi fallout    altern scenario in the  book  there are consider downsid risk to the near term outlook as well   as i mention  the most recent econom data have consist surpris on the downsid  and i see a real risk that the data may continu to come in weaker in the near term than the  book has assum  for exampl  a dynam factor model that my staff regular use is much more pessimist in the near term than is the  book   this model aggreg the inform contain in more than     data seri   base on the most recent econom and financi data avail  this model predict that real gdp will fall     percent in the fourth quarter   the model   s pessim reflect the combin of the recent weak data releas for the month of septemb  follow by the abysm data that we have avail so far for octob  includ financi market price  region busi survey  and consum sen ent  turn to inflat  the most recent data have been encourag   look forward  the sharp declin in commod price  especi oil price  will bring headlin inflat down relat quick   more fundament  the consider slack in labor and product market will put downward pressur on the under rate of inflat over the next few year   a number of octob                 of     my contact alreadi report that their busi are work on lower margin in the more challeng econom environ   i expect headlin pce price inflat to declin to about     percent in      and core pce price inflat to be    percent next year   i expect both inflat rate to edg down to    percent in        given the sizabl downsid risk to the forecast for growth  the risk to the inflat forecast are likewis weight to the downsid  in conclus  i think the present situat obvious call for an eas of polici  as i assum in my forecast   given the serious of the situat  i believ that we should put as much s ulus into the system as we can as soon as we can
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in spite of the fact that i am go to valid what presid   said in term of content  i am remind of what candid ronald reagan said in      against georg bush   to paraphras     i paid for the plane ticket down here   i   m go to tell you what i learn       laughter  pessim is run deep  and no one i spoke with this round was immun to the current econom and financi turmoil   even contact who have sworn for month that their prudent financi manag had insul them from fund difficulti now report be stress  the speed of the turnaround in sen ent has been breathtak   some of these new report about chang in financ condit came from larg manufactur firm that had been do well this cycl   for exampl    deer note that it financ subsidiari was have difficulti roll medium term note that fund their custom leas   this seem symptomat of financi stress becaus the subsidiari has a larg capit cushion with high valu collater back the leas   caterpillar did have better luck get such fund but onli becaus it went to the market dure a veri brief window when lender were activ seek custom with octob                 of     high credit qualiti   i also heard numer report of busi have difficulti renew long stand lend arrang with their bank  and for those who were abl to get new loan  the term were typic view as unattract   at least they felt so  sever chicago director indic that busi were success tap exist loan commit and revolv credit  much along the line that presid   just mention   howev  this was not greet enthusiast by their banker   in fact  i heard a veri interest stori about a major new york bank ceo who spent some  e in chicago a coupl of year ago   he was call a larg custom to assur him that their credit line were good and that they didn   t need to be taken down preemptiv   the custom  who is our chairman  listen polit and then tap the line anyway    laughter   no wonder bank are worri about their liquid posit  with regard to nonfinanci develop  report on both current and expect real activ have turn uniform more negat   an abrupt chang occur in septemb   peopl are spook   sorri    laughter  and it is show through to spend   retail sale are weak   i have grown accustom to the inher pessim of one of my retail contact   he has often said that busi has never been weaker in    year  but this  e he said never in    year   i also heard mani report about how the slow in demand is worldwid  in my district  the sharp slowdown is evid in the chicago purchas manag    index   in octob  it plung near    point  to       the lowest level sinc the last recess in may        this index will be public releas on friday   busi appear to be respond to the drop in demand by do anyth and everyth they can to cut back spend   labor demand is way off   my manpow contact indic that even compani that are do well had turn cautious about hire and are tri to squeez out more product   he thought octob                 of     that the drop in sen ent could have some extra impact  given that it was occur dure the annual plan cycl for corpor   the idea was that a lot of harder to sell structur adjust were be implement anyway and that ceo want to get these move done quick and have them behind them by earli        this is consist with a rang of report we have heard that new capit spend is dead in the water or that plan expans are be cancel   on a posit note  i think we are see the benefit of the structur improv and inventori manag that has occur over the last    year   my contact are report some increas in inventori  but they think that so far they have kept stock under relat good control   with prompt product cut  we may not get the addit downsid of a big inventori swing later in the cycl  perhap when it is more pain  turn to the nation outlook  our forecast envis a full blown recess  rough on the scale of the  book   but like everyon els  i have a great deal of uncertainti about this project   thing could turn out a lot wors   in contempl the transmiss from recent financi event to the real economi  there seem to be at least two channel to note   first  there is the dramat reduc avail and higher cost of credit   second  a recessionari psycholog has emerg strong in household and busi   with regard to the psycholog  i haven   t spoken with anyon this round who thought there was a good reason to undertak ani kind of discretionari expenditur   clear  the self reinforc dynam impli by these and other report could generat a deeper downturn than i have written down in my forecast   that   s a big risk   with regard to the credit channel  the hit to the nonfinanci sector has intensifi a good bit   we clear are sail in unchart water when it come to quantifi these effect  the factor identifi in the  book highlight the unpreced natur of the financi impuls to the economi  octob                 of     look ahead  i expect that the improv in financi condit will be somewhat fa  than in the  book   that is my cautious op    still  in our forecast  financi headwind weigh substanti on growth throughout      and continu  to a degre  into       accord  substanti resourc gap remain open throughout the project period   also  i expect inflat expect to declin in this depress environ   with greater slack  lower inflat expect  the reduct in energi and other commod price  and the higher valu of the dollar  we are project core inflat to move under   percent by        and i won   t be shock if the  book project for this to happen in      actual happen   so  on balanc  i think that inflationari risk are low but the downsid risk to the economi are veri high   much as presid   indic  it is much in line with the report so far   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   busi and consum sen ent in the fifth district has deterior mark   even though econom condit were alreadi deceler head into our septemb meet  a discret shift in outlook seem to have occur   it seem to me to have origin dure the week of septemb    or short thereaft   our busi contact express anxieti about the nation economi  and they express uncertainti about the mean for their firm    prospect of the astonish sequenc of event that began unfold that week   both consum and firm have been increas unwil to make long term commit and engag in discretionari expenditur   consum are delay larg and discretionari expenditur   firm have adopt a wait and see attitud on invest  octob                 of     our region survey releas this morn show a substanti drop in busi condit as well   our busi survey respond report that obtain busi loan is more difficult than three month ago  and there are widespread report of lender tighten credit term and seek to reduc exposur   most respond  howev  also indic that they would still be abl to satisfi their borrow need   when you listen to banker  they will tell you that they are tighten standard  but they also report that they are still extend credit to solid borrow with high qualiti deal  i find it difficult right now to pin down the real effect of the financi market turmoil of the last few week   as the  book note  assess such effect    pose signific identif challeng      specif  it is hard to disentangl the effect of the increas cost of bank capit from those of the deterior in the econom environ face borrow  person  i suspect the latter are play the more promin role in the tighten of credit term right now  look on the bright side  the near term inflat pictur has eas notic sinc our septemb meet  main becaus of the declin in oil and other commod price   the  book carri this moder into it long term forecast  where pce inflat now converg to   percent in        i did a doubl take when i saw that   it had me wonder whether the  book was ghost written this month by presid      laughter  whoever   s forecast it is  the longer term project moder in inflat reli heavili on the open up of a larg and persist output gap   in the current circumst  i am not sure how plausibl that stori is   in particular  i have been struggl with how to think about the effect of credit market disrupt on the concept of potenti output   to the extent that we think of these disrupt as analog to shock to intermedi technolog   and that is what the model of octob                 of     these kind of credit channel effect general tell you to do   it seem to me that we should see them as pull down potenti as well as actual output   i believ this point has been made at previous meet   we have also talk befor about the tenuous natur of the phillip curv relationship  and it is difficult to forecast   the slope is sort of flat   we had been schedul to discuss inflat dynam  and we postpon that  for good reason i believ   i hope we can get back to it soon becaus i think it   s go to be relev to how we see our way through this   in ani event  i think we should be care not to be over op ist about the forecast of an inflat declin driven by a larg output gap   the shift in the  book   s long term inflat project is noteworthi for anoth reason  i believ   we are get closer to a   percent target feder fund rate  and we may actual reach   percent at some meet soon   the last  e this happen it spark a widespread discuss of and concern about the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate  i want to make a coupl of relat observ   first  a key to conduct monetari polici at the zero bound is be abl to keep inflat expect from fall and therebi increas real interest rate   from this perspect  the revis of the  book   s forecast from     percent one meet ago to     percent for five year ahead inflat impli that we run a monetari polici regim in which five year ahead expect inflat vari pretti signific in respons to contemporan shock   i don   t think that variabl in long run inflat project can help our abil to manag inflat expect at the zero bound   we   d be better if we ran a polici in which long run expect inflat was more anchor  more stabl  you can tell where i   m go with this  i   m sure   this highlight the valu of an explicit inflat object as well as the valu of be abl to communic clear about how we view the function of monetari polici at the zero bound   second  i will just note briefli that the octob                 of     econom of monetari polici at the zero bound are close relat to the econom of pay interest on reserv at close to the target rate   in fact  if i   m not mistaken  they are virtual ident   i think progress on both front would be use right now  final  let me just comment on financi market condit   my sens is that what the public has seen   the larg failur  the varieti of resolut techniqu  the deliber lead up to the congress   s adopt of the bill it adopt   taken togeth have ad up to signific pessim on peopl   s part and have alter op  strategi for a lot of financi institut  so i think that is alter how peopl alloc portfolio and has led to further volatil in certain market   it has led some institut to adopt a wait and see attitud  to see how particular program are go to be implement   i think that we are see at least some dead weight loss associ with the burden of shift financi flow between thing that are cover and thing that aren   t and we are see a good deal of rent seek behavior as well   what we are see is go to have the effect of mask the evolut of under fundament   it is go to make it harder to see our way through this and understand just what is happen   i think that is go to be a thicket that we will need to cut through in the month ahead   that conclud my comment  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   while the libor   oi spread has narrow somewhat  the mutual fund industri is no longer experienc wave of redempt  and commerci paper market condit have improv  we   re still not back to the short term credit condit that prevail befor the failur of lehman brother   this outcom is strike consid the histor intervent that have occur in the past month   with all of the new octob                 of     govern guarante and equiti infus here and abroad  the limit improv in short term credit market attest to the degre of concern and risk avers prevail in financi market  these concern are like to becom even more elev if the economi slow to the degre expect in most forecast   like the  book  our forecast anticip a signific recess  the boston forecast includ three consecut quarter of negat gdp growth and result in an unemploy rate peak abov     percent   the weaken labor market and the larg loss in hous and stock wealth make it quit like that consumpt will shrink in the second half of this year   while we need hous to reach bottom  mortgag rate relat to feder fund rate remain quit high  and further job loss are like to aggrav the upward trend in foreclosur and add to the downward pressur on hous price   with limit new home purchas and demand for vehicl weak  consumpt of consum durabl is unlik to recov until next year  commerci real estat  which has held up reason well  all thing consid  is like to be much weaker next year as new and rollov financ is difficult to obtain and staff cut and hire freez affect the space need by busi   more general  firm are like to have littl incent to make new invest until the sever of the downturn becom much clearer  unfortun  mani of our trade partner are like to face an even more sever downturn  aggrav by their slow fiscal and monetari respons to deterior econom and financi condit   while the  book assum the stock market will rise by   percent for the remaind of this year   it look as though that happen today
nice job  dave    laughter
i think that just offset the declin that had happen sinc the  e we finish the  book    laughter
i would say that i   d be surpris by that outcom  octob                 of     there are sever loom financi problem that are like to affect financi market   bill   highlight the one that i think is the biggest for me  which is that the nav  net asset valu  trigger for hedg fund will be a signific problem in the fourth quarter   without comprehens inform on hedg fund  it   s difficult to know the extent of the problem they are face  howev  sinc the stock market remain one of the few market avail for the dispos of asset in bulk without a signific liquid haircut  i   d expect signific sell in the fourth quarter   my second big concern is that rollov financ will becom more problemat as financi problem persist   particular expos are real estat develop and high leverag privat equiti firm   my third worri is that neither insur compani nor commerci bank have reserv for the econom outcom in our baselin forecast   under reserv and high payout ratio are like to limit the amount of addit lend that bank are will to take on   these financi problem place addit downsid risk to our forecast  our forecast  like the  book forecast  expect the rate of inflat to slow as a result of fall food and energi price and signific excess capac emerg in the economi   in fact  our equat indic there is a non neglig risk that deflat will be a problem in the outyear of our forecast   unlik presid    i was surpris that it stay as high as   rather than as low as     the outlook for a weak real economi and fall inflat highlight the need for both monetari and fiscal polici to offset some of the financi and econom problem that we are like to experi   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just briefli say that  in our region  we have continu to do actual better than the nation averag  but that is begin to wane   we are see  obvious  the energi effect show itself as rig are be put out of product and you see a octob                 of     slow there   we are see some concern be rais about agricultur price and the boom that has been go on in that part of the economi  that said  there   s still a reason amount of busi go on that they haven   t frozen up  we ask our director and our other advis how they were see thing  and it vari   there were some organ that say that our non invest grade borrow from the bank  if they had credit alreadi  are still abl to access those line   if they lost some portion becaus of a bank problem or someth like that  they cannot get new credit  so it is cut off in that way   i think that   s import to keep in mind   busi themselv are begin to pull back on their capit plan  they   ve said that   their balanc sheet   obvious outsid the auto industri   are still decent  but they   re say     we   re look at this  and we   re pull back until we see how it play out      you are begin to hear more of that   they feel that they can get credit   some of them are talk about actual tri to pull down their line to make sure they have the money  and the onli thing keep them from do that is they don   t know what to do with it onc they get it   so that   s their dilemma   they   re afraid of lose their credit  but they also know that it cost if they pull it down  so the dynam there are interest  on the nation outlook  i   ll be brief   i think that obvious the project for recess are in place   down is where we   re go   how much  though  is specul right now   i don   t know  i don   t know that anyon   until we begin to see thing settl out   inflat should be down as well   obvious  when you have a recess  you will back off from that  but how much   that   s not clear at this point   there is a lot in play  and that   s whi we don   t know the answer to those question   we have these liquid facil and an enorm amount of liquid out   we have the tarp that is now in process but not complet   that   s go to have an impact  and i think those are veri import   as we discuss our own polici  we are veri close to the point of the quantit octob                 of     eas discuss that we had  as you said  in        pull that materi out and take a look at that is import as we decid what we   re go to put our money into as we tri to s ul this economi   right now we   re subject to wait and see   there   s been a lot done  and attitud are a critic part of this now  and we just have to wait to see how those chang over the next quarter or two   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m not go to say much about the district condit   in the third district  as mani of you have note  they   ve weaken consider   i will make just a coupl of observ that i think might be pertin   our last busi outlook survey  the one that was releas a week ago  had actual gone into posit territori in septemb to      which was the first posit read we had had sinc januari   sinc  i guess  last decemb  actual   and it drop from that plus     to minus      in one month   now  it   s relev to know the  e of this a bit   our survey is done dure the first   week or the first    or    day of each month   which meant that the septemb survey was close on septemb       day befor that weekend   so what we see is a veri precipit  dramat chang in the tone that had as much to do with event and perhap polici action as with what was actual go on in the economi  i share a bit of presid     s concern to tri to disentangl a littl the tone and feel of the economi  which realli did feel as though it fell off a cliff in septemb  unlik ani other month that i   ve seen dure this episod   we have to think care about disentangl that effect not just becaus someth fundament happen to the economi but also to see to what extent polici  whether our polici or treasuri   s polici  have contribut to a chang in tone and increas uncertainti and aggrav what might be the real fundament go on   i don   t know the answer octob                 of     to that question  but it suggest someth that mani of us have argu over  e   that more consist and more predict polici can help us avoid some of that  one special question that was ask in this survey in octob was whether firm had troubl get credit   interest enough  onli    percent of the respond report that they had troubl obtain credit  but twice that number  almost    percent  report that they believ that their custom were have troubl get credit  which was an interest dynam go on that lead to a bit of uncertainti   i guess the best thing i can say about the third district right now is    go philli       laughter   mayb that will turn thing around in the third district  anyway  let me turn briefli to the nation outlook   it has deterior  certain more than i expect  from what i thought in june   in our confer call on octob    i indic that i was revis my forecast downward   i expect the economi to contract dure the second half of this year and perhap in the first quarter of next year   but that   s less clear to me   and then gradual approach what i would consid trend growth over       so that by the end of      we   re get back toward what might be consid trend growth  which i consid to be about     to     percent  in essenc  for          i push out my recoveri of the economi by somewher between six and nine month becaus of the current turmoil   i expect the unemploy rate to peak around mid       at about    and then to declin gradual to it long run rate of about   percent by the end of        inflat pressur have subsid somewhat sinc june  and inflat expect have remain contain   i expect core inflat to declin gradual from the current level to my goal of about     percent by       now  my overal forecast is consider better than the  book baselin forecast   in fact  it   s similar to what we talk about as the    more rapid financi recoveri    scenario  which make some of the adjust for the financi turmoil somewhat quicker and somewhat less octob                 of     dramat than in the baselin   the fed fund rate path under my forecast is less accommod than the  book   i assum that the fed fund rate remain at     percent through the spring of next year and then gradual begin to rise  reach    percent by the end of       now  there are certain risk around that forecast   somebodi at this tabl has to be a littl more op ist after all  and we have risk around all forecast in this environ   certain mine is no except   in particular  the effect of the financi market  as we   ve all been talk about  remain high uncertain and high riski  and i am not tri to disregard that   everi day it seem as though there   s a new develop  usual negat  although i guess     point on the dow today should be consid good news  but in fact  i believ that the risk around the  book baselin forecast are to the upsid  as i have allud to   first  the baselin entail a sizabl downward adjust base at least part on the volatil financi data  especi spread   spread can fall dramat  although they don   t alway do so   but they can rise and fall veri quick  and i think it   s veri riski to base monetari polici  which ought to be take a longer term perspect  on week to week movement in such volatil variabl   if spread do continu to fall over the next quarter or two as they have in recent day and if the financi market tool we   ve put in place have the desir effect  we could see the economi becom much stronger than the  book   s baselin   second  in the  book  inflat fall and remain low despit a veri low fed fund rate path   in fact  it   s reminisc of the fund rate path in           this appar is due to the sizabl output gap that open up in the forecast period   now  these output gap aris in the forecast becaus the effect of the financi turmoil show up main in aggreg demand   howev  as i   ve suggest in previous meet and as presid   allud to  i think a plausibl altern view is that the financi market disturb we   ve experienc   result in a restructur of the financi system and a lower octob                 of     of the effici of financi intermedi   act on the suppli side as well  much like a somewhat persist product shock with an associ damp effect on measur of potenti gdp for some period of  e   if so  we   ll see much smaller output gap open up  and that mean the risk of higher inflat than in the  book  especi if the baselin fund rate path is follow as they lay out  in think about the appropri monetari polici go forward  it   s import that we not let our polici be whipsaw by volatil market data   we have been lower the fund rate sinc januari  larg in anticip of a recess or to mitig the chanc of one occur   now  it may final have arriv     that mean we have to lower more   a difficult question   the level of the fund rate is alway a difficult question   clear  if we experi a sustain slowdown in real econom activ  which suggest a lower equilibrium in the real rate of interest  polici need to allow the fund rate to fall with the equilibrium rate  and i base my recommend throughout the year on such a forecast   but i think it   s a mistak to overreact to volatil data  especi when it   s the stock market   although there has alway been the desir and much pressur from market to do someth when we see such swing in the market  in my view  the economi is better serv if monetari polici is a steadi hand  take appropri action when the intermedi term view dictat  but not overreact to fluctuat in the market with an inappropri tool   thank you  mr  chairman
i have a question about the potenti output view   so you would also have to argu that the natur rate of unemploy is higher becaus of this
you think that   s plausibl   i mean  i understand whi product capac would be affect  but whi do you
well  i don   t like the nairu  but in my baselin forecast  my natur rate of unemploy is higher than what the  book has
but it rise becaus of the financi situat   i see
yes  right
if i could  mr  chairman  in the dynam stochast general equilibrium model  one of which i understand has been adopt by the staff for use in forecast  employ fluctuat with shock to product  and it   s the natur correspond to that   so in some sens the unemploy rate rise becaus the natur rate rise  but that   s a way of say that the natur rate goe up in recess   i   m not sure if propon of the natur rate view that as consist with that old model  but that   s what happen in these model
employ fluctuat  but to get unemploy you need a richer pictur of match  or someth like that
right   you need some match model  and you get intersector flow  you get the same thing
but even in my steadi state  if i view this as a perman ineffici in financi intermedi that chang thing  the unemploy rate is a littl higher
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start with a few comment about the district economi  which will sound pretti familiar by now   the preponder of the anecdot from busi contact that i   ve talk with sinc our last meet have been distinct negat   it   s not just a slow of activ or some deterior but a sharp contract in activ  particular with regard to discretionari spend or discretionari project  begin in the middl of septemb  the one except to that is commerci construct  where there are enough thing under way that octob                 of     busi remain pretti good   but the backlog are drop  and so weak certain is anticip next year   i thought anoth possibl except to the negat tone was the hous market in the twin citi   not that the hous market in the twin citi is in and of itself so import but that it might be repres of some middl of the road market across the countri  clear  it   s not indic of what   s go on in florida  california  or place like those becaus sale volum in the twin citi had been up distinct   some of that is no doubt due to short sale and foreclosur  nevertheless  there were some other sign that were favor   the afford index has realli improv a lot   it is back to level of          which realtor call veri comfort   the ratio of hous price to rent has move back to the level of          and that   s also encourag   i alreadi mention the higher sale volum  unfortun  when you get beyond those statist and look at other thing  it   s too earli to declar stabil in the hous market or anyth resembl under improv   part of the problem is someth that we   ve talk about befor   the inventori of unsold  unoccupi properti remain veri substanti   by histor experi way abov anyth resembl normal   second  even though the price to rent ratio has come down  it   s still elev relat to the longer term histor experi   so it look to me as though  even in that market  there are some further price declin to come and it   s go to take some more  e to get through all of this   probabl well into next year  as far as the nation economi is concern  i  too  have mark down my outlook for real growth for the balanc of this year  for all of next year  and into earli      as well   this reflect to some extent the natur of the incom data but also the intensif of the financi problem and associ headwind  the impact of the negat wealth effect  and so on   when i look at my june forecast  back then the forecast obvious look better  although there were a number of what octob                 of     i call    identifi negat      they have proven  for wors rather than for better  to be relev  i alreadi talk about some of them   in addit  we still have the problem in hous with excess inventori   we have steadi declin in employ  which obvious have negat implic for consum spend  and the credit headwind as well   so now i have the economi contract through the middl of next year  modest growth resum thereaft  and robust growth begin with the second quarter of        quit some distanc off  on the inflat outlook  i have for some  e been think that inflat would begin to slow this quarter   with the declin in commod price  the evolut of the econom outlook  and so forth  my confid in that forecast has increas  and i do expect inflat to diminish over the forecast period   so i think i   ll conclud with that
okay   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i concur with the view that we face a veri serious situat   in most respect i agre with the  book baselin project  with the reason that the board staff use to arriv at the project  and with their view that the risk to growth are to the downsid   like the  book project  my project is heavili influenc by judgment that we are bring to the project from forc that are not captur by our model  the magnitud of the judgment adjust has becom strike larg  as we talk about earlier  and i realiz that  if one want to be a skeptic about the  book baselin  one would have to look no further than these assumpt and question their signific influenc on the outlook  but i am not a skeptic   dure the past few week  in our bank we have step up our contact with busi peopl from larg  medium  and smaller busi  banker  and local govern offici   we have been ask them to tell us not so much what they think and feel but what has actual happen to their order book  product run  and account receiv and what octob                 of     action they are take as a result   it suffic to say that the feedback about the environ was overwhelm negat   respond say that their situat has gone either from good to bad or from bad to wors  and i want to share just two anecdot that i think captur the essenc of what we are face   one of them from a busi perspect and the other from a consum perspect  one of my director is the ceo of a compani that produc and sell forklift truck all over the world   he report last week that his sale are down and order have fallen off dramat  and he expect to be announc some layoff soon   but what was make a greater impress on him is the fact that order for the forklift part have fallen off as well  and this tell him that the warehous oper have cut back on the use of truck that they alreadi own   my second stori concern the owner of a bodi shop that is locat in a solid  middl class communiti   he told us that he was do record busi all year until last month  when busi just went dead   he said it is not that peopl sudden don   t need auto repair  but in fact  they are collect the insur money and not fix their car   they want the cash and they don   t want to pay out the deduct  stori like these convinc me that the  book baselin is on the right track   i do part compani with the  book in one respect   name  the longer term inflat outlook   i think it is quit like that we are go to experi some cost realloc of resourc across some sector of the economi   financ and construct are two obvious exampl   go forward  i think there is reason to think that fewer worker and less capit are go to be employ in these sector   the cost adjust is go to be character by slower product growth  higher trend unit labor cost  and a smaller output gap than would otherwis occur  lead to somewhat less disinfl in the outyear in my project   nevertheless  with output and inflat expect to declin sharpli over the come quarter  i think it is essenti for us to be think about the zero bound in conduct monetari polici in a low inflat environ  and i will address the octob                 of     magnitud   e  and communic aspect of our monetari polici in tomorrow   s go round  thank you  mr  chairman

we have some data this morn   dave  would you like to discuss this
yes   you have at your place a tabl on order and shipment of durabl good  one of the more inscrut releas to actual make sens of  but the bottom line is veri littl effect on our basic outlook here   as you can see in that second set of number  the shipment area exclud the aircraft line was up   percent in septemb   that was actual a littl stronger than we had pencil in  but onli enough to add a few basi point to gdp growth in the third quarter   then you can see that it has basic been averag flat for the last two month  this is a septemb figur  so it   s fair date at this point   the order figur  the set of number abov   again look at the    exclud aircraft    line   have been come down   i wouldn   t say that they   re collaps  but they   re certain weaken some   so this realli has no appreci effect on our outlook for a small declin in equip spend in the third quarter and a more appreci declin in the fourth
the resolut of the boe strike have ani macro implic
we actual predict that the strike would end this week   it did
my  you   re good
it wasn   t look too good last week    laughter   but we   re expect that it would provid a small rebound effect on first quarter gdp growth   it   s go to take a littl while to get product back on track here     the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix
other question for dave   okay   if not  let   s continu with our go round   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   we expect a recess at least as bad as the           recess  with a signific risk of a deeper  more protract downturn wors than the      s  and a veri substanti rise in the unemploy rate   inflat is deceler quick  and deflationari forc are ascend around the globe   the huge declin in energi and commod price will add to a veri substanti downward pressur on core inflat from increas econom slack around the world   we could see an abrupt chang in inflat expect into deflationari territori  we   ve seen a lot of polici action over the past few week   one question is whether policymak should wait to measur the effect of these measur befor go further  and i want to talk a littl about that question   my view is that i don   t think so   the outlook has been deterior ahead of the polici respons   this is true both here and around the world   the magnitud and speed of the tighten financi condit  the eros in busi and consum confid  the fall in actual spend  and the shift in inflat risk togeth present veri grave risk to growth and to the financi system   mitig these risk is go to requir more monetari polici here but even more so in the other major economi   but in addit to the veri substanti eas in the global stanc of monetari polici ahead  the substanti damag that has alreadi happen to financi intermedi global suggest that a broad base and quit larg fiscal s ulus will be critic to prevent an excess fall in aggreg demand  how quick and how far should we reduc the feder fund rate in the unit state   the  book and the bluebook present a veri strong case for move down anoth     basi point quick   in fact  if i read the pictur in the bluebook correct  they might impli a need to get real octob                 of     rate to the negat   to negat   percent territori relat quick  if we could do that   if we don   t move anoth    today  we   ll be behind again   monetari polici has effect tighten substanti sinc the summer  of cours  becaus of the intensif of financi pressur and becaus of the rise in forward real interest rate that have come with the rapid deceler in expect futur inflat   beyond this meet and this choic  our choic are harder   i think we need to get real rate lower and  to make sure we get them there  we need to keep them low enough long enough   this requir that we get the nomin fed fund rate as low as possibl as soon as possibl   i don   t see a good case for monetari polici gradual in the current context   the risk are too great   if we   re too tentat  the damag to the financi system and to the real economi could be much greater and much harder to correct   if we end up do too much  we can alway adjust   that   s an easier problem to solv   it just requir will   with global financi market place progress more weight on a veri sever global recess  the    keep our powder dri    and    reserv our remain ammunit    argument don   t seem that compel to me   we don   t have much ammunit left in the fed fund rate anyway   if we hold that back  it will like be less effect when we ul  use it   the more power escal option we have left will probabl involv communic  such as continu commit to keep rate low enough long enough that we avert creep expect of deflat and can be confid that inflat will come in around our target level over the forecast period  i don   t have a strong view now about how low we can go with the nomin fed fund rate without caus too much risk of damag to the function of financi system   we need to look at all possibl option  though   i think the princip focus of our staff   s work in the come week will be to put togeth a set of altern polici option go forward along with the analysi of their benefit and risk so that we   re in a posit to act quick enough to be effect   just a few octob                 of     final point   i think this basic risk manag choic realli involv three dimens of judgment   one is about the relat probabl of altern outcom   the second is about the relat consequ of or the damag caus by those altern scenario   import  it also involv a judgment about the eas of correct  adjust  or mitig the consequ of be wrong  this is just a styliz present  but in the staff note ye day  there was a nice way to think about those choic   i just want to point out one thing about this styliz framework of those choic  which is the consequ   if you look at exhibit    the bottom left panel  which show the inflat outcom associ with the    more rapid recoveri    scenario  in this present you don   t have much risk of a veri bad inflat outcom in the event that we end up do too much with too much polici and have to take that back   again  it   s import to recogn that it   s not just about the probabl that we attach to the altern scenario   it   s not just about the relat impact of the consequ of those scenario   it   s about the eas with which we can correct for a judgment that was wrong   in this case  a judgment that we did too much   this may underst the complic in correct for that error and may make it look easier than it may ul  be  but i think it   s a nice framework  final  i just want to point out  just to underscor the basic point   this is not go to be princip about monetari polici go forward   if you look at the broad framework of polici that are now in place  both here and global  and the instrument we have to play with  along with the fiscal author  we have monetari polici  we have the liquid arrang and what we do with our balanc sheet over  e  we  the collect integr govern  have the broad fiscal polici question and the scope for either a broad base substanti fiscal packag or more target fiscal measur  as the chairman suggest  to focus on the credit market  and we have the octob                 of     capac to alter the framework of capit and guarante that is now in place   beyond that  the govern here also has the abil to chang what the gses  the fha  and the fhlb can do   so when we think about escal go forward  to go to presid     s question from ye day  we have the abil on all these front to do more if that   s necessari and prudent   but i think the mix has alreadi chang substanti   it was probabl most fiscal nine month ago   it is certain most fiscal now in a broader sens  except that mani of the major economi go forward will have to move monetari polici veri substanti   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   a number of the present ye day talk about fall off a cliff in the middl of septemb   i think we need to remind ourselv that we were slide downhil pretti fast befor we hit that cliff   the third quarter data  which aren   t realli affect by what happen in the last two week of septemb  indic that the economi was weaker than we thought at the  e of the last fomc meet   i think dave   or norm morin note that about a third of their downward revis reflect incom data rather than the credit tighten   that was especi true for consumpt  with real consumpt spend fall through the summer  respond to lower employ and tighter credit   privat domest final purchas were revis down to a declin of     percent in the third quarter after be flat in the first half  hous price declin pick up in august  and i think the deterior economi and concern about the economi were reflect in increas nervous in financi market over the summer into the first half of septemb   it was realli those worri about what the loss were go to be and how they would spread from mortgag to loan book general   that deepen pessim   that doom the margin institut like aig and lehman and the gses   they just octob                 of     didn   t have a chanc to recapit or stabil themselv when so mani of the other market particip were worri about what their own posit would be   the result flight to liquid and safeti  the loss of confid that follow  the deepen gloom  and the failur and near failur and associ loss trigger a tremend tighten of financi condit over the intermeet period   presid   and other discuss this   despit the    basi point of eas   even after the     point increas ye day  equiti price are down about    or    percent over the intermeet period   the dollar is up    percent   corpor borrow rate are up for invest grade corpor     to     basi point   bank tell us that they   re tighten across everi dimens of their lend  and other lender  like financ compani  are also cut back veri  veri sharpli   you can see this in auto clear  but the stress is much broader than just the auto financ compani  we have good program in place to deal with mani of these problem   the capit  the fdic guarante  and the feder reserv balanc sheet facil   and they are have some effect relat to the freez up of market that we had in mid septemb   we can see that interbank spread and libor have come down some   commerci paper rose  i guess  on monday with the introduct of our facil   declin in money market mutual fund have abat  though they   re still there  and there are some sign that matur are begin to lengthen in fund market   as these program are more fulli implement  we   ll see some greater effect   includ  i hope  some greater willing to extend credit   i also assum that the fiscal packag is necessari  as in the  book    fiscal s ulus    altern  but we need to rememb that the improv we   ve seen over the last coupl of day is relat to a situat in which fund market were in effect frozen beyond a veri short term  and although a sharp snapback is possibl  as presid   was note ye day  i think further octob                 of     gain are more like to be gradual   in the past few day  the declin in libor have seem veri grudg and gradual  and libor remain quit high   i think close to    basi point higher   relat to what it was in mid august  befor we even cut rate   this was three month libor that i look at this morn   in an environ of econom weak  spread credit problem  fall hous price  a number of fals dawn in this episod so far  and death and near death experi  lender and investor are go to continu to be veri cautious and conserv their liquid and capit   so despit further improv  financi condit will remain quit tight  the effect of lower wealth  higher borrow cost  the stronger dollar  and tighter nonpric term of credit will play out over the next few quarter  put downward pressur on an economi that was alreadi in recess  at the same  e  heighten uncertainti and fear of futur problem caus a sharp deterior in attitud and spend even apart from the effect of credit   judg from the confer board index  region purchas manag survey  and anecdot   includ what we heard around the tabl ye day   it feel like a recessionari psycholog  as i think     call it   other talk about pull back and curtail of discretionari spend in train  and this is not just caus by credit effect   this is just fear   so we   ve had a downward shift in aggreg demand as well as a movement along the aggreg demand curv  and this downward shift in aggreg demand will propag through multipli   acceler effect even if attitud begin to improv some  the global dimens of the shock are import   as we talk about ye day  heighten risk avers has had a pronounc effect on emerg market economi as well as on industri economi   net export cushion domest weak in the first half of the year  but with the dollar strong  if anyth we   ll be absorb weak from abroad  not export it  as the octob                 of     rest of the year goe on and we get into next year   grow credit problem abroad will onli add to pressur on mani larg global lender who might have thought they were diversifi geograph   but a littl like our u s  hous market  they will find that diversif  sn   t realli work when there   s a global recess  the net effect of all of this is a much weaker growth path for the economi   in my forecast  i had a somewhat steeper near term declin in econom activ and a slight sharper bounceback than the staff  includ my fiscal assumpt  but i also have the unemploy rate peak at over   percent  as the  book did   with commod price plung  the ad slack maintain through sever year  and declin in inflat expect  inflat will be on a clear downward track   in the  book  this downward track for inflat obtain even with the assumpt of some rebound in commod price and the resumpt of dollar weak   in my forecast for inflat from next year on  inflat was at or below the     to   percent rate i would like to see as a steadi state consist with avoid the zero bound when advers shock hit  critic  the downsid risk around activ forecast are huge and tilt to the downsid   i think they   re huge becaus we   ve never seen a situat like this befor  certain not in my experi date all the way back to       and have onli the vaguest notion of how it will play out in financi market and spend   i think they   re tilt to the downsid becaus i  like the staff  assum a gradual improv in financi market   that could be delay or even go in the wrong direct for a  e  further tighten financi condit   in addit  the effect on spend of the heighten concern and tighter credit condit could be larger and longer last than i assum   for some  e an import downsid risk to the forecast has been a sharp upward revis to household save as wealth  job avail  and borrow capac erod   i assum a moder increas in the save rate  but i can definit see the possibl that advers octob                  of     develop will galvan a  more thorough rethink by the household sector of what save is need  and that will affect invest as well as consumpt   we   ll get to the polici implic of all of this in the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   the first sentenc of the  book said that    recent econom and financi news has been dismal     and the last sentenc on page   of the bluebook said that    market general remain extrem illiquid and volatil      i can   t do better than that  but i can certain do wors  so let me give that a tri    laughter  market price and offici and corpor data confirm an addit leg down in mid septemb  which has been much discuss   i think it is go to becom increas clear that octob  particular the first    day of the month  was materi wors   so if we fell off the cliff in the middl of septemb  i think that onc the data come out and find their way into the marketplac in octob  the  book forecast might look a bit more posit than the fact on the ground would suggest   as a result  my own forecast is less op ist than the  book  but there is plenti of uncertainti  as i think dave   talk about ye day  let me make a few comment about financi market befor turn to the broader economi   i expect a prolong period of signific strain credit market  and that strain is like to be exacerb between now and year end and i suspect even well into        the credit intermedi process that we   ve talk about is fundament broken   i talk six month ago about the financi architectur that was fundament be chang   i think that has all happen fa  than i could have anticip   confid  not just in counterparti but in basic rule of do busi across financi market  has been lost  and my own sens is that loss of confid is not easili fix  even by well intend govern program   we should all be quit patient in octob                  of     term of see the benefit of the rather dramat action taken by the offici sector  both here in the unit state and oversea   corpor bond rate and other risk spread may well fall from their recent peak  as suggest in the  book  but spread across asset class are like to stay far wider than histor norm throughout the forecast period   i think these new spread relationship are uncertain   so what we thought would be sort of normal spread of libor and normal spread of corpor bond  all have to be reassess not just by us but also by market particip   even if credit is now made more avail to busi through some of these new treasuri and other program  i suspect the all in cost of capit is like to materi imped busi invest  particular given expect by busi for a weaker economi in the upcom period   as vice chairman   suggest  monetari polici might be abl to do a bit about this  but it is not go to be abl to chang it veri much  let me turn to three point on the economi befor close   first  in the near term  given my sens of how octob is track  it   s like to be extraordinarili weak   i expect weaker fourth quarter consumpt than the  book  weaker labor market go into       and a materi weaker fourth quarter gdp print   some labor survey   includ some of my own prefer measur  like the jolt   seem to be hold up  but i   m not sure that that   s go to hold for anoth coupl of month   so i   d expect the labor market to trend more materi in the direct that i   ve discuss  well  what about beyond the near term   what about      and beyond   it strike me that the catalyst for mark improv are lack   when i think about fiscal polici  regulatori polici  tax polici  and trade polici  which i talk about previous  it   s not obvious to me that ani of those are go to provid some kind of catalyst for a mark chang in the contour of the economi   on the fiscal front  i assum that the fiscal s ulus is like to be larger  mayb even octob                  of     materi larger  than in the  book altern simul  but my own conclus are similar to the  book   s  which is that i   m not sure it   s go to be terribl effect   i   m not sure it   s go to be construct in that way  and i   m not sure it will do near as much as it will inevit be advertis to do   a more disturb trend probabl even than the efficaci of a fiscal packag   which in my own view is absolut necessari  but again i queri whether it   s go to be structur in a way to do what it need to do   is that potenti output in the forecast period is like to fall  trend growth rate are come down  and i expect product to fall perhap even more than in the  book project   the vaunt resili of the u s  economi  which i   ve talk about for a long  e  is certain go to be test dure this period   busi invest  it strike me  will be a use gaug as we get into the first quarter of      to see how tough an econom period we have in front of us  and i worri about the decis that busi peopl will be make   now  of cours  against all of this  market could snap back  as we saw a littl ye day        could look better   we have to remain open mind about the possibl that the economi will continu  as it has over the past ten or fifteen year  to outperform model base expect  let me turn to foreign growth   these decoupl  which were so promin for so long  are somehow hard to find these day   foreign growth strike me as like to fall fa  and stay lower than in the  book project   the road back is not like to begin as earli as the first quarter of      for our major trade partner   the    more financi fallout    altern simul strike me as signific more like for foreign growth   in light of a growth trajectori that is better here in the unit state than outsid the unit state  at least relat to current market expect  i   d expect the foreign exchang valu of the dollar on balanc to strengthen against a basket of foreign currenc  octob                  of     so let me turn final to inflat   the trend on import price  the broad measur of commod price  and the expect dollar strength all suggest that inflat problem are abat mark   i think an open question  which isn   t like to be disposit but is like to be interest  is how sticki price are  particular from the consum product compani dure this period   how long the various surcharg and increas in price we   ve seen can stay high and the compani attempt to keep profit margin   my guess is that they can make profit margin look decent for anoth quarter or two  but beyond that  price across a broad set of product and servic are like to retrac some of the gain in recent period   i   ll save the balanc of my remark for the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you   well  the autumn bonfir have realli sort of heat up sinc the last fomc meet   i think we have evid in the unit state and now worldwid of what emerg market literatur call    sudden stop      a sudden stop of the flow of capit  the so call flow of hot money  into latin america or other countri and the devast impact that could have when sudden credit is no longer avail   i   ve been talk about the slow burn of the problem in the credit market  but i think we saw that move up to a differ level global over the past six week   this is the concern that we had earlier in the year about a regim shift   we seem to have move from a growth regim to a slide by with some growth regim and now to a contractionari one and the nonlinear effect that we had been concern about  as we alway say  it   s particular difficult to predict where the economi is go to go  but there   s evid of whi it   s so difficult becaus almost ani measur of volatil is up dramat   that   s true on the financi market side  on the real side  as well as just in movement of consum confid   so i think that we can say with some confid that it is particular octob                  of     difficult to predict which way thing are go to go   as mani peopl have said befor  a few spread have come down  but given the extent of our action and those of other govern around the world   central bank  fiscal author  et cetera   it is surpris that there has been so littl effect  now  mayb it   s just becaus so much is go on that there   s a fair amount of confus and uncertainti about what the program mean  how they will actual be implement  and to whom they will be appli   i think that   s perhap part of the reason for some of the spread not come down with respect to interbank borrow   there is a lack of clariti about exact how the fdic program will oper and exact how the tarp will oper   we   ll hear more about that in a bit  but i think it   s go to take  e for peopl to feel confid about how that will work   also  i think there is real uncertainti becaus after thirti day some bank may not get the guarante or may have the guarante pull back   i think there is also a lot of uncertainti about who will get tarp fund and who is qualifi for tarp fund   as inform come out about peopl not be qualifi or market be concern that individu institut are not go to be qualifi  that could put on a lot of pressur   unfortun  that   s go to be come in addit to the end of the year pressur   so i see a number of loom risk  particular in the financi servic sector  as we fulli implement and clarifi some of the program that i think on balanc can be help but that can actual caus some uncertainti at individu institut   other have also mention broader challeng in the emerg market and the insur compani and certain we have the hedg fund redempt that are loom   i   m veri concern about tri to get over the end of the year with so mani differ piec put addit pressur on   even some of the piec that we thought would be help potenti have a lot of downsid risk to them  octob                  of     but even if we get through this   and the govern guarante program  the special liquid facil  and the negat real rate that we have and potenti may make even more negat would provid some support   the fundament uncertainti is not go to be resolv until we see what is go to work in the financi sector  what   s go to be the success busi model  and what are go to be the new set of activ that can be undertaken   will certain fund market come back and at what spread onc you take away all these special program  until that is work out  i don   t see how the market can figur out who will surviv and who won   t  who is go to be there in three month and who isn   t   i think that the program are veri valuabl in provid a  e out   a  e for peopl to reassess   but until there   s greater clariti in those financ market go forward  i don   t think the market will actual be abl to recov  that whi the altern simul that put thing off a bit more seem quit sensibl to me  some specif on consumpt   as i often do  i talk with some of the largest provid of consum credit in the unit state   they are report  exact as governor kohn said  that consumpt or spend growth was deceler through the summer  but it did seem to get much more rapid in septemb and octob   one of the larg compani actual report signific contract on the consum side of spend   on the small busi side  it was still posit but down from doubl digit growth in the second quarter to basic flat   they also look across incom categori   this is not a phenomenon of just the peopl at one or the other end of the spectrum   it seem to be across the board for what they look at   all of them have report  just as the senior loan offic opinion survey did  a signific reduct of credit line   so even if we   re not see credit in and of itself have contract yet  the abil to get credit down the line is go to be much  much more difficult   also the fund market for the credit card compani octob                  of     have effect close   they may reopen   thing may come back  but i think it   s go to take  e for that to happen  and they were certain not op ist about that  as virtual everyon has mention  inflationari pressur for a varieti of reason are much lower  and i think that fit into what the vice chairman said about think about the cost of move now and perhap move    too quick      there seem to be lower cost now in be a bit more aggress than  let   s say  six month ago becaus much less inflationari pressur seem to be out there   i think a prudent risk manag point of view would certain take into account those cost and benefit   we need to use our monetari polici tool as effect as we can and then work with the other tool that a number of other have mention to tri to get the market to be more comfort with where thing will go and then be abl to lend to each other   to have the unlock of the credit market without govern guarante  without negat interest rate  and without extraordinari liquid facil   thank you
thank you   governor duke
thank you  mr  chairman   i focus on the    more rapid financi recoveri    scenario  not so much becaus i thought it was the most like but just tri to think what it would take to bring that about   i   m not sure that the polici chang we have done recent will do that  but i am fair certain that we are go to keep at it until we find someth that restor confid  i was shock when i was look at the bluebook at how short a  e has pass sinc the meltdown of all these major financi institut   fanni  freddi  lehman  aig  wamu  and wachovia   there is a sens among those who were affect  who lost from it  that they just realli didn   t see it come  at least not at this speed  and that all of them had adequ regulatori capit  and the banker at least were use to watch a sort of gradual burndown of that capit octob                  of     befor institut fail   they had a sens of be unabl to predict who was go to be save  who was go to get whack  and who would be the winner and the loser   so subsequ both the bank and their custom froze  and there has been veri littl activ sinc then   all the bank i talk to report have stop do busi with one or more counterparti and that one or more counterparti had stop do busi with them  and they were shock by both of those thing  so  first and foremost  it is clear that we need to restor confid and predict   in this sens  the recent move to increas deposit insur  to guarante interbank short term debt  and to provid capit on the same term to bank of all size should be help   but onli as long as we can do this without creat new uncertainti about who is go to benefit and who is not  without be too subject or too cute  we need at this point just to creat confid in our entir system   the demonstr and preemptiv support of the nine largest financi institut  our public support of aig  similar support of global import bank by their home countri  and the resolut of wachovia and nation citi  the two largest troubl institut  without loss should help us avoid shock surpris while everybodi calm down  in this light  my convers with the bank center most on their reaction to the recent polici chang   all thought the deposit insur increas was help   they vari in their es  of the import of the increas to           with a lot of them point out that for consum they had alreadi realli restructur deposit to insur fair larg amount  and sever were use the cdar  certif of deposit account registri servic  program for larger depositor   they were even more enthusiast about the coverag of transact account  although one banker felt as though this coverag realli hadn   t gotten as much visibl as it should  particular with corpor treasur  and mani had alreadi seen corpor and octob                  of     institut deposit move into treasuri and felt as though it was go to be difficult to get those back   there was even much more confus about the guarante of short term debt   one banker question how they would know whether the fed fund sold to anoth bank actual fell insid the     percent cap   anoth one thought that the all or noth structur of the guarante was a littl difficult to work with   interest  and as i point out ye day when i ask about interest on reserv  nobodi had even focus on it   they had bigger fish to fri   so i wouldn   t read anyth into those earli result  as for capit inject  most were take a hard look at it   two larg communiti bank had just issu privat capit to support growth that had been attract from competitor  but they thought that they could profit deploy the new capit   other bank were interest in have the capit just in case they had the opportun to buy weaker competitor  particular deposit or branch in problem resolut   none was realli concern about the announc restrict  but a number of them were somewhat suspici of the possibl restrict that might come later   some small bank with alreadi high level of capit somehow felt pressur to appli anyway just to show that they would qualifi  although they didn   t think it would give them much growth   in all case  capit is onli part of the stori   they also need reliabl fund if they are go to expand lend   this will have to come either from reliabl deposit growth or from the reopen of secondari market becaus all of them were reluct to increas borrow from ani sourc   the loan to deposit ratio is grow new fan   in term of lend  all report that they were still lend to their relationship custom  and they were cut back on credit to credit onli custom   as one defin it  if    percent of the revenu is come from credit  then that was a custom relationship they want to exit  octob                  of     they still report no signific deterior in the c i book   i ask about drawdown from compani  and across the board they said they had seen it in a coupl of instanc but realli they had not seen an aw lot of that  so that might be some postur rather than actual drawdown on the credit   they are  howev  exercis strong price disciplin  and the price decis  more than credit decis  are be escal up the approv chain  activ outreach to custom that they want to keep and assur them of credit avail   but becaus they have no price power on the fund side and price becam veri skinni on loan in recent year  there is a high level of sticker shock go on  which might explain some of the complaint about unreason term   they also report veri high level of caution from their custom  with the descript rang from    hunker down    to    wait and see      there were more anecdot report of compani ride trade credit by tri to acceler receiv or extend payabl   now  whether this is due to the actual or to the perceiv unavail of credit from bank is not yet clear  real pressur is on commerci real estat lend   they are veri select in new project   they are process renew for onli one year  use the opportun to shore up price and underwrit  and no longer write mini perm   nobodi is do those   so far  the perform is hold up on commerci properti  with strong perform on apart and weak show up in retail   residenti construct and land develop continu to be a problem   in visit the san francisco and the kansa citi bank  i was shock to hear the same stori from larg builder about land sale   one builder had a     acr parcel with a cost of         an acr  list it for         an acr  and sold it for           anoth report a properti with a cost basi of      million sell for     million   appar  the impetus for both of these transact was a judgment that the cash receiv from tax refund was more octob                  of     advantag than hold out for better price   so the outlook for lend in residenti construct or commerci real estat is dim far into the futur  and i would say the same thing for syndic or particip lend   howev  to the extent that bank can exit those segment  it should free up fund for normal lend for busi and consum   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i would like to ask governor duke a question   do you sens in this deep dive into the institut that you talk to that they are benefit from cut in the fed fund rate   are they enthusiast or not about the prospect for a lower fed fund rate
actual  i have heard a coupl of report that  when we did that last    basi point cut  bank did not lower their prime   a lot of bank still have prime relat credit   as we lower the rate  whether it make a differ on anyth els  it affect the prime  and there are still an aw lot of   percent cds out there   so as we lower rate  we are cut into those margin  and it is like to turn some of them negat
mr  chairman
i would just echo that   i have heard the same thing from banker in our district   just vocifer complaint about lower rate becaus their loan rate go down but their cost of fund  sn   t
mr  chairman  if i could just add one other thing   we are hear more and more about peopl switch to libor  tri to shift their lend contract to libor rather aggress  obvious  becaus they are higher rate   but i   m wonder if you   re pick that up as well
well  i don   t know   but just as soon as they get them switch over there  mayb we   ll be success at bring libor down
okay   thank you   let me tri to summar all that i heard today and ye day  and then i   ll tri to add some new comment to that   the outlook for econom growth appear to have deterior quit signific sinc the last meet   data on consum spend  product  and employ had weaken more than expect even befor the recent intensif of the financi crisi   over the past six week or so  howev  financi condit have great worsen  and risk avers has increas  despit action here and abroad to stabil the bank system   equiti valu have declin sharpli amid condit of low liquid and extraordinari volatil  credit market condit have improv modest sinc the global action to recapit bank and guarante their deposit  assist also by addit central bank liquid action  howev  in almost all credit market  spread remain much wider  matur shorter  and avail more constrain than was the case befor the intensif of the crisi   firm face continu fund risk and rollov risk   bank have probabl not reserv suffici for the credit loss to come  and hedg fund will be hit their net asset valu trigger in greater number  forc them to liquid asset   the durat of futur financi turmoil is hard to judg  but it could be lengthi  the worst thing is that financi condit appear alreadi to have had a signific and remark quick effect on activ and consum and busi expect and plan   most committe particip see us in or enter a recess and have mark down signific their expect for near term growth or for the pace of the recoveri   the difficulti of predict the cours of the crisi or it effect on the economi has also increas forecast octob                  of     uncertainti   in particular  the ul  effect of some major polici action  such as the creation of the tarp and the bank guarante  are not yet known   uncertainti about futur polici action  as well as uncertainti about the economi  has affect behavior in market and the broader economi  consum spend has weaken consider and probabl fell sharpli in the third quarter  reflect in part a recessionari psycholog   consum durabl  such as automobil and discretionari expenditur  have been particular hard hit   this weak reflect the same set of negat influenc on consumpt that we have been see for a while  now compound by loss of equiti wealth and confid effect on price  although lower oil price may provid some relief   the labor market continu to declin  with mani firm report that they are cut back worker   the hous sector has not been notic wors than expect  and report are somewhat mix   but on a nation basi  the contract is continu  and recent develop in the economi and credit market are like to have advers effect   inventori of unsold new home remain high  put pressur on price  nonresidenti construct continu at a moder pace  but backlog are fall  and the sector is look increas vulner to weaken fundament and tighter credit condit  whether a new fiscal s ulus packag will be pass and to what extent such a packag would be help remain open question   manufactur product has weaken signific as have expect of demand  includ export demand   credit is becom more of a problem for mani firm and their custom   spend on equip and softwar appear to have slow  reflect greater pessim and uncertainti   fall commod price may reduc mine activ and cool the boom in agricultur   on the plus side  firm are report fewer cost pressur  and inventori do not appear excess  octob                  of     deterior in global growth expect has been mark   industri economi had alreadi shown sign of slow  and they have been hit hard by recent financi develop  emerg market economi  until recent evid not much affect by the u s  slowdown  have in recent week also been hit hard by the spread financi crisi   togeth with the stronger dollar  these develop are like to restrain futur growth of u s  export  inflat risk have declin materi  reflect the fall in the price of energi and other commod  the stronger dollar  and the prospect of consider econom slack   firm report much reduc price power and lower markup   inflat expect have come down  both in the survey and in the tip market  though it wasn   t note   but i will note   that the tip market is distort by illiquid and other problem there   most particip see both overal and core inflat moder in the come quarter toward level consist with price stabil  with some see a risk of undesir low rate of inflat   some note  howev  that financi disloc affect aggreg suppli as well as aggreg demand and may reduc the extent to which slower growth damp inflat   so that   s just my sens   ani comment  addit  let me make just a few addit comment  none of which will be radic differ from what we have alreadi discuss   i do think it is overwhelm clear that we are now in a recess and that it is go to be a sever one   to give some sens of perspect  the postwar record for durat is    month   if the nber set this experi as have begun earli this year  i think we have a reason chanc to break that record   the largest increas from peak to trough in unemploy rate was in        it was     percentag point   start from     percent  i think we have a chanc to come close to that number   ye day   s drop in consum confid in one month from    to    shatter the previous low of    in decemb octob                  of            so i think we are talk about an episod here that could easili be among the largest postwar recess  we don   t know how thing would have evolv without the develop in septemb  but obvious we have to deal with that realiti   it was just a few week ago that we were deal with what might have been a true system crisi  in the week lead up to the g   and imf meet   i think it has been veri fortun that europ  the unit state  and other countri have adopt vigor respons to that  includ bank capit  bank guarante  and other measur   that has been veri import in calm the situat somewhat and reduc the system aspect of investor concern   that be said  concern about counterparti remain veri strong   risk avers is intens  spread remain high  and i think that this has now becom realli pervas   it isn   t just a question of junk bond and weak borrow or weak credit histori   the spread on gse debt  on high grade corpor debt  and other area have also widen  lead to a veri broad base tighten in credit condit   so i think that  overal  ani reason read of financi condit suggest that the tighten of credit or financi condit in the last six week or so has been quit substanti and overwhelm the effect of our coordin rate cut  now  normal you would expect to see a tighten of credit condit affect the economi with some lag   it take  e for peopl to borrow money and to use the money they borrow to make expenditur   but compar with that predict  we have instead seen a sudden stop   a remark and veri rapid effect on econom activ   it is possibl this is due less to the direct effect of credit avail and more to the psycholog impact of these event   one possibl analog is the      carter credit control  when the govern announc what seem to be a tighten of credit   there was a veri sharp respons in econom activ  octob                  of     probabl base more on expect than on actual credit avail   unfortun  the credit control could be remov by govern fiat  we are not abl to do that today  one interest develop is that the labor market has not yet shown as much weak as one would expect   unemploy insur claim and other indic do not yet show a mark deterior   i expect that we will see more deterior of the labor market  besid the intensif of the financi crisi that has mark increas the restrict of financi condit  i think the other veri import develop sinc our last meet has been the internation of the crisi   we had alreadi seen weaken in europ befor the most recent intensif  but it has becom much more sever   there is littl doubt that the unit kingdom and europ are in or about to enter recess   my sens is that their monetari polici respons will be stronger than what the  book anticip   i believ they will be veri aggress in respond to that  a new and particular worri develop is the fact that the crisi has now spread beyond the industri countri to the emerg market   the g   weekend was quit an interest one   it was a strike experi   i heard over and over again from the indian  from the brazilian  and from all over the world that  until the middl of septemb we were fine  we were not be much affect  we didn   t see much effect on our trade flow  and sudden everyth chang  and now we are under sever stress   we are see tremend outflow  our currenc are plummet   commod price declin are hurt mani countri   i think that is go to be a veri signific develop as we go forward  just to give some data  in just a few week the embi spread  the emerg market sovereign debt spread  went from     basi point to     basi point  and the emerg market equiti index has fallen about    percent sinc the last meet   it is not obvious that these octob                  of     chang were justifi by econom fundament   mani of these countri are veri well run and had shown a lot of progress in their domest polici and their domest economi  instead  i think they are suffer contagion from us most   unfortun  the implic of this will be not onli the usual trade and commod price type of implic but also  and even more import  financi implic   we are now see that the advers feedback loop  which we   ve been talk about for a long  e in the unit state  is becom a global phenomenon   in particular  european bank are veri heavili expos to emerg market debt  so we are go to see yet more of this interact between the financi market and the broader economi  except at a global rather than a nation level   these develop  obvious  are veri disturb and don   t bode well for u s  growth or now for global growth   somewhat iron  all of this deterior in the global outlook has led the dollar to appreci veri sharpli  which is interest to say the least   for us that obvious also has import implic for inflat  and as governor kohn mention  it mean that we will be less a recipi of foreign strength and more a support of foreign weak than we have been until now  on inflat  i know there is some discomfort in talk about a   percent polici rate and promis to keep it low for a protract period   and all those thing   we have seen this movi befor  and i think we all have to recogn the import of watch the implic of that for our economi and for asset price and to take quit serious the respons for remov accommod in a  e fashion onc the crisi has begun to moder   that be said  i don   t think that there is realli ani case in the near term to be worri veri much about inflat   or  perhap even less so  the dollar   as we look at our polici   price power is evapor   and given what is happen in the global economi  i don   t see a commod price octob                  of     boom ani  e soon  although i think as the economi do begin to recov in the next year or so that we might see some recoveri in commod price  so i think that  as everyon has indic  this is a veri worrisom situat   i don   t think we have control of it   i don   t think we know what the bottom is  so we have to remain veri flexibl and veri open to new initi as they becom necessari   there has been some comparison of this to the japanes situat   i   m begin to wonder if that might not be a good outcom   the advantag of the japanes was  first of all  that they were isol   the rest of the world was do okay  and they were abl to draw strength from their export and the rest of the global economi   although they had veri slow growth  they never realli had a deep recess or big increas in unemploy   i think we are look at perhap a much sharper episod  and our challeng will be to make sure that it  sn   t persist longer  i do think that one lesson of both japan and the     s as well as other experi is that passiv is not a good answer   we do have to continu to be aggress   we have to continu to look for solut   some of them are not go to work   some of them are go to add to uncertainti   i recogn that critiqu   i realiz it   s a valid critiqu   but i don   t think that this is go to be a self correct thing any  soon   i think we are go to have to continu to provid support of all kind to the economi   let me stop there and  unless there is ani question or comment  ask   to introduc the polici round
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the version of tabl   that was distribut to you on monday   it is reproduc in the packag befor you label    materi for brief on monetari polici altern      chang in the languag relat to the bluebook version are shown in blue   start on the right hand side of the tabl  even though member saw the econom and financi inform that becam avail over the intermeet period as wors than expect  they might be inclin to leav the stanc of polici unchang at today   s meet  as in altern c   as note ye day  your    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     octob                  of     econom project reveal that mani of you anticip that inflat pressur will diminish less quick than the staff anticip  and sever of you note explicit that you thought less eas would be appropri than was assum in the  book forecast   also  the committe alreadi reduc rate in earli octob  respond to at least some of the advers econom news   moreov  the feder reserv has put in place addit facil to support credit intermedi  and the treasuri and the fdic are move quick with the implement of other program that should  with  e  help stabil financi institut and market and enhanc the flow of credit to household and busi   final  you might believ that the congress is like to enact a second fiscal s ulus packag  possibl reduc the need for addit monetari polici accommod   the rational section of the statement suggest for altern c would acknowledg the intensif of financi turmoil and the weaken of the econom outlook   howev  it would also cite the rang of polici action taken in recent week as factor that should help over  e to improv credit condit and promot a return to moder econom growth   the languag on inflat would be essenti ident to that use in the committe   s statement earlier this month  note that the upsid risk to inflat have been reduc   the risk assess would state explicit that the committe   s primari concern is the downsid risk to growth  suggest a predilect for lower rate   nonetheless  with market particip anticip an eas today   a    basi point move is seen as most like   an announc along the line of altern c would point to a much higher trajectori for the feder fund rate over the next few month than investor had expect   short  and intermedi term treasuri yield would like jump  credit spread probabl would increas further  and equiti price might declin sharpli   if the committe is of the view that further polici accommod is appropri at this  e but is also quit uncertain about the extent of rate reduct that will ul  be requir  it might be attract to the    basi point eas of altern b at this meet   member might have a less pessimist outlook for the economi than that present as the baselin in the  book or might at least be quit uncertain as to the extent of the negat forc at work in the economi   at the same  e  you may view the incom inform as suggest that the    basi point eas earlier this month is unlik to be suffici to adequ balanc the risk to econom activ and inflat   given these consider  you might see modest further eas today as appropri and be prepar to cut rate again in come month should develop warrant   the statement propos for altern b would note that the pace of econom activ appear to have slow mark  and it would repeat languag from your earli octob statement indic that the financi market turmoil is like to exert addit restraint on spend   the announc would also indic that  in light of the declin in the price of energi and other commod  the committe expect inflat to moder in come quarter to level consist with price stabil   as note in a box in the bluebook  we think that  in view of your previous polici octob                  of     communic  outsid analyst would interpret such a statement on the inflat outlook as indic that the committe anticip that overal inflat will drop to around     percent to    percent befor long  a indic that would be consist with the central tendenc of your inflat project for        the risk assess in altern b  paragraph    would cite the same broad rang of polici action that was propos in altern c  paragraph     it would indic that the predomin concern of the committe is the downsid risk to econom growth   market particip see a    basi point eas at this meet as possibl  but at this point they seem to place signific higher odd on a    basi point reduct   the explicit citat of downsid risk to growth would suggest that further eas could be forthcom after this meet  but this announc still would suggest a higher path for the feder fund rate than they anticip   consequ  short  and intermedi term rate might tend to edg up after such an announc  credit spread might widen somewhat further  and equiti price might declin   under altern a  the committe would eas polici    basi point at this meet   an econom outlook along the line of the  book forecast would provid one rational for choos this altern   the  book forecast for aggreg demand has been slash dramat  import reflect a sharp declin in equiti price  a steep rise in credit risk premium  and a consider climb in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   one metric for this revis is the  book consist measur of the short run equilibrium real interest rate  r   which has been cut near   percentag point sinc the septemb meet to a level of about minus   percent   that level is about   percentag point below the actual real fund rate defin on a consist basi   the staff outlook for a protract period of substanti econom slack  togeth with the recent plung in energi price  point to a consider diminut of inflat pressur  with overal inflat fall to     percent next year in the  book forecast   even with the  book   s assumpt of     basi point of further eas by earli next year   but even those who are somewhat less pessimist about the outlook than the board staff might view the modal outlook as have deterior enough  or the downsid risk as have increas enough  to warrant a    basi point rate cut today   the rational languag for altern a in the revis version of tabl   is similar to that for altern b  but altern a  paragraph    note addit factor that are restrain growth   the risk assess  too  is similar to that for altern b  but it refer the rate reduct that would be implement today under this altern and note that downsid risk to growth remain  without say that the downsid risk are the committe   s predomin concern   an announc along these line seem larg consist with market particip    expect  and the market reaction would like be relat small   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   question for     all right   if there are no question  whi don   t we begin our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think that this is a tough call   i support altern b  with the statement word as present   in my think  a    basi point cut today is part of a total    basi point action  includ the octob   move   i believ the deterior we have seen in septemb and octob and the result downward revis of the outlook merit a cumul respons of this magnitud   that said  i am sympathet to the view that we would be well advis to keep some powder dri to respond to shock or develop ahead   i anticip that  becaus a number of the dynam in the market have not realli play out  we will have more shock and they could come from further financi institut failur  corpor failur  a sovereign debt crisi  and market disarray  and in other market  such as the municip market  there is alway a chanc of a geopolit event   in all likelihood these thing come in combin or in rapid fire   so  as i said  i am sympathet to the    powder dri    view  but i see the powder dri object as be in conflict with respond to the recent deterior   therefor i come to    basi point or altern b to some extent as a compromis  combin with the    basi point of octob     thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern a  a    basi point cut in the fund rate   this action  and even more  is justifi by the dramat develop sinc our last meet   a deepen of the recessionari outlook worldwid  the near meltdown of the global financi system  and the abat of inflationari pressur   frank  it is  e for all hand on deck when it come to our polici tool  and the fed fund rate should be no except  although we cut the fund rate    basi point a few week ago  the  book inflat project was revis down more than that  so the ex ant real fund rate actual edg up over the intermeet period  octob                  of     we need to do much more and the sooner  the better   one might argu against such a polici move in favor of a wait and see approach to better gaug if the recent flurri of polici initi will turn thing around   in normal  e  i would have some sympathi for this argument  but these are about as far from normal  e as we can get   we are in the midst of a global econom and financi freefal  and the confid of household  busi  and investor is in shambl   the advers feedback loop is play out with a vengeanc   lender continu to ratchet up term and standard  sap the abil of household and busi to spend   as the economi weaken  further loan default will mushroom  i think strong  clear action is need   histor preced  such as the case of japan  teach us that it is a mistak to act cautious as the economi unravel   i think the clear lesson from both econom theori and real world experi is to lower rate as quick as possibl to avoid a deeper and more protract recess  not to keep our powder dri or to wait to use tool until later if they are avail to us now   the more medicin we give and the sooner we give it  the better   the bluebook op  polici simul tell us that  absent the zero bound  the fund rate should be lower well below zero next year   sinc that is not an option  we should do the most with what we   ve got and cut the fund rate aggress now
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like presid    i support altern a  the    basi point cut   i think it   s the right respons to the veri  veri substanti chang in the econom outlook sinc the last meet   we would have cut the nomin feder fund rate by   percentag point and real feder fund rate by someth less than   percentag point depend on what you think is happen to inflat expect   but sure inflat expect are come down   and come down substanti  octob                  of     i think the incom inform  the weak befor the shock hit in mid septemb  which to me suggest that we didn   t have ani insur against that weak at the  e   the extraordinari tighten of financi condit  and the downshift in spend that we   ve seen sinc mid septemb all suggest that a   percentag point cut in the real rate  and even a littl less than a   percentag point cut  would seem a veri modest and moder respons to the shock   it   s probabl a down payment   if the staff is right  we will need more   i built more into my own forecast   but even if the economi is not as weak as the staff has built into the  book  i think a substanti cut in the feder fund rate is entir appropri  all of us   without except  i think   said that there were downsid risk to their forecast  and a number of us have cite the possibl of a veri deep recess here   so i think we need to take action   we are start with a situat in which the economi is declin   we are in recess   the unemploy rate is rise   inflat is fall   there is a global recess in train   it seem to me  from a risk manag perspect  that the cost of not do enough   the cost of be reluct to lower rate and make that situat wors   are far larger than the cost of go a littl too far becaus thing turn around fa    i think we are in a situat in which it is almost imposs at this point to go too far   mr  chairman  we may have to take it back at some point in the futur  but right now i think the    basi point is absolut justifi by the condit in which we find ourselv  i was drawn  as the vice chairman was  to the staff simul have to do with a more rapid financi recoveri   i myself think that   s a veri small probabl   but even if that   s what happen  we   ll know by decemb whether the financi market are recov fa    we can stop at   percent  if we   re get that recoveri  and the outcom  as the vice chairman note  realli aren   t that bad in that recoveri   so i think that even the small probabl of a veri sharp octob                  of     turnaround in the market is still consist with cut rate anoth    basi point at this meet  the fact that we are alreadi low is not a reason to hold back   i don   t agre with the    keep the powder dri    kind of argument   i think the lesson of histori  includ from japan  are that the closer you get to the zero lower bound the more aggress you should be   if you let weak build  that weak will overwhelm your polici tool   the most effect use of the limit scope for polici eas is to be preemptiv and stop weak from build  i think a    basi point eas will have benefici effect   i don   t think that the market will react veri much   we won   t see those benefici effect   but if i can compar it with do    or noth at all  i think do    or noth at all would have advers effect   with    or noth  you   ll get longer term rate up  you   ll get stock price down  and you   ll get an eros of confid at a  e when we don   t need it   that the central bank  sn   t get how serious this situat is   i agre that the last eas was larg offset by the loss of confid and the rise in uncertainti   i also agre that it might not feed through as direct and complet as it often   becaus bank are tri to rebuild and lender are tri to rebuild profit margin   but i still think it will be effect   as i say  i convinc myself of that by ask about what would happen with the altern  and i think the altern would be far wors   we need to keep fine tune the tarp and the liquid provis   we need fiscal s ulus   i agre with all of that   we need to move on lot of dimens   but these thing will not be suffici in and of themselv to counter this   monetari polici is a fair blunt instrument  but we need to s ul the spend wherev we can to do this  some have express concern about circumst forc us to eas between meet  we have done      will that take us further   i think we need to make clear in our statement and octob                  of     our minut   particular in our minut   that we do expect a weak economi go forward  at least a moder softer economi  and that the process may call for further eas   i think it will call for further eas at the next fomc meet  but we can get to the next fomc meet and see   but it should take a substanti and unexpect deterior relat to that path to justifi an intermeet action   so i think we are absolut right to have a prejudic toward take action at meet  when we can sit around and discuss thing   the odd are high that we will need to go further  but we should do that at a meet if we can   if we do have a veri strong and substanti deterior even relat to our weak outlook and we do end up move between meet  sure that move would not put us at a level that is unjustifi by the circumst  so i think we can deal with the intermeet situat and not have the pressur of the market  the pressur of expect  get us to a level at which we   re ul  uncomfort   in short  i think it   s a veri serious situat   we need to do all we can to counter this situat   now is not the  e to hold back   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
like the  book forecast  our forecast predict a signific recess   further eas will like help mitig the sever of the recess   coupl with improv in short term credit spread  a reduct in the feder fund rate should lower rate on home equiti line of credit as well as busi and consum rate tie to libor  eas cash flow for consum and busi   we are face problem of histor proport  both here and abroad   a    basi point eas  as in altern a  is both necessari and appropri  even with the eas assum in the  book  the unemploy rate remain too high for too long   the inflat rate fall enough to be well below my target   to avoid a sever and octob                  of     prolong recess  we will veri like need further monetari eas and a signific fiscal packag  even after this    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate  i would just note in term of the languag that  although i am comfort with the altern a languag  my actual view would be closer to say    the predomin concern of the committe is the downsid risk to growth    rather than    nevertheless  downsid risk to growth remain
okay   thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   after think about this for quit some  e  i cannot convinc myself that altern a is not the right way to go
let the transcript reflect that    laughter
you were veri effect in list a number of dire circumst   the fact that we may challeng the maximum durat of a recess in the postwar period  ani mention of the         recess is veri frighten  you even mention      in term of the reduct in confid  and the      credit crunch also   you were abl to do that without ani mention of the     s  and that   s quit compel  i would say  so for the reason that have been alreadi discuss  the outlook is quit unfavor  and i think that this will help improv matter   but as i thought about the concern that i have  one concern is whether this will actual be view as effect today   i   m not sure about that   the last  e we cut rate  financi stress interven to swamp ani benefici interpret of that  whether that affect our credibl  i think that don kohn was veri effect in mention that there will be credibl hit in the other direct if we don   t take some action like that   i do think that eventu thing will subsid and the benefici effect of lower polici will be seen  about the dri powder argument  we are not go to have mani more action left after this  but i octob                  of     don   t see what the altern are other than to go ahead and put this in place   i don   t subscrib to the view that inflat is like to be too low  although that is a risk   inflat concern  the financi stress  all of those issu  even take into account the risk that presid bullard mention the other day  i think speak strong to the fact that we   re run out of normal monetari polici option and that fiscal action are go to be strong import   so i do favor altern a   thank you
well  mr  chairman  i certain understand how serious this matter is  and i guess i am of the view that altern a is not go to solv much   there is a psycholog  i understand  in the market that is go on  and i am not convinc that our continu to take these action and then have advers outcom is necessarili go to inspir confid   i think we need to let our action work their way through   part of the problem is that the credit mechan is stuck right now becaus of the tremend uncertainti   then i look at all of the thing we have done over the last month  and the ramp up of the liquid facil has realli exceed even our abil to  il   so we have had  in effect  a fund rate that is well below our target   we have excess reserv in that period that were over      billion when they are normal    billion  and that was befor we ad more swap line and more liquid into the market   frank  i think we are at a point now where the liquid mechan that we   re tri to use  not our interest rate target  are realli our monetari polici   as we go forward  perhap we need to think about how we are go to conduct monetari polici under a quantit eas environ   that is what i think we will effect be at if we move again today   so how we think about liquid and about the credit mechan is realli where more of our attent will have to be spent   lower the rate may have some posit effect  but i octob                  of     doubt it   so i would just stay where we are  let some of these past action begin to work through  and see what the effect of those are befor we then take anoth move becaus i think the market would just appreci some stabil over  e in our action so that they can see these thing begin to work   it isn   t a problem of the interest rate level right now  in my opinion  so that   s whi i would wait and see   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   clear  forecast have been mark down sinc our septemb meet   mine includ   this reflect the weaker data that we have obtain on the real side  especi consum spend and manufactur  but also worsen condit in the financi market   accord  in an intermeet move on octob    we cut the fund rate    basi point   yet the addit effect on the economi of financi turmoil dure the last month remain high uncertain   spread in mani market remain higher than at the  e of our septemb meet  but some have start to declin   if our new facil have the desir impact  we may well see spread continu to fall back to septemb or lower level  it is veri difficult to say at this  e   although i dislik intermeet rate cut  i support the octob   cut becaus it was part of a coordin effort among central bank around the world and it seem justifi given that our growth outlook had deterior and inflat expect had remain stabl  we may well have to do more  but i think we are near the end of what we can do with monetari polici   of cours  it   s difficult to determin the appropri level of the fund rate  and i want to draw your attent to the  book  which show that  whether we cut today or don   t cut today  the path of gdp  employ  and inflat over the next year or two are not much differ   in fact  in most model  cut of that magnitud do not show up veri heavili in octob                  of     real variabl   i would also note that  accord to the  book  we could cut the rate to zero and have no effect on inflat  appar  for the next four year   howev  given the fact that rate cut don   t have much effect  even in the  book simul  we have cut rate   it may not make much differ  as presid hoenig was say   my prefer at this meet would be to stand pat and see how the data and financi market improv   we are alreadi engag in extraordinari quantit eas  even at this point  and we are hear from banker that the fund rate will do littl to s ul lend on their part or improv their balanc sheet  now  delay necessari rate cut is not desir   but given the consider uncertainti around our forecast  it is not clear that further cut are either necessari or desir or are go to be effect   and do so for pure psycholog reason  from my standpoint  is a dubious way to conduct polici  a comparison of the baselin  book forecast with the altern scenario involv more rapid improv in financi condit suggest that the appropri polici path is veri much depend on know whether the increas in financi stress in septemb will be last   if condit deterior further  which they might  we may want to cut in decemb   if condit improv  this may not be necessari   given the declin in confid in our market and institut  i think the fed can play a posit role by be a steadi hand   that   s anoth reason to wait a bit longer befor move again  i do not believ that we inspir confid by appear to react to market fluctuat  even though that   s not what we   re do  i fear that we often give that appear   moreov  although we have gotten posit reaction to the creativ of our liquid program  i think we have miss opportun for rais confid by roll out our liquid facil in a piecem fashion   we had announc made everi day between monday and wednesday  octob                  of     on octob       and     i think it would have been far better to announc these action as a well thought out packag  explain the intent of the individu piec and how they relat to one anoth   for exampl  we now have three differ lend program design in whole or in part to support money market mutual fund   i have concern that we have been look reactiv rather than proactiv  even though i know that some of these program had been in the work for a while  i have argu that it is import that we think about our polici choic in term of polici path   that is  a dynam path   the principl of dynam program suggest that we think about our polici in a backward look way   this  i believ  appli not onli to monetari polici but to our liquid program as well   in this spirit  i believ that we must think hard about our exit strategi both from the liquid program and from our veri low fund rate   i think we have dug ourselv a veri deep hole in term of the breadth and depth of our lend to the privat sector   we seem  at  e  to be the lender of first resort as well as the lender of last resort   we must make sure that we have a sturdi ladder that will enabl us to climb our way out of this hole   this is especi import given the interact between the program and the differ across the program in their current expir date  on the monetari polici side  we have ad signific to liquid in the economi  as i allud to earlier   given the uncertainti surround our forecast  we may veri well find ourselv in a posit of have to revers those inject sooner than expect   i am even more concern with this plan process than i have been when i have rais this point befor  the baselin fund path in the  book is quit extraordinari from my perspect   it suggest that we can keep the fund rate low  below   and even close to zero  throughout most of the forecast period   inde  in      the fund rate is still below   percent  even though the octob                  of     economi is grow at     percent   we may disagre somewhat on the magnitud of the contribut of our low interest rate polici in the           period to the current problem  but i don   t think mani of us want to repeat that episod   yet look at the baselin forecast and where the fund rate remain   below   percent or certain below   percent for the next four year   it strike me as a riski strategi at best and perhap even a danger one   we have previous express view around this tabl that this committe histor has been reluct to rais rate in a  e fashion  and i believ that fear is reinforc by what i see in the baselin forecast in the  book   that project worri me a great deal   we must not act in a way that sow the seed of the next crisi  despit the pressur of the here and now  we cannot and should not ignor the consequ of our action in the intermedi term   manag our way from point to point  deal with immedi problem  can veri easili lead us to a place in which we do not wish to be   thus the import of think in term of a path   i think it would also serv us well to think about the process we will follow to unwind our liquid program in advanc  so that we avoid unintend consequ across market  and about the communic strategi that will eas the transit back to a more market base provis of liquid  in sum  mr  chairman  although i would prefer not to move today  i recogn that my forecast is more op ist than most   moreov  i also accept the notion that there is a great deal of uncertainti about the outcom and fragil in the marketplac  and your concern are well note   thus  i will not dissent against a    basi point cut   but i would like to remind the committe of our earlier discuss and the general agreement i thought i heard that  when the  e come  we will have to rais rate and we may have to do so aggress   in all likelihood  octob                  of     that will occur befor lag indic  such as the unemploy rate  are firm on the declin   this is not the project offer in the  book baselin   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid bullard  you have a handout
i do have a handout
everybodi have a copi   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess befor i start  i just want to say that i general agre with everyth everyon is say   this is a dire situat  and i am perfect comfort with that assess   what i want to do with my comment here is just put on the tabl one idea about whi a rate reduct might be counterproduct   that is what i   m tri to do here  the u s  economi now appear to be in recess   intensifi financi market turmoil and veri fluid expect have creat a veri difficult situat   a key question for the committe is what to do with the monetari polici piec of the polici respons to the situat  we know that monetari polici is a blunt instrument that   not direct address fundament problem in financi market   we have other program in place to tri to address those problem more direct   we also have import fiscal action  which are probabl have the largest effect in tri to stabil the current situat   unlik the ecb  we alreadi lower nomin interest rate aggress earlier this year in anticip of the possibl of weak macroeconom perform   we are now in the middl of a further round of eas  which is threaten to send nomin interest rate to zero  given the forc of event  is this the op  polici  or could it backfir on the committe   i want to at least lay out the possibl that a veri low nomin interest rate polici may be counterproduct   my key worri is that hous market remain at the core of the current turmoil   mortgag market      the materi use by mr  bullard are attach to this transcript  appendix     octob                  of         trillion or so  about one gdp   are base on nomin contract   deflat tend to be veri destruct in an environ of nomin contract   i want to stress that macroeconom expect are veri import for the way the economi actual evolv and will evolv go forward and that those expect are veri fluid in the current environ   the japanes experi  while it is not an exact parallel  repres an import refer point for the current situat   japan   s problem were veri real   some have describ the outcom as a lost decad  so let   s turn to the graph here for just a second   this is what i was talk about ye day   this is an argument put forward by jess benhabib  stephani schmitt groh©  and mart­n urib   on the vertic axi is the nomin interest rate   on the horizont axi are the inflat rate and inflat expect  which in this graph are go to be the same thing   the diagon line label         is just a   relationship   the nomin interest rate is the real interest rate  r  plus inflat expect   then polici is describ by the line with the kink in it   the polici line mean that  when medium term inflat expect are abov target  we rais the nomin interest rate and  when medium term inflat expect are below target  we lower the nomin interest rate   that work beauti around the target equilibrium  the ï   in this environ  and all goe well   it   s just that  when you go to low nomin interest rate  strang thing start to happen becaus you have to do someth with polici as you come to veri low nomin interest rate   you could just go to zero  and then you would have the horizont line label    polici    that would go across all the way to the minus r there   or you could stop at some earlier level   i chose someth here to illustr what the  book seem to have in mind  say    percent  octob                  of     but ani way you cut it  this is go to creat anoth cross of the   relat and creat a second steadi state   this is the main point of the benhabib analysi   you can layer on top all kind of other stuff that you would like to includ in your model  but most model are go to have a   relationship  and most model are go to have the policymak react by adjust the nomin interest rate   so this other steadi state  the steadi state with low nomin interest rate  has deflat   if you get stuck there  in our current environ  this would exacerb the hous problem a lot and make our problem much more sever   so this is just one caution about go to a veri low nomin interest rate environ   when i saw this six or seven year ago  it had some influenc on me   befor this  i was not worri about ani of the zero bound issu   but then  this   make me a littl nervous  given the core problem in our situat  which is the hous problem   that   s the argument   so let me set that asid then  one thing this line of research point out   and a whole bunch of paper have been written sinc this paper   is the exist of this second steadi state and that the deflat associ with the trap steadi state is a worrisom phenomenon   there are two steadi state here   you can just argu that you don   t think the lower one is go to be the one the economi coordin on and that eventu we are go to go back to the high one and that is perfect fine   howev  the japanes case seem to be zero nomin interest rate and a moder low rate of deflat for quit some  e   you could say that  if we coordin on this low nomin interest rate steadi state  we can somehow take fiscal polici action to move off that to the other steadi state   that is a more complic issu   that has been address in the literatur  and that is also a reason thing to say   i guess my main concern about this is  sinc it is a veri dire situat and i think we are go to go veri close to zero veri soon  i want us to do it with octob                  of     our eye open   it has some possibl of creat a wors environ   that is the onli thing i want to say here  so my prefer base on this would be to leav rate alon and say     let   s use fiscal polici      i don   t think what we have now is an interest rate problem   what we have now are problem in credit market  and i think they are be fair well address by the most recent fiscal action  includ capit inject into the bank sector   so that would be my prefer at this point
thank you   let   s see  presid
mr  chairman  if you had kick around in the street of hong kong in       then you would have wander into elementari school and seen what we call at that  e    quotron      children trade stock on the lunchroom floor   it was the surest indic that the market was out of control   this morn i open the wall street journal  and on the front page they describ an exercis run by the secur industri and financi market associ  which you know is wall street   s biggest trade group  with a similar program in american school   it say that a    year old in wilmington  delawar   michael ashworth   is slump by his comput  weari from anoth rough day in the stock market with all his favorit pick   domino   s pizza  the hershey compani  and gap   surpris    laughter      i   ll be honest with you     he confid     befor all this i ask my mom to give me stock for christma   but then  i told her not to do it   i ask for a parakeet instead       laughter   now  this is not as exot or thought a handout as the one from my colleagu from st  loui  but here   s the point  he may not get that parakeet becaus the pet store may not have access to credit   this is  to me  the fundament issu that i think presid     and i won   t repeat his argument   and presid hoenig were refer to   the concern i have is not about the price of money   in fact  octob                  of     i think we are not see that kind of transmiss mechan   governor duke gave tes oni to that earlier   all of us are awar that it is not move as quick through the iv tube as we would like it to becaus of the crimp natur of the tube  i have no problem with the languag in altern a  except for the first paragraph  and the phrase    includ today   s rate reduct      i have an open mind   i do think the issu in term of restor the system come back to credibl and predict   you cannot have a function capitalist system if you have total uncertainti   these are the issu that i believ presid    presid hoenig  earlier presid    and other were refer to in the first intervent   i thank presid   in particular for address the question i ask ye day  and there was refer to them earlier  we have done so much so quick   we are in a quantit eas period   the question is whether it actual make a differ if we cut rate or not and whether the price of money is actual the issu or the fact that money is not flow  that there are counterparti risk and rollov risk  and all the thing we have talk about at this tabl and each of us has articul in our public speech   to be veri honest with you  mr  chairman  i am open mind about this becaus i could make that argument both way   if it  sn   t matter  whi not cut    basi point  or whi not hold   i am not convinc yet   and i   d like to listen to the rest of the argument   that altern a  in term of the action  is the right way to go   i do think it   s veri import that we be veri clear and articul in lay out how we see the world  and i do believ that the languag in altern a   the best job of all the column that have been present  but i come back to the question i ask befor   what are the next step   i   d like to know   what is the end game   i   d like to know befor i cast my vote   i will conclud with actual onc again agre with presid    as i think i have done twice in histori  octob                  of      laughter   the last  e was at the last meet   i think it   s veri import that we have all hand on deck  that we have a unanim decis   but  still  i would like answer to my question   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    i promis you answer  and i will deliv them   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i strong favor altern a  a    basi point cut in our fed fund target rate today   i think it is import for us to move aggress and quick to offset the strong forc that are act to depress econom activ   i know that some prefer a more measur respons  especi as we move closer to the zero bound  but the lesson i take from histori is that more and sooner is better than take smaller step over  e  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom outlook has definit deterior   on top of the slow at the begin of the third quarter  a sequenc of polici action and statement has spread an inchoat fear   in respons to that  a wide varieti of econom agent have delay outlay   the breathtak credit market intervent that we have undertaken in the last sever week are go to make it hard to judg whether those market are stabil   it is go to make it even harder to judg how and when to withdraw  governor duke ask rhetor what it would take for recoveri to begin   i think it is not go to be a veri healthi recoveri unless we have made substanti progress toward withdraw these intervent   i know it   s probabl prematur in the midst of a crisi to be talk about the recoveri  but a number of peopl did  and i think it make sens on the ground that presid   advanc for us to be think ahead   presid   talk about the octob                  of     will and the desir and that it amount to a matter of will to revers cours later on   i think that in withdraw these subsidi and these credit market intervent is where we are go to need the will   it is go to be realli hard to disenfranchis somebodi who now has access to one of these program  the inflat outlook has improv   expect inflat has come down   a coupl of peopl have note that   that bring the real rate where the interest rate is now   to about zero  so i can favor a    point reduct in the feder fund rate target at this meet   i think a fund rate that is  in real term as best as we can measur it  about minus   percent is how we should see our way through here  at least in the near term   like presid    i will mention the     s   what i take from my read of the great depress is that this is what central bank should do in  e like this   keep real interest rate low  let me make a coupl of brief observ   as i mention ye day  i think we are go to face a challeng communic about our strategi   if we need to reduc interest rate to the lowest practic level to which we feel we can reduc them  i think ye day   s discuss suggest that the committe could use a refresh cours on the monetari econom of the zero bound   i applaud presid bullard for his break new ground by provid a figur from the journal of econom theori    laughter  i want to put someth on the tabl about the feder fund rate   we are vote today on the target for the feder fund rate   the way our oper are conduct now  we are leav so mani excess reserv in the system that we are drive the feder fund rate down to the interest rate on reserv   the interbank risk premium is like to becom small as the fdic guarante becom well understood and more broad effect   the gses are like to catch on that they deserv more on their fund   small bank  as governor duke say  that haven   t realli octob                  of     paid attent to what this new regim is about are go to find that broker are go to be abl to find them placement at closer to the interest rate on reserv   so i think that the sloppi trade below the interest rate on reserv is go to fade over  e   as long as we have excess reserv at the scale that we do  as long as the desk has ad that mani reserv  we are go to have the effect feder fund rate at the interest rate on reserv   becaus we are vote on the feder fund target rate  i think that the committe ought to have some understand from the staff that either excess reserv are go to be drawn down to the point that the effect rate is lift off the interest rate on the reserv floor or   and this would be my prefer cours of action   we rais the interest rate on reserv to equal the target rate   otherwis  we are vote on someth  but we are actual do someth els   i can understand the desir to err on the side of soft rate   this is what we did in august        but as rate go down  we need to be more and more care about what the committe is actual vote on
just to support what you said  we are obvious still tri to find our way in how to use this in the new regim with the excess reserv interest rate   it is possibl that at some point we might decid to target that interest rate   that might be the most straightforward thing to do   but as i understand it   and  in fact  i   m quit confid   the intent of the staff and the board is to tri to figur out what the relationship is between the excess reserv interest rate and the feder fund rate as normal measur   if we can establish a reliabl relationship  then we should tri to   and we will   use that to hit the target   it   s come close to it   we certain are not tri intent to come under the target   if that fail  then we will go to what you are suggest  which is effect what i   m say  and make them the same   then  effect  there is no differ between target the interest rate on excess reserv and target the feder fund rate   we are certain open to that  and there is octob                  of     no intent to do anyth other than to tri to figur out a way to take the fomc   s decis and put it into practic in the money market   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  financi headwind continu to be a major part of my think about the econom outlook   reason peopl can differ about that issu  but it seem to me that the headwind are signific and they are like to persist  partial as a consequ and partial for other reason  the econom outlook has deterior  and the inflat outlook  fortun  has improv   so i favor altern a  and i am satisfi with the languag associ with it  let me make just one addit comment   one way of think about lower rate at this junctur and it potenti effect is that it is import to reduc the price of liquid in this environ   i think that   s what lower the target would do   that said  if i think about polici a bit beyond this meet  i start with an observ that governor kohn made   we are probabl go to receiv a batch of pretti negat econom news over the next sever month   at the same  e  a lot of program are in place  as everybodi is awar  and perhap my op  is ill conceiv  but i actual think that they have the promis of be effect over  e   so it   s not just a question in my mind of the natur of the news we get  but are we also see sign that all these program are get some traction and be effect   if they are  that ought to temper our desir to go further   obvious  a lot of thing are in play  and a great deal of uncertainti is present here and abroad   but we will simpli have to assess all these develop as best we can as  e pass   i think i   ll end my remark there
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me begin by agre with don kohn on two thing   this is the toughest econom period i can rememb in his life    laughter  and i octob                  of     support altern a   i think the inflat trend and the trend in the global economi give us flexibl  which six month or so ago i did not think we would have   i think that give us some degre of freedom that  given all of the negat tone  includ my own  around the tabl  give us at least some sourc of comfort  next i would say that i agre with the consensus around the tabl  which is that these problem are not princip about monetari polici   but i also think that monetari polici isn   t irrelev to this  and all agenc of govern around the world are make tough decis  and the margin benefit of further monetari polici chang strike me as not high but not irrelev   i think presid   talk a bit about the altern polici path in the  book that rang from keep the fed fund rate constant where it is to take it to zero percent and the surpris small differ in output  employ  and core inflat there   in some way  in the discuss that we   re have about    or    or move or not  it would not be fair for ani of us to overst the import in term of direct affect the economi in the short term  that goe to my final point  which is that the most valuabl asset that we have isn   t what at the end of this meet might be     basi point left of monetari polici   frank  it is the credibl of the institut and the credibl of the fomc   if i compar our credibl now to virtual ani other organ in the unit state or mayb even global  i think our credibl is hold up quit well  particular relat to the degre of difficulti we have in front of us  relat to the trauma in financi market and the weak in the economi   so it is that asset  that credibl  that we need to continu to protect more than increment basi point move on the fed fund rate   i think that credibl will be test over this period as it will for our counterpart  we don   t want to find ourselv in a corner come decemb or come a coupl of brutal day in the market where we feel compel to continu to act and make    basi point move unless and until octob                  of     we know where we want to end up on this   so i   m sympathet to that point of view   we need to tell the stori befor the stori is told for us of what our lower bound is  whi it   s there  and what our diagnosi of the economi is   i think that the chairman and the rest of us will have ampl opportun to do that between now and decemb and that it is quit import to make sure we come out of this as strong as we have been through this period so far   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   well  i   ve not been abl to convinc myself not to agre with presid     as everyon has said  we have this veri signific global shift that has step down real activ and financi activ   the inflat environ has chang dramat from a number of month ago with the chang in commod price  the chang in the valu of the dollar  and the chang in not just u s  but also global resourc util   i think we   ve seen just an enorm chang there   also  when you look at the expect feder fund rate path   we have to be care in look at anyth in the market these day becaus of liquid  risk premium  or term premium that we   re not quit sure about   the market are expect signific cut from us   they are not expect ani immedi or near term signific increas in inflat  and i think all of the indic are that it will be go down  in a cost   benefit analysi  the cost seem relat low in term of the potenti for inflat of do this   now  we have to think about it in term of benefit  and a number of peopl have touch on the transmiss mechan   i do think that there are forc that mute the extent to which a    basi point cut translat into    basi point or lower on cost  but i don   t think they complet offset it   it still has the effect of reduc the cost of liquid  reduc mani peopl   s borrow cost   i think it still   have an effect even if there   s an offset risk spread and even octob                  of     if there   s an offset bank action that affect that   so in term of cost and benefit  at this  e it seem that the cost are relat low or mute  and the benefit are posit and potenti high  in particular  as i mention befor  i   m concern about the confluenc of forc that may make thing veri difficult around the end of the year   if you look at a lot of these libor or forward market  they   re not come down either in the unit state or around the world   we have a lot of uncertainti with hedg fund  with the potenti for other institut get into troubl  and with just the implement of our polici   in particular  as i mention  the way the fdic guarante program and the tarp program work may end up singl out institut and bring them down more quick than otherwis   so i think it make sens in term of cost   benefit analysi  even more so given the tail risk around the end of the year  to act now   we have anoth opportun to act in decemb and obvious an opportun to act at ani point if we do see a dramat chang   we are get near as much as we can do  but i don   t see the cost of act more aggress and more quick here outweigh the benefit   so i support altern a with the languag as draft   thank you
thank you   governor duke
thank you   i confess i find myself torn between the posit of presid   and the equal compel argument of governor kohn  and that make altern b quit attract as a way  not becaus of ani op  about the econom outcom  but i realli do question the effect of ani move in the fed fund target given the actual trade of the fed fund rate right now   when we set the interest rate on reserv  at that point i was concern that our interest on reserv would disrupt the market for fed fund between bank becaus of the risk premium   with the fdic insur  i think that goe away  and so probabl presid     s suggest deserv some strong consider   i am also pain awar of the oper and octob                  of     financi difficulti that bank experi at a   percent fed fund rate and the like difficulti of other intermediari as the absolut level of rate fall further  as i state in my earlier remark  i   m also most concern about the import of predict in return confid to the market  and in that light  i am concern about market expect   but have recent been an expect rather than a decid  i   m go to suggest that most of those do the expect don   t understand at all the issu that we   ve discuss here today  there   s a thought that  if the fed fund rate just come down  it would mayb make this pain go away   so i agre with governor   that the public statement in the intermeet period and as we approach the point where we simpli can   t meet market expect anymor are critic import to shape market expect   so i do think it   s import that the market focus on the other effort  and with that i would support altern a
thank you   vice chairman
mr  chairman  i support altern a  both the action and the languag for the reason i said earlier   i just want to make a coupl of other point   i think the onli way to be predict in a crisi like this is to be predict inert or to be late   i don   t understand the basic argument that you add to confid by be inert or by be late or  as the chairman said  by be passiv despit overwhelm evid about chang in the outlook and risk to financi stabil   the argument that make me most uncomfort here around the tabl today is the suggest sever of you have made   i   m not sure you meant it this way   which is that the action by this committe contribut to the eros of confid   a deepli unfair suggest  now  a lot of thing happen over the last three month and the last year  and a lot of thing happen in term of polici over the last six week   there is no doubt that communic about octob                  of     polici by all the arm of the u s  govern and the uncertainti creat by the action by all the arm of the u s  govern contribut in way to uncertainti about the polici respons go forward   there is also no doubt that inevit in a crisi like this  when polici move forc  it is scari becaus a lot of peopl are not yet at the point of assess or understand the forc drive our decis   but i think it   s just unfair to suggest that the action by the chairman and this committe were a substanti contributor to the eros in confid and to uncertainti about further polici action  even though it   s true that when we move with forc and drama it has the risk of ad to uncertainti  i   d be veri care to look more broad at the full rang of other thing that happen in that period of  e  includ  for exampl  the confus establish by the rang of differ choic for intervent in lehman  aig  the gses  wamu in particular  and wachovia and what that meant   look particular at the damag to confid creat by the congress   s action in the week after the legisl was first propos   compar that  for exampl  with the announc effect of the initi thing   look also at the uncertainti creat around what the packag was design to do and how it was design   but pleas be veri care  certain outsid this room  about ad to the percept that the action by this bodi were a substanti contributor to the eros in confid   i think that don kohn said it best   the whole frame  which seem to have harden now  that the world end with the lehman bankruptci is just deepli unfair to the basic truth   independ of whether there was an option avail at the  e  the eros in under econom condit and in confid in the futur outlook was power and substanti go into august and earli septemb   so i just offer that  you know  everyon want to quot fdr   fdr said at one point     if i judg the mood of the countri right  what this call for is bold experiment      i do not believ that this chairman octob                  of     and this committe have been irrespons experi at the cost of predict and confid go forward   what we have done is a relat well design seri of escal in monetari polici and liquid intend to be preemptiv against what we knew was substanti risk of a veri advers econom and financi outcom   the risk were not broad share  not just in this room but outsid   but i think the judgment by  the chairman were larg correct in weigh those risk appropri at that  e  and i think we all owe him a substanti amount of defer for the judgment he made and his wisdom   both here in this room and in the effect he had on the polici choic that the fiscal author also ul  made look veri good now and will look even better over  e as peopl understand how grave and substanti the risk were that we were face in the economi and the financi system  one last point to presid     s question   presid   ask the obvious question  which is  what next   i think a veri good approach to decisionmak is to say     i don   t want to know so much about this   i want to know about the next three thing      i know the chairman is go to give a nice  thought  and complet answer to this   but i would just say the follow  we don   t need to know today what is next on the monetari polici front   we know there may be some argument for go lower than   percent   we have to think through veri care the collater damag consequ in term of what that   to market function and behavior   we have to look at the altern to that  includ in communic   a rang of other polici option are within our capac to influenc and effect that will give us the abil to minim downsid risk go forward   but i don   t think that we need to know   and we cannot know with precis   what the op  mix of those thing is now befor decid what to do  although i   m veri sympathet to the basic judgment   the question realli is  in move today  are we go to do more harm than good to our ul  object   it   s veri hard to make the case that we do damag to ani of our octob                  of     basic fundament object and mandat   i can see a much stronger case that we do a lot of damag to those if we don   t act today  even though we all recogn that ul  this is go to requir more than monetari polici to address the risk here
thank you   presid
i   d just like to just take a moment to react   i   m not sure whom you heard say that the result was primarili a result of this committe   s action or the chairman   s action or anyon els   s action   if those were word you were put in my mouth  that was not what i said  presid     i do think i have been support of almost all the action in term of liquid facil  i support the action   i also was support of the lehman brother decis   but i think it   s a far cri from say that uncertainti about polici contribut to uncertainti   which you agre to   it   s a far cri from that to say we lay the blame at the feet of this committe or the chairman   so i don   t know what straw man you were set up  but it certain didn   t appli to this member of the committe   thank you  mr  chairman
okay   thank you   let me just offer some thought that may be somewhat more expans than usual in respons to the question that have been rais   some of this is extemporan  so you   ll have to bear with me   let me first talk about the strategi we pursu thus far and where we are and then think about where we might go as a countri as well as an institut go forward  without go through all of the familiar discuss about how the crisi began  what the sourc of it were  i think that the feder reserv   s respons are essenti three   first  we were relat earli and aggress in our monetari polici eas  particular compar with other countri   second  we have been creativ and expans in our use of liquid tool  includ a octob                  of     wide varieti of lend program   third  we have use our avail  but not alway adequ  tool to tri to stabil system critic fail institut and to tri to mitig system risk  without sound too defens  i will tri to argu that i think on all three of these we have been more or less in the right direct   first  on the earli and aggress monetari polici eas  obvious there was a lot of concern   a lot express abroad that we were go to creat a stagflationari     s type of situat and that we were go to destroy the dollar and it role as an intern currenc   our respons essenti was that we thought that the increas in commod price were most a relat price chang induc by chang in real demand for commod and in the suppli of commod across the globe and that  at some point  those commod price increas would stabil  which would lead to a moder of the inflationari effect and concern   it took longer than we had expect  but onc it began  it was more pronounc than we had expect   inflat has not becom the problem that was anticip by mani earli on  and the dollar  of cours  is now stronger than it was befor we began our cut of interest rate   so in retrospect  i think our monetari polici  although not perfect certain   and our communic was not alway perfect   broad speak was appropri given what has turn out to be a veri sever econom situat  liquid expans also receiv some critic earli on   there was a view that this was induc moral hazard   there was also some question of whether this was an effect approach  we were help in this respect by the fact that the ecb join us veri earli in this type of aggress polici   i don   t know the counterfactu   it has obvious not solv all of the problem  but i think there   s a strong percept in the market and in the general public that these action have been support  and they help mitig the effect of the crisi on the function of the financi system   so i feel comfort also with that approach  octob                  of     the attempt to stabil fail system critic institut  begin with bear stearn  have obvious been veri controversi   there have been critic from the right and from the left   from the right  the initi critic was that we have no busi interf with the market process   we should let them fail   the market will take care of it   what are we do   we heard this as recent as jackson hole   i never took this serious   i just don   t believ that you can allow system critic institut to fail in the middl of financi crise and expect it to be not a problem   i don   t want to get into the issu about the inconsist   it   s true that we treat senior debt differ between fanni and freddi and wamu and wachovia  but i don   t think that that is the reason we are have the financi crisi we   re have   i think there was a panic brought about by the under concern about the solvenc of our financi institut   that panic essenti turn into a run   compani like wachovia that had adequ basel capit face a run on their deposit  which was self fulfil   the invest bank essenti face run   we did our best to stabil them  but i think that it was that run  that panic  and then the impact the panic had on these major institut that was the sourc of the intensif of financi crisi   so i don   t buy the argument that we should stay out of the busi of protect the financi system  and i think that the major factor was  in fact  the panic that was generat by the under uncertainti and the effect that had on critic institut  also more recent we have heard more of a critiqu from the left  which is  what in the heck were you guy do let lehman fail   this is interest given that the critiqu had been the other one for quit a while   i think that critiqu is unfair at a narrow level in that  first  lehman was a symptom as well as a caus of the recent crisi and  second  the fed and the treasuri simpli had no tool to address both lehman and the other compani that were under stress at that  e   i think that critic is appropri  though  as direct toward the unit state as a whole   we did octob                  of     not have   as the european have or as we have fdicia for bank   a system that was set up to allow a reason and respons order resolut of nonbank system critic institut   i think we now have made a lot of progress there   the tarp will provid a good interim solut   it is veri import that in the futur we address the too big to fail problem that we have  that we find way to reduc that problem  and that we find way to deal systemat with firm that are in crisi   so given the fog of war   which has  of cours  been intens go back for more than a year   i would defend what we   ve done in term of the general direct  acknowledg that execut is not alway perfect and that communic is not alway perfect  now  what about the futur   histori suggest that  whenev a financi crisi becom suffici sever  ul  the onli solut is a fiscal solut  and we will have a fiscal solut   there are two possibl   one is that the financi system will muddl through  in which case the fiscal solut will be of the sort we   ve alreadi seen   inject of capit  support for critic firm  support for the credit market in general  keynesian style demand support   that   s one possibl   i hope that   s where we   re go to be   in my own tes oni  i argu that we should tri to focus whatev s ulus we have in solv the under problem rather than simpli hand out money and that we could do that  again  by address credit market   i would add  foreclosur  homeownership  and some of those issu as well   so i hope that   s where the fiscal polici will be   i hope that will take the lead from us go forward   obvious  we   ll have to continu to play a support role in a lot of differ way  the other possibl  of cours  is that thing get much wors and that we are in the same situat as sweden or japan  in which case a massiv recapit of the bank system will be necessari   that will eventu happen  but i just note that  in all of these fiscal dynam  there is a polit economi overlay   you have to get to the point that it is not onli the right polici to induc octob                  of     fiscal support but also that it is polit possibl   that   s one reason that i think the tarp was not possibl befor the most recent period   in fact  it was bare possibl recent   so  again  i believ that fiscal polici will have to be a critic part of the solut go forward  anoth part that we should not forget about is the intern respons  which is now just begin realli to becom serious   the respons after the g  weekend on bank and bank guarante were import and suggest a commit by other countri to stabil the system  that   s veri import   i think we will see aggress monetari polici go forward  and i think we   ll see increas aggress fiscal polici in other countri becaus they recogn that the decoupl is no longer a realist stori   so that   s go to be import as well  with respect to the feder reserv  just general speak   and i   ll come back to the specif recommend for today   again  i think that our liquid provis has been construct   it has allow the use of our balanc sheet to help push in the deleverag process that   s been go on now for more than a year   my guess is it will probabl expand some more  but i don   t see it expand a lot more  if for no other reason than we are reach the limit of our oper capac as well as balanc sheet capac   i think we have been reason success in stay on the side of liquid provis and not stray into credit or take credit risk   i want to stay on that side of the line both for legal reason and becaus that   s the way monetari polici and lender of last resort polici are suppos to work   again  i hope that the fiscal intervent will now be abl to take away some of these respons from us  but we   ll have to see how they play out  i confess that i hear presid     s concern about revers these program   i recogn that it   s someth we   ll have to do care   but i just don   t see it as be someth that will be a huge problem if the economi begin to recov and credit market begin to function octob                  of     more normal   i think we   ll be abl to do it   japan was abl to get out the quantit eas without too much difficulti   but i acknowledg the point that it is someth we   re go to have to plan for and think about  on monetari polici  i think it is import for us to be respons   even if we stipul for the moment that the interest rate chang we might make today have a minim effect on the cost of capit   and i don   t necessarili agre with that  but let me stipul it   there is still the import of the signal and what we   re tri to tell the market about what we plan to do in the futur  frank  i don   t think that we should tri to signal that we are go to stand pat  that we are reluct or refus to move lower   we have to be prepar to move as low as make sens   by that i mean in part that there are institut factor that affect the efficaci of monetari polici at veri low interest rate   we   re all awar of that   i ask ye day  and i   ll ask again  for the staff to go back to the      work  to updat it  and to think it through and help us understand what i would call the effect zero   what is the real zero   is it zero   is it    basi point   is it    basi point   we have to recogn that if we do go to liter zero  it would have veri substanti effect on a number of financi market  and we would have to ask ourselv whether the benefit from that are worth the disloc   the japanes thought they were  and for exampl  they did shut down the interbank market for a long  e   mayb do it is worth that   those are decis that we need to make befor the next meet  and we will have opportun to talk about this togeth and in public as well   but i do think that monetari polici need to be proactiv and to continu to be part of the solut here go forward  what about today   s action   i essenti accept the general chang in outlook as propos by the  book   sinc our last meet there has been an effect tighten in financi condit  which has overwhelm the    basi point cut that we did with the other central bank  octob                  of     the outlook has becom much wors   so it is import for us to act aggress and to signal essenti that we   re will to do whatev is necessari to support the recoveri of this economi  there has been a lot of talk about confid   i think the best thing we can do for confid is to say that we   re go to do whatev it take  even if it involv extraordinari action  to get this economi back onto a path where it can begin to grow in a reason way again   signal coy  be cute  is not a safe strategi right now   we just need to be straightforward and say that we   re go to do what it take   in my view  just to be specif     basi point is the right step today  now  a number of concern and object have been rais   let me address just a few of them   one is presid bullard   s veri interest present on the inflat trap  and intuit it   s clear that  for a given real interest rate  you can have an equilibrium at which you have a high nomin rate and a high expect inflat rate or you can have a low nomin rate and deflat  both of those thing are possibl   that was the trap that japan got into   we obvious want to avoid the deflat trap   the question is  how do you avoid it   as far as i can see   obvious we can get further into this   the best two way to avoid it are  first  as presid   suggest  reaffirm our commit to price stabil defin as     to   percent or whatev our committe   s general view is   we   re go to tri to do that with our project and potenti with the trial project that we   re do  and i think we can continu to strengthen our commit to maintain a posit inflat rate   the other thing  in term of the dynam  is to be aggress in tri to avoid get to a deflationari situat  where those expect move in that direct  i don   t think deflat expect will aris spontan becaus we   re cut interest rate   i think they   ll aris becaus the economi is expect to be extrem weak  and anyth we can do to elimin that expect in my view would be help  octob                  of     the second object i   ve heard is the question of whether or not these action are effect  i think they are effect   mayb they   re not as effect as under normal circumst  but let me put it to you this way   if we cut    basi point today and the libor   oi spread rise    basi point tomorrow  i will accept that there   s a problem   but if the libor spread  sn   t move much and the overal libor drop    basi point  then i think that we   re have an effect   if you look at libor over the past year  you   ll see a dramat declin even though the spread have widen   i don   t think you can argu that we   re not have ani effect   to the extent that we   re have a mute effect  you can just as well argu that we should be more aggress becaus you need to do more to get the same impact   so i understand those concern  and i reiter  respond to governor duke and other  that as we get veri low  there are side effect on certain institut and financi market   we need to understand those  and that   s part of our decis process   but i don   t think it   s the case that monetari polici has zero impact  the third argument i   ve heard is the    keep the power dri    argument   unless you think that movement in the rate are entir psycholog in their effect  i don   t think that that   s a strong argument in this particular circumst   again  we analyz this quit a bit in the      episod  and the general outcom from the literatur and from simul done by our own staff   dave reifschneid       and other have publish research on this   is that the best way to avoid the zero bound is to be more aggress than normal to tri to avoid the accumul of weak and tri to avoid get into that trap   so more preemptiv strategi are  in fact  consist with what we   ve done for the last year  my recommend for today is    basi point and the languag in altern a   i do think that it will be at least moder benefici both in term of psycholog and in term of reduc the cost of fund and give some addit support to fund market   i hope that in octob                  of     these remark  which again are somewhat extemporan  i have address to some extent the futur step   we ought  again  to think veri hard in the next six week about what the real zero is and what the implic are of go below  say     basi point   then we ought to make a determin  and it may be that we can sit still in decemb   it may be that thing improv quit a bit in the market  for exampl   it   s possibl   one advantag of do    today is that we almost certain will not have to do anyth intermeet becaus we will have done this signific step today   so in decemb we   ll be abl to look at the situat   we may be abl to do littl or noth   it is possibl   but if we decid that further action is need  at that point we should be prepar to decid what the regim is go to be  how far we   re go to go  and what the effect zero is  and i think that we shouldn   t hesit to do that if that   s what the situat call for   so i think there is a way forward   i understand the need to withdraw all these polici action at an appropri  e   but i don   t think that focus on the near term for the moment is at all inconsist with the fact that at some point these thing will have to be revers   so  ani further question or comment   presid
first  i would like to thank you  mr  chairman  for that veri thorough and clear elucid   i meant to mention earlier that i actual agre with presid     it   s worthwhil now and then evok ronald reagan   what i mean by that is not his    where   s the poni     comment  but more import  the reason he was so success as a leader was that he had clear object  they were limit  and they were well articul   it  sn   t matter if you   re a democrat or a republican   i think it   s veri import for us to understand what our object are in order for us to be fulli support   by the way     as mr    has been  i have been fulli support of all of these initi   again  i want to thank you  mr  chairman  for help us understand better the cognit road map becaus it is critic for all of us to do what   octob                  of     suggest  which is have all hand on deck and make sure we   re all fulli support   against that background i would support altern a   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   other question   presid
just a question or thought   as the staff prepar the review of the      studi and memo and think about what zero effect mean and how we might oper in those circumst  one thing i think would be use to includ is a discuss of whether or not when that  e come we announc that public and say     okay   this is it   from now on we have to do x  y  or z     and make it part of the communic strategi   mayb they would anyway   but if we get to the point where we now as a group have some concern that  well  effect we realli don   t want to go below x  we will have to do some other oper action as a substitut for that
i think there   s no problem do that   i can do that   that is not a problem   presid
yes  i also strong support your charg and direct to the staff to assembl with all due hast updat inform for the committe about what the effect lower bound on nomin interest rate is   but i   d urg you  along the line of what presid   suggest  to includ in that charg what we would do onc we got there  what we could do  and what would be open to us   i emphas again the relev even if we don   t get there becaus analyt we   re effect do that right now with interest on reserv   the classic econom of this is that  when you get down to effect equival between a monetari asset and a govern bond of one day durat or whatev  to be effect monetari polici need to be fiscal polici   it need to acquir other asset that we wouldn   t normal otherwis acquir   we   re do that right now   so i   d emphas the import and relev of that
mr  chairman
i also think it would be help  as the staff look at the polici option go forward  that they do other part of the communic option  too   not just those but also other way to think about how to make polici for look at and communic a path that are differ from what we did in        it would be good to look at option for how we talk about polici go forward in that context along with just the oper choic and the polici choic
just to follow up on that   i think that   s a veri excel suggest  presid     to be veri specif about that  in our trial run  one thing that we did was to look at what we thought was the steadi state   one way to engend some communic about the longer run might be to includ what the committe thought the steadi state neutral level of the fund rate would be in that environ   i   d describ the path by which we got there  it would convey some sens to the marketplac of what we thought would be in some normal world a reason level of the fund rate consist with those target   i just throw that on the tabl as someth to think about
okay   other comment   would you call the roll  pleas
yes   this vote encompass the languag of altern a that was in the packag pass out earlier today as well as the direct from the bluebook  which state the follow     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  octob                  of     the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent     chairman bernank vice chairman    governor duke presid     governor kohn  governor    presid pianalto presid     presid  n governor
