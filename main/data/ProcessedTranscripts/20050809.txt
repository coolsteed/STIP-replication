good morn  everyon   dino  pleas start us off
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart in front of you  dure the intermeet period  market particip confront the surpris chines revalu  strong domest data  and high oil price   on net  the result in the market was higher yield and equiti price   the top panel of the first page graph the decemb      and decemb      eurodollar deposit futur contract   earlier this spring  the impli rate on these contract had been come down and the spread between the       and       contract was narrow  as most market particip thought the end of the tighten cycl was approach   but dure the intermeet period  rate rose sharpli and the calendar spread widen   the strong data and some reassess about inflationari pressur suggest to mani in the market that the committe will continu to tighten beyond the so call neutral rate    whatev that is   longer term yield rose steadili in near a straight line sinc the last meet  as shown in the bottom panel   sinc june     yield on    and     year treasuri rose about    basi point   essenti  the curv had a parallel shift higher and the shape remain unchang   that dim slight  but did not silenc  the chatter about invert yield curv observ in the last period   despit the rise in yield  risk appetit in credit market remain strong and the search for yield remain intact   the top of page   graph the option adjust spread for    year mortgag back secur  mbs    that spread is slight wider than earlier this year but remain low by histor standard   as yield move in either direct  this is one market that investor   and for that matter we at the desk   tend to watch close  given the acceler effect that convex hedg can have   howev  even if yield continu higher  there are reason to expect that  at least under current condit  mbs relat hedg will play a lesser role   first  mortgag convex is concentr in tradit    year fix rate mortgag and mbs   right now    percent or more of the    year fix mbs univers have coupon below current rate and thus are alreadi    out of the money    to be refinanc    the top right chart show the distribut of outstand    year mbs    as a result  further increas in long term rate will like have onli a small impact on hedg need go forward     the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix              second  the shift in issuanc to hybrid and other adjust product has reduc the overal need to hedg convex for new mbs product   and third  those who do hedg mortgag convex are more like to hedg up front with interest rate option and less like to hedg dynam with swap or treasuri   the low level of impli volatil has made it cheap to buy interest rate option for hedg  and sever mortgag hedger have increas their use of option hedg after their dynam hedg strategi produc poor result in the summer of        final  there has been some shift at the margin among the holder of mbs from those who hedg activ to those who probabl do not   as shown in the bottom left panel  the two major hous gses  govern sponsor enterpris    which do hedg activ   have seen their portfolio level off or shrink outright   meanwhil  one group that has been accumul mbs is foreign offici account   the bottom right panel graph aggreg hold of gse secur held by foreign account at the new york fed sinc januari        despit the account and manag problem at both major gses  central bank kept buy gse

billion  or almost    percent of agenc hold   moreov  this number probabl underst total central bank hold of mbs sinc some central bank have outsourc manag of their mbs portfolio to extern manag who use other custodian   move to page three  the corpor market recov veri quick after it spring  jitter   the top right panel show the high yield spread  which has narrow by more than     basi point sinc earli may   take a longer term   e frame  as shown in the top left panel  even at recent peak spread are at veri low level    while spread are narrow  qualiti has shown some sign of deterior   the middl panel graph for      through      to date the percent of high yield issuanc compris of secur rate at b  or lower at the  e of issuanc   in the past year  rough    percent have been in this categori  exceed the level seen in earli      and also in the late     s dure the junk bond boom   the use of those proceed is shown in the bottom panel  after sever year of focus on balanc sheet repair  main through refinanc  issuer are get a bit more aggress   let me draw your attent to the red bar at the bottom of the stack   so far in       about    percent of issuanc has been use to financ leverag buyout   the highest that number has been sinc             move oversea  the pictur was mix   in the euro area  econom data  were  at the margin  somewhat better than had been expect   those improv data and statement by ecb  european central bank  offici that they were not contempl an eas of polici shift sen ent in euro area money market   as shown in the top left panel on page    the   month forward rate agreement on   month euro deposit   the solid   line   rose sharpli and unwound the eas that had been price into market around the  e of the last fomc meet   the ecb has now maintain it key polici rate at   percent for    consecut month   in contrast  the bank of england eas polici by    basi point last week  as expect   and as shown in the top right panel  anoth eas is expect   in asia  the chines revalu was the most noteworthi news event  even though  overal  the price action in region market was tame   ex ant  the currenc that was expect to appreci the most if china were to move was the japanes yen   and on the day of the chines announc  the yen rose sharpli   but that was quick unwound and   as shown in the middl left panel   the yen remain broad weaker compar to it level at the begin of the year   japanes export  who report are use a refer rate of  ¥     are feel veri comfort with the yen at these level   with data such as this morn   s strong machineri order suggest that the japanes recoveri is intact  equiti and jgb  japanes govern bond  yield have both been rise   the    year jgb yield has risen to about     percent   the failur of the

befor juli      other region currenc also appreci briefli but  with the except of the malaysian ringgit  those move have been larg unwound   turn to domest oper  i want to briefli updat the committe on the growth of soma  system open market account  in the first half of        the top chart depict the growth of soma   s outright hold in half      year increment sinc        so far in       soma has expand by onli about    billion  the slowest growth sinc the first half of       a period that was distort by y k effect  and  given the rise base  in percentag term the slow growth of soma is even more pronounc   the bottom panel graph the autonom factor chang over those same  six month interv   the relationship between net factor movement and soma growth is not one for one but over longer period the two track each other   the notabl featur of the first six month in      are the slow growth of currenc  in    and the reduct of requir oper balanc  in blue    final  let me say a word about our foreign reserv   earlier this year i report on my plan to shift invest of the system   s and the esf   s  exchang stabil fund  yen reserv from treasuri bill to a portfolio of jgb invest and deposit at the bank of japan   you will recal that the japanes t bill market had becom illiquid and  in my view  no longer suitabl for a reserv portfolio   after make the necessari system and procedur chang  we recent start the process of roll off matur t bill and invest the proceed into jgbs and boj deposit    mr  chairman  onc again there were no foreign oper in the period   i will need a vote to approv the domest oper
you rais the issu of the question efficaci of the dynam hedg engag in by fanni and freddi earlier this year or last year   i   ve forgotten exact when   i don   t recal it be both gses  and i wasn   t quit clear whether that was just a general rumor or what   is that now confirm
well  i actual had a differ institut in mind   a veri larg player in this market who did have some issu in         and they have now chang their hedg strategi
i understand that   you weren   t refer to someth new  you were refer back to the origin problem
did they ever acknowledg that that was a problem
well  a fact is someth that can be observ and verifi  and i   m talk
no  i realiz that   but as far as i know  they have never acknowledg that dynam hedg did not work for them at that  e
well  let   s put it this way  some institut do it better than other  and there  were some institut that didn   t do it veri well in         patricia  do you want to add someth
yes  i think that   s exact right   the one gse that had reli histor on a lot more
just becaus he is run for governor or someth like that  you don   t have to be that diplomat    laughter
the one gse that tradit had done a lot of dynam hedg had alreadi start  even in       to shift over to more option hedg   but a coupl of depositori institut did not make such a big switch   for one particular larg firm  the result of poor dynam hedg show up in their oper result  and by all report they have sinc    gotten religion     shall we say   and in part that   s becaus it has been inexpens to hedg with option in the last coupl of year
well  as far as you can judg  in the mortgag market has there been a signific reduct in the proport of dynam relat to passiv hedg that has occur subsequ to that episod   and has it stay down
is there much dynam hedg go on at all
there is some   almost everyon dynam hedg some portion of  their convex   certain  mortgag servic still do some dynam hedg  as do the gses  and hedg fund and fix incom fund that hold mortgag do some dynam hedg   so  there is some  but it   s a substanti lower proport than it was three year ago
go from passiv to dynam hedg  if you do it right    enhanc the bottom line   and it could be signific  so that the attract is realli quit strong   well  i think i   ve squeez about as much as i   m go to get out of you on that   laughter   second  regard the pickup in mortgag back secur hold by foreign central bank  it   s quit evid that the hold of the gse debentur are in lieu of u s  treasuri secur and they are held sole becaus of the extra yield   i know that explicit   it   s not a question  they   ve told me that   inde  they   ve ask me     are these guy okay  so i don   t have  to worri about them      but how do they view mortgag back secur   do they view them as mere treasuri with a higher yield   i assum that the mbs they   re hold are fanni or freddi guarante  not privat conduit
do we know that
yes  becaus all of these secur are on fedwir   we as custodian are not hold ani physic or other white label that are not on fedwir   so these would all be freddi  fanni  or ginni  but in fact  they are most fanni and freddi
they don   t hold ginni  it  sn   t help that much   do you get the impress that the mortgag back secur are in lieu of u s  treasuri   do the central bank tell you anyth
i think in part there   s a diversif effect go on becaus some of these central bank have such larg reserv that they have expand out the risk curv   so they   ve expand their hold from treasuri to agenc secur to mbs to corpor bond  and some even to equiti and ab  asset back secur    actual  some of the central bank      with veri larg reserv have expand their asset class quit a bit   so it   s hard to disentangl how much of that is a substitut for treasuri and how much reflect just an effort to get a more diversifi portfolio
well  if you have a gse guarante of an mbs  for exampl  whi   it sell at as much of a spread abov debentur of the gses   is the option to refin the whole differ
it   s the option   it   s the unpredict of when you get your cash back
so it   s no credit risk differenti
i would not see it that way
all right   i notic you made a particular point of the solemn statement by the peopl   s bank of china that the juli    move was not the first step in a seri of chang    sn   t that strike you as what a financ minist would say when ask the question     mr  financ minist  are you about to revalu       laughter   there was no other statement the author could make for fear of get a huge inflow of fund   as you rememb  origin they character it as an initi step and they back away from it  which do you believ
well  the market thought that the juli    move was a first instal  and they were encourag to believ that by some of the initi statement   and then in the juli     statement they did an about face
but i   m ask   whi   the juli    statement have ani valu whatsoev   it   s a perfect obvious thing to say if you   re a central banker  even if you   re prepar to revalu six month later  or three month later  or ani  e
well  i think the juli    statement basic sent a signal that there wasn   t go to be as much flexibl as the market thought
all you   ve got to do is watch the actual transact
right  and veri littl movement or shift has occur   so i think the market are say that this is either a basket of one  laughter  or it   s a basket where the dollar is    percent of the basket and that   s realli what they   re target
or the market could do correl of the dollar against all other currenc and then presum the basket consist of all those in which the r  is abov        laughter   governor bie
i want to follow up on your comment about mortgag hedg   i   m  hear concern that there is increas hedg activ for servic right on the new option arm   to the extent that they are servic right  the risk is the prepay risk  and histor bank have found it veri hard to come up with ani kind of hedg model against prepay on arm   so this could be a hit to earn of bank that are build up big portfolio of this   and it involv the servic right  not carri the loan in the portfolio   are you hear of anybodi tri to hedg that prepay risk
they   re tri to model it   i don   t know if they have found ani good one  you   re absolut right about that   these product have not been wide use  they   ve tend to be use by a narrow segment until fair recent   arm do have differ prepay characterist   i know from what i   ve read from the folk who sell the model that they are work to improv their arm model to help with the hedg   but at this stage it   s not as straightforward as buy an interest rate option on a long term fix rate mortgag where      there   s sort of a natur hedg in a natur market   i don   t think there   s much likelihood in the near term of a prepay shock to the servic  but in a year or two the possibl is probabl fair signific
isn   t that a cost hedg  given the indeterminaci of the behavior of some new product such as that   the prepay pattern is virtual unknown
it is   that   s exact right   they do the best they can with the limit histori and inform they have from the way the market has behav in the past   but it has not been a veri big market becaus a lot of these weren   t securit until fair recent  so they weren   t price veri well   therefor  unless you have a histori in the busi and have your own intern model  it   s extrem difficult to figur out how prepay are go to behav
the big question is who is buy the securit version of these   i can understand that there are origin who get the fee and then sell it on to x   i alway wonder  who is x
from the littl inform that we have gather  it   s a fair wide array of investor   from hedg fund to a veri larg number of intern investor   i don   t know if central bank are buy these  but
well  if you packag someth with a lot of yield  there are buyer out there  wait for that
exact   that   s true
to move from the mortgag back market to treasuri  there was an interest articl over the weekend regard a squeez on the    year note   i   m wonder what you have seen on that and what you think about it
yes  there have been a coupl of articl in the last two day about that situat   in my view  that particular articl in the new york  e was somewhat exagger and had some fact wrong   that said  the cheapest to deliv into the contract in june was veri tight   but to conclud that there was a squeez as a result is probabl go too far  base on the evid   the issu here is that the futur are veri  veri larg   the cheapest to deliv contract is a finit size treasuri   as you know  this sort of treasuri issuanc has not increas over the last few year  while the number of peopl trade and the volum of trade have increas   so there is this imbal that we saw a few month ago in anoth futur case  and we may see more of it becaus of the way the contract are structur     has done some work on this as well   i don   t know if you have anyth to add
i think that   s right   this has been an evolv pattern over the past sever futur settlement   there was a pattern in the last few month of pronounc tight in the particular issu that we   re talk about  which is the februari      note   and it is the case that current the cheapest to deliv issu into the septemb contract has an even smaller outstand size   so this situat will bear some watch
that have ani implic for where the    year rate is on the yield curv
yes  potenti   these issu that enjoy a lot of    special    in the repo market becaus they can be financ cheapli tend to trade notic below the yield curv  at least at  e
it   s a few basi point   it can be five to ten basi point  which at one level is a lot   at anoth level  it   s mere the market forc at work
so you think it   s a suppli issu and not compar to the salomon brother situat where there was some actual desir to keep stock off the market
well  at core  i think it   s a suppli issu   by the same token  that  sn   t mean you won   t have peopl tri to take advantag of that
right   i notic that the treasuri is look into it
but there   s no evid that i   m awar of that there was anyth of the kind of situat that salomon present a few year ago
further question for dino     if not  would someon like to move to ratifi the transact   vice chair
without object  they are approv   we   ll turn now to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   a corollari to murphi   s law is that the biggest forecast error on an employ report alway occur when the report come between  book public day and the fomc meet   laughter   last year  in an event that undoubt is sear more into my memori than your  the corollari held true   this year  in the biggest surpris of all  there was no surpris  and i am in the unexpect posit of be abl to report that the august  book forecast has surviv the incom data a grand total of five day and count   in that regard  i should note that this morn   s releas on product and cost came in veri much in line with our expect   a colleagu correct observ that there are a lot of move piec in this forecast  so i thought you might find it help for me to review what some of those piec are   the first has to do with the implic of the annual revis to the nation incom and product account  nipa  data   as you know  the bea  bureau of econom analysi  took down it es  of the level of real gdp in the fourth quarter of      by     percent   in respons  we move down our es  of potenti gdp by an ident amount   thus  all els equal  we would have shown the same gdp gap at the end of      in this  book as we did in the june  book         but not quit all els was equal   in work unrel to the nipa revis  we refin our model of the labor forc particip rate so that we could extend our es  of the trend in that variabl backward in  e on a methodolog consist basi   as it happen  those refin to the model steepen the downward tilt in the trend by enough to subtract a coupl of addit tenth from the level of potenti gdp by the end of last year  leav the gdp gap at     percent rather than the     percent that we had shown in the june  book   the second move piec has to do with the growth of potenti gdp go forward   one implic of the revis to the nation incom account is that the capit stock is like to grow more slowli over the forecast period than we had earlier believ   accord  capit deepen should make a smaller contribut to the growth of potenti gdp  inde  we have cut that  contribut by a quarter of a percentag point this year and next   so on the suppli side  the basic summari is this  a slight smaller gap as of the end of       and somewhat slower growth of potenti gdp go forward   the third move piec has to do with the demand side   we read the data that were releas dure the intermeet period as suggest that the economi has somewhat more forward momentum in the near term than we had anticip in the june  book   you might not know it from top line real gdp growth in the second quarter  which was onli about a quarter of a percentag point stronger than we had anticip  but the composit of growth point to greater strength   in particular  inventori invest step down much more sharpli in the second quarter than we had expect   as best we can tell  most firm outsid the motor vehicl industri are satisfi with their current inventori posit  and so will see no need to pare the pace of inventori invest to anywher near the same degre as they did dure the first half of the year   if they manag to maintain their inventori invest at the second quarter pace   as is anticip in our forecast   they will  at one and the same  e  keep the inventori sale ratio move down in line with it long term trend and add more than a percentag point to the acceler of real gdp between the second and third quarter   the under pace of final sale also look a littl stronger to us now than at the  e of the june  book  but not by much   a good deal of the second quarter surpris was in net export  and we do not expect that unanticip strength to be carri forward   as for domest final demand  the second quarter surpris was veri modest   to be sure  the recent pace of motor vehicl sale is eye pop  but the bulk of that demand is be met out of inventori   and  in ani event  we have assum that the piper will have to be paid as far as those sale are concern   despit the extens of the employe discount program  we have sale drop back in august and septemb from  the    million rate reach in juli   on the theori that mani consum      probabl believ the automak the first  e around when they said the discount offer would expir   and we have the payback continu into the fourth quarter   asid from net export and motor vehicl sale  our outlook for privat domest final demand is hard revis  on net  over the last three quarter of this year   a fourth move piec has to do with inflat   the inform we receiv dure the intermeet period present a mix pictur relat to our expect in the june  book   on the one hand  the most recent read on core market base pce  person consumpt expenditur  price inflat have been encourag  and they have caus us to mark down our es  of inflat in this categori    percentag point in the second quarter and near that much in the third quarter   on the other hand  we have a good deal more energi price inflat in this project  which contribut direct and in full forc to the overal pce inflat rate  and seep through as well   to the tune of     percentag point   into core inflat next year   and we also have less restraint in this project from ani gap in resourc util   on balanc  though  we see these factor as fight each other to a draw  leav our project for core market base inflat unrevis from the last  book   howev  that was not the end of the inflat stori   a consequ of the annual revis was that nonmarket price now are on a steeper upward trajectori than befor   in our project  we have assum that inflat in this compon will averag rough   percent go forward  rather than   percent as we had assum in the june  book   becaus this compon has a weight of    percent in the core pce price index  the increment of   percentag point to the rate of growth of this compon in our project add     percentag point to our project for core pce inflat   the last move piec has to do with monetari polici   against the backdrop of somewhat slower growth of aggreg suppli  greater near term  thrust in aggreg demand  and a somewhat higher rate of inflat in core pce price  we shift up the assum trajectori for the fund rate    basi point essenti throughout the forecast period   on our current assumpt  we have the fund rate level out at    percent in the middl of next year   evid  privat market particip share at least some of the same reaction to the incom data  as they have mark up fund rate futur price by almost exact the same amount   the adjust to the polici assumpt was import for present you with a forecast broad consist with your polici object   had we left the fund rate assumpt unchang at it june trajectori  output would have been abov it potenti in      and       and core inflat would have been run at     percent in those two year  and edg up rather than down        one of the mani question confront you is how you should react to this chang in the inflat outlook   are inflat pressur unchang  on net  from  last  e  as indic by our outlook for the core market base compon   or are they more intens than befor  as indic by our outlook for the offici core pce price index includ the nonmarket compon  and the overal pce index   it seem to me that the answer to these question depend on what you are tri to control  and the  e frame over which you seek to impos that control   if you see yourselv as control the overal pce price index  and you aim to bring that measur back into line with your polici object within a small number of year  then you would probabl regard inflat pressur as have worsen sinc the june  book  most becaus of the greater direct contribut of energi price to top line inflat  but also becaus of the fa  pace of increas of nonmarket price   at the other extrem  if you see yourselv as control the core market base index  then you would probabl judg no materi chang to have taken place in inflat pressur sinc the june  book  base on the simpl observ that our outlook for this measur of inflat has not been revis   perhap the toughest case is the intermedi one  in which you see yourselv as control core pce inflat  includ it nonmarket compon   in this case  if you regard the nonmarket compon as bear no relationship to realiti  then you might insul your polici from the chang in bea methodolog by mark up your target inflat rate by     percentag point   equival  in effect  to control the market base compon   on the other hand  if you think the nonmarket price index might convey some use inform   perhap not from quarter to quarter or even from year to year  but at least over the intermedi term   then you would probabl be inclin to adopt a tighter monetari polici in respons to the chang in measur methodolog   this is the assumpt implicit in the  book   one last point on which i should be clear  on our es   the monetari polici assumpt we adopt for purpos of this  book is suffici restrict to keep actual and potenti output in approxim balanc and to put core pce inflat  even includ the upward revis nonmarket compon  on a slight downward slope trajectori   inde  as best we can tell     percent on the fund rate is slight more than enough  in the long run  to keep inflat head downward  and after a few year at that level  the fund rate could be brought back down to   percent   this is not a monetari polici that acquiesc  in the long term  to inflat continu to run at   percent  but rather aim to nudg it down  littl by littl  into the neighborhood of     percent   in this respect  the monetari polici in the current  book is veri similar to the one in the june  book   in both case  polici nudg the       inflat rate down to     percent  but also in both case  mani year were requir befor that lower level was attain      son will continu our present
the staff outlook for real gdp growth abroad is littl chang this  e from that in the june  book   econom expans in our foreign trade partner has rebound from it subdu first quarter pace  and we expect that it will firm somewhat more later this year and next    nevertheless  three element of our baselin outlook this  e are suffici chang from the previous forecast that they warrant attent today  first is the veri sizabl  posit chang that recent data have impli to the contribut to u s  real gdp growth from the extern sector  second  the long await announc by chines offici of a chang in their exchang rate regim  and third  yet anoth discret upward revis in our project for global oil price          we now es  that net export made an arithmet posit contribut of     percentag point to real growth in the second quarter  a figur slight less than that report by the bea in the advanc real gdp data for the quarter  with june nomin trade data yet to be releas  both the bea and we must guess  that number in construct a second quarter figur for real gdp  our es  of the contribut is now signific larger than the      percentag point that we had incorpor into the june forecast   the nomin trade data for may surpris us with stronger export and a bit weaker import than we had anticip   these data account for     percentag point of the revis   the remaind of the revis to the contribut owe to a markdown of import in line with the advanc nipa data  which contain a differ translat gap between the balanc of payment data and the nation incom data than that for q   which in turn had been the basi of our project   the overal revis to second quarter import is somewhat greater than that to export   we now es  that real import of good and servic actual declin in the second quarter wherea real export grew at over a    percent annual rate  veri strong nomin export in april were follow by even slight larger export in may   over the forecast period  we expect that real import will resum grow  at an annual rate of about   percent   posit but slow impetus from u s  output expans larg explain the growth of import  with relat price switch from be a small drag to provid a slight boost to core import  we project that real export growth will step down in the second half of this year and a bit more next year  to rate more in line with s ulus from output growth abroad and diminish impetus from dollar depreci over the past three year   all in all  the contribut from the extern sector revert to negat      this quarter in our baselin forecast and is about minus     percentag point over the next year   the juli    announc by chines offici of a chang in their exchang rate regim end specul about when such a move would come  but left mani other question unansw   follow the initi     percent revalu of the renminbi in term of the dollar  the exchang valu of the chines currenc has fluctuat veri narrowli   essenti no inform has yet been provid about the composit of the areference@ basket of currenc that is now part of the regim   scope has now appar emerg for futur move in the exchang rate in term of the dollar  but some offici statement have emphas that such further chang will be gradual    to construct our forecast of activ abroad  we need to make a specif assumpt about the chines exchang rate regim go forward   hold the renminbi peg at it current dollar exchang rate seem to give too littl recognit to the major step we thought was impli by the announc  but we saw as arbitrari ani specif project we might make of further bilater appreci of the renminbi against the dollar   accord  we chose to harmon our treatment of the renminbi and most other currenc   for the purpos of the forecast  we have project that the renminbi will appreci slight in nomin term   at a rate compar to that we project for the euro  the yen  the canadian dollar   and have made small adjust to other asian emerg market currenc as well   this trend nod in the direct of the downward pressur that we judg will at some point be visibl on the dollar as a result of the financ burden of our grow extern indebted  we realiz that when it occur this pressur is not like to be even distribut across all bilater dollar exchang rate with other currenc   nor is it like to occur smooth and gradual over  e  howev  we do expect that the real index of the dollar in term of all our import trade partner is like to move down on balanc over a reason long horizon becaus of global imbal   ad the renminbi into that mix has result in a slight more rapid rate of real dollar depreci than we had previous been incorpor into the staff forecast   the spot price of west texa intermedi  wti  crude oil move up over the intermeet period to exceed     per barrel on august   as the  book was complet and has risen further in the day sinc then   the price of oil futur contract with more distant expir have surg as well   this most recent run up in spot wti price has been accompani by a widen in the spread between that price and the price of heavier  more sour  crude   this wti premium is expect to unwind  but not immedi  result in a forecast for the u s  oil import price that is littl chang on averag over the second half of this year but is more than    higher in      than we had project in the june  book        various factor appear to have contribut over the past six week to the upward pressur on oil

the futur curv   renew upward pressur on global oil price remain a risk to the forecast  howev  as higher oil price for consum tend to erod domest demand in import countri and region  and oil export take some  e befor increas their expenditur     and i will be happi to answer ani question
what   s the latest weight for the nonmarket compon of core pce
it   s about    percent
i know in the cpi it   s of the same categori or even larger  so to speak   but is there ani question about the weight of that   is it general accept as the right number   it   s a veri big number
it is a veri big number   these nonmarket element are  i think  by definit not includ in the cpi
correct   most of them are not in the cpi
i was mere refer to the owner    equival rent and that sort of thing  which is the same type of calcul
well  owner    equival rent for this purpos is defin as a market compon even though it  too  was imput by the bea   in general  our clear prefer is for the weight scheme embodi in the pce price index as oppos to the consum price index   we think that give a more realist portray of the market basket
the revis they made are huge
they are   for better or for wors  the fact is that they most have the charact of correct someth that involv either an error or a miscommun   in one case  it was clear just a code error in the comput code for medic servic   in the other case   which the bea  sn   t quit portray as an error   it was an errant trend appar introduc by some miscommun between a supervisor and an employe   so now that has been brought into line   a certain price for noncommerci bank  i think  had been drop at    percent per year and now it is rise slight   so that alon contribut about   percentag point to the upward revis in the core measur for        so these are veri big  veri quantit import revis
are they go to revis it again next year
i   m absolut certain that their hope is that ani revis will be for reason other than error detect   they will bring on board new sourc data and new      inform of all sort   we   re not expect anyth again that would involv revis of this magnitud
we   ve been discuss anecdot evid in the last few meet on the lack of price power in the corpor sector   and we   ve anticip that margin would be squeez unless there was substanti top line or revenu expans   i   m wonder if you   re see ani evid that that situat has chang   is there ani evid in the data that compani are not just meet these increas price pressur through cost cut but are begin to pass their higher cost on   and then     my question for you is  could you give a number for the trend line rate of dollar depreci  includ the yuan  you anticip
i don   t think we are see ani slippag or deterior in price pressur   mayb the most direct piec of evid on that is just that the last coupl of read on the cpi have come in to the good side of our expect   i think that   s the best summari statist i can cite   from the order contact that we have in the busi communiti  for exampl  i don   t think we   re notic a mark intensif of price pressur either   it is true that in the nation incom account the markup of price over unit labor cost was revis down just a bit  but we don   t lean on that veri heavili in our inflat analysi   so  i   d say the fact that the market base inflat news has been to the good side of our expect is probabl the best summari statist that i can give you
with respect to the trend  over the  book forecast horizon  the dollar is now  on averag  depreci in real term about     percent  and in previous  book the compar figur would have been about    percent   so we   ve deliber      construct it so that the    percent embed the notion that a block of asian currenc was peg to the dollar   if we   re go to undo that assumpt  it should show through   so it   s by construct  basic  this is just our attempt to signal this and let the rate of depreci rise to     percent   i have to say that when we do  book extens that find their way into background use in the bluebook and so forth  that rate of depreci so allow the extern imbal to explod that we actual have to up it   so  ani  e we do anyth that run longer than the  book horizon  we put in a number like minus    becaus otherwis the extern sector behav in such a domin way that the simul don   t seem use   but for the  book horizon  that period is so short that in all honesti the real dollar could go up and not down at all  so we now have that minus     percent in place as a sort of marker
i thought your discuss of the detail of the  book forecast was veri enlighten   i want to congratul you for the present   the implic for inflat that flow from that were clear state   the question i have is whether the confid band around your forecast for inflat has chang veri much   is it as  symmetr as it was
i can   t think of ani reason off the top of my head for the confid band to have chang   we certain perceiv no asymmetri in the risk   we   ve gone to enorm effort this  e  as alway  to present to you a forecast with balanc risk   i don   t see ani reason whi the width of our confid band should have narrow or widen   i suppos i   m go to fall into a common conceptu error here  but i guess i would say that the uncertainti around the oil price project might be even greater now than averag   but i hear      echo in my brain say     you know  now is a particular uncertain  e     and i never hear anybodi ever say     now is a particular certain  e       laughter   nevertheless  if i were go to point to someth that would widen the confid interv  it may be the oil situat   but i don   t find that a veri compel piec of evid
could i add just one other point to that question   the output gap is smaller  essenti shrink to almost noth by the end of the year  and there   s less slack in the economi     that factor into your answer to toni   s question
no  it  sn   t becaus in our inflat model  the output gap enter linear   so it has the same effect at the margin  whether it   s      as it was at the end of the project last  e around  or     as it is this  e   we are veri uncertain about what the actual magnitud of that output gap is  but the fact that our point es  is at     percent rather than     percent  sn   t materi chang our uncertainti about the inflat outlook   it would if we perceiv some kind of a threshold effect   if  when output move abov potenti  we saw that as ignit inflat pressur in a nonlinear way   but we   ve look over the year and haven   t found ani compel evid of a nonlinear effect of that kind
yet theori would suggest it has got to exist
well  i think the best metaphor for the way we take this measur of the output gap into account is that we view it as a baromet   it   s an indic of pressur   at ani given moment in the economi there are go to be sector and region that have more pressur than other   so if the output gap is well construct  what it should be show is that as actual output get into the neighborhood of and perhap even exceed potenti  in general averag pressur will be rise   so the averag upward impetus on inflat will be increas  but
it   s the interact effect between industri   if a coupl of them are start to squeez  the interact pick up   and it becom a geometr  not an arithmet phenomenon  as everybodi move toward capac
there use to be a view   i   m think back to the brook     s view   of an l shape suppli curv
well  how about a j    laughter
i   ll give you j    laughter   you know  our abil to detect these kind of thing in the aggreg data is not veri good  especi against
no  i understand that   but there   s an interest question here about polici   i think you   re quit obvious correct that it   s veri difficult to find becaus it   s not a point es   it   s obvious some sort of function   but at the end of the day  there has to be a fix absolut ceil at some point   as you approach that  i don   t think it   s an l  but it   s  got to be someth of that natur   the fact that we can   t find it in the data is not
just to be clear  we don   t see potenti as a sort of physic maximum
it   s a baromet
it   s a measur of the sustain rate of output which can be maintain with all other factor either contribut to inflat or deduct from inflat so that product capac isn   t itself lend ani impetus up or down to inflat   that   s not to say that output can   t transitorili go abov potenti   it   s not to suggest that produc have met their physic capac   their limit on product
yes  i have a question and a comment   the question is whether the revis in the nonmarket core pce price index should caus peopl to revis the number they carri around in their head for the document upward bias in the pce
that   s a veri deep question  and i think the answer
as oppos to the other    laughter
if we could engag in a littl orwellian histori  i think what we would prefer to do is to go back and revis our old es  of the bias in inflat   we might maintain our es    or we might say     oh  there was someth in the data that i didn   t understand befor so if i thought the upward bias was     percent  mayb i should have thought it was onli     percent
would you explain to me what    upward bias in a nonmarket compon of the pce    mean
i was ask if this correct ani known sourc of bias   if you   re look for sourc of bias and document them  and this  sn   t affect ani of those  then it strike me that it shouldn   t chang our notion of the upward bias  right
have made this correct  if you thought the bias was x befor  not know about the mistak in the
we should still think it   s x
yes  you should still think it   s x
all right   thank   my comment has to do with your line of question  mr  chairman   it  sn   t seem to me from the model i   m awar of that reach that wall  as you put it  has to result in an acceler of nomin thing as oppos to real thing  which  would acceler   the late      s seem to me a good exampl where our credibl   the way we      were expect to conduct monetari polici   allow that link to be broken   is that consist with your interpret of the      s  mr  chairman
i wish it were true   it conceiv might be true  but i   m  not sure the evid is fulli conson with that view   let me put it this way  the concept of capac    year ago for a lot of industri was an engin concept   there was just so much steel you could get out of an open hearth steel furnac without an oxygen lanc   it was an engin concept   today  it   s like a rubber mat   in other word  you can press it   although you have an averag expect long term capac  you can still go well abov that  but it   s more and more cost to add to product   so  i think what has happen is that the notion of capac is more like a rubber mat   as you move up to capac  the margin cost  sn   t chang   when you hit capac  you can push it up   inde  by quit a signific amount   but the cost rise and  henc  the effect capac declin   now  what that say about the relationship between nomin and real is a wholli differ matter   that is a differ concept   the issu you   re rais is one possibl explan of whi we could still have this sort of flexibl  but it has littl to do with inflat   i don   t think that   s the case  but it   s conceiv   i   d like to believ it   s the case  but
thank you  mr  chairman
my comment concern the nonmarket portion of the core pce and it revis  and you   ve cover much of what i want to get at in your answer to the chairman   i don   t want to belabor the point  but i will spend just a minut on it  in look at this veri larg revis in the nonmarket compon  i natur ask myself whether or not this should chang our interpret of what inflat was in        is the      charact of the revis one that suggest we   ve receiv addit data tell us that inflat  inde  was higher than we thought   or is it charact more that of a methodolog revis   that is  we have no new data but have process it differ  and now we   re  chang the yardstick or the ruler we use to measur someth  my interpret   and i   d like to make sure that you agre with it   is the former   i believ it   s more of the charact of have receiv new data that told us  with an unchang measur tool  that inflat in      was higher   for the hospit insur and medic care compon  an analyst made a program error  and that led to an underreport of true inflat in that compon in        and in the noncommerci bank  or other financi sector compon  an analyst built in an assumpt   i think probabl larg about mutual fund    that the price of mutual fund servic would be declin over  e   but when bea look at the data  they discov that was a terribl assumpt and that it had not occur   so  that has the charact of new data indic that what was built into the index was wrong   therefor  inflat in the nonmarket compon  which i think is    percent of the overal core pce  realli was higher than we thought and there   s no reason to ignor it   at least those were the major part of the revis
while i agre with everi aspect of what you said  where one is left at the end of the day is with a difficult question as to how to judg truth   in the case of gasolin  we can go out and conduct an independ sampl of the price of gasolin at fill station around the countri  and we can assess whether the measur methodolog lead to a bias in the cpi relat to what individu are actual experienc in their day to day purchas   but the veri essenc of these compon we   re talk about is that it   s vast more difficult  mayb even imposs  to do ani kind of benchmark studi to know whether we have the measur right       i   m veri confid that in the revis version of the nation incom account the measur is better   but whether it   s right or not now is imposs to say
i admit that there   s someth arbitrari about the methodolog that is use   but the chang we see is not due to a chang in the methodolog for assess the truth  one could use a differ methodolog   the chang is akin to new inform that  given a fix methodolog  tell us that inflat was realli wors in      than we thought
that   s exact correct   yes
i   d like to ask about the labor forc particip rate   you show a sustain downward trend  and i think that has a lot to do with the elimin of unus resourc in the labor market  becaus your project is for the labor forc particip rate to stay about constant   but you have the trend particip rate move down to about    percent  which is more than a percentag point below where it was for about three or four year in the late      s   could you talk about the reason for that project   what is bring down the    equilibrium      i guess that would be the right term    particip rate in the labor market
i can point to two main factor   one is simpli the age of the popul   the babi boom cohort are move into an age of lower particip rate
this is particip for everyon over age
so it includ that part of the popul that is abov age      i   m talk about the definit of the rate
peopl my age and older are move into lower particip rate categori   that alon  on our es   has been take about a tenth of a percentag point off      the trend particip rate per year sinc        so that   s the predomin factor   the other factor that we think we see is a level off in the particip rate of women   wherea earlier in the postwar period the particip rate of women had been rise strong  we believ that has end   so those two factor are the major drive forc
but your trend rate is down more than a percentag point from the level  that was sustain in the late      s
well  we think that particip rate was abov the trend   let me set   the fact first   the actual particip rate was about trendless from      through        we have the trend in our new model run at about      or so through that period  includ through the late     s   we have the particip rate in the year from      through      run abov trend
by about    point  i guess
correct   at it peak   then  as the economi soften and came into the recess in       the particip rate first came back to it trend   subsequ  through the period from      through       it soften and went below trend   in our project  go forward we anticip the actual particip rate to hold about flat  and the particip rate gap in our project is close becaus we have the trend come down to meet the actual
so  it   s true that this declin in the trend is an import featur of our outlook for the labor market
for a varieti of reason  i   ve had some inclin to look over the intricaci of the work that you   ve been do on the labor forc particip rate   i find it veri      interest  and i think there are a number of way one can look at data in this area and separ out cyclic and trend develop   look at the forecast we have and the import impact of the labor forc particip rate  i   m wonder what your band of uncertainti is regard your project on the trend rate   i  for one  would hope that what we   re see in the earli year of this centuri is not indic of futur femal labor forc particip   mayb there is an econom reason for whi that pattern of femal particip is occur  but i have yet to see one that realli strike me as reason   so  i   d like to know what your rang of uncertainti is
as with all econometr es   we do have a rang of uncertainti  on our es   the trend particip rate now is      percent  which is just a coupl of tenth abov it current level   our read of the articl that was publish in your bank   s review is that katharin bradburi   s es  run from      at the low end and up to      by the way  for refer you could look at page   in part   of the  book  if you have a copi of that
i don   t think it   s worthwhil to get into a discuss of the two approach   grant that the statist method are veri interest and i   ve yet to realli  understand them all   that   s my problem  it   s not your problem   i   m just ask about your sens of a confid interv or band of uncertainti
our confid interv  if we were to state it  perhap would run up to      if we were realli stretch  mayb we could see a trend particip rate in the neighborhood of      i  frank  find that a littl hard to believ  given the strength of the demograph forc that we think we see push down the trend particip rate by about     percent per year  our point es   as i say  is        our labor economist say  on their confid interv  it may be somewher in the mid    area   we   d all agre that there are      uncertainti about the methodolog   so  if we step outsid the formal econometr  we might think we could see a number as high as    or someth like that
that   s the rang of uncertainti
but that    would realli be push it   that would be take into account that there probabl are consider outsid of the model and that model never quit work out as well as econometrician or empir investig hope   but at the end of the day we believ that the case is fair strong for some downward tilt in the trend particip rate
yes  i have just a quick question   we   ve talk a great deal about the intricaci of measur the various price index   the pce or whatev   i want to clarifi  though  that   regardless of which index one is look at and adjust   the trend line on inflat is up over the last    to    month   even with these adjust  you still have a trend  line that is up  which i think is an import consider
yes   our price project has move up   the best measur of that may be what has happen to the core pce price index   let   s see  now that i   m look at the number i   m about to eat my word   in       on the revis figur  core pce inflat was at     percent and we now have it at       so if one take as the trend last year and the first half of this year  i guess i   m go to have to revers myself and say that the core pce price index has been about flat   it has been run in the neighborhood of   percent or a littl abov   it has  been higher than we thought becaus of the oil price
it   s higher than we thought  but not get higher
but not get higher  yes
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to start the general discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   there haven   t been mani chang in our region sinc the last meet  so i   ll keep my comment about our region brief  busi condit around the seventh district are general good  although we still lag the nation   labor market continu to improv gradual  and inflationari pressur remain moder   mani of our contact remark that growth has come down from last year   s pace  but they   ve also acknowledg that last year was unsustain strong and that the current moder pace is more in line with long run trend  final  michigan is still struggl  due to it heavi relianc on the big three automak   the big three indic that the reaction to their latest incent  which succeed in pull down inventori signific  as   mention  was larger than they had expect  nonetheless  they told us they were onli rais their sale outlook for the year as a whole by         or         unit   they also said that they would be fair conserv about increas product  this get to the payback we talk about befor  turn to the nation outlook  the recent data confirm that the economi is on solid foot   we expect growth to be somewhat abov potenti over the rest of this year   this repres a modest strengthen of our forecast sinc june   and with the unemploy rate at    percent  it is like that the current degre of resourc slack is small   the moder in the recent month core inflat data is a posit develop   howev  the upward revis to core pce inflat are a serious concern   appar  inflationari pressur were higher than we thought when we introduc our    measur pace    languag       at our last meet  i was concern about the possibl of core inflat run abov   percent some  over the next coupl of year   now it turn out that we   ve alreadi been have inflat at that pace   this  of cours  includ both market and nonmarket inflat but i don   t think you can discount the nonmarket inflat   as   said  we now have addit data   and i think the point is  in refer to tom   s question  that the forecast for core inflat has chang now   it use to be that inflat in      was come down from the rate in       and now  of cours  it   s go up  look ahead  given the polici assumpt in the  book  we think the inflat forecast is reason and that the risk to the outlook are balanc   but i am uncomfort with the outlook   i   d like to see inflat stabil below   percent much sooner   i agre strong with the chairman   s argument at the last meet about the asymmetr polici cost surround the inflat forecast   and at the higher rate now built into the  book  we could face an even greater risk of a disappoint increas in inflationari expect   in that case  reestablish price stabil would requir much tighter polici than market current  expect  i   m also concern about the larg amount of liquid chase financi deal   in the earli stage of our accommod polici  busi were extrem cautious and mani capit invest were defer   liquid flow into mortgag and into hous   now corpor are flush with cash  competit among lender is intens  money is flow rapid into privat equiti fund  and bank continu to relax lend term   i think we may be approach the point in the lend cycl where investor tend to overreach and make bad invest   we can help counter this by remov polici accommod at a suffici pace       and given firm    buffer of cash  i don   t see much risk of choke off product invest project if we rais rate to level somewhat higher than market current expect   so how   this all add up   given the good prospect for growth  but with some  asymmetr polici risk  i continu to think that we should rais rate until we are comfort in the middl of the neutral rang   to me  this mean reach a fed fund rate of about     percent befor we paus   of cours  we will continu to watch the incom data   if either inflat or growth come in much lower than expect  we can stop earlier   or we can do more if necessari   final  it   s pretti safe to say that this is not the meet for us to chang our polici strategi   so i favor a    basi point increas today  and i   ll hold off my comment on the languag until later
mr  chairman  as report in the beig book  activ in our district has pick up substanti   there   s a tremend amount of activ in all but the manufactur sector   and there   s an enorm surg in confid  particular in texa  even though that may seem like a redund to talk about confid texan   i   ll refer to just a coupl of point veri quick as part of the broader discuss we   ve been have at this tabl   first  we   ve had a huge surg in hous start   houston now rank second in the countri year to date in term of hous unit permit  and dalla rank third   first  by the way  is atlanta   moreov  permit are run at rate rough three  e what we see in new york citi and rough twice those in miami or orlando   but to illustr the point that we discuss at our last meet  in term of price pressur  dalla rank     out of     msas   metropolitan statist area   which show the geograph differenti   in ani event  we   ve had a substanti pickup in hous activ        the second point  with regard to energi  is that texa  louisiana  and new mexico account for two third of the rig count in the unit state   it   s a rather schizophren sector  one might say that schizophrenia beat dine alon  becaus we do get both side of these argument    laughter   we have a veri excit group of peopl   the rig oper   now run at the tightest capac rate in term of rig util sinc decemb of      in the case of texa and sinc      in the case of louisiana   as evid of the kind of pressur that   s occur on the happi side  but also a tes oni to global  we have the first case of a  compani   a small compani that was not abl to find rig   import a rig with worker from china to oper in a certain basin in colorado   by the way     percent of that rig content is construct in china and    percent in the unit state   this is the first such case that we   re awar of   on the opposit side  the depress side  there is a constant fear of price collaps in the oil sector   one might describ it as a wild surmis  except that one of the most articul and outspoken champion of the view that oil price could fall dramat happen to be lee raymond  the chairman of exxon and the chairman of the nation petroleum council   he  like to remind listen  and he lectur me constant  that in      or        i forget exact when it was   we had a price collaps which took oil price from     to     in two week   he is constant warn his colleagu   note that it is a minor view within the oil patch   that if we have a warm winter he expect that kind of price behavior in the oil market   and he certain is a noteworthi propon of that view   on the high tech side  i   d note a coupl of point base on convers with texa instrument and dell on the issu of capac and capit expenditur   ti  have just announc that they   re go to build a huge factori   a      billion invest in the dalla      area   say that they expect this to be one of their last full bore product facil for wafer  by the way  even with that larg dollar invest  the factori will employ onli     peopl  what they   re find now is that they can buy what they call commod wafer   which is about    percent of the content they need   from chines produc at ever lower price   dell repeat the same kind of defianc of the law of econom behavior  as they put it  in term of what they   re abl to sourc out of china  and they claim now to be the second largest oper of u s   compani in china   moreov  they report that with each pass day  as we   ve heard from retail  somebodi appear on their doorstep abl to outbid ani exist supplier at an ever cheaper price  as far as the retail sector is concern  again  with my colleagu   s permiss  i do talk to contact from wal mart occasion   to the coo and to the presid of wal mart intern   we hear the same kind of report  and there are substanti question about chines account   and     the reason i ask the question about the assumpt regard the chines yuan appreci or the general depreci of the dollar against the yuan   even though it   s obvious veri volatil   is that the ceo of wal mart intern said that it make absolut no differ that china has revalu the renminbi at this junctur  they constant find that peopl that will come in and underbid exist supplier   the supposit  mr  chairman  is that the chines  a  don   t pay back princip   b  don   t pay tax  and  c  if they do pay tax  they pay the tax collector rather than the govern   all of that  of cours  give them a substanti advantag   this has alway been the case  and we assum it will be not carri forward over  e   but in term of competit  there seem to be a voraci appetit to continu to suppli   a variat of the old communist model in which they produc for product   s sake and now they produc for sale    sake   again  our privat sector    our      retail  our high tech sector  and other  and now our energi sector   are take advantag of that situat   have said all of that  i want to indic  as did mr     that with this strong econom activ  even though there may be a risk that we   re borrow from the futur  we  too  are concern about inflationari pressur   so we would be in favor of further tighten to the degre that my former colleagu as deputi u s  trade repres just mention   we   ll talk about the word of the statement later   thank you veri much
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data  includ the benchmark revis  have alter my percept of the econom scene notic   we now see more under strength in econom activ relat to potenti through the second quarter and into juli   the juli employ report suggest that job growth has also gain momentum  and develop in a broad rang of financi market suggest that market particip share this assess   the  book  sensibl  has rais it assum path for the fund rate to bring growth next year back to the pace of potenti  the inflat pictur is cloud up in both sens of the word   it is unclear and also a bit forebod   the pictur is a bit forebod becaus the benchmark revis boost inflat as measur by the core pce to     percent over the last    month  which is at the top of my comfort zone   it   s unclear  becaus our two main inflat gaug are now give differ read on the perform of inflat over the last year  although both  fortun  suggest that inflat has been relat tame over the past sever month   with a normal gap of about    percentag point over the core pce  the     percent increas in the core cpi  in contrast  present a rather benign inflat pictur       of cours  the issu for polici is not so much where inflat was in the past but  rather  where it is head   given the unusu small and like transitori gap between the two measur of core inflat  we tri to break through some of the cloudi associ with this diverg in signal by examin statist which measur typic   most of the adjust to bring the spread back into line   a find that the cpi typic   most of the adjust would be bad news   a find that the pce price index normal bear the brunt of the adjust would be good news   unfortun  we found few statist regular   both measur have taken the lead at differ  e  so we can   t count on either one to provid a reason signal at the present  e  move from actual inflat outcom to the pressur affect inflat go forward  it seem like that higher oil price are be pass through to core inflat to some extent  so unless they rise further  the effect on core inflat should begin to dissip next year  unfortun  i think i also said the same thing at our june meet  and they did rise again  anoth risk relat to unit labor cost  which have risen notabl over the past year after  sever year of littl or no chang   this part reflect slower  although still robust  product growth   insofar as the declin in product growth has been cyclic rather than structur  our analysi  and that of other research  suggest that it will have littl effect on inflat   in other word  it is structur product growth and trend unit labor cost that main drive inflat  it would take a drop in structur product growth to boost inflat  as discuss in the  book  the recent benchmark revis probabl do warrant a modest decreas in our es  of structur product growth  which   add to inflat pressur  make the outlook a bit less favor than i origin thought   nevertheless  it is      encourag that  even after a downward adjust  product still seem to be grow somewhat fa  than the robust rate achiev in the second half of the      s  i   m less concern about inflat pressur eman from the other compon of  labor cost  name  labor compens   although compens per hour jump recent  this appear to be due to one  e factor and thus should be discount   this interpret is support by the smaller increas report in this morn   s releas on the second quarter and from read from the employ cost index  which exclud these item and has shown onli  modest increas  furthermor  recent increas in labor compens could be part of the process by which labor   s share of gpd is return to more normal level  follow a period of unusu rapid growth in profit that has been push up capit   s share   this interpret is support  by recent econometr work by our staff suggest that transitori deviat of the markup from it mean are typic unwound over  e by movement in labor compens  not inflat  inde  our contact are tell us that in the absenc of much price power  increas in labor cost are hurt their bottom line  the increas pressur on margin appear to have reinvigor the search for product gain   for exampl  a natur gas drill compani in our district just instal chip in all of it well that alert a central control when a well is down  with this technolog the firm has been abl to shed worker who check the well manual  and it has decreas the down  e of well in the network  so for all of these reason  i   m inclin to think that inflationari concern about unit labor cost should be focus more on possibl chang in structur product growth than long term labor compens       anoth sourc of inflationari pressur relat to slack in the labor market   in my view  a whisker of slack probabl still remain  but on balanc there is probabl less than we saw in june   of cours  the unemploy rate remain at   percent in juli  but other measur  such as the employ popul ratio  a survey of job market percept  and industri capac util now signal a bit less slack  so  overal  the economi is notic stronger than seem like in june   some of the slack that remain at that  e has been elimin  and the trajectori for inflat has shift up a bit   the market   s expect concern the degre of fed tighten have increas  as have longer term yield   i consid it obvious that we should continu on the path of rais the fund rate  and i   m comfort with the word in altern b

thank you  mr  chairman   as expect  the econom soften we saw in the third district in late spring was temporari  and econom condit in the region have strengthen sinc our last meet   retail sale in the district  which had fallen in may  improv in june and earli juli   we saw gain in most categori  especi season item  apparel  and home furnish   like elsewher in the nation  strong auto sale led the way   our dealer report that their inventori are now at desir level  but mani are concern that sale  will eas later in the year unless incent remain in forc       while retail sale have regain some strength over the past month  high gasolin price are begin to impact consum behavior   our dealer report a shift away from suv   that   s a plus as far as i   m concern  laughter    to vehicl with higher fuel economi   we   ve also had report that shopper were visit store less frequent  consolid shop to econom on gasolin expenditur  manufactur activ in the district also has improv sinc june  although it remain more subdu than last year   the index of general activ in our manufactur survey rose to     in juli  up from minus     in june   that   s quit a larg swing in the index  and it is true that  the volatil of the index has increas this year   but a staff analysi indic that the level of volatil remain low by histor standard and that the index continu to be a good indic of chang in the manufactur compon of the industri product index  the more forward look indic in the survey  includ the index on new order and shipment  also show modest improv in juli   activ in other sector of the district   s economi continu to expand in line with recent trend   payrol employ growth in the region acceler to     percent in the second quarter  somewhat weaker than the nation   s pace of     percent   region unemploy continu to trend down in most of the district   s labor market   the three state unemploy rate fell from     percent in the first quarter to     percent in the second quarter   onli six of the district   s sixteen labor market had unemploy rate abov   percent in june  the residenti hous sector continu to show strength   construct and home sale were up on a year over year basi in the three state region   hous price appreci continu and is especi strong in new jersey   the downward trend in nonresidenti construct appear to have bottom out  and we saw a strong increas in offic construct activ in the      first quarter  especi in center citi philadelphia   the demand for commerci space continu to expand at a slow but steadi pace in philadelphia  but vacanc rate remain at near    percent   news on the region inflat front has improv somewhat   consum price inflat in the region is still run at a stronger pace than in the nation  due main to stronger increas in owner equival rent   but it   s down from the pace we saw earlier in the year  increas in wage and benefit in the northeast have also moder  although some of our busi contact report that they are plan higher salari increas for next year   a manufactur survey indic there has also been a moder in industri price pressur this year   although the price paid and price receiv index remain elev  much of the signific increas in the index seen last year has been work off  in summari  after a temporari lull in activ this spring  econom condit in the third district have strengthen and the outlook is posit   region busi contact remain  upbeat and expect the region   s economi to continu to expand in line with the recent trend  incom data suggest that the nation economi has also regain momentum sinc our last meet   the data report receiv over the intermeet period on most sector have come in better than expect   at our previous meet  i argu that it was prematur to conclud that the softer data we were get at the  e point to the begin of a persist downturn  rather  i interpret it as part of the fit and start we usual see as the economi approach equilibrium   similar  i believ it is now prematur to conclud that the fa  growth in final demand we saw in the second quarter will necessarili persist  howev  i think we need to be particular watch at this point to ensur that we don   t get behind the curv with monetari polici   that risk has increas  in my view  with the risk      that aggreg demand may be grow abov potenti at a  e when littl slack remain in product and labor market   so we must remain vigil  it is true that the most recent month measur of inflat have moder  and the revis data on core pce suggest that it has not acceler this year   still  the level of inflat are signific higher than previous measur  and the benchmark revis in the gdp report suggest that less capit deepen has occur   the latter impli somewhat weaker structur product growth go forward and more inflat pressur   in our current econom situat  therefor  it is my view that we must continu on our path of remov monetari polici accommod  as for the announc we use to explain our action  we should point out the strengthen that has occur in econom condit sinc our last meet and the fact that the inflat pressur are inde elev   appropri word the rational part of the statement will ensur that we have substant polici flexibl at futur meet  even if we decid to make no chang in the assess of risk paragraph today   in fact  to me a better  e to chang these paragraph is when we think a signific chang in polici action is call for   i don   t think that  e is today  but it may be get closer   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   the district economi continu to track the nation economi quit close  as it has for a long  e   and as i comment at the last meet  what is strike about the district economi right now is the breadth of the econom expans   virtual all sector are either strong or improv  and i won   t go through a review item by item   i will say that with the growth in econom activ in the district and with      improv employ condit  wage increas still remain quit modest  as best i can judg  and inflationari pressur haven   t chang  as best i can assess the situat  as far as the nation economi is concern  we   re now almost four year into the current econom expans and  overal  thing look quit good to me   that in a way is remark in and of itself  as i think of the convers we   ve had around this tabl over the last four year and the varieti of concern and issu that were rais   to be sure  polici has play a role in support this econom perform but  as i   ve comment befor  i think onc again we are observ the fundament sound  resili  and flexibl of the economi  the situat is start to resembl in broad term  in my mind at least  the long expans of the      s and      s   in fact  without stretch too far  i think one could perhap make the case that the situat is even a littl better than a few year into those expans  after all  today we have low interest rate  low inflat rate  well anchor inflationari expect  for the most part a fair well balanc domest economi  and what i might call a promis intern economi   i call it promis not becaus i   m think about europ or  japan  but becaus i   m think about china and india and some of their smaller brethren  there are some issu  to be sure   one is oil price  which have alreadi been mention today   the feder budget situat is anoth one  although i think that   s more a secular than a cyclic problem   and then there are hous price   all i would say there is that even if there is a bubbl  and even if it burst  the quantit signific of that remain quit unclear  as far as i   m concern  i do think we need to pay consider attent  as we have been  to the inflat situat  but my sens of the situat is that there is no signific deterior under way or immin at the moment   and i   m inclin to stick to my random walk methodolog for      forecast inflat   it has work remark well for a good number of year now   laughter   have said that  i do think it   s appropri to continu with the polici path we   ve been on   that seem  given the way the economi has evolv  fulli appropri to me
thank you  mr  chairman   consist with incom data on the nation economi  busi condit in our part of the southeast have remain posit sinc our last meet   in fact  i found it more difficult than usual to answer the question     what has chang     and    what are we see and hear in the region that might help inform nation  trend in our polici discuss     so  uncharacterist  i will highlight just one region issu   one i   ve talk about a great deal and one which i still think is especi import   and that is the extraordinari pace of home build and sale in some of our market in the southeast   it may be wish think on my part  but one get the sens that thing may   and i emphas may   have begun to show some sign of cool   although home build remain at high level over the most recent period  report from builder in our area were a bit more mix  and some modest deceler was note in a few florida market   most interest  our bank examin are now report that some of the larg region bank are begin to exercis a new caution in their real estat lend  and some have gone so far as to actual stop develop and construct lend in certain area of florida   i find this appropri and encourag   of cours  the fact that perman mortgag rate remain relat low  even with the recent uptick  is probabl still the greatest s ulus to the extraordinari and prolong hous boom   but i hope my sens of  some restraint now be exhibit is correct and will bring us to a better balanc       turn to the nation economi  i   ll also focus on just a coupl of area and their polici implic  and i think all of those have alreadi been referenc in the question period or by other   the first is that the growth in output has  if anyth  been somewhat stronger recent than i expect  even though the nipa revis tell us that the economi was on a somewhat lower growth path than we had thought   other may not share my view  but i think that i  and probabl we  have more often than not tend to underes  and underforecast output growth  we may be acknowledg that again base on the fact that most forecast  includ the  book  have been revis up for the remaind of the year   i believ it was presid  n  and i think he just confirm this  who remind us onc   and mayb more than onc earlier in the expans when we were get uneasi   to have faith  and he seem to have been right  i   m also perhap more sensit than some to what we now know from the data revis that show us the higher level of inflat in the recent quarter   i recogn that the upward revis on the core pce seri were in the imput price   nonetheless  the level of measur inflat has gotten closer to the upper bound of my comfort level  as well that of other  and i think we should be more sensit to forc that could  despit the most recent month data that have been encourag  exert upward pressur on price in the period ahead  although i did not go back and check  i would guess that the adjust in the es  output gap reflect in today   s  book was one of the largest between meet adjust in quit some  e   although i don   t find the output gap framework especi help  the rapid closur in that measur suggest to me that upward inflat pressur could be more immin  of cours  the  book   s    more room to grow    altern scenario could give one comfort  but i do not find that possibl compel  becaus such an outcom hing critic on the exist of more slack in labor market  presum due in part to the current low      particip rate   i   m not convinc that is a reason view   i   m concern for two reason  first  it is not clear that the failur of labor forc particip rate to rebound follow the recess mean that slack in the economi is greater than is reflect current in the unemploy rate   our atlanta staff   s recent research indic   when one control for chang in worker characterist  chang in individu behavior and prefer  and for differ in the econom environ   that labor forc particip rate are not like to return any  soon to the peak level seen in       second  look at the upcom chang in labor market demograph that will hit the economi as soon as next year  we will have to chang substanti how we think about labor market and job creation in our economi   if i read the data correct  project by the bls  bureau of labor statist  and social secur administr show that near         more worker will retir in      than will enter the labor market   that trend will acceler year by year  as more and more babi boomer reach retir age   it is unlik to be complet offset by increas we might see in older worker labor forc particip  the cumul deficit in worker could reach near two million in      and four million in        i think we all know our economi will find way to deal with these signific chang   but given this forward look perspect  i am not terribl worri about slack in the labor market   further  not far down the road i think we will find ourselv concern about where the worker will come from  especi if the economi continu to creat job   even at the current pace   not onli do we have to revamp some aspect of how we think about the economi  but we also must be mind of the pressur that will bring to do thing differ  and those trend will sure call for adjust in some of our model       when it come to the polici discuss  i think we should be sure that we   re comfort  after take account of the veri latest inform on growth  product  and inflat that we   ve gotten over the last coupl of week  with the phrase in the altern b draft statement that character labor market condit as continu to improv onli    gradual    and the  phrase that say    core inflat has been relat low      it seem to me that we should not do or say anyth today that could counter market expect that we now have a somewhat greater upsid risk to inflat and that we still have unnecessari polici accommod to remov  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in assess all of the inform about  the district that our bank staff had gather for this open market committe meet  and in my own interact with contact around the region  a few word stand out becaus they were repeat so often   and they are differ word than would come to mind from mani of the previous discuss   the word are    lacklust        underwhelm     and even    blah     new england   s growth has been lag that of the nation through the entir           period  larg becaus of the impact of the technolog downturn in massachusett   for most of       howev  it has seem that the region might be gain a bit   with employ grow at a pace onli slight behind that of the nation  sign of life in manufactur  and strong  residenti real estat market  we notic a lull  as almost everybodi els did  in the earli spring   we thought that lull would dissip  but it seem that the forward momentum that exist earlier has falter a bit   it could be the recent hot weather and it impact on retail sale   it could be the impact of high gas price on area that depend on travel and tourism and on consum pocketbook in general   it      could be the continu sens of busi caution about hire and prospect demand   and it could be the effect of the propos base close  especi in main   but whatev it is  econom activ seem to have flatten out  and one can see this in the consum confid and busi confid data  inde  consum confid in new england fell to    in juli  with read on current sen ent about normal   a littl bit lower  but still in the normal rang   but expect about futur activ were down to their lowest read sinc        now  it   s onli a month   s data  and it   s difficult to get excit about one month   s data on consum confid  but i think it   tend to pick up the mood in the region  that   s not to say that the region   s econom health is not move in a posit direct  employ is grow  it   s just grow slowli   unemploy is down  but that   s larg becaus the labor forc is down   moreov  manufactur and relat servic compani do report growth   demand is just not as strong as they onc expect  and they   ve been work hard to contain cost and increas market share through acquisit to maintain revenu growth  inde  even the onc hot residenti real estat market seem to have moder a bit  region wide inventori of home for sale have risen  and freddi mac home price index for the region indic price appreci about at the nation level  except in rhode island where the residenti real estat boom continu   sale of exist home decreas in the first quarter of      from the previous quarter and level are below those seen in       perhap the lull in econom activ that usher in the second quarter linger on in the mind of new england busi  and mayb the stronger trend that are evid now nation  will be reflect in data and anecdot later this year   but there is a sens that this period of      growth is not so much a rise tide that   s lift all boat but a continu struggl to surviv by the busi within the region   peopl keep ask where the next new thing is that will fill the downtown offic space  and get the region realli hum again   there   s no good answer to that question except that the region   s histori is replet with cycl of downturn and rebirth and reinvent   inde  look at the glass as half full  one benefit of a period of slower but posit growth is that a lot of attent is place on product enhanc in the privat sector and on creat more incent for busi growth in the public sector  turn to the nation  our forecast for the rest of       and       is quit similar to that of the  book  use the same monetari polici and govern spend assumpt   we could argu a bit about the  book   s lower rate of potenti growth  and we end up with slight less inflat and slight more unemploy  given our sens that the output gap is slight wider and will not be fulli close by the end of        but a lot of this is split hair   recent econom data  the seem stronger health of the labor market  and the expect flatten out of oil price are all good news   the economi is do well  and inflat seem pretti much in check   and both the  book and we in boston see that pictur continu into       a key question  of cours  in such a halcyon environ  is how one see the risk to that environ   concern abound about upsid inflat risk   but in my view  anyway  the risk seem fair balanc   as the altern scenario point out  the  book might be wrong about the amount of slack in the economi  and the project of potenti might have been shade lower than is actual the case   that is  should we ever realli be abl to perceiv what the economi   s actual potenti is       inde  one can read a varieti of labor market indic   not just labor forc particip  but also long unemploy durat  a low job find rate  a low job separ rate  moder eci  employ cost index  wage growth  and overal a continu subdu pace of employ growth relat to gdp   as suggest greater level of labor market slack  product as well could be stronger rather than weaker  as reflect in convers with everi busi contact i have  they all continu to emphas their unflinch focus on cost control and innov   and profit margin remain quit high by histor standard   we could well have more room to grow without ignit inflationari pressur and over  e need less  rather than more  polici constraint  but the fact remain that we have not yet arriv at a place where most would say polici is neutral  let alon a constraint on activ   and cost pressur do reflect some upsid risk to inflat   recent data on bank    consum  industri  and construct lend could be a harbing of more rather than less strength   spend on equip and softwar could surpris  given anecdot from the tech sector   so  growth abov potenti is possibl  and that could nudg resourc usag upward   even now  various measur of wage pressur are send contrari signal   the better read may be the eci data  but the upward trend in unit labor cost should not be ignor   energi cost could well be a problem  though they are as like to take a bite out of growth as they are to feed an inflat spiral  the project current account imbal of   percent of gdp is an even larger concern in my view  as the risk of a signific and perhap sudden adjust loom larger   if the adjust take the form of a larg depreci in the dollar and more pass through to consum price occur  the consequ for inflat could be serious       and i remain concern that abnorm low interest rate produc greater risk take  that could come home to roost in an unpredict way   i meet with a group of invest manag prior to the feder open market committe meet  most to understand better how those individu are read market   one quot from this week   s meet     the biggest risk market face right now is their belief that there is no risk      with equiti volatil at a veri low level and bond risk spread veri narrow  market particip seem to believ thing are rosi as far as the eye can see  and they seem to be reach out the risk spectrum for return  and it would seem that consum continu to reflect the    don   t worri  be happi    perspect in their spend and save habit   we know from experi that such confid can be a harbing of financi instabl to come   thus  i continu to believ that while the risk to our forecast may be balanc  it would be more cost if we were to err on the side of more rather than less accommod   it seem clear to me that the move to a less accommod postur should continu   and if current trend persist  that process possibl should acceler  it also seem clear to me that the move today that the market expect is the right move to be take   and i think we should begin to give some thought to how we ought to start the process of chang our statement   mayb we don   t need to chang it today  but we should set in process some movement toward think about how that statement should chang   continu to reassur market with the    measur pace    languag may be provid too much in the way of certainti   arguabl  market don   t need this anymor and would benefit from a more realist assess of uncertainti   some would argu  i know  that the ideal  e to chang is either when we see a need to paus or to acceler   it   s hard to know when that will be  and i worri that our continu use of this reassur languag is present it own problem       i think it   s veri difficult to react three or four day befor a meet to altern languag and to come up with someth that   s satisfactori and move in the direct of chang   if we are go to chang our languag  i would hope we have a chanc  prior to the week befor the meet  to contribut to the under think that goe into that   and i would argu that we ought to begin that process sooner rather than later
may i suggest that if you have idea or notion about how to chang the statement  write a memorandum to the committe well befor the meet  and the  secretariat will circul it
there   s no reason whi you have to wait until the last few day if you have some idea to suggest
i think that would be a help thing to do   i  by no mean  think i have the perfect answer   probabl none of us
you may galvan the discuss on the relev issu  clear  there is a limit life expect for the particular statement we   re use now   my own judgment is that we may luck out in the sens that the market will perceiv chang that are go on in the economi and will move the forward feder fund rate in a manner that will  essenti make our transit to a differ status seamless   but we can   t assum that   we have to be awar of the fact that we may have to make a veri specif judgment     coffe is avail   whi don   t we break and come back in a reason  e   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   as i talk to my busi contact in the fourth district  i   m struck by the lack of ani specif concern about the near term econom outlook   the busi communiti appear to be op ist about the remaind of this year    they see diminish inflat concern and a brighten growth outlook   the price statist report dure the intermeet period were better than i expect them to be   i hear from businesspeopl i talk with that steel and raw materi price remain soft  moreov  the big three auto produc have reduc price to sell more vehicl   these  price cut might take some pressur off of inflat as well   base on the comment of my busi contact and my read of the detail of the price statist  i don   t see that inflationari pressur are intensifi further  like presid  n  i don   t believ that the near term inflat outlook has chang as much as the inflat revis between the june and august  book might impli   the inflat environ that i just describ seem to be more in line with the baselin forecast in the june  book than that in the august  book   howev  for reason that   has alreadi explain  the staff believ that there is somewhat more inflat pressur in the economi today than they saw a month ago   consequ  they think that the polici path now need to follow a steeper trajectori than the one assum last month in order to nudg inflat back down gradual over  e  now  i have to confess that i   d rather be make polici base on the world depict in the june  book than the world in the august  book   and i don   t want to come across as complac about inflat   as i state at our last meet  the inflat rate is alreadi run at the high end of my comfort zone   i also find myself concern that the heavili advertis unwind of energi shock has not arriv   and as point out in the  book       the inflat outlook appear to be requir more polici restraint   the fed fund path in the august  book might prove to be too steep if inflat pressur unwind fa  than the baselin project contempl   but it also might prove to be too flat if those pressur don   t unwind at all  i don   t relish the prospect of have to add an addit    basi point to the fund rate path project in the june  book and not get much of a reduct in the inflat rate as a result of that   sinc the fund rate path in the june and august  book don   t part compani until the novemb meet  i   m hope that we   ll have a better read on the inflat situat by then   for today i   m comfort with the path that we   re on  and i don   t see a need to diverg from that path today   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  let me start with some thought on the nation economi  i do expect growth in real gdp to averag about    percent this year and     percent next year  while this is somewhat slower than last year  it remain abov trend   and the monetari polici and financi condit current in place i think are pois to support continu abov trend  growth   with growth abov trend  the output gap and labor market slack will further diminish  in fact  the economi appear to be at or near full employ now  which is all the more reason to have the feder fund rate abov it current level   i   d like to turn for a bit to develop in our region  becaus the evid from the tenth district is consist with this strong outlook   for exampl  econom growth has strengthen rather notic sinc our last meet   employ continu to expand  and in the intermeet period busi announc substanti more new hire than layoff in our region   consum spend also increas strong  as retail post further gain  auto sale      rebound  and tourist activ show no effect that we could notic from higher gasolin price    in addit  energi held steadi in term of high level of demand   drill has slow in the matur oil and gas field of oklahoma but has continu to grow strong in newer field in the rocki mountain region   drill in those area continu to be constrain by a shortag of equip and labor   as a result   and i   ll repeat what   said   one denver base energi compani has order two chines rig and rig crew for deliveri this fall as well as sever addit rig for the come coupl of year   while manufactur activ expand at a slower pace than in the spring  most firm are op ist about futur sale and plan more hire and invest to meet the increas demand   a wide rang of district busi also report sharpli improv earn due to strong revenu growth systemat in our region   the onli negat news on this level was that commerci real estat market continu to show onli modest improv and that inventori of unsold home were up notic in some of our citi   i think it is worth note that a sizabl area of extrem drought has develop throughout the central corn belt state   the drought affect much of missouri and illinoi and part of wisconsin and indiana   market current expect the nation   s corn crop to drop    percent and the soybean crop to drop   percent   as a result  corn and soybean price have both risen about    percent sinc their plant   the usda crop report that will come out later this week  on august   th  could trigger a further ralli in price if drought damag is greater than the market current expect    turn to inflat  i think it is worth note that core pce inflat  as we discuss quit extens earlier  is now averag about    percent this year and is expect to remain      at that pace next year   while we continu to talk about this as be moder  i think it is import to recogn that it repres a continu upward adjust of the inflat outlook and is at the higher end of what most of us have indic we are comfort with   i also  remain concern about the upward pressur on inflat   first  there is an upsid risk from higher energi price and dollar depreci   in addit  the real fed fund rate  use the core pce inflat  is onli     percent   these factor  i think  pose an upsid risk to inflat  especi when combin with growth that remain abov trend and an output gap that is small and approach zero   i believ we are now at a point where the upsid risk to the economi is greater than the downsid risk   and while we appear commit to move onli    basi point today  and i think the market would be surpris if we did otherwis  we ought to at least serious consid elimin ani refer to    measur pace    in our statement   to me it was notic in listen to   today that  as we talk about the economi  potenti is less than we expect  demand is greater than expect  inflat is greater than we anticip  and monetari polici is probabl     basi point below what most peopl think it should be   in my view  it   s  e to think about chang our statement   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my contact led off almost univers with comment such as     thing look great        everyth is steadi as she goe     and    all busi  area are strong      and i   d just like to fill in a few observ here   my wal mart contact   and as i think you know  wal mart has been veri concern about the drain on purchas power becaus of gasolin price   said that they now believ that last year the compani had underord good at the upper price point level   that is  they had a      product mix that was too skew toward the low end  and the part of the incom distribut that buy the low end merchandis is still struggl with gasolin price   so  to some extent  their overal sale perform last year was simpli a consequ of the mix of good that they had on their shelv   they have chang that mix of good   he use as an exampl the fact that    percent of the tvs they   re sell now are high definit digit tvs   that   s a rather big  percentag for a compani like wal mart   an interest comment from my up contact was that they are now struggl to obtain enough aircraft  in good part becaus of their expans in china   that expans is not just in the import export busi   they   re enter the intern chines market   he said that they have no aircraft avail either for purchas or leas until        up and fedex both have fill out their fleet to a veri consider extent by take age passeng aircraft and convert them  but the convert are all work at capac   so  up will keep in servic aircraft that are    to    year old   obvious  those plane are much more expens to oper  and up would like to replac them with new aircraft but will make do with these older one   both up and fedex said that they   re expect a veri good holiday season  but they anticip have plenti  of capac   a contact with a major softwar compani said that they   re a littl skittish      veri cautious    was the term he use   about the larg enterpris busi but that other sector of their busi are do quit well  it seem to me clear that the economi has a veri good head of steam   i would argu that monetari polici is not high expansionari at this point   rate have gone up a lot  and the market anticip that rate will continu to go up   i   m one of the few peopl  i guess  who look at money number anymor  but for what it   s worth   and i think it   s still worth someth          laughter  mzm is up by slight more than   percent in the last year and has been about flat in the last six month   m  is up a bit less than   percent   that   s not consist with high expansionari monetari polici   i would say  howev  that there is a disconnect aris between the anecdot report and the econometr es  and analysi on the state of the labor market   when i talk to contact in my district  they say over and over again that they have no problem with labor avail and that there is no wage pressur  except in isol case   for exampl  my up friend said that they are have ongo negoti with the team  and are see some job action   so there may be some issu there   but except for a few scatter exampl   such as truck driver  as i   ve mention befor   my contact say that they just don   t see ani problem with labor avail   and that   s not just at the low end  but at all skill level  though there may still be some problem hire account   but even that   s not someth that they bring up voluntarili when i talk with them   again  they see no signific wage pressur   so i think there   s a disconnect here between the anecdot inform and the econometr inform   i don   t know what to do about it  but i   d make note of it    laughter   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   like everyon els  we think growth has strengthen sinc our last meet   we   re go into the second half with more forward momentum  and this has been accompani by a broad base improv in confid about the outlook   we expect a stronger second half of       than we did at the last meet   but our forecast for next year remain essenti unchang  with real gdp growth still a bit abov potenti   we think around     percent   and the core pce deflat at around   percent   on the assumpt that we move the fed fund rate up on the higher path now reflect in the market       the risk around this forecast seem broad balanc to us  with perhap a slight greater probabl of outcom on the higher side    as this impli  we   re veri comfort with the basic  book view  the stori behind that view  and the evolut in the es  output gap the  book expect   i guess the one qualif i   d mention is that we don   t see a strong case yet for as signific a downward revis in our es  of potenti growth or actual growth in         the fundament support consumpt and invest growth still seem intact  under product growth still seem fair good   real yield appear to have increas materi  and equiti price  credit spread  and risk premia general suggest a pretti favor view of this expans and it durabl   our various survey of sen ent  formal and less formal  support this more posit view of the nation outlook  we think the under inflat rate is follow a slight higher trajectori than we thought at the last meet  and we think a lot of the forc at work in the economi that we have discuss today will continu to put some upward pressur on the inflat rate go forward  but we don   t expect a signific acceler in inflat abov this   percent band  and that view  of cours  is consist with the moder in inflat expect we   ve seen sinc the start of the year   howev  even this relat modest path leav us some margin abov the     percent pace for the core pce that we believ should be our object over  e   and  of cours  even this forecast of   percent could prove to be too benign  all of this suggest that we should tri to design our monetari polici signal to achiev three object   these will be familiar object   first  we should reinforc the sens that the fed fund rate need to move higher for us to achiev our price stabil object   second  we need to emphas that the extent and pace of further move will depend on how the outlook      evolv   we want to ensur that expect of polici continu to be respons to chang in the forecast  and we want to make sure that we have the flexibl to alter the trajectori as appropri   it   s import in this regard that we not give the market more certainti about the futur path of the fed fund rate than we can reason expect to have ourselv   i think we also want to avoid convey the sens that our task is simpli to get to neutral  that we   re confid in our es  of what neutral is  and that we   re unlik to need to move beyond that point   even if the data continu to support this veri favor forecast we all seem to share  we may find it increas difficult to decid how far we   ll need to move   and  final  given the move up sinc june in the market   s expect of the fed fund rate path  i think we should tri to leav the expect futur path of the fed fund rate larg unchang today   or perhap a bit firmer  but i don   t see ani reason now to tri to induc  or to take the risk of induc  a major shift in current expect   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   august of the off elect year is a  e when we can take stock of how the congress has respond to certain issu   as we began this year hope that congress would address some issu that had import fiscal polici implic  i think now is an appropri  e to review to see what impact congress   s action will have and the implic for our deliber   that sens of  e was heighten in recent week when we got a mix of veri posit and veri negat news   the posit news was the    percent increas in receipt that the feder govern has experienc thus far this year combin with the increas in payment of slight under   percent   that has had the net effect of reduc the expect      deficit by      billion   those trend are expect to continu go forward and the deficit project for      subsequ year have also been reduc   that sequenc and the provis of it were veri well document in the  book and particular in part   of the  book   on the other hand  just befor congress left town they pass a transport bill that was load with pork  and it also contain numer gimmick   there   s no other way to say it   that allow them to ignor their own budgetari guidelin   and that pass with onli eight dissent vote in the hous  which was veri discourag to anybodi who is expect to see  some fiscal au     unlik most of you  i   ve spent most of my public life involv with fiscal issu as oppos to monetari issu   so it   s somewhat disappoint to me that my arriv on the board coincid with the departur of fiscal disciplin at the congress    laughter   as the year start  there were a number of issu on which there seem to be a sens of resolv that they would be address   in particular  social secur was high on the agenda for this administr   there was a recognit that medicar and medicaid issu were of  grow concern and certain more problemat   there was a desir to achiev some fundament chang in incom tax polici  and there were some other unresolv issu relat to either tax or fund  particular pension reform   the presid began by announc that he was go to   i believ he said    spend    but i think he meant    appli      some of his polit capit to the social secur issu   initi there was a veri strong push on that but as of now    at the august recess   there seem littl likelihood of action this year or perhap even by this congress   the hope is  if there   s anyth with respect to social secur  that the chairman of the way and mean committe could packag it in some way with other polici issu that have some momentum   so they might be abl to move it as a packag  but separ and independ it seem unlik that the social secur chang will go anywher        with respect to tax polici  the presid did appoint an advisori committe on tax reform  that has been meet   i know our chairman spoke to that group  as have other  and that committe is expect to produc a report by septemb      even though the report deadlin seem to be in place still  the substanc of what they are go to produc is not yet fulli in place   howev  the public statement by sever of the member have indic some of the issu that will be includ   three in particular will be fair thorough vet   one would involv a revis of the exist incom tax code  highlight the necess of deal in particular with the altern minimum tax   current the altern minimum tax hit about   percent of taxpay  within five year  it will be up to    percent of taxpay   the cost of a repeal of the altern minimum tax could be anywher from      billion to      trillion over the next decad   so for each year that address it get postpon  the cost get much higher   that certain will be consid   a valu ad tax also will be given some consider  as will some sort of a consumpt tax   what will not be produc is a report that is in the form of legisl   i   m told by some that the report will be neither a legisl propos nor a textbook   it will be a report that discuss tax option that hope will keep the burden relat neutral with respect to where it is at this point   becaus it will not be in the form of legisl  it will not becom an activ legisl issu ani earlier than the spring  and mayb late spring  of        therefor  it   s unlik to be consid ani  e within the next congress   among other issu that are still outstand  of cours  are some other tax issu and the absenc of fund of the pension benefit guaranti corpor  in summari  the long and short in my view is that we will not see relief on the fiscal side  in term of the implic for our monetari polici deliber  the implic of that were      less sever  i think  dure the  e when the economi was soft   the deficit spend  in fact  was s ul at a  e when s ulus was welcom   as we get closer to equilibrium  it seem to me that that chang  so  it seem to me that at the veri least we will be proceed with an absenc of fiscal disciplin   what that will mean  among other thing  is that it will add pressur  i would think  to the extern fund of our current account deficit   and it will certain rais question as to the willing and the appetit of the u s  congress and the u s  peopl for maintain a stabl economi and a stabl currenc   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have remark  under demand has shown a surpris degre of vigor over the intermeet period   strength in final demand should show through to output as the mini inventori cycl work itself out   this strength  togeth with revis to es  of the level and rate of growth of potenti gdp as a consequ of the nipa revis  suggest that the economi is probabl a littl closer to it long run sustain product than we had thought   a smaller output gap  in combin with further increas in oil price   some portion of which is like to show through to core price for a  e   in turn suggest that inflat risk are a littl higher and rais question about our polici strategi   in my view  although the risk have shift a littl  they have not shift enough to throw us off our presum polici path of measur increas in interest rate  and i would continu to indic that in our statement  i agre with the staff forecast that the increas in final demand is like to slow go forward  as we continu to rais rate   the surpris was not in invest  which continu to be a bit on the weak side relat to fundament  but rather in consumpt  which is alreadi quit      strong   in part  the unexpect strength reflect auto incent and is borrow from spend in the futur   the increas in consumpt requir a further declin in the save rate from an alreadi low level  a pattern not like to be sustain absent continu veri sharp increas in  hous price   in that regard  at some point rise short term rate   and recent long term rate    should take their toll on hous price appreci   to be sure  to date the indic of cool hous market are anecdot  such as those we heard from presid guynn  they   re not yet data base   but if  as mani assert  the demand for hous is be support to a  consider extent by arm and exot mortgag tie to short term rate  the effect of monetari polici tighten should  if anyth  be greater than in the past  with the hous wealth channel bear more of the adjust   in addit  the further rise in energi price is like to shave someth off spend  or at least postpon the  e when energi price are no longer hold back growth   and the posit contribut to final sale from net export in the second quarter appear to be a short term quirk in either data or behavior   moder growth abroad  togeth with our outsiz demand for import  should onc again begin to damp demand on our own product resourc   moreov  incom data on price and compens continu to indic  to my mind  that there is some slack remain  which is work to contain price pressur   although core pce data for      and befor were revis higher  incom inform about the most recent sever month has suggest an appreci short term deceler   the recent price data were  in fact  lower than anticip   in effect  the data tend to confirm that the higher rate of inflat earlier this year were temporari  probabl reflect the increas in price level of oil and other import  and that inflat is not on an upward track   these data have been consist with an economi produc somewhat short of it sustain potenti   compens data      have been contradictori and confound  but it seem hard to believ that the surpris soft number for the eci in q  and q  were drawn from a labor market under pressur  perhap give some more weight to presid pool   s comment on the anecdot inform there  even the product number are somewhat ambigu in their implic for cost and price pressur   although past product growth appear to have been lower  and the staff mark down it es  of structur product growth for      and beyond  actual product data for      are run at a higher rate than had previous been anticip   the es  for the first half of the year was revis up to     percent  and the current quarter is project to be substanti higher than that  market particip seem to think the measur pace of polici tighten will be adequ   they have ad to the extent of the tighten but not the pace   and inflat compens  as presid   note  while edg a littl higher over the intermeet period  remain much lower than it was just a few month ago  despit the further increas in energi price  final  i think the strategi we have follow of tighten at a measur pace and be transpar about our intent has a number of advantag   in particular  follow this strategi   especi compar to one of larger increas or those that weren   t well predict by the market   reduc the odd of signific overshoot   gradual chang enabl us to get a better handl on their effect on the market and the economi as they are happen   their predict mean that they are incorpor into financi condit more readili and accur  bring forward their effect on financi condit and make observ about their like impact on the economi more accur and  e       and i wonder whether this strategi isn   t go to be especi use given the uncertainti about how our action could affect hous price  construct  and consumpt  increas rate will affect hous market   inde  that   s a necessari condit for constrain inflat pressur   but increas uncertainti about the strength of this channel  given the chang natur of mortgag market  reinforc the argument for a gradual approach to polici  if possibl  i agre that the incom data should reinforc and strengthen our intent not to allow inflat and inflat expect to rise from here   i   m encourag by the reaction of market to the news over the intermeet period in ad    basi point to the string of expect gradual increas in the fund rate   this show that they are not constrain by our languag from mark up long term interest rate  and it strike me as the right respons  at least for now  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to focus my comment today on some macroeconom perspect and on what we   re learn in the supervisori review of mortgag product that we and other regul are undertak now   on the posit side  when we look at the larg volum of arm in exist  most of them are of the tradit form   and current those arm are at a point   whether they   re adjust annual or they start out as   year fix rate loan and then move to annual adjust   where they will be reset   for the one that start out in      with fix rate for three year  this is the year when they will go to annual reset   we know all of them  sinc they   re index to short term rate  are go to have a big increas whenev their anniversari come up in the second half of      and into             to the extent that long mortgag rate or the reindex rate are veri close to those avail to most borrow on refinanc  it look as if most of these arm can be convert into a fix rate product without a larg amount of payment adjust   there will be some  but it seem like to be manag for mani of these borrow   on the other hand  we   re see a lot of subprim arm where this may not be true   as you know  those arm product that have been push into the subprim market are much more problemat   so the afford for that group of custom is question   they are go to be hit not onli by higher gas price but higher month mortgag payment when their rate are reset   and that is go to be more of an issu as we go forward and as we continu to rais  short term interest rate   also  i   m a bit more pessimist about what is happen with regard to some of these option arm and the more esoter arm that are be market and have been market particular in the last nine month   banker as a whole i think clear are do a good job at underwrit these   we have some lender on the edg  though  that we   re work on   but these mortgag market develop have some signific macroeconom implic   mani of these loan start out with teaser rate that were below current market rate   so first of all  the rate have to catch up to the market level   then also  the index to which the rate is tie will have move up by about     or more basi point  say  by the end of the year  so if they are interest onli loan  the rate could go from someth that mayb start out with a         and could get to someth with a         in front of it   and all of a sudden the month payment are go to go up fourfold   even if default don   t increas  it certain is go to pull a lot of discretionari incom out of spend and have some implic down the road        anoth issu is that appar mani of these loan have limit on how much the payment can go up each year in order to tri to make the annual adjust easier   but that put borrow in a predica becaus it throw them into negat amort   dure the teaser period  they   re in negat amort  and the cap on the index use to reset the month payment could put them further into negat amort   so if they do want to get out of the arm and switch to a fix rate loan  they have to cover the addit negat amort  mani of these loan have prepay penalti  so the lender recoup that   that may be problemat in move more peopl into fix rate product as interest rate rise   and to the extent borrow go to fix rate mortgag  they   ll go to fulli amort loan  which could be a financi burden   even though we are begin to see mortgag of    year and longer   the leverag that we see in household on their borrow i think is anoth indic that if they   re stretch to be abl to afford these hous  it will be more problemat for them to stay in the hous as their month payment go up   perhap even doubl or tripl   so  when we talk about the wealth effect of hous price bubbl  i   m get concern around the edg that we could see a major impact on cash flow of both subprim and prime borrow becaus these arm are index to short rate and those rate are move up   sinc arm are a big chunk of the mortgag market today  we have to realiz that we can   t just look at long term mortgag rate and the afford of hous   we need to look at the short rate  too  becaus they   re get to be more and more import   as i look overal at the economi today   and i   m go to echo some of the comment i   ve heard around the tabl   i   m veri comfort that we have gotten past the soft spot of the spring   i also am a littl pessimist regard how this recent bounc will be sustain   but i think we do have a strong foundat go forward  with growth somewher in the mid three       and in my view  that is a good pace of growth   i also believ  to echo the comment governor kohn just made  that the market has react to the understand that we may have to push rate up even further   there is a tremend amount of liquid in the market  and i think that   s what the market is see   when we talk about accommod  the market is look at the liquid that can flow into deal for both commerci activ and for consum   so i think we need to continu to push the fund rate upward   and person  my number for the upper limit on the fund rate is much higher today than it was three to four month ago
thank you  mr  chairman   the incom data show broad base support for growth  with inflat   at least in the most recent read   relat well contain   final demand seem to be robust  with consum  hous  and to some degre busi invest spend  all make contribut   no doubt some of these data have been help by the surpris success of the latest set of incent from the auto compani  which boost consum spend and led to an unexpect slowdown in inventori invest  howev  under financi condit  the creation of wealth and job  and both consum and busi confid i think provid a more last  sustain basi to growth go forward   while it   s hard to have a great deal of confid in the saw tooth quarter pattern that we see in the  book  i think the baselin forecast in the longer term is ampli support by the fact   and in my view  a continu execut of our announc polici of a gradual remov of accommod is in order   howev  there were a suffici number of surpris in the intermeet period   and  as   said  a suffici number of move part in the  book   to warrant a closer      examin of a number of issu   given the  e  howev  i   m go to focus my comment on onli one of those   i think the most import issu from a polici perspect is whether it is reason to accept  as a basi for today   s decis  the staff   s forecast of inflat stabil   albeit at the veri upper end of what i believ is this committe   s accept rang   the baselin staff view of this relat benign inflat dynam can certain be call into question  given a rang of sourc of uncertainti and inflat pressur   those uncertainti and inflat pressur come from a number of factor  the mix data that we   ve seen of late on labor compens  the upward movement in the price of oil  the recent chang over the last sever quarter in unit labor cost  and our new understand that pce price were on a steeper upward trajectori and that structur suppli side growth may have been slight less robust than we had thought befor the nipa revis   to attempt to answer this question  i sought to valid the  book inflat forecast  and i   d like to hand out some tabl that indic the result of this work    what i ask the staff to do was to assess the histor perform of sever altern measur of inflat as predictor of one year ahead inflat   cpi inflat in particular   and here i think i owe a slight apolog to gari  becaus i came to some statist conclus that were somewhat differ from his instinct conclus  if you look at the tabl i   ve hand out  the first page show what is call the root mean squar predict error of altern forecast of one year ahead cpi inflat   the set of forecast that i look at is pretti obvious   the  book  the spf  survey of profession forecast  cpi forecast  the cpi random walk  and the median cpi random walk use the cleveland median cpi   in the second to leftmost column you   ll see that over a long period       the materi refer to by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix               from the third quarter of      to the first quarter of        our  book forecast has turn out  at least on this relat simpl measur  to have been the best of the forecast   the random  walk forecast tend not to be so good  but other forecast extern have also done pretti well   you can look across the various period and see that  by and larg  the staff forecast tend to be the histor winner   curious  as you get to the far right column  which cover the period begin in       we can add in import inform   the compens from tip  again  i think it give a relat good forecast of inflat   and then the one measur here that is not self explanatori is the adjust tip   there  our staff has adjust the tip to elimin the best es  that we have of the liquid premium and inflat risk premium base on a term structur model   and if you look at the adjust tip  at least in the short period of      to       you can see that the adjust tip measur tend to be somewhat better than almost ani of the other   so  by and larg  we   d say overal that the market seem to have a realli good forecast record in the short term   and in the longer term  our  book forecast seem to be the best and is probabl somewhat better than the random walk  turn to the second page of the handout  given that background of what we can trust  i think the good news here   again  i had to do this on the cpi forecast   our staff   s cpi forecast seem to be pretti much in the middl   we are not an outlier   the other good news  particular if one trust the adjust tip inform  is that it also seem to be quit consist with the  book forecast   so i took this to basic say at the end   and i want to be relat short here  given i   m the last speaker   that we can be reason confid in base our polici today on the  book inflat forecast   there clear is an upsid risk to that forecast  i think   but as both other forecast and a varieti of market base indic all signal  it would be veri hard for us to find at this stage a better inflat forecast than the one the staff has given us   so      while there   s obvious some uncertainti  i   d say let   s build our polici approach around the baselin forecast  and let   s continu with the market accept approach that we   ve alreadi announc of a gradual remov of our accommod   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much   let   s move on to   madigan
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the packag of chart distribut dure the break entitl    materi for brief on monetari polici altern      your monetari polici discuss today take place

monetari polici firm   as shown in the upper left hand panel of your next exhibit  investor appear to have boost their forecast for the peak feder fund rate from around    percent as of the last fomc meet  the dot line  to just abov    percent  the solid line    and wherea previous investor had anticip a slow in the pace of tighten this autumn  the steepen visibl in the left hand part of the panel indic that market particip have signific rais their expect for polici action over the next sever month   this revis in near term polici expect can be seen even more clear in the step path in the upper right hand panel  which portray market expect for your action at each of the four remain meet this year  as given by our read of fed fund futur quot   the uptick for the august meet from      percent to      percent indic that investor have gone from fair sure to essenti certain of a    basi point move at this meet  especi strike are the upward revis to expect for the novemb and decemb meet   previous  onli a veri small probabl was assign to a move in decemb  but that likelihood has now been mark up to abov    percent   despit these upward revis  the      percent rate after the decemb meet suggest that investor still see high odd that you will take a pass at one of the meet over the balanc of the year  most like in decemb   this pattern of expect is reflect in the desk   s survey of the    primari dealer   as shown in the lower left hand panel  on averag dealer assign a    percent probabl to a    basi point move at this meet     percent for septemb  and    percent for novemb   for each of those meet  both no action and a    basi point move were also seen as possibl  with the likelihood of a paus still slight outweigh that of a polici acceler   as indic in the middl panel  for today   s meet  dealer almost unanim expect you onc again to judg the current stanc of polici as accommod  to assess the risk as balanc  and to retain the    measur pace    languag   as shown in the

uncertainti   dealer    averag forecast that core pce inflat will be about   percent in mid       not shown  seem to suggest that their    percent averag es  for the nomin fund rate translat into rough a    percent es  for the equilibrium real fund rate        as shown in the top panel of exhibit    an equilibrium real feder fund rate in a rang of rough   to    percent is also consist with both a rang of model base staff es   the red band  and the  book forecast  the   dash line    as indic in the upper part of the lower panel  the rang of model es  has narrow substanti this round   in the june bluebook  the right hand column  the es  went from     percent at the low end to     percent at the high end  but in this bluebook they are relat tight clu  rough between   to    percent   the width of the red band  howev  should not be interpret as a confid interv   rather     and    percent confid interv captur uncertainti about model specif  coeffici  and the level of potenti output are denot  as usual  by the dark and light shade area in the chart   accord to these rather wide interv  the real fund rate could alreadi be abov it equilibrium level or remain well below it   moreov  at least some of these es  of the equilibrium fund rate are subject to uncertainti regard the outlook for a rang of exogen variabl  this point is made use a differ framework in exhibit     this exhibit show the result of a benchmark scenario and two altern scenario that are prepar use the version of the frb us model with forward look investor and assum op  policymak whose outlook is similar to the staff   s   the benchmark scenario  denot by the black line  captur econom condit and inflat pressur as interpret judgment in the  book and extend through        but in the benchmark scenario as well as the two altern  policymak pursu an op  polici rather than follow the fund rate path of the  book or a taylor rule   specif  policymak minim the sum of squar deviat of unemploy from the nairu  deviat of inflat from an assum     percent target  and chang in the feder fund rate   under that benchmark scenario  the feder fund rate move up gradual to about     percent  a littl higher than in the  book  and then drop back to   percent  as core pce inflat tilt down toward it assum target of     percent and the unemploy rate vari narrowli between   and    percent   this scenario  by the way  assum that the current veri low term  premium in bond yield rise gradual  reach it histor averag level in    year   the red line are base on the    stronger demand    scenario that was discuss in the  book  with person consumpt  residenti invest  and busi invest expenditur all consider stronger than in the baselin scenario   here  polici tighten much more steepli than in the baselin   and  with financi market immedi recogn both the posit shock to demand and the result tighten of monetari polici  nomin bond yield prompt jump to about    percent   as shown in the lower panel  inflat initi drop below baselin under this scenario becaus the sharp tighten of monetari polici induc a substanti appreci of the dollar and becaus      the modest initi declin in unemploy below the nairu  the middl panel  impart littl momentum to inflat    the blue line in this chart focus on a topic issu   the unusu low term premium in bond rate   this scenario address the question   what would happen if the term premium jump    basi point  thus revert immedi to it histor averag   here  the assumpt of forward look policymak and market is key   to offset the incipi upward pressur on bond yield aris from the increas term premium  the committe eas polici consider relat to baselin   investor see right away that you are  and will be  take countervail action   consequ  as shown in the upper right hand panel  the effect of the higher term premium on bond yield is essenti offset by market    correct anticip that the stanc of polici  as gaug by the nomin fund rate  will be easier over the next    year   as shown by the lower and middl panel  this polici is near complet success in elimin the effect of the term premium shock on the real economi and  inflat    certain  these altern simul contain some extrem element   the larg shock to aggreg demand in the first  the immedi substanti jump in the term premium in the second  and the assumpt of immedi recognit of the shock and a high degre of forward look behavior in both simul   but they nonetheless illustr some use lesson   first  it is easi to imagin that the economi or financi market could evolv in such a way as to requir a feder fund rate notabl abov or below the rather concentr   to    percent center of graviti that current seem to be suggest by the r  measur  fed fund futur  and dealer    expect   and the second scenario in particular suggest the potenti valu to policymak of be abl to decompos chang in nomin bond yield into expect and term premium  compon   even acknowledg the uncertainti illustr by these scenario  though  the weight of the evid seem to suggest that monetari polici will need to firm at least somewhat further in come month   accord  the bluebook onc again present three polici altern  summar in your final exhibit  that each would involv a further increas in the feder fund rate at this meet   as shown in the second column  under altern a the fund rate would be boost a quarter point today  but the languag in your announc would hint at an immin downshift in the pace of tighten   with the real fund rate current at onli about    percent  it seem implaus to propos statement languag suggest that the end of the tighten cycl was just around the corner  a suggest of a paus  with further tighten to come  seem a bit more relev to current circumst         at the other end of the spectrum  altern c  the fourth column  could be motiv by a sens that the real fund rate is current well below it equilibrium  possibl far enough below that an intensif of inflat pressur could alreadi be in train   to move more rapid to close the real rate gap  this altern would rais the fund rate    basi point at this meet  moreov  the statement would convey fair serious concern about both the strength of aggreg demand and rise cost pressur   with a move of this size  the committe would presum no longer express a view that futur polici move would occur at a measur pace and might take the opportun to elimin other forward look element of the statement as well   under altern b  the committe would stick with it establish progra   by firm polici anoth    basi point today  retain the assess that the risk to growth and inflat should be balanc with appropri polici action  and reiter that polici firm like can continu at a measur pace   howev  the propos languag in the    rational    sentenc of the announc   those character real activ and inflat   have been modifi signific   these chang could be read by investor as convey a bit more concern about the pace of demand growth and the degre of inflat pressur than they had expect    in weigh altern approach to near term polici  policymak as usual would seem to have to make some key judgment   these includ  for exampl  whether the staff is correct in it assess that onli a bit of slack remain in the economi  that current financi condit are consist with a near ter   slow in the growth of aggreg demand to a pace in line with that of the economi   s potenti  and that core pce inflat will probabl remain near   percent over the forecast horizon with a continu of gradual tighten   the staff could be wrong in those assess  but if so it will like have a good deal of compani among financi market particip   that conclud my prepar remark
just one      you had on exhibit   an interest simul in the scenario with a higher term premium   but an altern you didn   t simul is what happen if the relat low term premia that we are observ now stay in place for some  e   there are a number of peopl who think that that has short term implic for polici   i   m not sure about that   it might over  e  but i   m not sure it has implic for the next sever meet
i think that would not be notabl differ from the  book scenario where essenti we do have the term premium go away but veri slowli
okay   so in some sens  the  book scenario cover the current situat  and then a veri  veri gradual movement up in the term premium
the  book baselin
so you have the same path here for the revers of the term premium to it histor averag as is in the  book baselin
that   s right
that   s for a slow revers  right   the other one that you have here involv a veri rapid revers
yes  that   s correct
further question for     if not  let me add my  thought  wherev they may go    laughter   i thought it was quit interest to hear the tone of this committe   s view that the inflat rate is gradual move up and that   s not particular worrisom  except that basi point keep get ad to basi point and befor you know it  the rate of inflat is higher than we want it to be   the underton of resist to that i thought was rather impress and  i must say  it   s a view that i share as well   the rate is be boost by a thousand littl hit  which eventu get you  and sudden you say     how in the world did we get here      there are general concern in the sens that the cost of nation defens  homeland  secur  and the like are realli quit substanti   but they don   t seem to have impact the cost structur signific nor result in a mark slow in product growth   we did  as you      know  have consider concern that the rate of product growth in the second quarter was go to slow appreci and that in the third quarter it wasn   t go to move veri much from  that reduc pace   we thought that structur product might well be revis down and that  therefor  structur unit labor cost would increas  suggest an acceler in inflat   that appar is not happen   that is  we are get upward revis in product on a month by month basi  so that concern is someth we can basic put asid for the moment   on the other side  there was a general tone in the comment around the tabl of concern about the acceler in econom activ   but i think we ought to be a littl care in make a judgment on that  given that the paus in the second quarter was to a veri larg extent reflect of inventori invest fall away at a fair signific pace  though the extent of that was not someth of which we were awar until after the fact   current  we   re see the revers   now  even though industri product is not all that big a chunk of gdp  it is a signific aspect of the chang in gdp   and the combin of motor vehicl output and non motor vehicl inventori chang suggest  as   point out  an automat pop in the number  and that is what we   re see   is it an implic of an acceler in econom activ   i would say    not necessarili      were that the case  we would be see a tighten in market  we   d see it in commod price  but we do not   we   d see it in deliveri lead  e  but we   re see onli a margin increas there   in other word  the anecdot report and other usual evid of market tighten up are not there   we   re not see the consequ of what inevit has to be the case   that is  the loss of effect capac as a result of increas oil and natur gas price   that   s go to happen at some point  but it   s not evid anywher we can see it   so  what we   re deal with  as best i can judg  are gradual chang that are      increas of a tighten natur   but those chang are not show up in ani form that creat a sens of urgenc to address them   there are two area of the outlook about which i think we know a great deal less than we   d like   one is oil and the other is hous price   on the oil side  the futur market  as you know  show a flatten out of crude price   but when ani commod price is go up  futur price alway show a flatten out   the reason is that futur market  while they may be the best es  that exist of the market   s expect of price in the futur  are nonetheless a mechan in which the demand in the immedi period is essenti spread out over the whole futur spectrum   and it   s reflect in the fact that the upper end of futur price relat to the spot price cannot be more than the carri charg   if it is  what happen is that the spot price get pull up in the process    so  at this stage what we   re look at is the market   s best forecast of the longer term outlook for oil price   but as a quick look at histori will tell us  the futur price has a terribl record as a forecast   therefor  it   s not all that use  especi when we   re look at veri odd under fundament here   if one look at the product number and demand as current measur  we   re run into a big increas in inventori accumul in the second half of the year   and one would presum  as i guess lee raymond    that that impli the market are go down   but we also have the other side of this problem where all of the prove reserv are in  area with nation oil industri and  therefor  the abil to bring to bear financ from the intern oil compani is veri signific limit   inde  in the case of mexico  it is constitut prohibit   and as the popul in these oil produc area are grow fair rapid  an ever increas part of the cash flow from oil revenu is go for domest      welfar need   so even though the price are go up and the revenu and cash flow are go up  there appear to be a shortag of cash avail to convert the prove reserv into effect oper capac  mean drill and infrastructur   even though the number look reason good  what we have had in the last few year  after a long period of veri small increas in world oil demand  is that demand has sudden tilt up as china and india have come on the scene  and after a fair signific amount of non opec product  which turn out to have been larg russian  now we   re get some evid of nation in the russian oil industri  and product growth there has slow veri materi   henc  the outlook for ani slack we general might have is question   and one of the serious question is  are we underes  long term demand growth so that even though there may be product out there  the gap is close from the demand side   but most of the concern  as   point out  is on the suppli side becaus one can list a number of fragil oil produc area and a whole seri of possibl suppli interrupt  anyth can go wrong   inde  one indic of how sensit the market is can be seen in the reaction to everi flicker of a potenti hurrican in the gulf of mexico   that is not the biggest oil produc area of the world  but when there   s even a hint of a hurrican in that region  crude price pop   as a consequ  we may have a sens that we   re look at a short term glut  but the price are see through the glut   that   s  inde  the converg of the long term   year futur price to the spot price   for a long period of  e we had a big surg in the spot price and the   year futur drag along bare  with the gap open up   in the last year that gap has close veri dramat  which suggest that there   s a fundament concern in the marketplac that the long term capabl of this market are not suffici and that a price of     or     a barrel for crude may not be the low number   just rememb  the price got up to the equival in      today   s price of     for wti back in the     s   all we can say that   s fortun about that comparison is the fact that the amount of oil use per unit of gdp is down veri signific  so  there is no basic long term concern  but there is a short term concern here  which i think  rais question about inflat and about the contractionari characterist of oil price increas  so it   s a veri difficult mixtur   on the hous area  the real problem is not actual the boom or how far it   s go or whether it is a bubbl or the like   the real issu is this  when it diffus  as it will one way or the other  what are the implic   the serious problem that will aris when that happen relat to the question of what is the margin propens to consum out of hous wealth   the problem that i think we have is that the impact from a slow or declin in hous appreci    or more explicit the effect of hous capit gain on the one hand and of stock capit gain on the other   would be a far greater contract in consumpt than indic by a standard reduc form system  which we current have in our model   name  the wealth effect   what bother me is that we may  in fact  be look at much higher margin propens to consum from hous capit gain   and  as hous turnov slow  cash out will slip and the amount of equiti extract will fall quit signific   in fact  implicit the  book has a veri substanti fall in equiti extract  as you know   mortgag debt is shown to slow down veri materi   the key question is  is the margin propens to consum from equiti extract actual      which is the figur indic in our survey of cash out and other survey   if one assum that that   s the impact on consumpt  that account for virtual all of the declin in the save rate  and it would impli a revers   a veri signific rise   in the save rate   and that is the other side of the question of what kind of consumpt pattern we will see go forward        implicit our exist model  which endeavor to differenti the margin propens to consum from wealth creation from stock and wealth creation from hous  is incap of distinguish ani differ in the margin propens to consum from those two sourc  and instead of      the implicit number is well under       as a consequ  even though the  book forecast has a signific implicit declin in mortgag debt expans  we do not get the type of margin slowdown in person consumpt expenditur   and i might add modern expenditur   that is implicit in the survey data   the troubl is that we cannot know the answer at this stage to the question about the margin propens to consum out of hous wealth  intern data are more suggest of a higher propens to consum   australia   s pce slow down veri dramat with the slow in hous price appreci there   the same was true in the unit kingdom   and that   s an issu about which i   m fear we will not know the answer for the unit state until we see it   when we find that equiti extract  sudden fall with a flatten of hous price and retail sale somehow begin to disappear   i   m not sure we can make judgment in advanc as to how that will come out  but how it come out may be the most difficult problem that we will be confront   it  sn   t seem like to be immin   it   s certain not the case that hous start are fall off dramat   inde  the backlog the larg builder have on start is still veri high   it is flatten out a bit but is show no sign of weak   conceiv  in the event of a weaken in price  a lot of that backlog will disappear   that may occur without our know where it   s come from  but peopl will just pull away from the hous market   so  we do have problem out there  and i don   t think we realli have a great deal of confid in the outlook implicit in this forecast of an ongo  veri smooth and veri      impress expans in the economi   i   m certain not argu that i wish it were otherwis  this is as good an economi as one can get   it   s just that we have to look down the road and see what   s out there   and what i see are a coupl of possibl that should make us want to exercis some caution  although none of the potenti problem  as best i can judg  is immin  there   s noth out there that indic that someth is about to fall apart   but as we get into       i feel that the tranquil we are forc to exhibit   becaus the forecast is a point es  in all of our project   may be a bit overdon   in summari  i think we   re on the right path   i don   t think there   s ani urgenc to consid acceler the path nor  of cours  pull it back   i share the view express by a number of you around this tabl in that i   m delight that the futur market have jack up the implicit longer term project of the fund rate quit signific  and i think certain to the right dimens   and as i   ve said here befor  my impress basic is that when the economi start to chang  the market are go to be move ahead of us and probabl will conclud pretti much as we would conclud when we meet   if that is inde the case  as i mention earlier  the most probabl outlook is that the market are go to tell us when we have final reach the point where this program of increas the fund rate is over and a paus is impli   it is conceiv that we may have to chang the languag abrupt  which will chang the market   s expect and caus some disrupt   i think that probabl will not happen  judg from the way we and the market have interact  we   re all look at essenti the  same play book  and i think we are like to come out with the same conclus   if that   s the case  the period of about six week that we   re go to have between one meet and anoth at the point we   re go to chang is probabl go to be enough  e for the market to adjust and effect to tell us     this is what we expect you to do when you walk into your next      fomc meet      and that  inde  is like to be what we   re go to want to do   we   re go to chang the languag   we   re go to chang  in fact  the way we produc our statement   and hope we will have phase into the next stage of monetari policymak in a less disrupt way than we probabl fear   or at least that i fear   but that   s for the futur   for now  i think the appropri action is a move of    basi point and pretti much the altern b statement that is shown in     s tabl   so i   d like to put that propos on this tabl and get your reaction   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend for    basi point  and i support the recommend that we repeat the statement   i would have two suggest on the rational part of the statement   first  in row   i would elimin the word    gradual    and just say    labor market condit continu to improv      second  in row   i think the syntax would work a bit better if there were two sentenc read    core inflat has been   relat low in recent month  but pressur on inflat have stay elev   longer term inflat expect remain well contain      i just think it read a littl better   paradox perhap  i think that repeat essenti the same languag actual give us maximum possibl flexibl in the futur   anyth that we might tri to chang would open up the possibl of misinterpret in the market   look ahead  i think it   s go to be simpl at some point to add to the statement or to have the statement say that monetari accommod has been substanti remov   the t i part   the tough issu that we will have to deal with   is whether in the futur we will want to have some forward look guidanc
we may not be abl to   presid
mr  chairman  i support your recommend and agre with the rational that you gave for it
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i look forward to work on evolv the statement languag for use at some point
mr  chairman  i think we   re a littl behind the curv   but i don   t see a better solut in term of go forward  so i support your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   the onli thing i would do to adjust the altern b languag is to think about remov the word    gradual     if this is gradual  i don   t know what rapid is
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   unlik presid    i don   t realli look forward to evolv the languag    laughter  on the    gradual    issu  i guess i don   t think thing have chang all that much   if we look at   month move averag of employ growth  we   ve been stuck in the same rang for  quit a while now   the initi claim have come down a littl  but they haven   t realli come down that much   so in my mind  improv gradual mean that we   re gradual use up what littl remain slack is there   and i don   t think the situat has chang materi over the intermeet period  those averag remain about what they were   we   re somewhat abov the sort of steadi state that we need
just to rejoin  i wouldn   t describ this as a    rapid    improv labor market but i would argu that it is improv   period   that   s probabl a better character of the last    month  the year to date  and the last three month   number of         are indic of a pretti good job market   that   s the onli issu that i would address   i wouldn   t object to this word   i just don   t think it   s as descript as it might be
i think bill pool   s caveat is right here   even if you   re technic correct  it   s question how much we want to chang the statement languag if we don   t have to
that   s fine
you know  initi claim have not move all that much sinc the last meet  so it   s a littl hard to make the case   and ani word that we chang now  sinc we   re chang so littl  is go to be made more of than i think we   d want becaus there are so mani peopl out there who are be paid to read this statement and interpret our mean   so  i think we have to be a littl care of that   unless someth in the statement is obvious get to be incorrect   clear  we can   t have that   it   s probabl better not to make a  chang
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   and given the comment that you just made about the less we chang the statement the better  i do like presid pool   s recommend about the order of the word in section   becaus that is a littl more like our previous statement on inflat   also  given our comment around this tabl that inflat today is near the high end of where we   d like it to be  i don   t want that first statement      about core inflat be relat low to be misinterpret as mean that the current level of inflat is well within our comfort zone   i understand that it   s hard to fine tune this statement at this tabl  so i am comfort with the languag  but i do like presid pool   s order of section
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  am comfort with your recommend  and i   m also happi to resist the temptat to chang the languag ani more than necessari at this point   go forward  my prefer would be to continu  where possibl  to provid some guidanc   but that   s an issu for anoth day
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   on the word    gradual     i actual would like to see it come out  too  but i don   t feel that strong about it   my logic was this   my recollect is that we put the word    gradual    in after a veri weak may employ report that was origin        in payrol job and was revis up to           in june we had an increas of         after the revis   in juli the number was           and if you look at the privat payrol  someth close to         has been a constant for a long period of  e  with all of the revis that have taken place   so i  too  think we could drop the word    gradual     though i suppos we could wait for one more employ report to see if that number is strong and take the word out next month   but i   d prefer to take it out today if possibl
i support the recommend  mr  chairman  and i   m indiffer on the word    gradual      i like presid pool   s rephras of the fourth box down   i think it make grammat sens  but i   m not go to fight over it
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i   m relat agnost on languag  though i slight prefer presid pool   s suggest on section number four   if i were go to put my two cent in  i might suggest ad someth along the line of an    unwelcom further rise in inflat     but i   ll wait
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   while accept your argument against fiddl with the word  i must say that i also would prefer to take the word    gradual    out   and i share sandi   s concern that  read liter  the phrase    core inflat has been relat low    could be interpret as a comfort level  and i don   t think that was the tone  of our discuss   but i assum we can correct that interpret with our comment  as we all go out and speak public  so i support your recommend
i support both the new target level and the languag in altern b   on paragraph    i did not tri to compar it word for word with the previous character  but my sens is that this is a signific chang from the pattern we   ve use in that paragraph  and i think it   s appropri
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   with respect to the languag  i think the most import set of chang here is not in paragraph   but      in paragraph     and i actual think have the languag read the way it is written now in altern b  as oppos to presid pool   s suggest  emphas the most import issu  which is that the pressur on inflat have stay elev   in my view that   s realli
leav it at the end
yes  leav it at the end   that is the polici signific stori here  and i think that pick up the general tone around the room   so i   m weigh in fair strong on not make this chang   i understand the grammat point that presid pool made   but in term of the polici messag  if we end with    pressur on inflat have stay elev     i think that   s a signific enough chang   it tell the market that we are awak and vigil  and i believ that will help us to keep the inflat expect pretti well contain  but presid   is closer to the market than i am
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i realli like paragraph four the way it is for the same reason governor   just mention   i want to leav peopl with the messag that inflat pressur are out there and are elev  and i want to make sure that that messag get through   so i rather like it the way it is  even though it may not be as smooth grammat
i support your recommend  and i agre on the argument made in favor of retain the structur of paragraph four   let me just add one argument to those alreadi made   bill  if we look at your structur in term of what we would be chang from the june languag in section four  all we   d be do is ad the thought that core inflat has been relat low in recent month   so i think the net effect of that chang      might be that it would come across as somewhat more reassur than we would want   that   s whi i think the evolut in this languag from the initi draft   circul to the current  draft is actual good in captur the sens of what is slight differ in the outlook   so i think it has a slight better balanc as current structur
i must say that i was also push toward somewhat better syntax and a littl better use of the english languag   the troubl  unfortun  is that the onli way to do that is to move the last phrase up  and that creat polici issu in my judgment   so i   d prefer to have poor but clear languag  laughter  becaus we certain don   t want to convey a messag that will bring the long term forward rate down   everyon in the marketplac has agre that we are go to move    basi point   if we move the longer term forward rate in a signific way  we   re go to have to adjust that  and that will be troublesom    would you read the appropri direct
i   ll be read the direct and the risk assess from page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run  object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around     percent      the risk assess portion read     the committe perceiv that with appropri monetari polici action  the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil should be kept rough equal   with under inflat expect to be contain  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur  nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil  it oblig to maintain price stabil
