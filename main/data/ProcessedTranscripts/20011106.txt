good morn  everyon   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut of our octob meet
without object   dino
thank you  mr  chairman  i will be refer to the chart that were hand out this morn      the top panel of the first page depict u s  and euro area cash and forward rate   u s    month cash rate  the solid red line  declin about     percent sinc the last meet  while   month and   month forward rate declin by similar magnitud as the string of data releas reinforc expect that polici rate would continu to be reduc   in the euro area  cash rate fell about    basi point but   month forward rate fell by more than     percentag point  widen the spread between cash and forward rate   the rate movement reflect reaction to weak data for the euro area as well as heighten expect that the total amount of eas to come from the ecb would be larger than had been previous anticip  this morn   s two week refinanc oper by the ecb was under subscrib by about    billion euro and the oper actual drain    billion euro  as bank expect to be abl to buy cheaper fund after this thursday   s ecb meet did not have much demand for   week money  overnight rate move to about   percent after the oper   s result were announc  the bottom panel provid three snapshot of the japanes yield curv in       for februari   th  august   th  and novemb  nd   broad speak  the curv continu to exhibit a veri flat trajectori out to three year and then steepen for matur beyond that out to    year   rate at the veri long end have stay near     percent  reflect both a premium for the longer matur and the lesser market liquid of bond beyond    year   but the long rate perhap also reflect worri about the prospect of signific govern debt issuanc  which may be necessari to financ a cleanup of the bankin sector                           chart use by mr  kos are append to this transcript            stay with the japanes market for a bit on page two  the top panel show the   year japanes govern bond  jgb  yield and the   year yen swap rate sinc januari        the middl panel depict the    year jgb and swap rate for the same period   in both  the spread between the swap rate and the jgb yield trend near    basi point in earli       then began to narrow in late      and earli      as yield start to fall and rate at the short end approach zero   by the summer  the    year differenti went to zero and was even negat on some day   the   year differenti narrow a bit later and is now also near zero   so bank oblig in a countri with known bank problem are be price as substitut for govern credit   one interpret would suggest that the market is alreadi presum that japanes bank risk is sovereign risk   anoth explan can be found by look at the flow that are creat this relationship   japanes bank have been veri larg buyer of    and    year swap   that is  they are receiv a long term fix rate and pay a short term float rate  which late has been near zero   that is function similar to buy a jgb and financ it in the short term repo market   the seller of these swap report have been foreign commerci and invest bank   japanes bank have ad to their swap posit rather than purchas more jgbs becaus of a preferenti account treatment  with small probabl that short rate will move higher ani  e soon  the situat probabl   not pose near term concern   but japanes bank do have a stake in spread stay tight and  given that the bank are also larg holder of jgbs  in rate remain low   ergo  one quick get into the circular logic of the situat   the possibl need to clean up bank balanc sheet may forc the govern to issu more bond to financ that endeavor  which in turn will rais yield and inflict loss on bank hold larg jgb posit and larg swap posit as well  as for the market    view on the state of japanes bank  the bottom panel graph the tokyo stock exchang composit index and the bank sub index  both are down substanti sinc januari of        interest  the bank sub index has had it greatest underperform in the last    month  precis dure the  e that swap spread began to narrow  as we go through the next three page of chart  i will briefli review a number of asset price relationship in major market in the eight week sinc septemb   th   the top panel of page three index the dollar   s exchang rate against the euro  the yen  and the swiss franc sinc august  st   despit the weak data on the u s  economi  the dollar is back to level where it trade in mid august  have recov from the post septemb    loss against both the yen and the euro   it is still somewhat lower against the swiss franc   the middl panel graph impli volatil  which have continu to come down to around    percent  compar to    percent in mid august and    percent in mid septemb            anoth vantag point into the seem tranquil of the foreign exchang market is through risk revers   this is an option trade that reflect whether market particip are will to pay an ad premium for protect against the risk of a rise dollar  in which case dollar call are expens relat to dollar put   altern  in the case of tri to protect against the risk of a fall dollar  dollar put are favor  immedi after septemb  th the marketplac bid up dollar put  but sinc then this indic  quit unusu  has move to absolut neutral for all three major currenc pair   the op ist view is that market particip believ that exchang rate have achiev someth of a sustain equilibrium   probabl the more plausibl explan is that there is a lack of convict among trader about the like cours of exchang rate   that hypothesi is also support by anecdot evid in that there has been a pull back of risk take in the foreign exchang market  on page four  the top panel depict a number of the major global equiti indic sinc august  st  but re index to their close level on septemb   th   in general  the major indic have move in a correl fashion back to pre attack level  the middl panel graph select major emerg market indic  with the except of the argentin merval index  most have recov but not as much as the indic of develop countri market   there appear to have been more discrimin among emerg market and between emerg and develop market   unlik the calm prevail in the foreign exchang market and despit the recoveri of stock price  impli volatil  at least as measur by the vix in the bottom panel  has gone sideway at between    and    percent sinc the last meet  but it is still somewhat elev relat to histor pattern  as shown on page five  spread relationship in fix incom market tell a similar stori   spread continu to widen on higher risk asset  such as debt of emerg market  as seen in the top panel   the high yield spread has stay relat flat sinc the last meet  but it has also remain at elev level despit the ralli in equiti market   in contrast  spread have actual narrow for better qualiti oblig  such as agenc and swap  interest  the rise tide did not lift all boat in the invest grade corpor sector   the spread in a  corpor issu widen slight   but even there  one need to consid that absolut yield for a  paper declin modest  moreov  the market absorb a massiv amount of suppli  includ that come from sever issuer who were refinanc matur commerci paper and will to pay the premium spread in order to get the deal done   final  at the short end  the impli volatil on near term eurodollar contract has again been rise recent  point to some linger uncertainti at the short end            turn back to the govern yield curv  the top panel of page six depict the benchmark on the run issu in yield term along with the target fed fund rate sinc august  st   until the middl of last week the pattern of recent month persist  with gradual fall yield  especi at the short end  and therebi a steepen of the yield curv   the treasuri   s refund announc last wednesday  which includ plan to revis the buyback program and to suspend issuanc of the    year bond  surpris the market in it  e and for that matter also surpris the treasuri in the extent of the market reaction  yield fell sharpli on wednesday and thursday as trader rush to close out short posit in their trade  wherebi they had been long the   year note or similar durat paper and short the    year bond   by this morn the long bond yield was at      percent or almost    basi point lower than the close yield on the day befor the treasuri   s announc  the bottom panel depict yield curv for a  industri corpor bond  fanni mae  swap  and treasuri as of septemb   th and as of novemb  nd   in general  the pattern observ in the treasuri yield curv has spill over to the other curv as well   sinc septemb   th  interest rate are general lower and yield curv are steeper  move to the commerci paper market  the theme there is that the year end has come earli to that market   the top left panel graph the spread between    day a  p  rate paper and a  p  around year end for three recent year   the         period  in blue  was typic of mani year until veri recent   the black line depict last year   s sharpli widen spread and the red line repres the current spread  the top right panel show the same set of relationship for    day paper   the trend are similar  though last year   s widen began later and the size of the widen probabl was influenc by the sudden with which the california util had difficulti roll over their commerci paper   this year   s widen began soon after the event of septemb   th   the downgrad of sever corpor has report made some manag unwil to hold a  p  paper at year end for window dress reason  but mani other fund manag have becom unwil to hold ani a  p  paper under ani circumst   the wider spread have been necessari to draw in new buyer  such as european institut  to pick up the slack   still  the a  p  sector has contract by near    percent this year in term of the amount outstand  the bottom panel show the spread of    day a  p  commerci paper to   month treasuri bill on the left and a  p  paper relat to   month treasuri bill on the right   these two graph indic that the widen of the a  p  spread  at least so far  is strict a matter of deterior in the a  p  sector   of note is how well the a  p  sector is hold up  with issuer abl to sell paper at a cost of onli    basi point or so more than treasuri            final  the last page depict the relationship between the rate for general collater  gc  in the repo market  the so call    special rate    for on the run secur  and the incid of fail to deliv   the top panel graph the gc rate in blue and the   year special rate  that is  the rate to financ the on  the run   year secur  in     the gray bar at the bottom repres the volum of fail report by primari dealer for that secur   the interest rate are all daili  while the volum of fail is collect week  the number repres the volum of fail on the report date  the bottom panel has the same set of inform for the    year note  the special rate can be volatil from day to day  as dealer financ need chang   the upper boundari is the gc rate  which rough tend to track the fed fund rate   the lower boundari is zero   when a secur is veri scarc  the cost of financ that secur can fall to or near zero   but if dealer who are short the issu cannot borrow the paper  a fail will result   more cynic  a dealer can go short the issu and not deliv  know that with the special rate so low there is almost no financi penalti to the fail  while the fail situat in the aftermath of septemb   th garner a lot of attent and was extraordinari in it size  secur at  e do go on special for extend period of  e  so a spike in the volum of fail is not tha unusu   for exampl  as seen in the bottom panel  in may of      the scarciti of the    year issu led to a surg of fail until the may refund was complet  i want to make two point here   first  as short term rate have com down  the gc rate has come down as well   second  the amount of elbowroo for the special market to move around has decreas   the rate  sn   t have to move veri far from the gc rate to get to zero and creat a situat that can lead to a rise in fail   thus  even without futur incid of the kind seen on septemb   th  in a low interest rate environ there is the risk of more instanc where fail accumul  at least for short period of  e  mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper in the intermeet period   the temporari swap facil with the ecb and the bank of england both expir without be renew in mid octob  and the amount of the swap facil with the bank of canada revert to it normal size  i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper  and i   d be happi to take ani question
will the emerg of fail in the order of magnitud we   ve been see late impair the market structur in ani ongo way that should concern us
i don   t think so   the cash market continu to function normal   there did not seem to be a spillov into the cash market   that might have occur if the on the run off the run spread had widen  but we did not see that   the problem remain a back offic problem that did not spill over into the front offic   of cours  there is the risk that that might happen at some point but thus far it has been contain to the back offic
yet the treasuri reopen the    year due to obvious concern about
that   s right
what was the treasuri worri about other than fail   on the face of it  fail seem to be a disrupt to the normal market process   if fail are benign  whi   anybodi realli care all that much
i think it   s the risk that i mention  that if the back offic get clog up  then it affect how the trader behav
has that ever happen
i can   t think of an instanc when it has   in      we had a differ situat where liquid was an issu  and on the run off the run spread widen then   but i can   t think of an instanc where we had that kind of spillov problem becaus of fail   again  that was a risk that the treasuri was contend with  and i think it is the reason they made the decis that they did
histor  mr  chairman  the treasuri has been concern that an environ in which investor are not sure they actual will receiv the secur they purchas may turn off some investor   as dino point out  dure the  e the fail were occur some foreign central bank were not make their secur avail in the market becaus they were on the receiv end of fail too   they   d lend the secur out but weren   t get them back   so they           decid not to particip in the market becaus they in particular like the order receipt of their secur   i think the treasuri   s argument is that if fail continu for a protract period  then at the margin at least some investor will pare back their particip in the treasuri market
i was slight distract  dino  when you were explain whi it is that the japanes bank are will to take the lower yield   year swap rather than jgbs   did you say it was for tax reason
there   s a preferenti account treatment for swap relat to jgbs  the latter go on their balanc sheet
you mean in term of their capit
in part i think for reason relat to capit   also  a bank may be influenc by not want to balloon it balanc sheet  which is publish   the japanes account author are look at chang that preferenti treatment becaus the japanes bank are use it as a loophol   the swap is design to be what they call a macro hedg  that is  it is design to hedg asset  and it can be exclud from the balanc sheet   howev  as the japanes account author see it  the bank are use these swap to hedg liabil  which more or less turn the intent of the rule on it head   so the account author have been look at this and think about whether to close that loophol   there is some pressur on them to continu to keep that loophol open  and i think the bank are wait to see how the japanes account bodi will rule
i   d like to add a comment   howev the account author rule  the situat is clear one in which the japanes bank are take a massiv interest rate risk at a  e when they have enough risk in the portfolio   and this practic involv an addit risk that they should not be take   wear my basel committe hat  i have been tri to bring that to their attent with absolut no posit result
ani negat result
no  they just continu to ignor that risk  essenti  anyth that will produc some addit earn  howev great the risk  is a risk that the bank are will to take   and as dino point out veri well  if the japanes govern has to start issu more govern bond in order to bail out the bank system  whatev is accomplish by put in addit capit could easili be revers by the hit the bank will take on the interest rate risk
in look at a whole rang of spread  on the run  off the run  bid ask spread  and risk spread on differ kind of paper  could you character the state of the market in recent day  relat to  let   s say  just befor the terrorist attack
well  in term of how the market are function  i think they are function fine   in term of how market particip are discrimin among risk  i would have no reason to second guess the assess they are make   they seem to be put in a greater risk premium on high yield asset and on debt of emerg market   so  to the extent that they are view the econom outlook as be weaker than had been the case  they are put in a higher risk premium to those kind of asset  which seem to be ration
right   but the spread that would indic how the market itself is function  such as bid ask spread  are back pretti much to where they were
i don   t recal that there has been ani meaning widen of bid ask spread in the fix incom market   and the on the run off the run spread has not move veri much   so those indic are not point to problem with the function of the market
further comment or question   mr  vice chair  would you make your usual motion
i move approv of the domest oper
without object  they are approv   we now move on to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   in my remark at the last meet  i said that if we were press to net the various risk to our project of real activ  we saw greater downsid risk in the near term and greater upsid risk further out   the data we have receiv over the past month seem to have support that view   we are now show a much sharper contract in real gdp into earli next year than was incorpor in our previous project  but  by the spring  we anticip a stronger recoveri   part on the thought that the more pronounc near term weak in the economi will spur addit action by congress  we have built a more s ul fiscal polici into this project   that ad s ulus  along with stronger equiti price and a slight lower assum feder fund rate  underli the upward adjust to our longer term forecast  so  how weak is the economi like to be over the near term   as we note in the  book supplement on friday  the octob labor market report led us to mark down further the project contract in real gdp in the curren quarter from about       percent at an annual rate to   percent   and with output and incom weaker now  there will like be some spillov in the form of further declin in demand earli next year  lead us to revis down our first quarter drop in real gdp to about     percentag point  even befor receiv the octob employ figur  we had been impress by the except weak of the manufactur sector  sharp inventori liquid appear to be continu this quarter  and the contract in capit spend is intensifi   moreov  report have suggest that the servic sector is soften notic  the concern rais by those develop were certain reinforc by last friday   s employ report   privat payrol employ drop near         last month  aggreg product worker hour fell     percent  and the unemploy rate rose     percentag point to     percent  all weaker read than we had expect   to be sure  some of our miss on employ was in industri that have been direct affect by the event of septemb     for exampl  airlin  travel  and hospit   we had cutback in these area spread out over the next few month  and we may have just gotten those cut sooner than we had anticip   but the declin were deep enough and widespread            enough to make us reluct to offset ani of that larger drop in come month  the bottom line is that we see the labor market report as signal a greater near term contract in activ  that certain seem to be the case in the manufactur sector  where the sharp drop in factori hour and the reduct in temporari help job  mani of which are suppli to the good produc sector  indic that the rate of declin in industri product is steepen this quarter   octob ip could be off around       percent for the month  set up a possibl doubl digit annual rate of declin for the fourth quarter  those cutback in product are in larg part a reflect of the ongo effort of busi to pare inventori   as a result of those action  as well as the surg in auto sale  we are project a substanti inventori liquid of     billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter   still  not much progress has yet been evid in reduc inventori sale ratio  the reason  of cours  has been that final demand also has been weaken  especi the demand for invest good   the falloff in new order for capit equip in septemb was stun   as with all of the statist report for septemb  there may be less signal than usual in these data   but it is difficult for us to see how these read could be point to anyth other than a veri steep drop in equip spend in come month  inde  the revis that we have made to invest spend account for a larg fraction of the downward adjust to our current quarter forecast  as you know  we incorpor a substanti hit to busi and consum confid in our septemb project  a featur that we have maintain in this forecast   thus far  we feel quit comfort with that assumpt for the busi sector   the cutback in employ  product  and capit spend have been swift and sizabl   and our busi contact  who have been gloomi most of the year  have turn decid more so this fall  howev  i think it would be fair to say that there is still a larg question mark about our assumpt of a consider sustain deterior of consum confid   to begin with the obvious  at the same  e that payrol were be slash by more than at ani  e in the past twenti year  sale of new motor vehicl soar to near record level   in our view  that surg has been induc by temporari incent  and a payback is in store late this year and earli next year  an outlook that larg appear to be share by the automak   but these develop could give one paus about our stori  moreov  while we have seen signific deterior in measur of consum sen ent  the declin have not been as larg as we had been expect   for now  we are stick with our assumpt that recent event have shaken consum confid and that there will be an unusu degre of restraint            on household spend over the next few quarter   but that outcom is far from a sure bet  we have now come to that familiar part of my present  where i recit for you the catech of recoveri   it should sound familiar becaus neither the question nor the answer have chang all that much sinc last march   what end this period of pronounc weak and what will restor the economi to a more vigor growth track   if it   s ani comfort to you  i did have our crack research staff examin the histor record  and they confirm for me that there have been no instanc  at least in the unit state  of recess that never end    laughter   so  i am reason confid that  with your indulg  if we stick with this stori long enough  it should eventu come to pass   howev  when is anoth matter   in our view  the basic element appear to be in place for an upturn in activ by the spring  the inventori liquid will end  and even it abat will provid support to product and incom  in our project  the runoff proceed throughout much of next year  but it becom a progress smaller drag on real output   much the same can be said for the capit spend adjust   we do not expect an upturn in spend befor the second half of       but the signific negat from this sector diminish as busi better align actual and desir capit stock and as sale prospect begin to improv  the risk to this aspect of our project remain consider   as we note in our report to the committe in june  econometr model of invest spend leav a great deal to be desir   consequ  it is difficult to use these equat with confid to gaug where we are in the adjust process   we do  howev  have pretti good compani here   the busi that purchas and produc capit good have fail to forese the extent of the weak in capit spend that has emerg this year   if excess op  lift capit spend abov the fundament in recent year  it seem possibl for excess pessim to depress spend below the fundament for a  e  we have built a bit of that effect into our forecast through an assum weaken of busi confid  but the retrench in spend could continu to be more pronounc and more persist than we have allow for  while the risk remain larg  our best guess is that the inventori and invest adjust will larg play out over the first half of next year  and will do so in an environ that receiv consider support from macroeconom polici   by our es   the real feder fund rate is notic below it equilibrium valu  suggest to us that monetari polici is calibr to produc abov trend growth onc the transitori drag on spend wane  fiscal polici  too  is an import part of the stori   we have substanti increas the size of the fiscal s ulus packag assum in our            forecast  and that ad s ulus show through to the top line of our project  two salient question are   will it happen  and will it be as potent as we are anticip   i recogn that read the newspap in recent week might rais serious doubt about the likelihood of pass a sizabl s ulus packag  and gridlock is certain within the realm of possibl   but  we believ that  with the full dimens of the downturn becom increas appar  effort will resum to reach a compromis  the precis composit of ani packag is veri uncertain  and we make no claim of special insight into how the polit process will unfold   we took a stab by combin element that have appear palat to both side in the debat   we assum anoth round of tax rebat will be paid in the first quarter to those that did not fulli particip in the last round   we built in addit spend for extend unemploy insur and increas subsidi for health insur for the unemploy   we also are assum increas spend for infrastructur and secur   final  we incorpor a three year temporari tax incent for invest that allow an immedi    percent expens of qualifi equip and softwar expenditur  this is the provis incorpor in the hous s ulus bill  all told  our revis fiscal packag add near a percentag point to growth of real gdp in      and about     percentag point to growth in       tax rebat are paid out earli next year and are assum to be larg spent in the first half   by the middl of       we expect the expens provis to provid an appreci lift to equip spend   as we note in the  book  becaus the provis is temporari  we expect the effect on invest outlay to be larger than if it were perman   one reason is that the budgetari cost is lower  and there should be less offset through higher interest rate   moreov  the temporari natur of the incent will caus busi to pull forward purchas that would have been made after the provis   s expir  we have heard the argument that invest incent  such as the one we have incorpor into the project  will not be effect in a period when the demand for capit good has been so weak   quit frank  we do not find this argument veri convinc   to be sure  for some firm  tax incent will not forestal further cut in their capit budget   but even with the steep declin that have occur in capit spend over the past year  busi have still purchas near    trillion of equip   so there must be mani firm that are on the margin for some categori of capit outlay and for which the expens provis will induc addit spend  there are  howev  plenti of other good reason for second guess the staff forecast on this issu   in build the effect of the tax provis into our forecast of e s spend  we have assum onli a mute effect in the first half of next year   in our view  there will be onli a small penalti to be paid for            wait to take advantag of the provis until a bit more clariti develop in the econom outlook   in our forecast  clearer sign of improv should be appar by next spring  at which point we project the s ulus from the expens provis to mount   this  e was larg a judgment call  and either a quicker or a more delay respons seem possibl  one small side effect of demand s ulus that occur through an invest incent  such as is incorpor in this forecast  is that it rais capit deepen and product growth for a  e  with consequ for the inflat outlook   along with a somewhat higher project valu of the dollar  these posit suppli influenc offset a slight lower path for the unemploy rate  leav measur of core price inflat on a modest but more notic downtrend by       in sum  the risk surround our econom forecast remain wide  but  in our view  are two side   rise equiti price  a steep yield curv  and soar motor vehicl sale might be point to a fundament sounder econom outlook than we present in the  book   on the other hand  last friday   s employ data cap a long string of veri weak report on the economi and could be signal that busi are prepar to act aggress to cut product and shed worker   in these circumst  household will be vulner to a bout of deepen pessim and signific spend restraint in come month  on that cheeri thought  i   ll turn you over to    son
we revis down our forecast for growth of real output abroad onc again in this  book   in part  we were react to the inform receiv over the intermeet period about product and spend in foreign economi   in part  we were recogn that more pronounc weak in the u s  economi in the veri near term impli more of the same for mani of our trade partner   we now es  that real gdp contract at an annual rate of

thank you  mr  chairman   i have a question for     you mention in your comment the possibl of weaker household spend and  of cours  that was one of the altern scenario that you had in the  book as well   the  book analysi indic that under this altern scenario household would react more advers than you anticip in the baselin forecast   i was wonder if you could elabor on what you   re anticip in that case  particular in term of extern shock such as terrorist attack and anthrax scare that are so import to household spend and consum confid   could you provid some more detail about what you are assum in each of these altern
certain   in our baselin forecast  we have assum a signific hit to consum confid  one that is by our es  suffici to subtract rough     of a percentag point from real gdp growth in        so in the baselin scenario we are alreadi expect some addit weak  an exogen hit  beyond the weaken in consum confid one would expect as the economi weaken   we have that also influenc busi spend in way that we tri to calibr  a spillov effect to other form of spend as in other period when there have been outsiz movement in consum confid  in our altern simul  version one remov that consum confid effect from the forecast so that you can get a sens of what it impli   in essenc the stronger growth in that simul is suffici with unchang polici to bring the unemploy rate back down to   percent or so by the end of the forecast horizon  the second version  which is the even more pessimist version  assum a further percentag point rise in the person save rate  again  an exogen further chang  and again with consequ and fallout for the rest of the economi   that produc a much weaker economi and a            much higher unemploy rate   in that scenario  with an unchang polici the unemploy rate move up to       percent by the end of the forecast horizon  i think there are two import and relat risk in this project   one  in the baselin project  we have some weak in consum confid but we don   t realli have a complet collaps in the consum sector   and with some turnaround in activ by the middl of next year  we get through this period of econom weak without a realli larg declin in gdp   one of the risk we   ve been highlight for some  e is that we   re not high confid that consum will be abl to withstand the kind of weak we are current project in the near term   that could obvious lead to a bigger fall in confid that will feed back on the economi with fallout that extend into late      and into        as i note in my remark  certain the data that we have receiv sinc the last  book haven t been especi weak for the consum side   yes  we did see a veri signific drop in retail sale in septemb and we expect some of that to be offset   but even that drop in sale and the declin we   ve seen in consum confid have not been so larg as to make us think that we are alreadi in the process of a confid contract   whatev one make of    million unit of motor vehicl sale  and as i said  we have pretti much written that off as a signal of stronger consum spend  it   at least pose in our mind some question about whether we have that stori right   i think we will begin to see in the next coupl of month whether our forecast is correct   a signific payback in the auto sector will confirm our view that there is go to be weak in consum spend   but right now that   s still a forecast
in your    weaker household spend    altern  as you look forward do you envis a more or less stabl environ in term of the terrorist threat that we   re face
that   s a veri good point   the answer is more stabl   we have not built in escal terrorist activ in the unit state that would either signific affect            consum confid or add signific further to busi cost   i wouldn   t even know how to begin to produc such a forecast   but certain there are some signific risk   just as anthrax has been a concern in the past month  it could be smallpox the next month and someth even wors the follow month   i don   t think our forecast begin to captur the potenti consequ of that for consum and busi confid   nor   it captur the hit we might take to the product and busi cost structur
i just want to probe a bit more on the impact you project from the assum passag of legisl regard a partial expens provis   if you   re right in your project  that won   t make much of an impact until we get to the second quarter of        but from then on the effect is fair signific   the analysi seem solid  but in an environ where we have so much excess capac and a great deal of pessim  intuit it   s a littl hard for me to connect to it   could you elabor a littl on that   in particular  i wonder if you look at this at all from a disaggreg standpoint   in other word  i   m ask what particular industri might react strong to this provis if it is pass
we certain did look at it at a disaggreg level   perhap my colleagu       can talk about the under theori of how we embed this in the forecast in term of it potenti implic for differ kind of capit spend  in particular on shorter live versus longer live asset   obvious this provis has a larger effect on the cost of capit for longer live asset than for shorter live asset   if you consid  for exampl  the comput area where price are declin by    percent a year  the advantag of the expens provis may not be quit so signific in term of move up ani spend   so  we have look            at it by industri but we certain haven   t gone through a veri detail disaggreg analysi   but mayb   want to talk a littl about how we actual work with the model that we use to incorpor this effect
there   s not a lot to go on   we don   t have clean  histor experi  we have some eleg theori and some consensus paramet   we attempt to calibr simul model to valu that we think are sensibl and that in other circumst produc reason result   but histori is not replet with temporari invest tax incent of the kind that we   re simul here   and congress is not notori for follow through in everi respect with the specif of it origin announc   so one possibl risk that could attenu the effect of the invest incent is that  contrari to our assumpt in the  book  busi may doubt that in fact the incent will be allow to expir at the end of the three year period   in that case the provis wouldn   t spur as much invest as we had assum will take place   that said  there is econometr evid that at least help us to narrow the rang of uncertainti a bit   we have a view about the long run elast of the capit stock with respect to the cost of capit   we have some evid on speed of adjust   we tri to piec togeth those bit of evid use a simul model to get a handl on how big an effect the propos legisl might have
dave  one of your comment in your present surpris me a littl  and that was the link that you describ between capit deepen  product  and inflat   you emphas the implic of a temporari invest incent that rais invest  spur addit capit deepen  and lead in a sens to a posit suppli shock   in the  book  though  it seem to me your emphasi was that on balanc we face a negat suppli shock becaus            of a signific slow in structur product growth that is expect to occur for a coupl of reason  includ a slowdown from an unsustain pace of technolog spend and also the realloc of resourc to secur enhanc
i should have been clearer about that   my remark in the brief was realli refer to the revis that we have made in the forecast  which involv a downward revis in our price forecast at the same  e that we   re show a lower unemploy rate   a piec of that stori was the slight fa  capit deepen in      that has been s ul by the fa  invest in late      and        you   re absolut right   as we note in the  book  you could look at the veri sharp deceler that we are project in wage inflat and  if you were so inclin  wonder whi that is not show through more forc into our price inflat forecast   the reason is that even with the improv in structur product that we expect to see by       the gain are still well below where they had been earlier   and we see this on net as a factor limit the extent of the disinfl that we are like to see over the next two year as busi respond to that and attempt to rebuild margin that have becom compress signific in the last year or so
just to follow up on that  the slowdown in structur product growth is realli quit signific into      in particular   we becam somewhat familiar with the complic dynam of how that play out on demand as well as inflat when we had an acceler in structur product  so this is perhap a factor that we should weigh in our real forecast as well
i agre with that   we   re not show veri much disinfl in the cours of      in part becaus of the unwind of the posit product shock that we saw on the other side
dave  i have a question and also a comment about the forecast   in look at the sourc of weak in the short term  a larg portion of it come from residenti invest  it strike me that there certain are some posit fundament in this area   in septemb  for exampl  start continu to increas   moreov  the financi fundament in hous are still quit good and the falloff in permit was actual quit small   i can see that the negat effect of higher unemploy rate and the impact on confid might be play a role  but whi   that seem to have so much of a role in the residenti sector and  in my view  not much of a role in person consumpt expenditur   i ask becaus in your forecast person consumpt expenditur in the current quarter and even in the subsequ quarter aren   t all that weak
i   d note a coupl of point   one is that our project falloff in singl famili start is not dramat  it   s certain not dramat if one thought we were wit a typic recess
eight tenth of a percentag point of the declin in real gdp this quarter is due to residenti invest  and that   s a small sector
we believ our start forecast is reason align with the declin in permit that we saw and with what we think will be some depress effect from the weaken in incom growth   and we built in some addit weak becaus of the assumpt we   ve made about consum sen ent   so that is one of the place where the confid effect show up   we also note that homebuild have report a notic falloff in both traffic and home sale recent   again  none of this is suggest of a major weaken in that sector  by my view what we built in is actual fair mild   certain the percentag chang at an annual rate look fair larg becaus  as you note  it is a relat small sector   but that would be one of the upsid risk that i think we were talk about in term of how thing have held up in the household sector   i think one            would have to say that hous also is an area where we have not seen the extent of weak one might have anticip   so that would be a part of the upsid risk that we see associ with our assumpt about extra weak in the household sector come from confid effect
do you know if there is anyth special in the adjust that goe from start to valu put in place that would be involv in this chang
well  there is a bit in the residenti invest forecast becaus the falloff in construct put in place has been greater for home at the high end than at the low end   so the cost per start has been fall as well and that certain add to that weak
i think that   s an issu
but we do still have a falloff in singl famili home start in the quarter to     million unit   that is a notic drop
i also have a comment about the partial expens invest tax incent   given that the propos is for a three year period  and recogn some of the point al broaddus made  that the capac util rate is so low and that the current econom situat is so poor and like to remain so for a while  whi wouldn   t the result invest be back load more   the lead  e need for much of the equip are short   i don   t know how you made the decis about how to spread out the invest  but as an altern i think you clear could have spread it in a way that is much more back load than you did
we certain could have and we debat that   in the end  as i note  more judgment than scienc was appli to how we spread it out   i would sound one note of caution about assum that a provis like this won   t be import by the middl of next year   when the economi start to improv  there is a fair amount of tinder that can be accumul in term of s ulus from both feder tax and spend provis  from monetari polici  and so forth   while            we   re sit here now in the midst of a signific contract in output  it   s obvious difficult to envis whi busi would be veri excit about use an expens provis   but come on the heel of a year and a half of signific contract in capit spend  there could be a rush to take advantag of this incent as sale prospect begin to improv   i wouldn   t rule out even an upsid risk to how we built this in  i think there are risk on both side   firm may wait until they are absolut certain that the economi is on a path of trend or abov trend growth befor they are induc by this provis to rais spend   on the other hand  there could be some reason as well for them to want to take advantag of it earli on  especi while price in the capit good market are on the low side   i can   t say that we offer much scienc here and  as i indic  this is an area where we feel quit comfort with your second guess us   but i think you could second guess us in either direct
there   s also the risk that the provis will be not for three year but for one or two year
anoth risk  too  is that the provis could be smaller than now anticip   this is not a veri larg temporari invest incent   if the window were made shorter  we might see a more immedi effect   or if the amount that can be expens were less  along the line of the    or    percent peopl have talk about as a compromis  the effect could be even more mute than we have in this forecast   so there is a lot of uncertainti   in the end we felt uncomfort come to you with a baselin project that complet ignor what we thought were cumul sign of addit fiscal s ulus   we had a veri modest amount of fiscal s ulus in our last project and our best guess of the mode is more along the line of what we   re show now   but as i indic  it   s certain possibl that gridlock will reassert itself and noth will happen
have we gotten ani greater visibl about what is like to happen in term of congression action on this
all i know is what i read in the newspap  and that has not been terribl encourag   yet this would be the  e when we might in fact not expect to hear much encourag news  as parti on both side posit themselv for the hard negoti that  at least in our view  will probabl need to take place in the next month or so
i   d like to underscor two point that dave made earlier   first  what we have built into the  book project is not a straight read of our model simul   we did veri substanti push back the invest respons to the tax incent precis on the theori that busi might plausibl respond to the heighten climat of uncertainti over the next coupl of quarter by opt to wait   they might well decid in the context of a three year incent  if it   last that long  that there   s veri littl penalti to wait until some of that uncertainti is resolv  second  we observ from the experi with auto sale in octob that at least in a differ context econom actor do respond quit vigor and quick to someth that is seen as a temporari sale on a larg capit item  name motor vehicl in this case   it   s conceiv that busi may respond in a similar way
that incent is for a period of month versus three year
i will grant that the durat make a big differ
presid  n
i   ve been think about what we might see in some of the data that will be publish over the near term  in particular payrol employ and the impact of season factor   i assum  other thing equal  that the season anticip an increas in employ in decemb and            probabl in novemb  although i   m not sure  and then some runoff in the first part of next year   is that right
yes  and i think even in octob we reach the front edg of a pickup in season hire   obvious that seem less like and is part of the reason whi we would expect ongo substanti weak in the employ data
right   so even if we don   t get further substanti employ reduct  the season adjust number are like to look fair lousi
yes   we are expect payrol employ to continu to contract at more than         a month over the next few month and to contract rather sharpli in the first quarter of next year as well
okay  thank you
i have a question about the interpret of interest rate develop   in the pre fomc brief you mention the common view in the marketplac that the budget deficit had someth to do with the behavior of longer term interest rate   it wasn   t clear what your own view on that was   i was interest in chart   in ye day   s board brief where you plot the impli one year forward rate  which current are not that differ five year out from those that prevail on januari  nd  let   s say   i would have expect the budget argument to make a big differ  to see more effect on interest rate  say  five year out and beyond the current cyclic situat   yet those curv are not that dissimilar   in fact  the longer end is actual lower now  which is not consist with the argument involv the eros of the budget surplus    would you  offer your own view on that
sure   i   d say two thing   one  we do think that the longer run budget outlook and the accompani fiscal polici that underli that outlook have been factor influenc long term interest rate   when i look at that impli one year forward rate  it current is show those rate rise abov level that were prevail in januari  though you   re right  not by a huge amount   howev  the other news that we have receiv sinc januari  this enorm contract in capit spend  would have been a factor work to depress the view about where equilibrium real interest rate might be go in that period   so  in our view  we have seen some effect of the fiscal polici on the structur of interest rate and that certain is a factor in interpret what has happen   it   s quit clear in our model  and we think there   s some reason sound econom theori for this view  that equilibrium long term real interest rate would be relat to the long run thrust of fiscal polici   so that   s our interpret
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid parri

otherwis dismal behavior look a littl better   their take on the prospect for substanti fiscal s ulus was equal downbeat  they view the current situat in washington as polit gridlock and didn   t expect anyth like the near term fiscal s ulus shown in the  book   monetari polici seem to them to hold out the onli hope   but they also seem to believ that lower interest rate could do onli so much

england   s economi has declin recent  like at a sharper pace than that for the nation   in part this is becaus the slowdown in the region occur later than that in the countri as a whole and our area is to some extent play catch up  but it also reflect the grow impact of a fall off in high tech equip and softwar spend  both consum and busi confid about the current economi are off substanti  and non manufactur respond to recent busi survey are now see sale declin and have join manufactur in a negat overal assess of busi condit   initi claim for unemploy insur rose sharpli  and help want

question now            focus on how deep and how long the turndown will be and what appropri further polici action should be taken  we see a similar trajectori in near term econom activ as the  book

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in our district appear to have declin further in octob  but perhap a bit more moder than in the week immedi after the septemb    attack   that part reflect the pattern of retail sale  which drop less sharpli in octob than in septemb  due main to strong car sale in our region  as elsewher in the countri  in respons to the zero percent financ packag  a coupl of week ago jerri jordan  who appar has been spi in my district  told me he had heard that a larg annual boat show in annapoli had surpris strong result   we check it out  jerri  and you were right   sale were quit robust   but the reason given was that peopl want to enjoy themselv while they still can    laughter   i don   t know whether that   s a good signal or a bad signal  mani of the retail we talk to over the last coupl of week in an attempt to get some sens of how they are approach the holiday season  indic that they are quit nervous about it and accord are build holiday inventori veri cautious   elsewher in the district  residenti home sale and construct are still grow  but much more slowli than a year or so ago   we no longer see the sign of a possibl bottom in manufactur activ that we thought            we might be see right befor the terrorist attack   in sum  with unemploy rise  both household and busi firm in our region are general nervous  and i would describ mani of them as hunker down  turn to the nation outlook  in short i think it   s problemat   the staff  as we know  has mark down fourth quarter real gdp growth to minus   percent at an annual rate   and they see it remain negat until the spring   on the face of it  one could see that as a pessimist forecast  but in my view  as a number of other peopl have suggest  a strong case can be made that under the circumst it is an op ist forecast with a consider amount of downsid risk   i say that for three reason   first  the  book is project a loss of payrol employ of about three quarter of a million job in the fourth quarter   of cours  we got more than half of that in octob so the staff may alreadi have revis that quarter number  though i haven   t seen it   in ani case  we could get signific greater job loss in this quarter   second  the  book still project that the unemploy rate will peak at around   percent or perhap a littl higher   that would be a cumul increas from the low point of a littl more than   percentag point   but in four of the five recess sinc      the cumul increas in the unemploy rate has been somewher between   and   percentag point   onli in the unusu brief and quit atyp      recess was the cumul rise limit to onli about   percentag point   base on past experi  i think it   s reason to expect that the       percentag point increas in unemploy that has alreadi occur will weaken household confid further  continu to depress spend growth  and caus still more job loss and so forth   third  the possibl of higher than project unemploy in and of itself is not the onli downsid risk in this situat   histor  rise unemploy in recess has been associ with disinfl   the  book is project some disinfl this  e around  of cours  but it is relat mild   the slower growth in project wage due to the            slack in the labor market is accompani by a slow in product growth  so the declin in unit labor cost is restrain by that   but the disinfl could be more pronounc than project   for the last sever decad  disinfl has been seen as a good thing and mani of us around this tabl have spent the better part of our fed career promot it   but it is a potenti problem today  my main point  and this has been allud to alreadi  is that in past recess the fed has had the leeway to cut the nomin fund rate to keep the real fund rate from rise as disinfl has run it cours through these period of weak   today  we have onli       percentag point of leeway left befor the nomin fund rate hit the zero bound   we will have to match ani further disinfl with nomin fund rate cut just to keep polici at the same place   but that   s go to eat up part of the leeway to cut the real fund rate  which we may need to do in order to counteract potenti serious weak in the economi  i have alway believ that price stabil is the goal of monetari polici   i still believ that   often in the past i   ve argu for polici action to preempt inflat as over  e  over a coupl of decad  we move the trend inflat rate down   that was realli the essenc of our anti inflationari strategi   and it has larg succeed   but in my view the risk to price stabil is differ today   what we need to do now is to preempt disinfl  as novel as it is to think in those term  and do so fair aggress to guard against the potenti problem of the zero bound i mention a minut ago   of cours  the core pce inflat rate  which is the measur i think most of us now focus on  is current about       percent   i think that   s pretti close to the inflat target we should be aim for at this stage  for the reason i just note   and i believ we should focus our short term polici action  as best we can  on prevent that particular measur of inflat from fall much below   percent

thank you  mr  chairman   as has been the case for some  e  the district economi is track close with the nation economi   there are some oas of strength but i don   t think they are particular repres  so i won   t spend a lot  e on them  overal labor market condit have eas and layoff and initi claim for unemploy compens are up   offic vacanc rate have begun to rise   that was certain anticip   vacanc rate for other commerci properti are also rise and apart vacanc rate are increas as well   the expect is that that will feed back on activ as project current under construct wind down   it has been a veri strong year for singl famili construct in the district but in that area  too  the outlook is less promis   sale  especi at the upper price end of the market  have slow and i anticip that the region will have a lot of troubl next year duplic the residenti construct perform of the previous two or three year  there has been some tighten in credit condit overal  but my impress from talk to a varieti of peopl is that decent qualiti credit can still be accommod on reason term   so i don   t sens a huge amount of tension or a problem there  by way of a few more specif anecdot  i talk to the leader of a coupl of nation retail   they describ their busi over the last four or five week as okay relat to reduc expect   one cite same store sale as run about   percent ahead of a year ago  that   s down  of cours  from what typic had been the case   but retail general seem to think that thing could have been wors  perhap signific wors   so that was their take on the situat  they also ad that the discount busi was do better than the full servic depart store busi  which is not particular a surpris  i talk to execut of a coupl of larg paper compani who also describ their busi as okay relat  of cours  to subdu expect   that has been a busi in which it            has been tough to make money for sever year   those execut were quit cautious about capit spend go forward and didn   t put a lot of weight on whatev program congress might gin up  but perhap that view is specif to their industri   final  i talk to an offici of a full servic financi servic firm who said that their sale of a wide varieti of invest product have been quit robust recent  as far as the nation economi is concern  i   m in general agreement with the contour of the  book forecast   i suspect that the contract in the current quarter may be a bit deeper than is project in the  book and it may take an extra quarter befor we see a recoveri some  next year   those are pretti much guess on my part   talk to busi peopl in the communiti  their view are along the same line   they expect busi condit to get wors befor they get better and that the recoveri will occur later rather than sooner   but have said that  we do know that the economi is veri resili even without the s ulus in place or in prospect  and  of cours  we do have a lot of monetari s ulus in place and it appear to me that more fiscal s ulus is like   this resili is someth that i think we need to bear in mind   it implic  to me anyway  is that we want to calibr polici veri care from here on out so that we give ourselv at least a chanc of wind up in the right place for a sustain period

negat job report make it clear that the economi is head toward what eventu will be defin as a recess  that   s realli a side issu   the key question for polici  as other have alreadi indic  is how sever it will be both in depth and durat   compar the current situat with histor experi suggest to me that there are reason to believ it will not be especi deep or prolong   first  as almost everyon has alreadi observ  monetari polici has eas steadili sinc the first of the year and is present accommod   second  signific govern and privat sector spend s ulus have been put in place with the recent tax cut  and more govern spend program are like   secur invest  rebuild  and insur payment flow are all            like to bol  spend   admit  these type of expenditur will not lead to product increas   i   m not especi worri about that becaus of the need to keep person incom move up in the near term until busi fix invest recov   while the ad spend will help  it is realli a form of stop gap incom mainten   third  while the economi receiv a major shock on septemb   th  the bank and financi sector are sound and have prove larg resili   our examin tell us that bank continu to lend prudent and that  while some deterior in loan portfolio has occur  the loss are not especi worrisom at this point  unlik the financi situat in most previous econom contract  it   s hard to argu that financi system weak and reduc credit avail have contribut or like will contribut signific to the declin in econom activ  monetari polici over the past year has done what it is suppos to do and arguabl virtual all of what it can do to shore up the current outlook   the more import polici question for the short term is fiscal polici  the impact of which will depend on how the feder tax and spend program are actual structur   sinc a further chang in monetari polici will have littl observ impact on q  perform  our focus should be on the project path of the economi over the next year and whether we believ that path is achiev   while the rang of profession forecast for the next two quarter is quit wide  those forecast are remark consist and quit op ist for the second half of       as is the  book   our experi with some of those model as well as with our own var model suggest that addit eas at this point is not like to provid ani meaning spend   in some way  it might even hinder the adjust process that still need to work it way out in mani sector of the economi   addit  the  book simul of altern monetari polici suggest that with slack demand and higher unemploy addit attempt to cushion the economi will ul  be associ with a            further uptick in inflat   moreov  to achiev ani of these path requir polici to be more nimbl than in the past  in term of rais the fund rate as the economi begin to recov  i must confess that it confus me at least a bit when al broaddus and bob   swap hat    laughter   nevertheless  my view today are probabl closest to those express by gari  n   while we continu to face consider uncertainti and downsid risk  i believ we have come to a point where further polici respons should be more measur   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the economi in the tenth district has not realli deterior sinc our last meet  but that   s not say much sinc it is consider weaker than it was befor the event of septemb   th   layoff announc have subsid somewhat but remain signific higher than befor the attack   the composit of the job cut be announc also has shift in the last month  with more now outsid the airlin  aircraft manufactur  and travel industri in our region   district manufactur remain in a slump but it   not appear signific weaker than last month   outsid of auto  consum spend has not recov from the initi fall after the attack and retail in mani area are veri much worri about the upcom holiday season   the convent and hotel busi has not return to normal either  due not onli to continu concern about safeti and travel delay but also to cost cut by busi under earn pressur   hous activ has slow in much of the district  especi in the high end sector and particular in kansa citi and denver   those citi are also be hit with slowdown associ with layoff in the high tech sector   these layoff also are increas concern about commerci real estat   we see a lot of subleas space empti out right now             and though realtor are prone to point out that it   s not near as bad as in the last recess  they are in fact worri  let me say a bit more on manufactur   preliminari result from our bank   s latest survey of manufactur show that product was about as weak in octob as it was in septemb  our firm are more pessimist about the futur than they were in the previous month   for exampl  the six month ahead product index was down about   point in the survey   among other forward look indic  the capit spend index fell about   more point and the inventori of raw materi index also declin   so  look forward  there is quit a bit of pessim in the manufactur sector  let me mention the energi industri   it has eas further sinc our last meet   the district   s rig count is now down about    percent from the decreas level in juli  as the steep fall in natur gas price sinc the winter has render some margin well unprofit   spot price have turn back  as you know  and we   re at about the      mcf level  which is a level that at least will sustain activ at about where it is now  in agricultur  price have drop in the cattl industri  as you know  part becaus of a drop off in restaur demand after the septemb   th attack but also becaus there is a larg inventori in the feed line   crop price also have been weak  although there   s reason for a littl more op  there with storag level not as high as they were a year ago   overal  busi condit in the district are general poor  turn to the nation economi  i would agre with those who say we are in a recess  as for the outlook  while our forecast differ in some way from the  book  i would say that in term of the outcom it   s a matter of degre  not substanc   in that context  though  i think it   s import to look at two  e frame   one is the immedi futur  that is  the fourth quarter  which            will be negat and will remain negat as we move toward the first quarter of next year   the other is the intermedi term  the first half of next year and into the second half  where the outlook is more op ist in both the  book and  as other have said  in forecast by privat economist as well   that   s due import to a veri s ul monetari polici  fiscal polici that is s ul and should be more s ul as we go forward  and to the fact that energi price have fallen signific  in term of polici  i think we need to be veri care  as we alway are  but our task is particular difficult now   in that context i   ll say just a coupl thing in summari   regardless of the fund rate  the fourth quarter will like be negat and there   s noth we can do about that today  with a signific amount of s ulus alreadi in play  the economi should recov in the first or second quarter of next year  and there   s probabl not a whole lot we can do about the  e of that recoveri at this stage   i would also point out that we tend to get veri nervous when we have taken action and we   re not see a turnaround  and i think we need to be veri care and patient in such period   so  i can   t help wonder if we shouldn   t paus  know the downsid risk are veri serious as we look to the futur  and watch event develop   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   overal under econom condit in our district have worsen somewhat sinc our meet five week ago   while there has been a slight rebound from the initi declin in activ we saw after septemb   th  the under trend still has a downward tilt and our contact acknowledg a good deal of pessim regard the rest of the year   the octob busi outlook survey gave us our first data on the district sinc septemb   th   prior to the attack  manufactur in our region appear to be stabil   that is no longer the case   the index of current activ took a sharp downturn in            octob  indic that manufactur activ continu to contract in the district and at a much fa  pace than in prior month   inde  the index is now at level we saw at the begin of the year   there was a strike consist across all the indic   new order  shipment  and employ indic all fell sharpli in octob   manufactur    capit spend plan remain weak  in our octob survey we ask some special question to tri to gaug the effect of the septemb   th attack   first  we ask each firm how the attack had affect their shipment and new order   half of the firm report that shipment were unaffect   but    percent report a decreas and    percent said it was a signific one   the result for new order were more troubl  sinc over    percent of the firm report a decreas in order  suggest that activ will continu to be weak in the come month   we also repeat a question from a previous month   s survey by ask firm when they expect to see a turnaround   the result indic that mani of the respond are put the rebound further out into the futur than they had in the past  there was some good news  howev  in that    percent of our respond still expect to see a turnaround befor the second half of next year  other econom indic for our district are weak   payrol employ in each of our three state declin in the third quarter and the unemploy rate increas   it will like go higher in subsequ month  given the current pace of layoff   retail sale in the district are run below last year   s pace   zero percent financ has boost motor vehicl sale in the region  as mani other have indic for their district  but dealer expect sale to declin later this year sinc the incent are pull sale forward as well as generat new sale   inde  dealer report to us that they are limit their order from the factori   retail sale of

this downturn  has eas somewhat   homebuild in the district general report steadi demand for new home  with some soften in demand for higher price hous   nonresidenti construct activ has begun to fall off  on the nation level  the event of septemb  th and their aftermath have signific weaken the near term outlook for the economi   even befor the attack  the economi was more sluggish than mani of us had forecast earlier in the year   the initi es  show a contract in gdp growth in the third quarter  which is not a surpris   and most forecast  includ our own  see a sharp contract in the fourth quarter   typic the longer run outlook is the least certain  but these day most economist feel more certain about the long run prospect for the economi than the medium term   assum no further shock  we see a pickup in activ next year  driven by the aggress monetari and fiscal s ulus   the difficulti  of cours  is determin when this pickup will occur and whether further monetari s ulus will help to ensur a better outcom  my outlook is similar to the  book   s  although rebound have been much stronger histor than the one we are now forecast   in addit  a philadelphia staff analysi suggest that forecast typic underpredict the respons of output growth to expansionari monetari polici   nonetheless  the incom data certain point to continu econom weak in the near term and one could easili argu that the current period repres a break with past histori   the octob napm survey  like our bank   s busi outlook survey  indic that manufactur will continu to struggl   labor market indic point to acceler job loss   the sizabl drop in consum confid suggest continu weak in consum spend   the surg in octob auto sale drew sale from the futur  so vehicl sale are like to fall in futur month             nevertheless  the auto sale data illustr the s ul effect of interest rate declin even in  e of increas uncertainti and uneas  so where   this all leav us   in respons to the devast event of septemb   th  the committe   s focus appropri turn to the immedi term and we act swift and signific   the fed fund rate is now     basi point lower than it was on septemb   th   two month have now pass sinc the attack   i certain do not want to underes  the amount of weak we are see in the economi and that we expect to see in the come month   i   m suffici unsur about the  e and strength of the forecast recoveri  even given the sizabl monetari s ulus alreadi appli to the economi  that i would support some further eas action  howev  it seem incumb upon us to begin to shift our focus back to the medium and longer term   in so do  we would acknowledg that a signific amount of monetari and fiscal polici s ulus has been appli to the economi   by almost everi measur  monetari polici is quit accommod and there is more fiscal s ulus on the way   focus on the medium and longer term would help us prepar the market and the public for the  e when the committe decid that further rate cut are not need   it would also shift some of the focus from monetari to fiscal polici   it would give us more flexibl go forward as we gather addit data on the economi   s current condit and it trajectori   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to comment on a few of the highlight from convers i   ve had with busi contact   the extent of the weak in the u s  economi and it impact on asia i think was well illustr by my up contact who said that his firm   s volum outbound from asia has been run onli one half of what up had anticip   of cours  that   s becaus expect were for a lot of high tech equip to be ship here and that            has not happen   the up outlook is that next year will be better than this year and they are anticip about a       percent growth in volum   volum this year is run about    percent below last year   up  along with mani other  is cut capit spend   the firm expect to reduc capit expenditur by      million out of a budget that would otherwis have been        billion  so the cutback is about    percent  my fedex contact said that in his discuss with custom their belief is that busi is go to be flat to the end of this year and on into        fedex see flat but not substanti weak from here   the firm find that sinc the end of septemb volum has been veri steadi and predict  though obvious not strong  my contact at j b  hunt  which is a veri larg truck firm  say that custom are rather pessimist   busi this octob was about flat compar with last octob  the compani had anticip growth of    to    percent   the market for use larg truck has collaps   my contact describ it as a disast and he is expect a lot of bankruptci in the truck industri  i would like to finish on a slight posit note in term of report from my contact  so i will mention that wal mart  as other have note  is do rather well   wal mart sale for the five week end octob  th  which includ the immedi and subsequ post attack period  were up     percent   the compani   s expect had been   to   percent  so total sale over that period were actual a bit stronger than had been anticip   moreov  wal mart is not cut it capit expenditur plan at all and in fact has revis up slight it forecast for next year from the expect held befor septemb   th  i want to make a comment on fiscal polici   the temporari invest incent that are be discuss are realli veri treacher   polici action are be consid and yet the best expert in the world don   t know how to forecast what the outcom is go to be   that say to me            that it   s a veri treacher polici instrument   there is a lot of experi with temporari invest credit of various sort over the year and i think the experi is not veri favor  sit where we are today it might look as if an invest credit is go to be a posit for the immedi futur  but i think it   s go to involv a high probabl of some greater difficulti later  if the economi were to rebound strong  we would see great effort to bring capit expenditur forward into the temporari window   that would make the economi even stronger   moreov  it would rais a lot of problem in interpret the incom data and tri to anticip how much fundament strength realli exist in the economi   if the economi remain weaker than anticip  we   re go to see propos to extend the temporari provis but we won   t know whether it will be extend or not   in my view  our histori of temporari fiscal polici adjust is not a good one and i think they are go to caus troubl rather than provid ani assist to the economi   that   s all i want to say at this point   thank you
okay   it is a littl after       a m   i understand that coffe is avail next door   let   s take a break but tri to be back in    minut
vice chair   coffe break
mr  chairman  the second district   s economi has deterior further sinc the last report  but it is veri unclear how much of the weaken can be tie to the terrorist attack and how much would have happen in ani event   widespread transport disrupt that develop immedi after the attack eas substanti in octob   that includ the subway servic to lower manhattan  which is now reason well restor   our big problem is get peopl from new jersey to lower manhattan   about    percent of the peopl who commut into lower manhattan come from new jersey and an averag commut             e that was an hour and a half is now two and a half hour   effort are under way to get more ferri and other rerout of the rail and subway line  but that continu to be a difficulti  busi most clear affect by the disast includ retail  hotel  and other travel  relat firm   retail note that sale in octob remain well below plan at manhattan store  that main reflect fewer tourist  especi intern tourist who spend substanti more than resid of new york or tourist from elsewher in the unit state   manhattan hotel experienc their worst septemb on record   busi report rebound moder in octob   the outer suburb and outer borough are pretti much back to busi as normal  the impact on the local labor market is not yet clear   an es         addit jobless claim  well abov trend  were file in new york and northern new jersey in the five week after the attack   commerci real estat market in manhattan and the suburb have not tighten as expect sinc the attack   what seem to be the case  despit the enorm loss of offic space  is that firm were hoard offic space dure the boom year and they have discov they can now give it up   citicorp  for exampl  had about         squar feet earmark for further expans that it was abl to make avail to lehman brother with realli no burden to itself   the further expans is now less like  so lehman brother won and citicorp won   in general the view seem to be that reloc  most firm are actual go to midtown manhattan  can be achiev without much addit build   that put an anoth question mark on    whither lower manhattan      in that regard i   ll mention an interest side note   last friday governor pataki declar  after a great deal of pressur from the busi communiti  includ our reserv bank  which in some way consid itself part of the busi communiti  that he was creat a corpor for the restructur of lower manhattan   the member of that group i believ will be name later this week   that   s a veri posit develop becaus there has been a real question            about who is in charg   the answer is that nobodi has been in charg and therefor the degre of uncertainti hover over ground zero as it   s now call and neighbor lower manhattan has been greater than it should have been  not surpris  becaus of the downturn in the financi servic industri  manhattan apart sale activ has been veri thin   it   s hard to gaug exact where the price are but they are probabl down    to    percent  with veri few deal actual take place   banker report weaker loan demand  tighter credit standard  and increas delinqu   the residenti mortgag segment appear to be fare relat well  on the nation level  we share the view about the general shape of recoveri that the  book describ and that dave   present so well   on the intern side  i   m inclin to believ that     s forecast is accur  but op ist  and that the downsid there is probabl even greater than it is domest  regard consum confid  the fact is that hous has held up rather well   and certain the pace of automobil sale in octob  at    million unit  indic that peopl want to buy car   it   s nice to have zero percent financ  but presum peopl don   t purchas an automobil even with no financ cost unless they want one in the first place   so i think there are indic that consum confid is hold up better than we might have anticip   how long it will hold up at this level is a veri big question  as mani of us have discuss  busi fix invest is abnorm low even for a recess   there may well be enough of it wait on the sidelin that fiscal polici direct at increas invest will work  but in my view there are some veri legi  question about whether that will be the case   in ani event  partisan polit are aliv and well   they did not go away except for a veri brief respit after            the   th of septemb   so i think there is a real question of when and if the fiscal polici that is be discuss will happen  we believ that the downsid risk is veri clear and quit dismal   that is a view that is share fulli by the member of our board of director and by those on our small busi and agricultur advisori committe   it is also the view of everybodi that i and my colleagu at the new york bank talk to in tri to ascertain what is happen in our district as well as nation and intern   so i believ our forecast is the best forecast that can be made under the circumst but it is one where the downsid risk is veri clear and the role of monetari polici continu to be a vital import one   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   listen to everyon who has spoken so far lead me to feel that it   s not much easier today than it was five week ago to know what to make of either the econom report or the anecdot inform avail to us   i come to each of these meet hope there will be less uncertainti than the last  e  and last  e was uncertain enough  but that  sn   t seem to have been the case today base on our go around  about     year ago a clever economist made a reput for himself by talk about the unseen versus the seen   he had a lot of fun talk about those thing that were not so obvious  but rather import to think about   of cours  that concept wasn   t new with him   it was in the work of copernicus and ptolemi also   nevertheless  what peopl are not do at all or are do less of is not news to ani of us   howev  what they are do instead  if we can find out what it is   is of interest and might give us some clue   for instanc  base on a lead from one of our director we found that ticket sale for the ringl brother barnum and bailey circus in the last two week of octob at cleveland   s gund arena were    percent higher than a year ago   so appar peopl            are do someth for the famili  which seem to be consist with other thing we   ve heard   in fact  both a member of our advisori council and one of our director report that the composit of consumpt spend that they have been see is consist with the notion of a cocoon effect  a coupl of remark by previous speaker support that notion  for instanc  the spend on home improv and durabl good for one   s home   i don   t know whether the car sale phenomenon goe with that too or not  a compani that produc secur glass for both busi and resid report that they were alreadi have a veri strong year and they experienc a sharp increas in order after septemb   th   our contact said that all four of the firm   s plant are run at capac and their backlog are lengthen   also  the health care sector has general boost capit spend sinc septemb   th  both for facil and equip   my contact indic that the expenditur are primarili for emerg room facil  as for the retail sector  we stay in contact with feder depart store and they report that their octob sale were down year over year but the declin was consider smaller than they experienc in septemb and much less than they had expect base on what happen immedi after septemb   th   their think now  look ahead to this quarter  is that they  will finish the year down   percent from the fourth quarter of last year   they   ve revis down their expect for the spring to a   percent declin  year over year  which is a smaller declin than they were think a few week ago   and for the second half of next year they have project a   percent increas year over year   our contact at both kohl and feder told us that they now expect stronger year end gift give sale than they had previous   they analyz the composit of sale over halloween and now believ the desir to give gift is much stronger than befor  which may also be relat somewhat to the cocoon effect             tie in with some of the remark made earlier about the uncertainti regard what is go on with auto sale  auto dealer in our district think that sale will fall veri quick   they said their strategi is not to have ani inventori on decemb   st   one director  continu in the good news vein  said that bob    applebe   s  and rubi tuesday   s all had the strongest septemb in their histori  which is consist with peopl drive to place instead of fli to florida  for exampl   the bad news side of that is that auto accid are probabl up  one of the sourc we   ve been look at is a compani call telecheck  which has         outlet across the countri that report on purchas by check   the data are analyz now by a former it   s a rather interest report   sale in new york citi  which is a big market and heavili weight  were down   percent octob over octob   overal sale in new york state were down about   percent   those were the onli declin record in the survey either by metropolitan area or on the state level   the southeast was the strongest region  led by louisiana and by new orlean in particular   mayb it   s those casino   one of the strongest state in the survey was ohio  where sale increas were well abov those in california   and the metropolitan area of cleveland was second onli in strength to new orlean   so we   re not quit up there at the top  but we   re pretti close  eleven year ago at this  e  look ahead to desert storm and in the midst of desert shield  it seem that both busi and household went into a mode of postpon the postpon  the attitud was      don   t do it now if you don   t have to  wait and see what is go to happen      we met with quit a few group in recent week  includ our director  advisori council  and the senior credit offic of all the larg bank in the district  and ask them whether they see a similar respons today   confirm what we   re see in the number  the answer was    yes    for busi but    no    for household   how   one explain that to a larg extent the busi sector  especi            manufactur compani  seem to have gone into a postpon and wait and see mode while household have not   general  the initi respons among our contact was      appar my spous  sn   t read the same thing i do      but upon further discuss they said no  in fact it   s the opposit   the spous usual say      haven   t you read about unemploy and the bad economi  it   s our duti to go out and spend      appar busi don   t think the same way   in our meet last week with senior credit offic i ask them to imagin that a year ago  when make their budget plan for       they had accur forecast the econom situat of today in term of broad measur of output  employ  and so on   with an accur forecast of the macro economi i wonder what they would have expect with regard to their consum loan portfolio   they said they would have project a substanti wors outcom   they would have assum a veri negat hit to the consum portfolio  but that has not happen   ask whi  they suggest that the refinanc boom might be a factor  with the lengthen of matur and  of cours  lower interest rate   one banker comment that his bank   s mortgag depart is buri  the general view is that household debt servic burden are actual lower now than they were a year ago   if that could be confirm  i would think that   s pretti good news   they also report that their commerci real estat portfolio were in much better shape than they would have thought  in fact they describ them as excel  which is quit differ from the experi    or    year ago   i ask about car loan  expect that there weren   t ani   but they said car loan are in fact still increas   i had forgotten about import and transplant  such as honda  which did not offer zero percent financ   honda didn   t go that rout becaus it  sn   t like it and think it   s a mistak  toyota and in fact mani of the daimlerchrysl model were not includ in the zero percent financ deal either   and jeep  for instanc  is produc a toledo model for which they can   t keep up with the demand   moreov  the loan offic made a point that is obvious  but i hadn   t            thought about it   with everi new car sale  a use car sale almost alway occur too  and the bank often financ those purchas  let me make some general comment on econom polici action and the perform of the macro economi   it seem to me that a prescript for polici should be deriv from a diagnosi   we never see all region  sector  and industri of the economi move up or move down togeth   there have been  e in past histori when we   ve seen weak in sector like hous and auto   those situat often warrant a prescript of easier monetari polici  lower financ rate may seem appropri   when i look at the fiscal polici under consider today  and have listen to the staff this morn regard the uncertainti about it  it   s veri hard to understand what might be go on  in the way of econom think at least   i don   t know how what is be propos or consid by the congress is go to help ani of the problem that we actual see now in the economi   it   s easi to understand the need for separ of power in the branch of govern   and it   s easi to understand that member of congress want to rais their hand and vote for someth   they want to be perceiv as be a part of the solut   but it   s not at all clear to me that anyth that is be propos under the banner of fiscal action is go to be on balanc construct   that assess may be deriv from my general bias in that i   ve alway been skeptic about the thrust of fiscal polici action   but i could easili talk myself into believ that the fiscal action current under consider will do more harm than good  on monetari polici i distinguish between the level of the fed fund rate and the reaction associ with announc of chang it   the level  of cours  is import becaus we need to know where the fund rate stand relat to some percept of the natur rate   that   s crucial in assess whether we are inject a suffici amount of liquid for the macroeconom circumst to achiev the outcom we want   that   s one issu   i look at where we are and            evalu other inform to tell me whether i think the fund rate level is appropri or not  that   s quit differ from the issu of announc of the committe   s decis to chang the rate  which show up in the headlin news   when i engag in the debat between    keep the powder dri    versus    take preemptiv action     i think in term of how mani more announc we might want to be abl to make   that would lead me to suggest one eighth of a point chang in the fund rate as more appropri at this junctur becaus then we would captur more headlin   but that has noth to do with whether i believ the current stanc of polici is suffici s ul or not  final  my think is that over  e the committe should look at the balanc of risk  not in term of the statement that we put in our announc  but in the sens of what kind of mistak are we more will to make and how can we correct them   we know that mistak are inevit  but we need to assess which mistak are more harm or more difficult to correct  there was a  e when we thought the greater risk was for polici to remain s ul for too long becaus have to tighten dramat would be difficult   so we thought it would be better to err on the side of restraint becaus we could alway eas more readili   i now perceiv  at least base on some of the comment made around the tabl  that the balanc of risk is revers   and that may be correct and appropri   now the view general is that the risk of be too restrict is the greater mistak  especi look at the experi of japan and theoret worri in some other countri  result in either deflat or prolong contract   so the thought is that it   s better to err on the side of more s ulus   while that may be correct  i think we should be say  at least among ourselv if we don   t want to go public with it  that we are more toler of run the risk of re inflat than we were befor
thank you  mr  chairman   our decis today  as jerri jordan has just indic  come at a  e of great uncertainti   i think our challeng is to minim the risk face our economi in these uncertain  e   as we have alreadi indic around the tabl  there are some posit sign that can   t be overlook   certain the strength in light vehicl sale is attribut to incent to some extent  but there are those who believ that it   s more than that and may reflect some posit sen ent remain among household   sever forward look financi market  particular the equiti market and the futur market  and perhap even the level of the u s  dollar  attest to a market expect of a rapid rebound   and final  as has alreadi been discuss  monetari s ulus is in the pipelin and fiscal polici may well becom more accommod  howev  buri within these potenti posit sign are some negat one  and we have alreadi talk about those to some extent   the current strength in auto sale is probabl borrow from futur demand and we can expect demand for auto to fall off   there is the possibl that the process of find a fiscal s ulus packag that work for all will produc fiscal action that is too littl  too complex  and too late   and final  the strength in equiti market may well erod quit rapid and we could have a negat wealth effect as earn fail to meet the expect that are built into equiti market price  against the background in which much of the good news in the near term is potenti bad  certain there   s a lot of other negat news as well   labor market weak is spread beyond manufactur to other sector   with the specter of grow unemploy like to weigh more heavili on consum  weak in the labor market will mean  i think  smaller increas in wage and salari go forward  potenti undermin consumpt as a major driver of macroeconom strength this year and next year   while the hous market appear to be robust             there is some anecdot evid from build materi firm that suggest some weaken in the construct segment   one of our contact note that for the first  e sinc late      sever construct firm plan to close down between thanksgiv and christma becaus of insuffici order backlog   again that   s a small sign of some uncertainti in an area that has been strong for some  e  more recent data on durabl good order suggest that compani are hoard liquid and more firm than had been expect are hold off on put new fix invest in place  particip in the bond market tell us that even the record set bond issuanc  which could be seen as an indic of busi confid  is better interpret as indic that the free cash flow for firm is insuffici to cover even exist invest activ much less support new one  and final  as i think dave   mention  survey indic show that manufactur is clear contract and i gather that our own ip number may well support that conclus  we haven   t put veri much weight on the intern outlook  though i would agre with vice chairman   that     s forecast seem to be the most reason one given the fact we know now but that the risk intern certain are veri much to downsid   and insofar as commod price tend to suggest the relat balanc of suppli and demand in global market  certain commod price are suggest further slow  not a pickup  the question is how to guid polici with this confluenc of develop   recogn the risk that we might do too much  i would still err on the side of continu to be aggress  which i think speak direct to the point jerri jordan was just make   the best strategi when confront with an ongo deterior is to move to offset the worst downsid risk and prepar to respond to the upsid in the unlik event that we   re surpris in that direct            while it is true that monetari polici in the pipelin is alreadi s ul  it   s import to recogn that we put that polici in place against a particular background of a forecast and outlook at the  e and  if anyth  the outlook has continu to erod   accord  i think that   requir ongo polici respons   the one mistak that a central bank can make when confront with the type of eros that we are face  which may inde includ the risk of disinfl  is to move sluggish in increment that are too small out of fear of hit the zero bound too quick   that cautious strategi is the most riski becaus it leav open the possibl of a much weaker situat still in the context of littl room for polici maneuv  so  while bob   encourag us to rememb the alamo  i would suggest that perhap the experi of the bank of japan and other might be import to rememb as well  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   an import theme at our last meet was uncertainti   we were meet reason close to septemb   th and it was still hard to sort out the data   it   s easier to do the sort now   to paraphras murphi   s law  almost everyth that could go down  did   it   s pretti hard to find sourc of strength in today   s economi  the list of downward point indic is long and get longer   the beig book  employ  the napm survey  durabl good order  consum confid  industri product  commod price  foreign demand growth  and on down the list   what seem especi troublesom is that former sourc of spend growth are begin to weaken   hous expenditur are begin to slip and consumpt is start to fall relat to dispos incom  as governor   just note  auto sale spurt but that could impli weak ahead if the sale just reflect an immedi bunch of expenditur in respons to the zero interest rate deal            the stock market is surpris high  but that could be problemat as well   the earn price ratio is now virtual the same as the real aaa bond yield and this with analyst    earn forecast that are still implaus op ist   when and if more prudenc strike the earn forecast  or if more normal risk spread assert themselv  stock valu could fall as well  mani comment are now argu that becaus all of this has happen as interest rate were cut  monetari polici must be impot   perhap i   m preach to the choir here  but sinc i think it   s relev for our decis  let me spend a minut take on that argument   to be sure  monetari polici has been fight veri power downward forc this year  far more power than i think ani of us imagin at the start of the year   polici eas may not have had the curat effect that we had all hope for  but i think the impot argument take thing much too far   the essenc of monetari polici is through the interest rate cost of capit channel   in the goldman sach financi condit index this interest rate channel get    percent of the weight   in the frb us model it weight rang from    percent to    percent  depend on whether one take one quarter impact or long run impact   and that channel has work well this year   short rate obvious have drop sharpli   even longer term     year treasuri rate have come down from   to   percent in real term sinc the start of their eas cycl last year and from   to       percent in nomin term   these chang have held up final spend   this year the eas of monetari polici clear seem to have held up spend for hous and consum durabl  especi auto   it   s possibl that it has even had some posit effect on invest  though it   s obvious hard to make that case given the power downward impact of the capit overhang  i will agre with the critic that there are both theoret and empir question about some of the other way that monetari polici alleg s ul the economi   one suspect channel            involv the foreign sector   it seem that a drop in interest rate  sn   t necessarili lower domest currenc valu  perhap becaus it rais expect profit or perhap becaus condit might have becom even weaker in other economi  the other suspect channel involv the wealth effect   there seem to be no doubt that a rise in futur product will rais equiti valu and consumpt  as peopl tri to consum some of their futur anticip incom up front   but whether fall interest rate and rise relat hous price  which do rais comput net worth  should also rais consumpt has alway been a matter of some theoret ambigu  so monetari polici is perhap not as potent as some believ  but it still can have power impact  still can be use to fight downward movement  and still has been effect in maintain spend this year   in the face of the power downward momentum that seem to come with each day   s econom news  i think we have no choic but to use our instrument as emphat as we can  final  let me say one word about revers  someth about which i am not veri worri   much of the  book recoveri hing on addit fiscal s ulus  which is somewhat in doubt for polit reason and is perhap even econom treacher   it   s not so much of a stretch to say that the world recoveri hing on the u s  recoveri  which hing on fiscal polici  which hing on polit   that is an exagger  i admit  but not too much   it   s easi for me to imagin a veri slow recoveri here and in the world and that should give us plenti of  e to revers cours   but if condit are such that we have to revers more quick  that would actual be fantast news and we should be delight to do that
thank you  mr  chairman   relat to the current  book forecast  i believ that there are still asymmetr downsid risk to the first half of next year but that the risk are more balanc after that  e   becaus of the near term downsid risk  i view the altern scenario of still weaker consum spend as identifi a materi risk   given that risk and consider that  in my view  suggest that polici today should be set to err on the side of s ulus  the path of the feder fund rate in my forecast is more consist with the easier monetari polici altern simul   inde  that would be the case even if i were begin with the  book baselin   still  as     note in his present  there is an unusu blend of pessim and grim data on the one hand and sign of resili on the other hand  further complic the assess of the outlook  but my major concern relat to the question of the appropri monetari polici relat to the forecast   my first concern here is that monetari polici may be less effect in this eas cycl than it normal has been becaus of the failur of the declin in short term interest rate to pass through to other dimens of financi condit that matter more for spend   in that regard i recogn that my view run counter to the remark we just heard and to mani of the comment around the tabl this morn that have emphas the amount of monetari s ulus alreadi in the pipelin and it like contribut to the vigor of the project rebound  financi condit indic  includ the one recent construct by the board   s staff  are some  subject to difficulti in interpret   but they do in my view highlight the risk that financi condit have improv much less than would have been expect base on the magnitud of the cumul declin in the feder fund rate over this eas cycl   the  book forecast presum take this into account   inde  i suspect it may be the reason whi monetari polici is assum to remain so s ul  measur in term of the real fund rate relat to it            long term equilibrium valu and relat to the economi   s rebound   the implic of concern about the improv in financi condit is not that we should reli less on monetari polici but that we may have to do more than would otherwis have been necessari  second  i wonder whether we need to take into account anoth aspect of asymmetr risk   what might be describ as the two state of the world problem   the  book  like most forecast  seem to assum a one  e terrorist attack with a near term effect on confid that dissip over  e   that might be appropri for a modal forecast   but relat to this assumpt  there seem to be signific asymmetr downsid risk  specif of further terrorist attack that affect confid in the economi or perhap for other reason as well   the forecast for the first state of the world is therefor like to be bias in an op ist direct though  as     note  we would be hard press to parameter the downsid risk associ with the second state of the world   still this analysi suggest that the mean of the forecast might be interpret as be below the mode in this case   so the question is how polici should respond to this type of uncertainti and whether polici should be set to err on the side of eas relat to the modal forecast  this concern is reinforc by the implic of the zero nomin bound restraint   my remark here will elabor on the point that have alreadi been made by presid broaddus and governor     some have suggest that the initi low nomin fund rate should encourag us to keep our powder dri   to the contrari  i read the lesson from our studi of the zero nomin bound constraint as point to an asymmetr polici respons  one that is more rapid with respect to downsid shock   this allow policymak to use a fa  speed of respons and compens for the smaller possibl cumul declin   the result of the more aggress polici would be to limit further declin in core pce inflat  restrain it from fall below my long            run target of       percent as it   in the  book baselin   this maintain a cushion that would allow a larger declin in the real feder fund rate if need  this may be less of a press concern at the moment given the steep in the yield curv and the opportun for long rate to fall relat to short rate if the downturn is deeper or the recoveri more gradual or longer delay than now expect   a more rapid eas would  howev  provid an opportun for long term rate to fall by more over the forecast horizon if the sharp of the declin or the moder of the recoveri disappoint the financi market   in ani case  i take the lesson from the zero nomin bound analysi to mean we probabl should move more aggress in respons to advers shock  not less when nomin short term rate are alreadi low  my last concern is about long term rate   while they have declin somewhat further recent  they have been sticki in relat to the cumul declin in short term rate   as a result  i have becom concern that we may have lost the abil to lower them further with monetari polici and  therefor  have quit limit leverag on aggreg demand   this sticki may reflect in part  as     note  the offset effect of a revis in longer term budget prospect   but in my view  it may also reflect a diverg between the fomc   s forecast for the economi and the forecast implicit in the bond market  equiti market  and the feder fund futur market   given the more robust forecast appar price into these market  most evid in the expect of an earli and aggress revers in the feder fund rate  ani further declin in the feder fund rate may be view as unnecessari  even damag  and in ani case short live  as a result  i have muse  the best way to s ul the economi might be not to lower the fund rate further but to encourag a declin in long rate relat to short term rate   how can we do that  i hear you ask    laughter
to say the least
perhap  i muse again  we could do that by be unusu transpar  that is  by inform market that we view the economi as weaker than they appear to be assum and that as a result the feder fund rate is less like to rise as soon or as aggress as they expect   as i said though  i am just muse here  i think  and perhap amus   laughter  as oppos to make a serious polici recommend
you   re on  governor
i realli should pass at this point   thank you  mr  chairman   at the  e of our last meet  the econom horizon alreadi appear dark  but there was littl hard data yet avail to judg the sever of unfold event   sinc then we have gotten consider inform that indic that we have on hand a steep and rapid declin that may be start to feed on itself in a vicious cycl   it   s not a pretti pictur  it continu to be my view that monetari polici play a crucial and appropri role in the economi over the first half of the year   but we have now enter a period when it influenc will be subordin to the unfold of other event  polit and militari  domest and intern  and how they impact on net with the psych of the american consum   our challeng today is to identifi how monetari polici can most use assist in assur a posit outcom  and that will be discuss short   this will be an interest exercis becaus even if everyon had precis the same view of the econom outlook  sever differ polici prescript can be seen as the best way to go  although fiscal action under consider have been discuss earlier by sever around the tabl  pleas let me make a brief comment on the expect that a temporari invest tax incent may induc a signific earli spurt in capit invest   obvious  such a tax break is quit attract and tempt   howev  given the present environ of extrem low capac            util  rise unemploy  and weaken demand  this gambit may prove disappoint  beyond whatev level of capit spend will occur regardless of event  a great mani firm  especi the smaller one that constitut half or more of the nation   s product  are like to conclud that attract as this incent may be  they simpli cannot afford to acquir nonessenti addit capac when their exist capac is so underutil and the outlook is so uncertain  larger and stronger compani who have more maneuv room in manag their capit structur are better candid to acceler their invest   howev  they may wait and see until the last minut befor the incent sunset befor make major discretionari commit   if that day is in the second half of      it may come too late to be of much help  as the tale of the econom recoveri will by then have long sinc been told   if the economi is rebound  they will be invest anyway and the incent would be unnecessari   if the economi is still in the doldrum at that  e  this incent is unlik to smoke them out  and policymak will be search for stronger medicin   thank you
thank you veri much   we now turn to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   the polici eas you have alreadi undertaken  and in particular the     basi point reduct in the feder fund rate in the three week after septemb     anticip a substanti downdraft in econom activ   nonetheless  with the incom data indic that the economi is even weaker than expect  and by a consider margin  the question you would seem to be face again today is not whether to eas further but rather by how much  to be sure  your answer is not like to have an appreci effect on the near term trajectori of the economi  but it will alter interest rate expect and asset price now and in the futur and  in so do  will help to shape the eventu recoveri   the extent of the contract is import to your polici decis   the larger the output gap creat as the economi goe through this current period of weak  the stronger the rebound that can be accommod consist with satisfactori inflat perform over the longer run             market particip expect you to lower the fund rate today  and they have put a littl more weight on a declin of    basi point than one of     the cumul eas they have built into the yield curv stand at close to    basi point by earli next year   although whatev you decid is like to have some effect on interest rate and asset price  the chang may not be larg  at least immedi   much of the initi adjust is like to be in the expect  e of further eas  when market see the fund rate hit bottom  rather than in the level of the rate at that point   but the cumul size of the anticip eas will be affect  at least a littl  and possibl more so over  e  as the market factor in their percept of your concern and respons when react to futur inform   an import aspect of the decis today  then  is how you would like to nudg those expect and asset price in light of your assess of the outlook  the risk around that outlook  and the cost of the economi deviat to one side or the other of it most like path  in the staff  book forecast  onli    basi point of further eas  along with greater fiscal s ulus than assum in the last forecast round  help to promot a rebound in activ after a relat shallow contract  inde  the ad monetari and fiscal polici action about compens for the greater than expect near term weak  leav the level of output at the end of the project period close to where it was predict to be in the last forecast round  in a coupl of respect  financi market price suggest that particip in these market forese a stronger reviv in econom activ than   the staff   market are anticip a littl more eas than the staff has assum  but also a quicker and more substanti increas in the feder fund rate thereaft  presum in respons to a more rapid pickup in growth   the rise in equiti price and the substanti narrow of risk premium on junk bond over the intermeet period are particular noteworthi in the face of downward revis to near term econom and interest rate expect   this more favor attitud toward risk suggest that financi market particip have becom less fear about futur prospect and are expect better earn perform than is the staff  give some weight to the stronger tenor of market expect would lend support to a decis to limit the eas at this meet to    basi point  moreov  the committe may prefer to reduc the feder fund rate onli    basi point at this meet even if it see a high probabl that further eas will eventu be need   move gradual  rather than front load the addit eas  might have a number of advantag   import  it could help you to calibr the extent of your eas better   addit  e should give you more inform about the economi   s develop respons to your earlier action  which includ some unusu larg eas veri recent   in addit  the natur of the fiscal respons to septemb    could            well becom clearer in the next month or so  and you will have more data to help sort out the more persist effect of the attack on consum and busi behavior   moreov  the committe may want to take account of the possibl that over the next sever month the interact of market expect and fragil public confid will weigh heavili on the side of further eas as the economi continu to contract   if the stanc of polici is set now to fulli anticip that oncom weak  you could be face with weigh the risk of disappoint the market and the public on the one hand  or eas polici excess on the other   if financi market have done a reason good job in read your intent and build the polici action you anticip into current asset price  littl of the stabil power of polici would be sacrif by move in more measur step   in the present situat  market particip are like to continu to anticip at least anoth    basi point of eas after a    basi point move at this meet   and that might be rough consist with your own es  of what will be need  though  as note  the structur of market rate also incorpor a substanti polici tighten begin later next year  howev  the risk in a gradual approach to polici implement is that polici action may turn out to be insuffici to forestal a cumul  self reinforc  movement in the economi becaus the forc bear on demand or price prove to be stronger than the central bank or the market anticip  or becaus the economi is hit with anoth shock in the same direct   in the current circumst  with incom data and the near term outlook consider weaker than anticip at your last meet  and with the rebound still onli a forecast  the committe may see a more aggress polici eas of    basi point as better calibr to the prevail profil of the econom risk and the cost and benefit of potenti altern outcom  the recent data may inde be consist with a short period of weak in which adjust are compress and the stage is set for a fair prompt and robust turnaround  as the financi market seem to believ   but they also may be symptomat of a deeper and more prolong contract  the latter could occur as both household and busi engag in a mutual reinforc withdraw to safer balanc sheet and spend pattern in the face of the heighten level of uncertainti and concern about the futur  the forecast of a reason shallow downturn and robust recoveri depend not onli on a measur respons of household to high level of job loss  but import also on s ul fiscal action that have not yet been agre by congress and the administr   were such an agreement to be delay signific or structur in such a way as to be less effect than has been assum  easier monetari polici would be need to carri more of the load in s ul the economi   and  a substanti shortfal in fiscal s ulus could requir appreci further monetari accommod   the            declin in stock price and the strength of the dollar this year have counteract much of the effect of your previous eas  rais question about how much s ulus from monetari polici alon is now in train to counter more persist forc of restraint on privat spend behavior over the next few quarter   moreov  the downturn is unusu synchron and interact around the world  but global demand may not get much of a boost from monetari polici elsewher  at least from polici in the other two main currenc area   the bank of japan is constrain by a lack of effect altern  and the ecb seem hamstrung from vigor action by a desir to build consensus amid concern about establish price stabil credenti in it initi year  if the standard forecast is correct  were the committe to eas by    basi point at this meet and perhap by smaller amount in come month  you would find yourselv next spring with a strengthen economi and monetari polici in a veri s ul posit   but  unless the contract is a lot shallow than most expect  you will also be face an economi with a consider margin of excess labor and capit that will be exert downward pressur on inflat   in these circumst  the fomc should have ampl  e to begin to firm polici to forestal the onset of inflat pressur   if  on the other hand  the recent data signal that the economi is in a steeper contract  you will want to have eas aggress to cushion the fall and to fo  a more rapid rebound  if the committe see inflat as most like to be move down as slack accumul in labor and product market  it may perceiv littl benefit from risk a further shortfal from the expect path of the economi and see reason to lean a littl harder against that possibl   the cost of such a shortfal could be unusu larg   not onli is there the potenti for cumul downward movement in output for a  e  but that spiral could be prolong under circumst in which the nomin feder fund rate is alreadi low and the forc of restraint turn out to be larg and persist   in these circumst  econom slack could reduc inflat and inflat expect so far that it becam imposs for the feder reserv to drive real interest rate far enough into negat territori to counteract continu weak   if this is seen as a possibl  act gradual  that is     keep the powder dri     risk find yourselv in that veri situat   therefor  it would be especi import to act preemptiv to bol  the economi  limit disinfl  and forestal be    pin to the zero bound     as the bluebook put it  taken togeth  these aspect of the current situat may be seen as argu for lean on the side of anoth    basi point eas at this  e  rather than      the larger action is like to lower somewhat market expect of the fund rate over the next few month  but the effect of such revis in reduc interest rate further out the yield curv and in            support equiti price may be seen as provid a desir extra margin of financi accommod in the face of the downsid risk and cost  whatev you do  the tenor of the incom data on both output and price and the downward revis to near term forecast would suggest that econom weak continu to be more of a concern than rise inflat  at some point  near term weak will be balanc by the prospect of an expans in the futur that could give rise to inflat pressur  but for now and into the forese futur  the risk to achiev your object for sustain growth would seem to outweigh those to longer run price stabil  thank you  mr  chairman
question for don   presid hoenig
don   sn   t argu for a    basi point cut  on the ground that the economi may be wors than we thought like  lead to argu for an even larger cut becaus we ought to do all we can now given the limit inflat risk from such an action   you didn   t mention make no chang in the fund rate  but that would say that we react veri strong after the crisi  which i agre is what we should have done  and are await the effect of those action  which haven   t even come into play yet   but the rational for a    basi point move is that we are so fear that we think we should make a larg cut   it strike me that that argu for an even greater cut given the uncertainti and the lack of inflat risk from that
i think it depend on where you see the central tendenc of your forecast   i believ the central tendenc among committe member is for someth like the  book forecast  some addit weak follow by an upturn next year   we   re talk about the risk around that central tendenc   one could view    basi point of eas not so much as a respons to the central tendenc forecast  if that appear to be a reason forecast  but rather to the risk around that central tendenc   by risk i mean not onli the risk that the economi could turn out to be weaker and the rebound weaker  perhap becaus the fiscal s ulus  sn   t come through  but also the cost of fall short   we could end up with a veri sever disinflationari pressur that polici would have troubl catch up to  be behind the curv  as committe member some  like            to say   get behind the curv on the downsid might be particular cost at this  e   if you had a veri weak central tendenc forecast  then i would agre that you should be consid a larger cut   but with a central tendenc about like the staff forecast  i think we   re realli talk about the risk around that forecast
may i ask one other question   with a    basi point move  in your opinion are we go to affect the market    expect go forward   will those expect be complet revis and instead of    basi point of eas on the horizon from where we are will they talk about anoth    basi point from where we would be if we were to go with a larger cut
i think a move of    basi point will have a relat small effect on market expect   after all  market have alreadi built in about a two third probabl of a    basi point cut   i don   t put too much weight on the precis measur of that probabl  but you would not be great surpris them with such a cut   i would expect someth along the line of what happen after your last meet when the market were debat between a reduct of    or    basi point  you did     and the market revis down the out year eurodollar contract by   to   basi point   and i think that kind of respons would not be an unreason one   so i would anticip some downward revis  but not a big one in the immedi expect
my question is along the same line   you   ve drawn  and mayb this is just my perspect  what seem to me to be a fair stark differ between a cut of    versus a cut of    basi point   i must say i was troubl by your comment about get ourselv into a liquid trap without a    basi point cut   i understood you to say that a    basi point cut would            not work to avoid that problem   i found the stark of your argument a littl off put and i thought you might expound a bit more on that
i think that   s part a function of how i structur the brief  in term of tri to give all the argument for do    basi point and then all the argument for do    basi point   it   s clear a matter of consider judgment   and there are argument on the    basi point side   this may be one of those unusu situat  presid jordan said he thought this might have happen over the last few week  where we realli do get some inform over the intermeet period   as he remark  we   ve been disappoint by that inform   as mani of you comment  the gridlock on fiscal polici may well persist past decemb   th  the date of your next meet   so i think there   s that argument   the market have built in more eas   you   re onli reduc expect by a littl   we could be get a rebound next year   it   s realli more a question of where you want to take the risk   i don   t think the differ between the two choic i describ are as stark as you suggest  but there are differ in emphasi  differ in messag  and differ in what might happen
let me say a littl about the implicit comparison to the japanes situat   we   ve been so much more aggress in a veri much shorter period of  e than the bank of japan was   and our economi is so much more resili  peopl use that word over and over   than their economi seem to be in term of the expect of consum and the innov of busi and so forth   i recogn that there is a potenti for all of the academ work we   ve put into the zero bound on nomin interest rate to come into play here  but i question the realiti of those expect or those worri in the context of where rate are now
well  you do have     basi point befor you get down to where the japanes rate are   so you have a way to go   and i agre with you that our financi system  our            privat economi and our financi market  is much stronger than the japanes system  which is realli what is hold them back
on the other hand  our economi is subject to some unusu shock and we just don   t know how busi and household will be respond to unfold develop   and there are downsid risk   some in the market see a bottom to the feder fund rate at       percent  so  the rate is approach that level   it may be a littl prematur to have box in the bluebook and a discuss around this tabl of the zero bound  but it   s not that prematur   one could construct a scenario in which there is a major loss in confid  as in the altern scenario in the  book  or scenario in which busi activ and foreign economi are much weaker   i think we could all sit here and write down about three or four develop that would serious weaken this economi  they would all have to occur at the same  e  a number of veri bad thing happen at onc  includ the possibl of anoth terrorist attack   it   s not imposs to imagin that six month from now the committe could be deal with some veri  veri low interest rate
i don   t put that out of the bound of possibl   it   s a question of how much control we use in the process of get there
i just have a comment on don   s present   i thought you were especi effect this  e  don  in make the case for both a     point move and a     point move   inde  it was a bit of a roller coa  ride for me   i felt myself be sway first in one direct and then whipsaw back in the other direct   so it was an enjoy ride   thank you   laughter
ani further question for don  if not  let me proceed            this is a particular difficult period and i want to start off with a few import issu  the first is that we keep forecast stabil but there has been no evid of it anywher   we go from one  book to the next with a project of rise econom activ  at least beyond the near term   and  inde  by the process we employ for forecast  that conclus is inevit  the altern forecast would be one that violat the rule of statist infer or  i should say  the great histor research that dave   set into motion  which conclud that the unit state has never had a recess that fail to end   that general view is veri help  i know  but the import issu is for us to be awar that we are wit develop that are quit extraordinari   as a number of you have mention  the intern outlook is continu to deterior   we current are observ the obvers of the extraordinari acceler that occur in world economi dure the latter part of the     s as a consequ of increas global  a develop that is now seen as a two edg sword   inde  the dispers of growth rate in economi around the world has come down veri dramat  there is an increas synchron and mutual reinforc pattern of econom activ among the world   s nation  and we are begin to see a gradual breakdown of barrier to stabil as our economi goe from one stage to the next   the eros is slow but persist   it is a develop that i don   t think ani of us has seen previous   we certain don   t put it into our econometr model  whether they are structur or var   inde  the one thing we can say about our model is that left to their own devic they will not project a long last deflationari process  the coeffici and the structur of the model alway produc an upturn at some point   there is a tendenc to revert to the type of growth path that has character our econom histori   we cannot presum that we can put a few exogen assumpt into our model and then conclud the model predict are tell us someth   i submit that that is not true   we are tell the model            what to conclud by the way we have built it  and inde the exogen input that we put in will not induc a contract unless we go far beyond the normal rang of input that we have use in the past   nonetheless  the real world has the potenti to generat deflat  and i think we are move gradual from a disinflationari process toward a situat where we could begin to experi outright deflat   i think that inflat rate final are get down to a level that can satisfi al broaddus  which is someth i thought would never emerg   but the point is that he   s right   at this stage i don   t know what the next  book is go to show  but i would wager that it will indic a weaker economi   what is veri disturb is that we have not yet seen ani under basi for stabil   in that regard i found the comment around this room veri distress   to be sure  nobodi has said that the economi is weaken substanti  it is not recov  but neither is it go down precipit  there is one part of our econom system that is say in effect that the economi is stabil   it is call the stock market  and i hope it is right   the stock market pattern of the last sever week are essenti project a bottom in the u s  economi and the world economi some  in the earli month of        if the market were a person  i would ask about the basi for such a conclus   earn expect continu to declin  and we are see pattern that histor would suggest a ralli in a bear market that may be perfect consist with a subsequ declin   i wish i could take greater comfort from the recent ralli  but i have look at too mani stock market chart go back to the   th centuri to take much comfort in recent develop  i think the surg in motor vehicl sale is a fascin phenomenon becaus i do not believ that we can explain it wholli in term of price discount   the problem unfortun is that the es  for octob sale is so bizarr out of the ordinari that even if there is a good deal            of real chang in the demand for motor vehicl  sale will still have to come down veri sharpli just to get back to someth resembl normal  i think we are look at develop that impli a veri difficult polici issu   my first reaction to the employ data on friday was to presum that the wisest thing for us to do today would be to move the fund rate down    basi point  given the downsid risk  and  to continu to make    basi point move as long as we have to   i struggl through the weekend review numer anecdot report and look care at the simul that our model are creat  and most interest i took a realli close look at what is go on abroad  where the data are not as good as our but they are increas more disturb  i thought that your up report  bill  was strike becaus it is anecdot consist with what we are see  name a gradual but continu contract with no evid of ani degre of stabil   i believ we are at a point where we are beyond disinfl and get to the edg of a deflationari process   this mean that even if we were to provid a great deal of s ulus  we would still have to deal with disinfl befor we could creat a problem of inflat   so we have a few stage to go through  i must admit that one of the thing i read which sort of struck me as be relev was that littl box on the    zero bound    that vinc and his staff put in the bluebook   i thought it realli address the key question  i don   t think ani of us has a big disput on the econom outlook   but there is a crucial disput here  it relat to the issu of whether we want to keep our powder dri or whether we want to make sure that we put in enough shot to knock down the oppon befor the oppon eventu   us in   i start with the view that keep the powder dri was the wisest polici  but as i struggl through the weekend i came out where al broaddus is   the reason i would argu for such            an adjust is that polici invari get down to the issu of what happen if we are wrong   and what i conclud is that if do    basi point today is wrong  if it turn out that the economi start to stabil tomorrow and a lot of thing go well  be requir to move our fund rate target back up would be the most delight problem we could conceiv face   i don   t anticip that   i think the chanc of that happen are extraordinarili remot   i do think that if we have an inadequ respons today  there is a danger  becaus as i see it we are at a critic point in the way this economi is function  that we will be take too high a risk   i don   t know what the futur hold for us   i don   t think ani of us can know   but on the basi of what we do know  what is the downsid if we do    and we are wrong or we do    and we are wrong   in my judgment the answer to that question is pretti forc   as a consequ i must say that  after great struggl  i come out in favor of    basi point   i wouldn   t go to    basi point larg becaus i am not absolut convinc that i am right   if i were  i would argu for that larger move
may i ask you a question
i would appreci your opinion on this   by go with a    basi point chang  are we like to fo  expect  not just in financi market but in the economi more general  that we will do at least anoth    basi point and will that induc peopl to hold back becaus they anticip further eas
yes   i think the expect that we will do anoth    basi point will be built into the market   i   m not sure that   s all bad   i veri much suspect  in term of the way don put it  that we alreadi have a good part of that further eas bake into the market   if we were to go    basi point  i would realli be concern about what the forward posit of the fund market would be   and take bill pool   s general edict  we must be care of            what we construct out there becaus how we respond to what is in the forward market has a veri signific impact   so i think it is far safer for us to be move    basi point  and frank that is what i would like to put on the tabl  and to continu in ani case a bias toward econom weak  vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  probabl with the usual enthusiasm of the recent convert  becaus i enter the weekend with a view that we ought to eas by    basi point and over the cours of the weekend chang my opinion   somewhat symbol i have a pond behind my hous in westchest counti and there are a lot of fish in the pond   therefor  i have two hawk  and the hawk enjoy fish in the pond  this is a true stori  though what will follow is not true    laughter   this past weekend  now we get into mytholog  one of the hawk miracul turn into a beauti white dove   i was veri confus until i realiz that what was even more miracul was that the dove spoke with a southern accent    laughter   and that convinc me even more that the    basi point move was appropri
i second that
let me respond to the question that tom hoenig rais on the market reaction   if we eas    basi point  the market will assum that we will eas at least    basi point more   if we eas    basi point  the market will make the same assumpt but will be confus  i think  about whether we are slow down just for the sake of slow down  which i think is a bad messag to send   if we eas by    basi point  that will creat an immens amount of confus  probabl start with the notion that we know a whole lot more with a greater degre of certainti than anybodi els   and that the downsid we   re all concern about is now            our central forecast   that would be veri danger   so we certain don   t want to do that   the conclus is that a    basi point cut  with the balanc of risk still toward inadequ growth  is the right though difficult conclus
mr  chairman  i agre with your prefer for a    basi point cut in the fund rate   for me the downsid risk to the outlook are sizabl as illustr by emerg data  which keep signal lower and lower forecast for real gdp growth   also  as note in the bluebook and comment on by governor   and by you  a larger preemptiv eas move now may reduc the risk of be constrain later by the zero nomin interest rate bound   i think that   s anoth compel reason to do    basi point at this  e
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   the good news in what you said was that you came out with a polici that i support   but the bad news is that you actual scare me a bit more than i was alreadi   nevertheless  i do support your propos  let me also address tom   s question   i   ve had a littl troubl with this myself becaus chang of         or even    basi point aren   t that huge   and as tom point out  if there   s an argument for get the fund rate down  whi don   t we get it down   the way i would ration what we   re do is that there is a sens in which we are speak in code here   we   ve been oper under a procedur for a while where    point is view as a big chang and the fed be respons   a move of    basi point is view as a littl chang and the fed not be veri respons   seventi five basi point is languag we   ve never use   so i think it   s particular import to be clear in our communic  as mani peopl around the tabl have said   to me that   s a power argument for continu the dialog that we   ve alreadi been have
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i support it for the reason that you gave
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i view the risk relat to the  book baselin as still to the downsid in the near term   i believ that   s a case for er on the side of s ulus relat to the baselin  given the asymmetr risk and the relationship between the mean and the mode in the forecast   and i believ that   s a case for move more rapid than otherwis  given the zero nomin bound constraint   for these reason i support your recommend of a    basi point declin in the target feder find rate today and also your recommend for a balanc of risk statement toward weak
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i support it strong
presid  n
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  although i think don did make good argument for both of the altern he describ   i am a bit concern that if the tenor of the economi  sn   t chang until some  in the spring  say  we   re go to run the risk of either overdo it or at some point have to disappoint market expect   that risk may not be huge in this environ  it is there nevertheless
i   m suffici uncertain about the  e and the strength of the  forecast recoveri that i support a cut of    basi point   i do worri a littl about endogen expect regard what we   ll do next and about how weak the economi realli is   have said that  i support the recommend
mr  chairman  i can support the recommend  although i certain came into this meet favor a move of    basi point   the way i see the issu is as follow   as you certain have said on mani occas  and i have said the same thing  we believ that the u s  economi has essenti undiminish long run prospect   the question  i suppos  is when those long run prospect will materi   if we believ that they are come in      or       that   s a long  e away   it seem to me that the tenor of the view around this tabl is that we may have a veri  veri difficult five year  and that the risk are decid on the downsid for the reason that peopl have discuss   i think our statement about the long run prospect for our economi are part of the reason whi long term rate have not gone down veri much   in my view we have express a lot of op  about the outlook for the economi and i think those statement of op  do not fulli reflect the belief that we heard around the tabl today in term of  let   s say  the next three to five year   would i bet my hous on my own convict on this score   no   obvious  we   re go through a veri difficult period  one that has no clear analog in histori  yet one where to date the absolut level of declin in activ has been mild   but we appar are project a consider risk of a steeper declin to come   so  if we realli want the reduct in the fund rate to translat into declin in longer term interest rate  i think we need to chang a bit the tone of what we say in our statement and in our tes oni and speech   presum we do believ that the long run prospect for the economi are sound and essenti undiminish and we should say that   but we            also need to say someth along the line  i don   t know how to word this  that we have ahead of us  in calendar quarter or mayb even year  a veri signific risk that the economi could requir a period of prolong and substanti monetari eas
let me just comment on that   first of all  if we serious believ the  e horizon was five year  then i think make a statement that the long term prospect are op ist is in ani meaning sens just wrong   when i talk about it  i   m think in term of two year or someth in that rang   if in fact our comment are hold long term interest rate up  if inde we   re that power  then i submit to you that if we take the posit that the world is go to be aw for the next five year  we can creat that result even if it   s not in prospect now   so i would be care about what we say we perceiv   i person don   t believ that the problem are deep seat to the extent that we are look at a situat like the     s or someth of that sort   but i do think that we are go through a period where the next year or next coupl of year is go to be subnorm   i don   t know whether i   m talk about just the first part of that period or whether the second part also will involv less than adequ growth   but i   m sure not argu that it   s go to go on for longer than that   i have no evid that that is the case
i appreci your comment on that   my belief  convict would be too strong a word here  is that we will go through an adjust  which when we look back at this period some  in the futur  will be regard as a cyclic adjust and not a chang in the secular outlook for the economi   i think we will be pull out of this situat along the line of the  book forecast   i view that as a veri good outlook   but if that is realli what we have in front of us  then it seem to me that we alreadi have a veri substanti amount of monetari eas in place  and to me the argument for    basi point today rather than    is not total consist with that outlook   that   s what concern me about look at it this way   i am also concern that there is a            sens in which we have doubl count the recent bad news   after all  we have cut the fund rate     basi point sinc septemb   th in anticip of bad news  the weak econom data to come  and we got the bad number   in part what we are say today is that we are cut the fund rate again by    basi point now that we see the actual of the weak data
but  rememb  we have revis down the forecast sinc those earlier cut
it   s not as though the forecast remain unchang from the immedi post septemb   th period   if it had  we would be in far better shape now   the outlook has deterior   that   s the problem
at ani rate  where i come out is that i   m concern about do    basi point now and about the process that i think we are get into   i m not go to dissent  that   s not my point   i   m just indic the reason under my prefer for    basi point   the likelihood is that we will have more weak econom data ahead of us and i think the market will read in anoth    basi point of eas at our next meet   i   m not sure that that dynam is realli help   that   s essenti what i am say
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve long thought that a varieti of unforecast intern and extern shock do happen and that there   s noth much we can do about that but tri to interpret them and respond appropri   and we can hope that we don   t get a success of shock go in the same direct that build into a cumul process   to my mind the role of policymak is often one of tri to avoid becom part of the problem rather than part of the solut   i do believ that in some episod in the histori of this central bank and other in the            world the policymak becam part of the problem rather than part of the solut   that   s the basi  too  for my comment earlier about fiscal polici   i   m not convinc that what is go on now in the fiscal arena is all that construct   but actual i   m less concern today than i was five week ago that monetari polici is not proper calibr   at that  e i was worri that thing were move in the direct of ration risk avers so fast that we might find that the fund rate was too high to be consist with the appropri thrust of monetari polici   given the desk   s net inject of liquid over the period sinc then  i actual feel more comfort that the level is not too high  moreov  my confid in the inher resili of a market economi and it tendenc to expand follow shock is undiminish   my uncertainti remain about what kind of intern or extern shock we need to be prepar for   so i would have been perfect comfort to stay with an unchang fund rate at this meet  given my read of the event sinc octob  nd   look at the yield curv  the four week  the three month  and the six month bill rate  it   s hard to disagre with a cut of    basi point   i can   t say that that   s wrong   but i   m actual fair comfort with where we are
mr  chairman  i will take your lead on this   but i also want to express a differ view in the sens that while our economi obvious had a terribl shock  we have taken veri aggress and i think appropri action and monetari polici is now in an accommod posit   some  e has to pass befor we will see an upturn  even with this accommod posit  and i believ it will take place   i have confid in the futur   in my view the u s  economi is quit differ from japan   s in term of it sound and it abil to recov from the shock   so i would be comfort with no chang or a    basi point chang today   i think we are rais expect with this move of    basi point   peopl are go to be make decis now            in the anticip that there will be more eas to come and i think there is a risk to that as far as the economi goe as well   i will certain follow your lead on this   these are difficult  e and i realiz it   s hard to know the right answer   but i think we could afford to be more patient and let the flow of  e work
i  like presid hoenig  would be much more comfort with a move of    basi point or even no chang versus your recommend of    basi point   i want to go through some of my think on this   i think it   s right to eas further   i had the same kind of battl with myself over the weekend that a coupl of other peopl in this room  includ you  mr  chairman  have talk about   but i continu to believ that there   s some need for caution   we have a lot of monetari polici eas in the pipelin and potenti fiscal s ulus as well   it   s import not to overreact   the recess seem to be bake in the cake now  the incom data will be negat  but the process has to play itself out   and as dave   mention  recess do inevit come to an end  there   s not a lot we can do about the near term   monetari polici  sn   t work in the near term   it can be a support for confid   and i think we provid support through our polici action after the terrorist attack  we put enough into the pipelin to bol  confid   but right now i don   t see further eas as a confid bol  move   i think it is like to work in the direct of confirm peopl   s thought about the impot of monetari polici becaus there won   t be much effect in the near term   instead  most of the impact will be felt next year  around the end of the first quarter or the begin of the second quarter perhap  when the economi is expect to be pick up anyway   and i have great faith that it will be pick up   how  when  and to what degre  i don   t know  but i think this economi has a lot of resili   in fact  peopl            have mention that lower rate now could actual increas long rate becaus the market appar see a quicker pickup than   our forecast  there   s probabl not a lot of differ between a move of    or    basi point today   i don   t see big differ in outcom   i don   t see the stark distinct that don was draw and i don   t see major differ in be wrong here   but i do think that a    basi point cut would suggest a bit more control on our part   i think it would show that we are be more forward look rather than focus on the recent incom data   to me it would indic that wherev we stop the polici posit might be a littl less s ul to the inevit upturn than otherwis   i don   t see the comparison to the current japanes situat  though i fulli understand the front load part of that argument   i don   t think go    basi point versus    would indic that the central bank in the unit state is part of the problem rather than part of the solut   but all that said  i do take your point on the feedback effect of the intern situat now and the potenti for a downward spiral   and if the psycholog  sn   t work domest  i think it   work a littl on the intern side   it   s a tough call for me right now but i am will to go with your leadership
thank you  mr  chairman   i start out my comment earlier by say that this is an uncertain and unpreced  e   that clear was evid as we went around the room and heard the comment dure the go around  which i too found veri depress   i expect it come into the meet becaus all the data and all the anecdot were so negat   i guess at some point we are go to get some posit anecdot   i keep look for them but i haven   t found them yet            there is clear a risk that the greater caution we   ve seen by consum and busi firm could cumul into a more sever recess   when one look at the consensus of the forecast that are out there  those forecast seem to discount anyth like that   i person think the economi is go to be weaker than the  book forecast and weaker than my staff   s forecast too for that matter   therefor  i do feel that a    basi point cut is safer and i support it   i  too  am concern about the interconnected of the intern economi and the feedback to our economi  which is the result of global  a develop that  of cours  all of us have support for mani  mani year   i think we just have to watch the situat veri  veri care as we move forward   so i support your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  first i   d like to correct the record regard al and i swap hat   the point of my rememb the alamo was that even though the defend lost the battl it was not becaus they were keep their powder dri   so basic  he came around to my point of view    laughter   i agre with your recommend
mr  chairman  this is the most fascin meet in my six year at the tabl   peopl have often ask me if i ever chang my mind dure the cours of a meet and i alway say    yes     but i   m not sure that i often do   today is probabl the except   i not onli went into the weekend but i came out of the weekend think that either no polici action today or a modest move was the right decis   i certain have come some way dure the cours of the meet and i think i understand the downsid risk more fulli   have said that  i   m still of the view that a modest move today feel more right to me   i think don made a credibl argument for such a polici   i share the concern of cathi   and bill pool that we may in fact build in            expect for even more eas than we would like   i think there   s even a chanc of a scare factor  peopl will think that we believ the economi is far wors than they thought   have said all that  i support your recommend and understand the argument for a    basi point move
will you read the appropri word
this is from page    in the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent     the sentenc for the press statement would be      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth  and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
would you call the roll
chairman  spa vice chairman   governor   presid hoeni governor   governor   presid mineha presid   presid pool    yes ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye
you miss governor
may i vote also    laughter   i believ i   m entitl to
all right  governor     i have you vote    yes       laughter
i didn   t think i was that transpar   i vote    yes
the preliminari statement that has been draft is veri close to the previous one   it   s veri short and it will be circul to you   in the mean  i request that the board of governor retir to the room next door so that we can act on a discount rate request   so  this meet is in recess and we will return short   recess
do you need a vote on this statement
i just want to ask whether it   s realli necessari to make what could be interpret as derogatori refer to enhanc secur   it   s clear that the divers of resourc to secur enhanc will have a negat effect on product  but do we realli need to say that in this statement   after all  the whole world is depend upon peopl feel comfort with the secur measur be taken becaus the world has chang forev  in my view anyway   peopl need to feel that these measur will be benefici for the long term   i don   t think we need to say this
i think that   s a valid critic   would somebodi els like to comment on it
well  if we don   t say someth about the reduct in product over the short run  for whatev reason  the statement will suggest that we think product is go to bounc back as soon as this econom slowdown abat   that sound too much like whistl in the wind   i   m not sure we need to blame it on protect and secur measur   but i think we have to say that someth is happen that like will affect product advers for a while
no  i agre with that   i think the question is whether or not we phrase it in the way it is phrase here
can we just say that becaus of the econom slowdown or the cyclic impact or someth like that product growth will slow
no  there is a heighten risk premium that has occur as a consequ of this   what we   re talk about  in the extrem form  is the elimin of just in  e inventori
yes  i know what you mean   but i don   t think this is the  e to be sound quit so negat about secur
well  could we say the    appropri    or the    necessari    divers of resourc to enhanc secur or someth along those line to suggest that it is well understood that resourc will be use in this way
i think the word    necessari    is good
yes  whi don   t we say the    necessari divers of resourc
yes  that   it
or how about just the    realloc of resourc
no     necessari    address the issu that cathi is rais
that turn it posit
is that adequ
well  let me first comment on the broader point and i   ll also talk about the word use   continu with bill     s whistl in the wind argument  i think we also have to show that we recogn this phenomenon  whether we call it a realloc or a            divers of resourc   so i think we actual have to tie that in there      necessari    is fine with me  also  there   s a doubl claus in there with    and protect against disrupt      we might not need that   a lot of word are devot to that sentenc and it could be strip down   but in my view we have to recogn not onli that it will be a while befor product come back  but also that a divers of resourc is occur   otherwis the messag just  sn   t look real
would you feel better if we said      the necessari divers of resourc to enhanc secur is like to detract from advanc in product for a  e
how about    necessari realloc of resourc      i think that was somebodi   s suggest   that sound a littl better
that   s better
but the econom slowdown all by itself produc a reduct in product
no  the refer here is to structur product   i might note that the es  for product in the third quarter is go to be come out tomorrow   i don   t know what the precis number is go to be  but it   s go to show strong product in the quarter   if we subtract out the septemb   th problem  it would be support of the fact that there have been structur chang in product in the last four or five year
so it   s not cyclic product we   re talk about
no  i realiz that
mr  chairman  could i offer a slight differ perspect   it may be consist with what is bother cathi   the last claus is a clear statement that product growth            is good   i might think that and everybodi around this tabl might think that   but hypothet  suppos    year ago we had substitut for the term    to enhanc secur    the phrase    to clean up the air and the water      the vast major of peopl believ that whatev is be done in our countri to enhanc secur is for the good   for the tone of our statement to somehow suggest that it is realli unfortun that our countri has to do this  i think is veri undesir
that   s my point exact   you state it so much better than i did
i agre with that   that   s whi the word    necessari realloc
i don   t think that take away the negat tenor
pardon me  but it   s a measur issu  isn   t it   the gdp  sn   t measur increas secur  it  sn   t give better secur a posit weight   is there a way to get the word    measur    in here  speaker      measur product
yes  that may do it
we   re tri to get across a veri sophist concept here
yes  measur product   i think the key question as far as the statement goe is   do we want to leav in    and protect against product disrupt
yes  right
i don   t think we need that
the sentenc is veri long   let me read it and see whether or not we need that phrase      although the necessari      do we want to say    realloc    or    divers     sever      realloc
realloc    is more posit
although the necessari realloc of resourc to enhanc secur is like to detract from measur advanc in product for a  e  the long term prospect for product growth and the economi remain favor and should becom evid onc the unusu forc restrain demand abat
did you keep in    advanc in product    or did you say    measur product
the first refer is to measur product   the second one is to true product growth so i would leav the word    measur    out
but one could argu  along the line that presid jordan did  that the actual product of the u s  economi is better becaus of what might have been look at as overhead expenditur on clean air and clean water   this realloc of resourc may turn out not to be a terribl develop
let me tell you what the problem is   if we   re go to get into this  we   ve got a serious problem  which is whether in fact we   re measur effici or improv in the qualiti of our standard of live
environment and other type of control do not increas effici   they improv the qualiti of life   measur product is effici
the improv qualiti of life could make the overal labor forc more effici
it   s conceiv  but that   s not what is be measur  one way of look at it is that a lot of activ basic don   t benefit us becaus they are in some sens protect   a big chunk of medic expenditur fall into that categori  it depend on whether the expens is for prevent or curat purpos   what i   m tri to get at here is that this involv a veri serious conceptu problem
we don   t want to get into that
no  we don   t   but i also don   t think we want to come out with a statement that could be interpret negat   grant  there are a zillion differ sophist argument one can make about whi this statement is true   i still think the public interpret of it will be negat with regard to secur
can we say    the appropri realloc of resourc      i made the statement in tes oni to congress in veri much this way   i got veri posit respons
absolut   i disput the major premis here  which is that it   s negat   i don   t find it negat for the feder reserv to say that invest in secur is a good thing  which is in my view what we   re say   i absolut fail to see how that   s negat
well  mayb it   s just an interpret   i think invest in secur is a good thing right now   that   s what we need
mr  chairman  if you want to appear more neutral  the verb    detract    may also seem negat
so if instead it said    is like to slow the advanc in measur product    i think that would pretti much go in the direct of neutral
i think that   s veri good   i   d suggest the languag    may restrain advanc in product     which is shorter and less awkward
how about    may restrain advanc in near term measur of product
you   re on a roll  al    laughter
let   s do it
may restrain advanc
yes  in that context we don   t realli need measur   let me reread it      although the     do you want to say necessari or appropri  speaker         appropri
although the appropri realloc of resourc to enhanc secur may restrain advanc in product for a  e  the long term prospect    etc
that   s shorter
i think that   it  speaker      all right
may i just ask a question   in the second paragraph  third line  is the phrase    for the forese futur    new in this statement
no  it   s part of the boilerpl
we had it in previous statement
oh yes  it   s part of the boilerpl
we   ve had that in our statement sinc the   committe came up with it
it   s in a slight differ locat in this statement  but we alway use it
mr  chairman  may i suggest that the committe reconsid use the word    necessari    to describ the realloc of resourc rather than    appropri      sever peopl suggest    necessari    dure the cours of the discuss and i think it may be a littl better there
i think that   s a good suggest   is that okay with everybodi  sever   yes
i didn   t think we could rewrit the press statement as a committe  but we did   the next meet is decemb            we adjourn for lunch  end of meet
