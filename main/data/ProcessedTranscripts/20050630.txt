thank you  mr  chairman   we have five brief this afternoon and  the issu cover in those brief are so intertwin that we thought it would be best if we just   present all five and then open the floor for discuss and question afterward   we recogn that a long present  come right after lunch and while a number of you are still probabl a bit jet lag  could test your power of concentr  but i think you   ll find the present to be both well inform and entertain    laughter   so with that we   ll begin
thank you   my present begin on the third page of the handout you receiv   it seem that everybodi is talk about hous price  and the upper panel of  your first exhibit show whi   hous price  adjust for general inflat  have risen at a rapid pace in recent year and did not even paus dure the last recess  inde  the real rate of appreci has increas  and the most recent read have  been at annual rate greater than   percent   by comparison  the averag annual  increas in real hous price dure the past    year is onli about    percent   the next two panel illustr some of the eye pop gain that have been record in select metropolitan area   for exampl  as shown in the middl left panel  real hous price increas about    percent in san francisco and    percent in las vega dure the four quarter period end in the first quarter  as shown to  the right  the most recent gain was    percent in new york and    percent in miami   rapid price appreci has spark debat about whether hous has becom  overvalu  and the popular press is fill with stori suggest that it has   as summar in the lower left panel  anecdot suggest that the hous market is overh includ those about increas specul  purchas decis that are  perhap too depend on rosi assess of futur appreci  and increas  relianc on novel form of financ without full recognit of the associ risk   although these anecdot are suggest  they do not provid a benchmark for valu hous   two approach that do provid a benchmark are list to the right   one is to ask if hous is afford for a typic famili   some analyst have  argu that price are too high relat to incom  while other say low interest rate  have kept requir month mortgag payment afford   anoth approach is to  ask if hous price are proper align with rent   i have pursu both approach  in my research  and have conclud that rent provid a prefer benchmark for valu hous   i will therefor focus my prepar remark on this approach   as summar in the upper left panel of your next exhibit  a strength of this  approach is that it employ a standard asset price framework  such as that often use in studi of stock market valuat   in this framework  rental payment in the  hous market are analog to dividend in the stock market   seen this way  the      the materi use by messr  gallin  lehnert  peach  rudebusch  and   are append to this transcript      appendix       price of a hous should reflect the appropri discount stream of expect rent  high price could be justifi by high rent or by low carri cost  which includ   interest payment  net tax  and depreci   but if price appear unusu high relat to rent and carri cost  one might conclud that hous is overvalu   as highlight to the right  i have implement the framework use repeat transact price index from the offic of feder hous enterpris oversight   ofheo  and freddi mac and the tenant    rent index from the consum price index   i made sever adjust to these seri to address some of the shortcom of the publish data   as you will see in dick peach   s present  he and i disagre about the best way to measur hous price   i would be happi to  discuss the issu dure the question period   that said  the red line in the middl panel show the es  price rent ratio for the stock of hous  and the black line show the es  real carri cost of hous   the first point to note is that the measur price rent ratio is current higher than at ani earlier  e for which we have data   moreov  the run up in price appear to be far greater than can be explain by carri cost  at least if we  use the histor relationship between the two seri as our guid   although theori suggest a tight link between carri cost and the price rent ratio  the data suggest that the actual link is more tenuous   at the simplest level  while the price rent ratio is at a histor high  the carri cost is not at a histor low   more formal  regress analysi suggest that price are about    percent too high given rent and carri cost   one might reason ask what this potenti    percent overvalu portend for hous price   the lower panel summar the histor experi on this  question   the panel show a scatter plot of the price rent ratio  on the horizont axi  and chang in real hous price over the subsequ three year  on the  vertic axi   the panel also includ a fit regress line   as i mention a moment ago  carri cost are onli slight correl with the price rent ratio  thus  their effect can be exclud from the chart without materi affect the result   the downward slope of the regress line summar a key find   when  hous price have been high relat to rent  subsequ price chang have  typic been smaller than usual   for exampl  on the right side of the panel we can see that in the second quarter of       the price rent ratio stood abov     and real price decreas   percent dure the subsequ three year   near the other end of the scale  in the third quarter of      the price rent ratio stood just abov     and real price increas more than   percent dure the subsequ three year  howev  as is readili appar from the chart  the relationship is loos   most notabl  in the first quarter of       the last observ for which we have a read for the subsequ three year chang in hous price  the price rent ratio stood at      although the regress suggest that real price should have been about flat sinc    then  real price actual increas more than    percent  and the price rent ratio rose  to about      liter off the chart   to give an impress of what has happen in local market  the upper panel of your next chart summar hous market condit for four metropolitan area   san francisco  new york  chicago  and miami   the panel display the  deviat of each citi   s price rent ratio from it long run level in the second quarter  of       the red bar   the fourth quarter of       the black bar   and the first  quarter of       the   bar    the number abov the bar indic their height  the first two episod repres previous peak of the price rent ratio at the nation  level   the third episod is where we are now   the number below the red and black bar show the perform of real hous price in each citi in the three year follow each episod   for instanc  as shown by the red bar  the price rent ratio in san francisco was   percent abov it long run level in the middl of        dure the subsequ three year  real hous price there fell   percent   at the end of       the black bar  the price rent ratio in san  francisco was    percent abov it long run level  and real price there fell     percent dure the subsequ three year   the most recent read for san francisco indic that the price rent ratio is now further abov it long run level  than in either      or        the price rent ratio suggest that hous is overvalu in the other three citi as well  but to differ degre   although the price rent ratio in new york is elev  hous   not look much more overvalu there than it did in the late     s   hous price appear elev relat to rent in chicago as well  but it is miami that stand out as the most overh of the four market shown here   the evid that i have shown you so far suggest that rent provid a loos  tether for hous price  price deviat from their long run relationship with rent for  extend period  but not indefinit   howev  to provid a forecast of hous price  we must consid both the long run relationship between price and rent and the short run dynam among price and other econom factor   the middl left panel of your exhibit list sever factor that affect real hous price dynam in the short run   in particular  the board   s staff has found that a basic model should  includ lag chang in hous price  as well as chang in real incom  real carri cost  and the unemploy rate   this basic model   not take a stand on whether hous is overvalu   altern  our error correct model add to the basic model the lag level of the price rent ratio and the lag level of  carri cost   it therefor provid a formal way to model short run dynam  around a long run equilibrium level   the es  coeffici on the lag price rent ratio is negat  captur the idea that there is a long run relationship between  hous price and rent and that price chang are restrain when price are high relat to rent     the middl right panel show the implic of these two model for the four quarter percent chang in real hous price at the nation level dure the  book forecast period   the basic model   in     suggest that hous price will deceler in the come two year  but that they will still rise fa  than their long run averag of about    percent per year   thus  even a model that ignor the long run relationship between the level of price and rent predict a slowdown in  hous price appreci   still  hous would becom slight more overvalu relat to rent at the end of the forecast period   the error correct model   in red   call for price to deceler more in the come two year  with real price actual edg down a bit in        in this  scenario  hous would be about    percent overvalu at the end of the forecast period   note that the june  book forecast   the black line   lie between the two model simul   to sum up  the statist evid that i have present today provid support  for the view that the price rent ratio can be a use tool for summar hous  valuat   the price rent ratio is current veri high by histor standard  suggest that hous might be overvalu by as much as    percent   histor experi suggest that the chang in real hous price go forward will be slower than in recent year   unfortun  the evid cannot rule out either further rapid gain in hous price for a  e or a more rapid correct back to  fundament   just as the price dividend ratio is an imperfect tool for forecast  stock price  the price rent ratio should be consid onli a rough guid to valuat in the hous market  thank you
as josh note  everyon   s talk about hous price  but  they also seem to be talk a great deal about mortgag   the popular consensus appear to be that homebuy  especi in hot hous market  now make token down payment and can just scrape into their home by resort to interest onli  mortgag  in this view  borrow and lender alik are vulner to ani fall in hous price   in my prepar remark i will address each of these issu    an obvious measur of the vulner of a borrow to a declin in his hous price is the ratio of the current mortgag balanc to the current valu of his home    this ratio is known as the current loan to valu  or ltv  ratio   the top panel of your  first exhibit compar the distribut of the es  current ltv as of septemb       the black bar  with the distribut as of march       the red bar     as shown by the leftmost red bar     percent of borrow current have ltvs   below    percent   move to the right  a further    percent current have ltvs between    and    percent     percent have ltvs between    and    percent  and onli   percent have ltvs of    percent and abov   moreov  the recent rapid appreci in hous price has actual outstrip mortgag debt growth  so that the averag ltv has fallen over the past    month     the middl left panel use the same data to concentr on the most leverag borrow   for a given drop in nomin hous price  the horizont axi   the vertic axi give the percent of borrow who would have negat equiti   as befor  the black line reflect data from septemb      while the red line reflect the most recent data   as shown by the red line  follow a hous price drop of    percent  an es    percent of borrow would have negat equiti  while a drop of    percent would leav about    percent of borrow in negat territori   the middl right panel summar averag ltvs at origin for home purchas in       by state  relat to price appreci in that state over the previous four year   state with lower than averag appreci  such as utah  texa  and oklahoma  are at the left  while state with fa  than averag appreci  such as california  massachusett  and new york are at the right   as  shown  ltv at origin in      was actual lower in state with more appreci   thus  homebuy in california and other high appreci state made larger down payment relat to the price of their hous than homebuy in low appreci state such as oklahoma   increas home equiti  main driven by rise hous price  has support mortgag credit qualiti in recent quarter   the bottom left panel plot delinqu rate for loan held on bank    book  the black line  as well as for the broader mba  mortgag banker associ  measur  the red line    both have fallen signific in recent year   the bottom right panel summar the vulner of borrow to hous price shock   the averag ltv on mortgag has declin over the past    month  and most household current have substanti equiti in their home   in the past few year  borrow have benefit from rapid rise hous price  which have kept mortgag delinqu at extrem low level   howev  an es    percent of borrow are high leverag and could lose all of their home equiti if hous price were to fall    percent    as i note earlier  recent anecdot report have highlight a second potenti risk lurk within mortgag market   the sudden popular of interest onli mortgag   these are the subject of your next exhibit    the statist present in exhibit   are taken exclus from data on privat label   that is  non gse  govern sponsor enterpris    residenti mortgag back secur  or rmbs  pool   the overwhelm advantag of these pool for my purpos are that they are veri transpar  that is  a great deal of inform is avail on the under mortgag and that they contain mani heterodox mortgag  includ interest onli mortgag   mani of the recent press articl cite the growth of novel mortgag are base on rmbs pool data and thus  becaus such mortgag are overrepres in rmbs pool  have exagger  in my view  the role of heterodox mortgag      turn to the data  line   of the top left panel show that the dollar valu of rmbs pool has near doubl over the past two year   moreov  as shown in line    rmbs pool back by interest onli  or io  mortgag have increas almost  sixfold  and now amount to near      billion   howev  total home mortgag debt  line    has also increas over the past two year   as shown in the memo line   interest onli rmbs pool now account for     percent of all home mortgag debt  up from less than   percent two year ago  but still a small share of all mortgag   as their name impli  interest onli mortgag do not requir the borrow to make princip payment  at least dure an initi period   borrow will to use io mortgag could qualifi for a larger mortgag and thus be abl to buy a more expens hous   the top right panel give some idea of the relationship between price appreci and the popular of io mortgag   the vertic axi show the fraction of io mortgag use to purchas hous  by state  in        again  i should emphas that the io share are calcul within the rmbs world  and so are probabl overst   the horizont axi give state level hous price appreci from      through        as you can see  io mortgag are somewhat more popular  in state that saw more appreci  although  as seen in the inset box  the correl is not particular strong   while the princip valu of an io loan  sn   t declin  if the initi down payment is larg enough  the borrow may have a substanti equiti cushion against  price shock   the middl panel report the ltv at origin for io loan made over the past three year   as shown  most io mortgag had ltvs below    percent  although the trend over  e has been away from the veri lowest ltvs   that said  lender have continu to make relat few io loan with ltvs abov    percent   those higher ltv loan now account for about    percent of all outstand io    final  anecdot often emphas that io loan are extend to borrow with lower credit qualiti   the bottom panel show the distribut of credit qualiti  measur by fico score  among io borrow   as a rough approxim  most  lender defin prime qualiti borrow as those with fico score of     or abov   the leftmost set of bar thus repres subprim borrow   as shown  between   and    percent of io loan have been extend to these borrow   move to the  right  the next two set of bar show that the great major of io borrow had solid credit score between     and       as shown by the rightmost set of bar  about    percent of io borrow had credit score abov       on the whole  therefor  the credit qualiti of borrow use interest onli loan   not appear particular riski   one might wonder if financi institut and investor have  in the face of the continu hous boom  drop their defens against the mortgag loss that would accompani a hous price bust   the top left panel of your next exhibit list  the main institut expos to residenti mortgag credit risk and the main type of mortgag held by these institut   the hous gses  line    almost   exclus hold or guarante conform mortgag with fix rate   privat mortgag insur  line    insur the compon of mortgag princip that exceed     percent of the properti   s valu and so are effect expos to the credit risk associ with high ltv loan   rmbs pool  line     as well as bank and thrift  line     hold a wide varieti of differ mortgag type  includ tradit fix rate mortgag as well as variabl rate and junior lien    the top right panel emphas that the hous gses hold veri littl credit risk   as shown on line    the averag ltv at origin of gse guarante mortgag was    percent  base on region hous price appreci  the es  current ltv of these mortgag  line    has fallen to    percent   the averag credit    score of the under borrow  line    is also solid in the    prime    categori  obvious  these averag valu mask some variat in the borrow popul  which no doubt contain some higher risk borrow   howev  as shown on line       percent of the mortgag guarante by the gses carri some form of credit enhanc   if one of these mortgag default  the gse receiv a payment from  the insur  usual a privat mortgag insur  or pmi  compani   the middl left panel examin the health of the pmi industri   as shown by the black line  left axi   the ratio of total

show net underwrit incom   that is  incom from  premium less loss and expens  relat to capit   after suffer larg loss in the late     s  pmi compani have consist record posit underwrit incom   in sum  pmi compani appear to have built up a histor larg cushion to absorb the loss that might be associ with a widespread drop in real estat  valu   the middl right panel analyz the risk pose to investor in rmbs pool   these pool contain some of the riskier outstand mortgag   howev  they are  structur so that investor can choos their risk exposur   further  rmbs pool are  except transpar  so investor have extens inform on each mortgag  in the pool   in principl  investor should have understood  and appropri price  the risk inher in these mortgag   in practic  howev  investor price these  mortgag use loss model  which are es  use relat littl data from major hous price declin   the bottom two panel discuss the exposur of the       bank and thrift in  the unit state to residenti mortgag credit risk   the panel to the left divid  institut into quartil by the fraction of their portfolio account for by residenti mortgag asset  defin as whole loan  home equiti line of credit  non gse rmbs pool  and residu tranch on securit mortgag   as shown  for  institut in the bottom quartil  mortgag account for less than   percent of total asset   this fraction rise by quartil until  for institut at the top  mortgag    account for more than    percent of asset   residenti mortgag credit risk is more concentr at these institut than at the institut in the lower quartil   the panel to the right show the averag size and capit to asset ratio of  institut in each of the quartil   read down the first column  which give averag institut size  one can see that smaller institut are concentr in the first two quartil  which have relat littl mortgag exposur   read down the second column  which give averag tier   capit ratio  institut in all quartil are extrem well capit   thus  institut with larg amount of mortgag credit risk on their portfolio are well posit to handl sever loss   to sum up  neither borrow nor lender appear particular shaki   inde  the evid point in the opposit direct  borrow have larg equiti cushion  interest onli mortgag are not an especi sinist develop  and financi institut are quit healthi   nonetheless  even the most sanguin analyst quail when contempl a histor unpreced drop in nationwid nomin hous price   such a drop will obvious hurt both borrow and lender and will also no doubt expos weak that will onli be obvious in hindsight   thus  perhap it would be best simpli to ventur the judgment that the nation mortgag system  might bend  but will like not break  in the face of a larg drop in hous price  that conclud my prepar remark
hard a day goe by without anoth anecdot laden articl in the press claim that the u s  is experienc a hous bubbl that will soon  burst  with disastr consequ for the economi   inde  hous market activ has been quit robust for some  e now  with start and sale of singl famili home reach all  e high in recent month and home price rise rapid  particular along the east and west coast of the countri   but such activ could be the result of solid fundament under the hous market   after all   both nomin and real long term interest rate have declin substanti over the last decad   product growth has been surpris strong sinc the mid     s  produc rapid real incom growth primarili for those in the upper half of the  incom distribut   and the larg babi boom generat has enter it peak  earn year and appear to have strong prefer for larg home load with  amen   one of the condit of an asset bubbl is that the price of the asset has risen well abov what is consist with under fundament   in the current debat  two measur of relat valu have been appli to singl famili home price    price relat to incom and rent relat to price   in the comment that follow i will  concentr on the price to incom measur  but my conclus appli equal to the rent to price measur   in most analys of the ratio of home price to incom  the measur of home price that is use is the repeat sale home price index publish by the offic of feder hous enterpris oversight  exhibit      this index track chang in the     averag price of home purchas  or mortgag refinanc  with loan purchas by fanni mae and freddi mac  or conform convent loan   therefor  it  exclud cash sale as well as purchas or refinanc financ with fha  feder hous administr   va  veteran affair   and jumbo convent  mortgag   it is call a repeat sale index becaus it is deriv by observ the  sale price   or apprais valu  in the case of refinanc   of properti at  specif address at two or more point in  e   final  it is a transact base index in that it reflect the price of home that are sold  or refinanc  rather than the entir univers of singl famili home   a lesser known home price index is the constant qualiti new home price index publish by the bureau of the census  exhibit      this index is base on a sampl of new home sold  regardless of how the sale was financ   hedon method are employ to hold the physic and locat characterist constant over  e  this index is part of the census bureau statist program through which the singl famili residenti invest deflat of the nation incom and product account is deriv   as shown in exhibit    the increas in price indic by these two index is quit differ   for exampl  over the four year from      to       the ofheo index increas at a compound annual rate  of     percent  while the constant qualiti index increas at a     percent annual rate   as shown in exhibit    the current ratio of price over median famili incom deriv from these two index is vast differ   if the ofheo index is give an accur pictur of what is happen to home price  i think one could say with some confid that price have been bid up to unsustain level   howev  if the constant qualiti index is a better reflect of realiti  home  price actual look somewhat low relat to median famili incom  particular compar to the late     s   i believ the constant qualiti index provid a more accur indic of what is happen to the price of a typic singl famili home   in contrast  the ofheo index is subject to upward bias that accumul over  e and distort ratio such as price to incom and incom to rent   to help us understand the bias in  the ofheo index  exhibit   present the distribut by valu of all singl famili home in the u s  in       with the specif valu at the   th    th    th  and   th percentil     the median valu in      was          with the distribut skew toward the right   the valu at the   th percentil was         while the valu at the   th percentil was            we do not know with certainti where  the ofheo index fall on this distribut  as it is an index rather than a seri of valu   but we can be reason certain that it lie somewher between the averag price of all exist singl famili home sold and the averag price of home purchas with convent loan   that mean the ofheo index is a closer reflect of what is happen at the   th percentil rather than the   th percentil   moreov  it is veri like that over  e the point on that distribut repres by the ofheo index has been drift to the right   one      in the american hous survey  home valu are self report   previous research has conclud that self   report valu tend to overst somewhat the price at which a properti would actual sell   we are limit to the         th percentil due to top code of the home valu variabl    caus of this rightward drift is what i call transact bias   as shown in exhibit    the american hous survey  ah  data suggest that both appreci rate and turnov rate increas as one move out the home valu distribut   for exampl  from      to      the compound annual rate of appreci at the   th percentil was     percent  increas to     percent at the   th percentil   correspond averag turnov rate for the period from      to      were     percent and     percent   that mean  of cours  that the averag rate of appreci of the unit that turn over is higher than the averag rate of appreci of the entir distribut  while the amount of bias in ani one year is like to be small  it   cumul over  e and becom quit import when one is compar level versus incom or rent   anoth potenti upward bias in the ofheo index is that while it is a repeat sale index  there is evid to suggest that it is not a constant qualiti index   in addit to the strong pace of new hous start  anoth aspect of the hous boom of the past decad has been a signific increas addit and alter to the exist hous stock   exhibit   present in the top panel the ratio of the ofheo index over the constant qualiti index plot over the  period from      to the present   in the lower panel are plot real improv per unit of hous stock per year over the same period   over the past decad real improv per unit have increas about    percent  which appear to be associ with a further increas in the ratio of the ofheo index over the constant qualiti home price index   research suggest  that higher incom household have a higher incom elast of demand for improv to their primari resid  suggest that this sourc of upward bias is like to be more pronounc in the right half of the distribut of all singl famili home      anoth way of look at the issu of home price over incom is to go back to the ah data and see what is happen at various point on the distribut of all singl famili home   this inform is present in exhibit     at the   th percentil the ratio of  home price to incom has been relat stabl  while it has increas sharpli at the   th and   th percentil  reminisc of the price to  incom ratio comput with the ofheo index   let me paus just a moment and emphas that i am compar home price at a percentil with the incom of the peopl who live in those home at the same percentil   this chart is like the equival of the find that the increas of home price has been most pronounc in area of the countri where home price were alreadi relat high due in part to relat inelast suppli   it is like that in these area of the countri  where land valu are high  the inclin to make substanti improv to exist properti is the greatest   clear  not everyon agre that the constant qualiti new home price index provid an accur indic of what is happen to the price of a typic singl famili home   for exampl  it has been  argu that most new construct take      see joseph gyourko and joseph traci            use home mainten and repair to smooth variabl        earn     feder reserv bank of new york work paper seri    place at the fring of metropolitan area where land price may not be rise as fast as is intra margin land   there are sever counter argument   first  the theori  lead to the conclus that intra margin land valu increas at a fa  rate than land at the fring is base on a theori of the develop of a metropolitan area with fair restrict assumpt   modern metropolitan area have multipl commerci employ center   mani household have prefer for rural or  suburban resid over urban resid   restrict on develop to counter suburban sprawl have report result in sharp increas in price of parcel of  land suitabl for home build   final  i would like to note that the increas in  land price implicit in the constant qualiti home price index  shown in exhibit    are substanti  particular in the northeast and the west   these es  were deriv  assum that land repres    percent of the valu of the total properti and that the price of the other input increas at the same rate in all region of the countri    in close  i would like to comment on one other aspect of the hous bubbl issu that has receiv substanti attent   earlier this year a major real estat relat trade associ releas the result of a survey indic that a signific percentag of singl famili home sale were of invest properti and second home   this was wide interpret as evid of specul buy of rental  properti  anoth featur of a hous bubbl   again  i believ that such report  should be view skeptic   accord to the ah  in      singl famili invest properti  defin as home renter occupi or for rent  repres      percent of all singl famili home while second home repres anoth     percent   therefor  we should not be surpris that such properti repres about    percent of the sale that take place at ani point in  e   moreov  the american   hous survey data indic that singl famili invest properti have been declin as a share of all singl famili home for some  e and declin in  absolut number from      to        a princip reason the rental vacanc rate for  singl famili home has risen in recent year is that the number of renter occupi singl famili home has declin as peopl switch from rent to own   so if a lot of peopl are buy rental properti  it must also be the case that a lot are sell as well   that conclud my report   thank you
i will review some general issu relat to monetari   polici and asset price   let me start   at the top of page     by assum that an asset price can  in theori at least  be separ into a compon determin by under econom fundament and a non fundament or bubbl compon  an asset price may be in line with it fundament  so the bubbl compon is zero  or bubbl could be posit or negat   perhap repres irrat euphoria or pessim   two type of monetari polici respons to movement in an asset price have   been propos   i refer to the first type as    standard polici    becaus there is  widespread agreement that it repres the minimum appropri polici respons   the standard polici respond to an asset price to the extent it convey inform to the central bank about the futur path of output and inflat   the goal variabl    of monetari polici   for exampl  a boom stock market is usual follow by higher demand and increas inflationari pressur  so tighter polici would be need to offset these consequ   even for the standard polici respons  it will like be use to identifi  if possibl  the separ compon of the asset price   in particular  the bubbl compon may exhibit more volatil dynam and be a pernici sourc of macroeconom risk  so op  polici would like react more to bubbl than to movement in the fundament compon   the second type of respons  the    bubbl polici     follow the standard polici as a base case  but  in certain circumst  it also take step to contain or reduc the asset price bubbl   propon of a bubbl polici argu that movement in the  bubbl compon can have serious advers consequ for macroeconom perform that monetari polici cannot readili offset after the fact  so it is   prefer to tri to elimin this sourc of macroeconom fluctuat direct  furthermor  becaus bubbl often seem to display a self reinforc behavior  a littl preemption and prevent earli on can avoid later excess   a best case scenario for these two polici is illustr in the lower half of the  first page   under ideal circumst  the policymak know the fundament and bubbl compon  and as histori unfold  the standard polici would like recommend higher interest rate to offset ani econom s ulus generat by the bubbl befor the crash and lower rate afterward   a bubbl polici would go further and tri to mitig the fluctuat in the bubbl and achiev an asset price path like ap  ²t    this would like requir higher interest rate than the standard  polici befor the crash and lower rate afterward  and it will like trade off near term deviat from the central bank   s macroeconom goal for better overal macroeconom perform later on   the fundament differ between the two polici is that the standard polici take the bubbl compon essenti as given or exogen  while the bubbl polici take into account the endogen natur of the bubbl compon   specif  a linkag between the polici instrument and the bubbl    a decis tree for choos between the standard and bubbl polici is shown on page     in brief  it ask three question      can policymak identifi a  bubbl       will fallout from a bubbl be signific and hard to rectifi ex post   and     is monetari polici the right method to use to deflat the bubbl    the answer to the first question   can policymak identifi a bubbl    is    no    if the particular asset price appear align with fundament   some have argu  that this is near alway the case becaus es  of fundament are so imprecis and becaus asset price reflect the collect inform and wisdom of  profession trader in organ market   if policymak cannot discern a bubbl  then the standard polici is the onli feasibl respons   but suppos an asset price bubbl is identifi   then the second hurdl is whether bubbl fluctuat have signific macroeconom fallout that monetari    polici cannot readili offset after the fact   a negat answer to this question is appropri in two situat   first  if the bubbl is in an asset market that is small in domest econom term   for exampl  a local real estat market   then a  central banker should avoid attempt at asset price realign   second  even when there are signific macroeconom consequ from an asset price bubbl boom  and bust  if they occur with a suffici lag so the policymak can adopt a wait and  see attitud  then the standard polici is again appropri   this second case seem relev if fluctuat in the bubbl compon have onli convent effect on aggreg demand and suppli through chang in wealth  the cost of capit  and  balanc sheet   then  to a first approxim  the lag involv in these channel  are about as long as the lag in the monetari transmiss mechan  therefor  the  standard polici should suffic   for exampl  fluctuat in equiti price will affect  wealth and consum demand  but a nimbl central banker can essenti offset  these consequ by chang interest rate in reaction to   that is  after   the equiti price movement     now to the case where asset price movement have signific macroeconom consequ and those consequ are hard to clean up after the fact through monetari polici   the most often mention possibl is that a burst asset price bubbl will lead to a broad financi crisi and credit crunch   such financi instabl is like to be transmit to the economi much more quick than can be offset by interest rate polici   this may set the stage for invok a bubbl polici  anoth exampl is when the asset price misalign result in signific misalloc of resourc  which distort aggreg demand and suppli across sector and over  e and imped the achiev of the highest possibl long run  econom growth   for exampl  the dot com bubbl spur overinvest in fiber optic cabl and decim the provis of ventur capit for new technolog  startup for year   of cours  after the fact  it is difficult to unwind these problem  with the blunt instrument of monetari polici  and  depend on the specif  it is  possibl to conceiv of a situat in which reduc the bubbl in advanc is a prefer polici strategi    the final hurdl befor invok a bubbl polici involv assess whether  monetari polici is the right way to deflat the asset price bubbl   ideal  for the  bubbl polici  a moder adjust of interest rate could constrain the bubbl and great reduc the risk of sever futur macroeconom disloc   howev  bubbl  even if identifi  often do not appear influenc by monetari polici  action in a predict way   furthermor  even if chang interest rate could alter the bubbl path  such a strategi may involv substanti cost  includ near term deviat from the macroeconom goal of the central bank as well as potenti polit or moral hazard complic   final  even if monetari polici can affect the bubbl  altern strategi to deflat it  such as chang in financi regul or supervis  may be more target and have a lower cost    this decis tree is a daunt tripl jump  but not a total prohibit against bubbl reduct   inde  page   suggest differ real  e answer to these three    question for two histor episod   the first episod is the run up in the stock market dure the late     s   in      and       one could have made the case that  there was an equiti price bubbl in the high technolog sector and perhap in the overal market as well   also  dure that  e  the possibl capit misalloc from the run up in price and the possibl financi instabl that might have follow a burst of the bubbl may have appear difficult to rectifi   howev  it was also unlik that monetari polici could have deflat the equiti price bubbl  without substanti cost to the economi   in the event  of cours  a bubbl polici was not follow  but arguabl  the consequ from ani bubbl boom and bust have been manag   a differ exampl is provid by the bond market collaps in        one could argu that this    inflat scare     which push up yield on    year bond by over   percentag point  result in an asset price misalign that was fair  appar to the fomc dure the second half of        if this bond bubbl had persist  the widespread propag of the associ fear of higher inflat could have had sever consequ that would have been cost to unwind with  monetari polici later on   final  with regard to deflat  it did appear like that monetari polici could guid bond price back to fundament   inde  one interpret of the fomc   s action in      is that it purpos and success   contain a bond market bubbl with sizabl increas in the fund rate   it is an   open question which of these two episod is the more relev one today   that conclud my remark
i   ll be refer to the exhibit begin on page      in my present today  i   ll lay out a few scenario that illustr the potenti macroeconom fallout result from a signific declin in hous price  and i will examin polici respons that minim it   i   ll start by describ the possibl size of the current problem   assum there is one   as point out in dick peach   s present  there are serious difficulti in accur measur both actual and    fundament    hous price   but  for the purpos of my present  i will take as a work hypothesi that hous price are high relat to fundament   or  in term of the decis tree that   just  laid out  i assum that the answer to his question   is    yes  the asset price appear  misalign      as josh gallin indic  it would take up to a    percent declin in hous price to bring the price to rent ratio back in line with fundament   with  hous wealth stand at around     trillion today  such a drop in hous price would extinguish      trillion of household wealth   that   s equal to about    percent of gdp   base on a margin propens to consum from hous wealth of     cent on the dollar  this declin in wealth would entail a near     percentag point  increas in the person save rate   and  accord to es  from the frb us  model  it impli a    basi point reduct in the long run neutral real fund rate   it may be use to put these figur into context by compar them to those associ with the stock market overvalu reach in earli        stock price    at that  e were arguabl some    to    percent overvalu   correct of price to fundament at that  e would have impli a reduct in household wealth of      trillion  equal to about    percent of contemporan gdp   in the event  stock market wealth fell by      trillion between march      and march       and at it lowest point was down      trillion   there is consider uncertainti regard the magnitud of the effect of chang in stock market and hous wealth on household spend  nonetheless  it seem clear the magnitud of the current  potenti problem is much smaller than  and perhap onli half as larg as  that of the  stock market bubbl   of cours  if hous price continu to soar   and in the san  francisco bay area  at least  they show no sign of slow   the magnitud of the hous overvalu problem will rise as well   a cautionari note worth emphas is that the monetari polici cushion avail today  as measur by the prevail feder fund rate  is notic smaller than it was in earli      at the peak of the stock market   the first question that come to mind is  what should monetari polici do  if anyth  about the appar overvalu in hous price   the answer to that depend crucial on the answer to     s second question     do bubbl  fluctuat result in larg macroeconom consequ that monetari polici cannot readili offset      therefor  i now explor the effect of a bubbl collaps and the abil of polici to respond effect to them   i consid three scenario in which a hous bubbl deflat relat quick  i use the frb us model to quantifi these effect   note that for the materi post last wednesday  i base my simul on the april  book project   i have   sinc updat the simul  and the one that i will be show today are base on the extend june  book project   in each scenario  i assum that hous  price fall by    percent relat to the baselin over the next     year   in the first two scenario  i consid the effect of exogen declin in hous  price that appar come    out of the blue     the third scenario consid the possibl of an interrel declin in both bond and hous price   for each scenario  i consid two type of monetari polici respons   the first is the op   perfect foresight polici that is veri similar to those report in past bluebook   the  path of polici is chosen to minim the sum of the squar deviat of the unemploy rate and the core pce  person consumpt expenditur  price inflat rate from their respect target and the squar chang in the fund rate  with the latter receiv relat littl weight   perfect foresight mean that the policymak today has advanc knowledg of all futur shock to the economi   i  assum that the inflat object is     percent and that the unemploy rate   target is   percent  equal to the staff   s es  of the nairu  non acceler inflat rate of unemploy    the second polici is one that respond onli to  event as they occur and   not respond direct to anticip futur develop relat to hous price   for this purpos  i use a modifi version of the taylor rule  with a coeffici of   on the output gap and of    on the inflat   gap  and with the long run natur rate of interest that appear in the rule vari in  accord with sustain chang in hous wealth and bond premium   the second page of my exhibit show the result from model simul of a    percent declin in hous price  where onli the standard channel includ in the  frb us model are in play   for comparison  i have also plot the baselin path  base on the june extend  book project but modifi under the  assumpt that monetari polici is set op  in the way i just describ  becaus a declin in hous price primarili influenc demand  not suppli  it    not pose a difficult tradeoff between polici goal   in addit  accord to the model  the macroeconom effect play out gradual and are moder in magnitud  give polici  e to respond   the op  polici call for a path for the fund rate that averag about    percent dure      and        about    basi  point below the baselin path   under this polici  the unemploy and inflat rate are near the same as in the baselin   the veri small rise in inflat reflect the effect of the depreci of the dollar result from the reduct in domest interest rate   the modifi taylor rule is abl to mimic the outcom under the op   polici reason well  indic that polici need not fulli anticip futur hous price declin to be effect  but can simpli respond to event as they unfold   note that if the hous price declin were larger  or the margin propens to consum out of hous wealth bigger   then the polici implic would simpli be to cut rate by proport more   in summari  assum that the frb us model   a good job of captur the  macroeconom implic of declin hous price  such an event   not pose  a particular difficult challeng for monetari polici   one linger concern  howev  is that the model may be miss other import avenu by which larg  movement in hous price affect the economi   i now consid a scenario that  entertain that possibl   in the second scenario  i incorpor extra model spillov from fall hous price  presum reflect a declin in confid and an extinguish of household spend that had been fuel by equiti extract from mortgag refinanc  as describ in the    heighten spend respons    simul report in the june  book   import  the demand spillov are assum to have a veri differ dynam from the model   s standard wealth effect  they kick in much more rapid and eventu dissip so that they have no long run effect   as shown in the next page of the exhibit  owe to the extra drag from these spillov  the op  polici call for a seri of rate cut  bring the fund rate to    percent by the middl of next year   the fund rate   not again reach   percent until the spring of        the op  polici is abl to stem the rise in unemploy that  would otherwis occur at the cost of a modest and short live uptick in inflat     the taylor rule  howev  is not as success   it fail to anticip the spillov  effect and respond too  id onc they occur   still  it contain the rise in unemploy to onli about    percentag point abov baselin and move inflat slight more rapid toward the assum inflat object   i should note that  given the uncertainti regard the size and  e of such spillov  the ideal  outcom in the op  polici simul exagger the real world abil of monetari polici to offset the effect of such shock   as i note befor  the thought experi behind these first two set of simul is that hous price fall in a kind of vacuum  without ani relationship to other event   some comment have argu that the current high level of hous  price is the outcom of a histori of veri low interest rate and past hous price appreci that has given rise to irrat op ist expect of futur appreci   inde  a simpl es  equat relat the current price to rent ratio to the user cost of hous and past hous price appreci   a reason  good job of explain much of the run up in hous price over the past sever year   if this explan hold water  a potenti risk to hous price and the  outlook in general lie in the path of longer term interest rate   which have been  surpris low  given prevail econom condit   and the usual behavior of term premium   bond yield could return to more normal level and in so do contribut to a downward trajectori in hous price   i explor such a possibl in the final scenario  which build on scenario    and is the subject of the next page of my exhibit   i now add the assumpt that the term premium on long term bond rise by    basi point  relat to baselin  over the second half of this year and remain at these level   this aspect of the scenario is similar to an altern scenario report in the june  book   this shock to   bond premium by itself reduc the long term equilibrium real fund rate by about     basi point   op  polici call for the fund rate to fall below   percent by the middl of next year and for the fund rate to remain below   percent through       the op  polici is just abl to contain the rise in unemploy without confront the zero bound   the taylor rule  on the other hand  respond too gradual to event  and  as a result  the unemploy rate reach   percent in earli        this scenario present a difficult challeng for monetari polici  especi in  light of the loom zero lower bound on interest rate under the op  polici  more general  it highlight that the risk pose by a hous price declin are magnifi if they occur in tandem with other event that damp econom activ   in addit  as   mention  a hous price misalign may misalloc resourc to hous relat activ   these condit suggest consid      s question    whether an altern polici is need that aim to deflat a hous price overvalu befor it grow too larg   the subject of the next page of my exhibit   the potenti effect of such a preemptiv polici  howev  is less than clear   the basic empir relationship between hous price  interest rate  and    other factor  upon which such a polici necessarili would reli  is imperfect understood and may have chang over  e   moreov  as seen in the earlier present  there remain consider uncertainti over the degre of overvalu   thus  the success use of monetari polici to reduc the magnitud of a misalign of hous price would be a daunt task  even assum that such a goal were deem desir   this conclud our prepar remark
we   re here to answer your question and to listen to your discuss
well  i believ there is a veri critic statist differ here which  befor we get veri  far down the road  i think requir resolut   you three gentlemen are talk about differ set of realiti  and you   re use the same basic data system   you all use the american hous survey  you use ofheo  and you use the census price index   i   ve heard comment from a few of you period on such matter   there are a coupl of issu that i find strike here   one is how littl we appar know   at least as has been communic to me  on the effect of the under land price that are  involv in all of these index   you can   t get the land price out of the american hous survey   i don   t believ it   s in the decenni hous survey   we do have farmland price by counti  and  one would presum be abl to pick up what was go on at the fring of various residenti oper   it sound like a tortuous job   but that still  sn   t solv the under question of    what the ratio of land is to other valu   and it strike me that we need to come to grip with some  of these issu  if for no other reason than i think it   s probabl our job   becaus no one els seem to be take it on   to tri to second guess the data that we   re get   nobodi is rais the question about the qualiti of the loanperform data and the fact that we   re deal with privat pool   which i presum are in the data that are be put togeth with respect to the proport of io  loan   i assum that conform mortgag do not includ io   or do they   are there part of  these pool that do
an interest onli mortgag can be purchas by a gse if it   s below the conform loan limit
and how much of the gse portfolio includ io loan   do  we know
at the moment onli freddi mac  i believ  has a pilot program to buy these  and it   s veri small
that was my understand     fanni do ani
so  for all practic purpos  sinc privat pool have gotten veri larg but are still somewhat less than the sum of fanni and freddi  the loanperform data at best are larg exagger   there   s also an interest question about the second hous issu   you   re rais the data  out of the american hous survey  and the last one was for       but the actual acceler of both turnov and presum purchas occur after that   we   ve been get hmda  home mortgag disclosur act  data on that for       essenti do it by month   in there  of cours   are the mortgag origin for other than owner occupi resid   one would expect that there   s a littl fudg on the part of investor about what the home are to be use for  but if the  bias is presum to be fair standard  we   re go to learn someth about the appar  uncontest assumpt of the acceler in turnov of exist home and  inde  the big increas in new home construct   all of that will be disaggreg into purchas for ownership  for invest  and for vacat home    the data that we have seen   confidenti data from individu bank   do show a rather signific pickup   the number don   t get as high as those from the nation associ of   realtor      percent or someth like that   but they indic a fair substanti pickup   and of the sum of second home  a disproportion larg number are purchas by investor  the  investor share veri definit has acceler   this is one set of data   for the veri larg bank    that   show a mark acceler into      and        so  i think we need to know much more  about this   but let me just ask one simpl question   do we have ani insight on the land compon of those sale
sir  i can address that a bit   actual  morri davi  who is an economist here at the board  has written a paper on that veri subject  and
was that a year or so ago
just about a year ago  exact
i read it
okay   i can tell someth from the tone of your voic    laughter   in ani event  the idea there was to look at hous price and construct cost and to tri to back out as a  sort of mechan oper   not an easi one   the valu of the land   he show that land price   have increas veri rapid and that the land share of the properti valu has gone up over  e   as you mention  we know someth about farm price   but besid those two thing  there realli aren   t
as an exampl  the chicago bank publish quarter data      fair detail data   on land price in all the state in it district     anybodi els
agricultur land  yes
yes   these are your data   you collect them
yes  we collect the data
so you actual have data on each individu farm   you have a databas from which one could actual construct the price chang over  e to at least learn what is happen as the urban fring move out   so you have at least one dimens  which is this  issu that you rais with respect to new home and exist home   has anybodi tri to look at that   i ask becaus they are the onli data that i   m awar of which actual show a level of land price over a signific period of  e   and no one use them on the ground that agricultur land price have noth to do with residenti land price   but that can   t be true
i agre  mr  chairman   those data are be influenc in part by the   expans of residenti area out into what use to be farm or agricultur land   there are some interest dynam take place becaus  in the chicago metropolitan area  a lot of this land is now be use for residenti purpos   howev the seller  for tax purpos  want to use the proceed to buy agricultur land right away   so they then go downstat in illinoi and bid up the  price there   they are not as concern about the price as long as they can make this tax free  exchang   so  that   s one dynam   the other interest dynam  of cours  is that as agricultur  subsidi have increas so rapid   they are now about    percent of net farm incom   there   s less concern about the valu of land come down
it   s capit into the land price
but you still have to pay the agricultur subsidi to buy the  land to build a hous   there   s no way to get out from under that
mr  chairman  we have  in fact  look at farmland valu and at the data that are collect by the reserv bank  and there has been an appreci acceler in farmland price   it vari a consider degre by district   for exampl  in area like the san   francisco district or the richmond district  where the interfac of the urban expans into agricultur area probabl is greater  we   ve seen a much more pronounc acceler than  for exampl  in the dalla district    as we put that all togeth  it is true that we don   t have a good seri broken down by   region land price per se   but it   s veri difficult to believ that the acceler we   ve seen in residenti properti price  sn   t reflect to a veri signific degre an increas in land price   while it may be difficult to do morri   s type of calcul  we just haven   t seen anyth like the acceler in basic construct cost that would suggest anyth other than a substanti increas  in land valu   and when we look at those farmland price to see if there was some confirm of that impress in the agricultur land price  it seem pretti clear that we were see that  again  that  sn   t necessarili mean that the farmland is overvalu   i think the same question are  open on the agricultur land price as they are in dick   s and josh   s debat about whether or not hous is overvalu  but there has been a substanti step up in recent year
we do obvious have bea  bureau of econom analysi    data on transact cost and  one would presum  profit margin  so that in a way we have at least one element of the markup over cost   the differ that we   re look at here are so larg that it   s   not a minor question   inde  if you take dick   s bubbl   or lack thereof  i should say   you get the  impress that deflat is probabl go on    laughter   i   d be curious  frank  to have andrea  who has look at this to a great extent  comment on dick   s paper
i think josh and dick should have an opportun to talk a littl more about their differ of view in this area
not that i don   t have an opinion    laughter
i thought you   d be the ideal intermediari    laughter
well  let me make just a coupl of observ
let me stop you   you   ve made your point   i think you were respond to the data of your two colleagu   let them respond  and then you respond to them
loos speak  what we   re tri to do is to get a sens of chang in the price of a typic home   what has been happen to that price over  e   adjust for qualiti   i guess i   ll start with my concern about the constant qualiti figur  and then i   ll address dick   s  concern about the transact price index that i use   one reason i worri about the constant qualiti number  and dick allud to it  is that it   s a constant qualiti price index for new home  and new home typic are not built where exist home are alreadi situat   you can see that when you drive out of ani citi  basic   the big develop are on the outskirt of the citi  and those outskirt are move further out   i recogn that citi can be multi center and so forth  but new home   while not alway built on the cheapest avail land   typic are built on the cheapest avail land   and the constant  qualiti price index for new home has onli crude control for locat   so i don   t think that index is abl to fulli handl that issu   that   s whi i like the repeat transact price index   as dick  mention  it basic match up address over  e and look at the price chang
have you adjust that for the modern per hous unit
how much   that take off
well  as dick point out in his brief  there are data on improv   so i use those data and divid that by the stock of hous and subtract it off   but on the other side of that argument is the fact that while mani home get addit made to them  all home are also   deterior somewhat over  e  which will bias thing in the other direct   and we have data  on that   so  improv are affect price appreci one way  and depreci is affect it the other way   onc you take both into account  the net effect is onli a few tenth a year   now   these thing can cumul over  e  but i use data on improv and on depreci to remov   those bias from the publish data   so  there are problem with the publish data  but we don   t have to make do with the publish data   likewis  there   s a transact bias   home that appreci more tend to transact more  and that   s go to bias upward the publish price index that i start with   but there are studi on the  size of this transact bias   dick provid some data on it   i   ve taken es  of the size of this  transact bias and remov it from the publish data   so  i start with the publish data  but i make various adjust   one last point is that becaus the price index is base on mortgag purchas or securit by the gses  it   s go to miss fha and va loan and also jumbo loan   there is a publish privat sector price index put out by case and shiller that actual goe to deed level data  and they look at all home purchas   they do a repeat transact method  but they look at all purchas and throw out onli refinanc and exchang among famili   that  index actual show fa  appreci sinc        that would seem to suggest that the home with jumbo loan may be appreci fa  and that by leav out jumbo i am perhap bias thing down    so  my final takeaway from this is that there   s no perfect way to measur hous price   all these measur have their various flaw   but i think that a proper adjust repeat transact  price index   one that use not just the publish data but make adjust for the  shortcom   is a better way to get a read on what   s go on in the hous market
i have just three comment   first  i   m not disput that land price where hous are be built would be lower than land price closer to the center of a metropolitan area  the issu is the rate of increas of those land price   and we don   t realli know what   s happen to  the rate of increas of land price at differ point along the continuum
it   s the weight effect   as you move out  the price level are lower  so there   s a downward bias  wherea for exist home that bias can   t exist
that   s true   that assum that there is this nice gradual gradient of price chang for land as one move out from the center of a metropolitan area   i don   t know the answer   but my observ is that that is not what occur   in the new york metropolitan area  for exampl   i think one could cite mani locat where land price closer to manhattan  say in newark  are not rise as rapid as in short hill or in hunterdon counti   so  that relationship probabl just  sn   t hold in realiti   anoth thing that we   ve observ  particular in our metropolitan area  is that state and local govern are now aggress bidder for parcel of land that are potenti site for  residenti develop   so it   s conceiv that the price of land on which one could build a home now is rise extrem rapid   and perhap even more rapid than land closer in that has alreadi been develop
is there ani agreement about what proport the land is  current   some rough order of magnitud   relat to the total valu of home sold   for exampl  is land    percent of the sale price  on averag  or    percent or    percent
i think it vari substanti across locat   i think morri found it to  have becom quit high  he es  that the number had move up abov    percent
the averag lot size also has been declin rather rapid  indic that the  price of land is go up rapid
i   m not ask for the chang  i   m look for the level  governor
well  one more question on the data   josh  you need the share of land   to do the price rent ratio  don   t you   you adjust for improv  but sure that   s onli on the structur  not on the land
so the share of land in the valu is increas   is that extract from  your price rent ratio in some way
yes   what you do is get the depreci rate  and that   s relat to the structur   it actual  sn   t make too much of a differ exact how you do it   but  again  i got land share number from morri davi  and one can basic tamp it down year by year
okay   then it   s also a ratio   and the cpi tenant rent measur is for a  constant unit over  e   so what you tri to do is to normal on that
yes   my price seri and my rent seri are both index to start with  so  they are unit less   again  lean on my colleagu  morri  we get a base year es  of rent for a constant qualiti unit   we get the base year dollar price and then multipli by that
okay      i have one question for you   how do we interpret the op  polici   we  the policymak  know all the shock   so when we move the fund rate on the red line  is that to be interpret as act in advanc of the hous price chang  simultan with the hous price chang  or what
in the op  polici simul  from the begin of the simul  which is the third quarter of this year  you know the entir futur path of hous price and ani other shock that i add   so you are act in anticip of those futur price chang
so if we see hous price go up  we   re in effect cut the fund rate  while the hous price are go up
that   s correct   that   s whi i was tri to compar it with the taylor  rule   which  sn   t have that aspect of respond to develop as they unfold   to see how well that would do
i want to make one other point with regard to josh   s work  and that is that use the tenant rent compon of the cpi and compar it with the ofheo index is  in my opinion  a real appl to orang type of comparison   as i point out in my comment  the ofheo index measur what is happen around the   th percentil of the distribut of singl  famili home where we know incom are rise more rapid   use a rent compon that on the  one hand is look at what is go on in the multi famili hous market to a larg extent
actual  it   s base on singl famili home which are rent but have the characterist that they could be sold
not in the tenant rent compon he is use
the rent compon i presum we   re use is the owner    equival rent  are we not
actual  it   s not   but it  sn   t make ani differ    laughter   i could  easili have done it with the owner    equival rent  but i would have had to cut off all my pictur  in      becaus that   s when that seri begin   i went with the tenant rent strict for the length of   the  e seri   but if you look at the relat level of these two seri over  e  while the growth  rate do differ a littl bit  you   re talk about realli small potato   on the order of   percent
if you keep get a signific rise in home ownership    mean a shift of exist famili from rent onli   you are go to bias that ratio
absolut   as an asid  but regard that particular point  i   ve been work one day a week at the bureau of labor statist  and i have access to the confidenti  under micro data that they use to build up the cpi   so  some of my work is tri to get at just these type of critic   but from the under data  i have been abl to look at rent appreci for differ segment of the rental market  tri to see   with home ownership rate go up     where the homeown market is steal  so to speak  from the rental market and how big the bias  are   and it   look as if the higher end of the rental market has been show somewhat smaller rent increas over  e  suggest that that   s where it   s come from  but not dramat
that rais an import point becaus  as we know  wage of nonsupervisori worker  which are essenti payrol data  are go up   percent  wherea  implicit that of supervisori worker is go up doubl or three  e that   that   s chang  it has acceler in the most recent period
let me note just one last thing   the pictur are go to look the same as  those dick show  whether we look at hous price relat to incom or to rent   so  even if the rent seri might have this problem or that problem   and it   have problem   hous price have grown quit dramat use the adjust data that i use relat to incom as well
i guess my question is address to   and     obvious  the unit state is uniqu  but we   re not the onli countri where a central bank has been tri to deal   with this issu   we   ve seen recent that monetari author in the unit kingdom  australia   and perhap the netherland are all talk about the possibl of use monetari polici to tri to deal with the hous price issu   so  what  if ani  lesson can we learn from oversea   i recogn  that our particular situat is uniqu  but we   re not the onli one deal with this problem
that   s an interest question   i think one of the point to be consid is that those countri are all smaller than the unit state  and typic their residenti properti market are center in one or two citi   london or sydney  for exampl   so perhap that   s a factor that just loom larger in the polici calcul   and that may be the reason whi the central banker in those countri have been perhap a littl more proactiv  although that issu is still be work out  i think   they have done a bit more jawbon  so to speak   but australia  in particular  has been a littl more explicit about factor in hous market develop in the polici calcul   again  they don   t target hous price  but they certain  seem to take them into account a bit more than the unit state    in term of set monetari polici
but have the result  general speak  been posit or neutral   i   know this polici is in it earli day  but is there ani judgment one could make even at this earli  stage on whether or not more jawbon   or  in the case of australia  actual move rate   has  been help
i think both australia and the unit kingdom  to the extent they  have conduct this type of polici  have felt it was fair success   they have been abl to temper home price appreci and restor some balanc in the economi without ani signific  macroeconom fallout   they have had lower home price appreci but  again  their situat are perhap veri differ from the situat for the unit state
i   d like to comment also on the polici discuss   it seem to me that to do  this analysi correct  the central bank realli has to think about interven more or less all the  e  becaus  if you have a one off polici respons and you promis that you   re never ever go to do it  again  it perhap would not be all that use   so it seem to me that policymak would need to  think about routin have asset price be a consider in polici analysi   i think that would be a terribl idea  and let me explain whi   let   s look at it from an op  control point of view and suppos hypothet that we have a polici instrument that is  absolut ideal   it has no side effect  is complet independ of the feder fund rate  or the macro polici instrument  and has perfect predict effect   that   s the ideal from a control theoret point of view   in that case  if the central bank were adjust such an instrument and set capit valu  it seem to me that that would chang the whole natur of the price mechan in asset market   and i think it would be a terribl idea in a market economi to have a govern agenc set capit asset valu   that   s whi i would not start to go down this rout  i believ it is realli a dead end
i guess i   d make a distinct there  in that i think the propon are talk not about set asset price in general but about tri perhap to reduc the bubbl  compon   clear  if asset price are set equal to the fundament  that   s go to lead to the proper function of
but the point is that there could be a littl bubbl compon or a big bubbl compon   obvious  policymak wouldn   t appli the instrument when price are regard as  reflect the fundament  but the instrument would be continu avail   the whole point  of such an instrument would be to keep the price right at the fundament   but then that would   chang the whole natur of asset price in a market economi   i think a proper polici analysi  realli can   t be done on a one off basi in case such as the stock market in the      s or hous price  today
i   m sympathet to that view   it seem as if there might be a  threshold   that is  policymak might be more interest in certain asset market or might be more interest in price in asset market in general at certain  e   but i think you   re allud to the moral hazard or polit complic that could aris from this type of intervent or from tri to use this bubbl compon as a monetari transmiss mechan
essenti  it   s the same problem that aris with wage and price control  have that as a polici instrument that is some  use and some  not use complet chang the price mechan in a market economi   i think that problem appli in spade to stock price  equiti price  and bond price   with hous price i think the problem is a littl  differ  but i believ the same basic principl appli
peopl also have made the argument that if policymak are go to  clean up the mess after the fact  there may be other problem   if you let equiti price rise on the upsid but then essenti make some sort of insur agreement on the downsid  that again is a distort   though perhap an asymmetr one   that may also have complic
there   s ampl room  i think  for understand the hous market within  what you phrase as the standard polici   but i think go after asset price direct is someth veri differ   that   s the point that i   m tri to make
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to make a coupl of comment and also ask a quick question   my first comment relat to the run up in price rent ratio that we   ve   seen   it seem to me that there might be a coupl of factor that could explain at least some portion of the run up  though probabl not all of it  that weren   t mention in the present   first  it seem to me that financi innov affect hous could have improv the  view of household regard the desir of hous as an asset to be held in portfolio and thus rais the equilibrium price to rent relationship for residenti real estat   what i   m think of is the idea that equiti held in residenti real estat is a lot more access today than it has been in the  past   home equiti credit at commerci bank is up fourfold sinc       and mani household obvious are now keen awar that refinanc provid a low cost avenu for tap into the  equiti in their home   so  in a sens  there might be less of a liquid premium embodi in the return for hous   also  if peopl feel that the liquid constraint in hold hous as an asset are diminish  that could explain a reduc need for precautionari save in tradit liquid asset   it could even make peopl will to put more of their wealth into down payment on  hous and may have rais price through that mechan    the other thing that occur to me is that there might be effect from tax chang   we   ve had chang in the rule for tax exempt and in      on capit gain from the sale of primari resid that would make hold real estat asset more attract   and the chang in capit  gain tax more general in      and then again in      would have work in the same direct   one of the thing that we look at that we thought was interest was the behavior of price rent ratio for residenti hous and for commerci offic space   commerci offic space price rent ratio are high cyclic   i guess they alway have been   but it appear that the  behavior of price rent ratio in residenti hous has close mirror what we   ve seen in commerci offic space   the ratio for both have gone up about    to    percent sinc around         though the dynam are total differ   commerci offic space rent have been fall    it   s not that the price have been rise   but the price rent ratio have move veri similar   a second comment i want to make concern the relationship of creativ financ to the hous market   one view that i think is veri preval is that the use of credit in the form of piggyback loan  interest onli mortgag  option arm  adjust rate mortgag   and so forth  involv financi innov that are feed a kind of unsustain bubbl   but an altern perspect on that is that high hous price  in fact  are curtail effect demand for hous at this point and that hous appreci probabl is pois to slow   so the increas use of creativ  financ could be a sign of the final gasp of hous price appreci at the pace we   ve seen and an indic that a slow is at hand   previous  lender appli veri rigid constraint on loan to  valu ratio  but essenti those constraint are now be eas at the margin through these creativ financ techniqu   and that   s provid some elast to what was a firm roof   it may slight diminish the price elast of the demand for hous  but the fact that it is blossom now basic suggest that we realli are at the ceil where it   s bind and will ul  constrain appreci   final  with those two comment  a question   it concern the present by andrea and the number cite on loan to valu ratio at origin   one of the thing we   re see in  california and elsewher in our district   and mayb this is true nationwid   is a grow use of  piggyback loan   loan to valu ratio of    to    percent are common in california  and we   ve even seen combin loan to valu ratio and piggyback loan go up to     percent   i guess  that mean two thing  one of which is that the tradit first mortgag look utter convent  those mortgag have an    percent loan to valu ratio and i suppos they are be sold off to   fanni and freddi   the other thing is that with such convent mortgag be sold to fanni    and freddi  there   s no need for privat mortgag insur   so fanni   s and freddi   s book may look better in some sens   less riski   than they realli are becaus of all of the second mortgag  go up to possibl     percent
it sound like a cdo  collater debt oblig    that   s what it is  isn   t it
yes   so i wonder if that was someth that you   re awar of and someth that is includ in the number
yes   the data that you see on my first exhibit in principl includ second lien  close end second lien   and in particular in the graph that you cite i use the newli avail       data from hmda which for the first  e has collect data on whether or not the hmda loan is a junior or a first lien   so the pictur that you see there should reflect the growth of piggyback loan
could i just ask a quick question   do we have data on price   to rent ratio of apart dwell   we do have data on price of apart  and we have rent   i think dick rais a veri interest question about the numer and the denomin   the way to squar that is to get the same data for the same type of unit   do we have that inform and what    it show
we do have those data   there   s an index that give price per squar foot and rent per squar foot for apart nation and in various citi   and it show a mark  increas in the price rent ratio
it look like the one that you were show
it  sn   t go back as far   it onli goe back to        but sinc       yes
it   s quit a steep increas
is the level the same  can you tell
these apart price data and rent data are by squar footag   i guess i could make a calcul  but i don   t have those data here
it   s worthwhil look at that   sorri about the interrupt  governor olson
i have a coupl of question   first of all  concern the scenario of a     percent declin in hous price  is that weight to ani extent   is it weight so that it would reduc the froth or the increas valuat that had occur up to a certain point   or would that  simpli take the total amount of valu and reduc that number by    percent
all i   m do is the latter   reduc the overal hous wealth by    percent relat to the base
with josh   s    percent  i assum that there is an implicit weight  is there   not   would the    percent increas in valu reflect to some extent the greater run up in valu in area like california where there are larg number of properti that have increas signific more in valu than other
it   s basic a valu weight measur
your is   but is it the aggreg divid by the number of hous unit   i would think that there would have to be an implicit weight in your calcul   if  in fact  the declin in valu   the nasdaq effect  in other word   were to repres a return to normal from the   increas that had occur  would that have affect to ani extent the risk exposur
in term of the frb us model  the onli way that hous price and hous wealth enter is through the aggreg
so  one of the shortcom  even of a model with sever hundr   equat  is that it  sn   t have the distribut effect
there are two part to that   one is the overal impact on the model   the second is that  to the extent there is risk embed in the under mortgag  it would tend to be  where the run up has been higher   i   m go to talk a littl bit about that tomorrow   my second point is on land valu   in the assess valuat that i get from the counti   i   ve been too frighten in recent year to look at it    sn   t it break out the land valu and the improv   i assum that   s public knowledg  is it not   so  presum  you could access that  number   and my recollect is that for residenti apprais three differ methodolog are use  one of which look at the improv vis  vis the land valu   so i would guess that that inform is avail    my third point is just a visual observ  have to do with the incid of teardown in a market like this   when there is an asymmetri between the land valu and the valu of the improv  you see an increas in the teardown   local  that trend start in d c  and it has now move out into our neighborhood   so that is a critic compon  it seem to me  of ani buy decis   and i think those data would be avail   i have one follow up question on someth the chairman mention   somebodi suggest to me recent   i just heard a differ figur on this   that the privat pool of mortgag back loan are now larger than the gse pool   have you seen ani recent data to that effect
not in the unit state   i don   t know what countri or planet      laughter
the planet was earth    laughter   the countri was the unit state   and the person make the observ was talk about sale of the nonconform product into what they see as a grow and undisciplin secondari market
i   m sorri  i shouldn   t have said that   do you mean the flow or the stock
well  that   s a good question   i think the statement was as to the flow
then i beg your pardon   of cours  the stock differ are enorm  as for the flow differ  on net  gse guarante mortgag in both pool and to a small extent on  the balanc sheet hard grew at all in       while it was an explos year for growth for the rmbs sector
that   s true   that   s a good point   thank you
follow up on governor     s question  i would imagin that one of the differ here is that we have tremend variat from market to market   and to the chairman   s question about the proport of hous price attribut to the land valu  i would assum that it has to do with local regul and restrict on land use   for exampl  if you look at the number for home be consid or under permit for construct in southern california   that includ los angel  ventura  and orang counti   in the      s it was in the         plus rang   this year it   s         in part becaus of the imposit of high restrict  regul on land use   if you look at permit for current construct of singl famili home in north  ina  where there are almost no restrict whatsoev  it   s over          so  the question is  can you assum that land price as a percentag of hous price is a function of regulatori and other restrict impos on land use and on construct   is there a way to measur this   i ask becaus it strike me   and i   ve been think about other countri as   well  and spain is an interest exampl   that monetari polici would be a veri blunt general tool if  inde  there are signific variat citi by citi  state by state  and market by market
i   ll leav the monetari polici aspect to my colleagu   but let me make a coupl of point about land use restrict   certain  land use restrict  environment restrict  and those type of thing have play a role in the rapid rise in hous price   that   certain is a factor   i mention in my brief that i like to compar hous price to rent   and this  is one of the reason   as oppos to compar them to incom   if increas regul boost hous price  peopl are just go to have to pay more out of their incom for hous becaus of the regul put in place   but land use restrict should affect rent as well   so  it should drive up the cost of buy a home  and it should also drive up the cost of rent a home   it can be a  signific factor  but it should be in both of those element    and this is somewhat of an asid  but i find it interest   i talk to a lot of builder as part of  my day to day work here  and i   ve ask them about this veri issu   they say definit that land  use restrict is a big concern for them   but i also went back and look at newspap articl written in                      and        and it   s truli remark how the view back then was that hous  price could never fall becaus  as peopl were say left and right  there was no more buildabl land left due to environment regul and land use restrict   they were say that right up to      when hous price level out in nomin term   i   m not say these thing aren   t real     the builder say they are real   but they   re certain not new though they may be new in their  effect   but just to get back to the point  i think they should be captur in the price and the rent data
just one follow up comment   there   s a lot of evid to suggest that a good part of the reason for the rapid rise in home price in california  washington  d c   and along   the east coast  for exampl  is becaus of relat inelast suppli   not that demand there is  necessarili stronger   that   s pretti clear in the data   whether it   s due to these land use restrict or other factor  the fact is that these are alreadi fair dens popul area and there   s definit a more inelast suppli in these area of the countri
i would imagin that it would be driven also by the kind of margin that the  supplier can captur   just for verisimilitud  i talk to hovnanian  who build about         home a year at rough          apiec   his margin are be squeez in california  but in these less restrict area he can captur a greater amount  so obvious he gravit to where he  can captur the greatest margin   now that   s just one exampl  but common sens would suggest that it appli more broad
the argument for the rapid rise in land price in      was that land was fix in quantiti    laughter   so  new idea are veri rare   vice chair
i rememb that bubbl    laughter   i have two question   my first is for     or perhap for dave     what is the right way to think about deal with uncertainti in consid the polici question   put asid     s question  about whether you know anyth ever about the relationship between price and fundament at a   given point   what if what you don   t know is simpli the like path of home price go forward  you could take the group here around the tabl and assum some path  but there would be a fair fat band of uncertainti around that path   what   your regim impli     for polici in that  particular circumst   do you basic ignor hous price and look at all the other thing we  look at
i think that the  book forecast  as i understand it   and mayb dave  should talk about this   is predic on a particular assumpt about the futur path of hous   price and take into account the kind of model that josh was discuss   the staff look at all the empir evid  just as they do for everi equat on everi aspect of the economi   so  monetari theori would tell you to come up with the best  most reason forecast and adopt a   polici that is appropri to that path but also consid  as you   re say  all the risk and the  distribut of the risk   it   s along the line of some of the chart in the  book  which show the distribut of risk and then contempl the implic for the current set of polici option over  that distribut of risk   i think the basic idea in the econom literatur is that you first want to get a veri reason path  and that would be more or less your baselin   it   s not a path  i should say  that just keep  hous price constant or keep ani asset price constant   it should be the best forecast of these   asset price that you can come up with  but subject  of cours  to the fact that these are veri hard to predict
and you wait and see and then adjust cours base on develop as they unfold
that would be the standard polici
just on that point  isn   t that the differ between the op  polici   and the taylor rule   with the taylor rule  you wait and see   in the op  polici  you somehow  know this so you can move earlier
right   the taylor rule would just be one exampl  of cours  of a polici that take into account the inform you have up to that point   it   s not op  in some sens    it   s just a simpl equat   it   repres this wait and see approach   i was use the op  polici to illustr what you would do if you knew everyth   it   s kind of a comparison
can correct me if i   m wrong  but i think there is an import element to your question about what is the sourc of uncertainti   if the sourc of uncertainti is go to be the evolut of hous price  that basic is uncertainti of a linear type that   s affect  aggreg demand   so you take your best shot and  therefor  set polici accord   the other possibl is that you   re not certain how hous price will react as you chang your instrument  that becom multipli uncertainti  and depend on the structur of the uncertainti in your model  you may either attenu or not
my second question is about polici  but not monetari  polici      in your note  you allud to other instrument if monetari polici  sn   t seem to be the appropri tool to address a concern about lower valu price   what do we know about the histori of the use of the supervisori tool in past period of concern about real estat bubbl or imprud lend   do we have a rich histori on the use of those instrument that tell us  someth about the efficaci or about our foresight in deploy them
it   s call the real bill doctrin
sinc the bill doctrin    laughter
sinc you   re go to the british embassi  i might note that in the  unit kingdom they use to allow loan to valu at origin of     percent   you could buy your properti under water essenti by    percent   one of the recent restrict they   ve impos is a limit of     percent   so this  e around they feel much better in the u k about where they are  with just     percent loan to valu at origin   but the monetari author there  sn   t have supervisori respons
i meant in our histori   in our histori  have we use that tool to good or ill effect   have we use it wise and with foresight
you   re bias the answer    laughter
the answer is obvious    yes       laughter
my understand is that we   ve use it fair often in the postwar period  in the      s       s  and      s   in earli       for exampl   my understand is that it hasn   t work veri well   there have been  e when we   ve tri to jawbon the bank system   s alloc of  credit
is the histori one of use it too late  or of use it and it have no effect becaus there are other way to get money
may i say someth here   i don   t have ani quantit studi on this  but  base on talk to the folk who live through it  i   d make a coupl of observ   if we look at  the     s   the most recent hous bubbl that was nationwid   we saw the bubbl burst nation as oppos to the pocket we   ve had with the california breakdown or the boston breakdown  which realli relat to the local economi and local employ develop   i think the local econom employ situat were the driver of delinqu  and the   regul general miss that becaus they miss the local econom impact   and i think peopl focus on the fact that those cycl were driven by local econom condit     i think the period of the     s involv a broader failur on the part of supervisor   if we compar the     s experi with what is happen now  in the earlier period a lot of financi institut were on an exam cycl that went five or six year   so  nobodi on the supervisori side was in there look at what was go on   and that period was befor the  e when securit becam a preval practic  so most of the risk was carri on the book of the bank   also  mani  of the bank that were hit veri bad were follow develop   go out of their footprint and lend on properti that they didn   t know   and i think one of the risk we have today in our big   bank is that while we say they are diversifi geograph  mani of their loan are to investor or purchas of second home resort properti   so  the lender again are follow their custom out of the local area  and in the locat of the new properti the local lender aren   t look at it  the custom   s lender is handl the transact   so  we still may have that risk embed within the financi institut   it   s one of the thing we   re focus on    what is new about it this  e  though  is that a lot of these nonconform product are be securit by the privat sector   so the real question is  where   the market disciplin  kick in   and as supervisor  can we fault an institut for respond to a market need when it is  offload the loan and the risk into these type of mortgag structur that andrea has been describ   we clear could if the financi institut were buy the equiti or mezzanin risk tranch and the risk were back on the institut    book   but in mani case that clear isn   t what is happen   so  we have some differ aspect this  e around   just to let everybodi know  the occ  offic of the comptrol of the currenc  and the  fed current are put togeth a horizont review to look at the fring kind of lend activ  where we do need to send some signal   we wrote the heloc  home equiti line of credit  guidanc that came out last month  we   re work on this other one and hope to have it out in a  coupl of month   we don   t want to turn off safe loan or the tradit type of lend activ  but we need to figur out where to go on some of these practic that are on the fring   but we haven   t done a  l job   i think that   s whi we   re tri to send out some guidanc   we sent out the apprais guidanc a year or so ago   but some of the riski practic of the past are start to be repeat  and it may be that the generat of lender now didn   t live through the problem befor
shall we break for coffe   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to make a few comment and then  ask a question   first  i   d say that with all of the concern about froth in hous market  i found  these present to be veri inform  and i want to congratul the peopl who spent a lot of     e prepar them   i thought they were all veri good present   but i also found the inform comfort   we   ve all talk about the possibl of local hous bubbl and region hous bubbl  and clear there are some in the unit state   but we never realli  look at it on a nation basi befor   the net result for me was that i come away from the analysi not feel ani wors than i did befor and probabl a littl better  first  i thought it was veri help to see quantifi   i think this was in josh   s memo   the   size of the potenti bubbl   he talk about a    percent drop in hous price   but that was equal to onli about    percent of gdp as compar to the drop in equiti price we had  which was more than twice that   also  i had the feel that appropri monetari polici  as   said  could  mitig much of the distress that might occur   moreov  the credit risk associ with home mortgag seem to be spread out across mani institut   governor bie said that a lot of analysi is be done now  and we   ll want to see the result of the analysi that the board and the comptrol are do   but on the whole  the financi institut seem to be in pretti good shape  the role of securit mortgag is to lay off risk to parti who are will and abl to bear the risk   capit level of the financi institut are relat high  so it appear that these market  are perform their role well   and in the event of a sharp drop in hous price  the odd of a spillov to financi institut seem limit   and as i mention  it was help to hear the  suggest that monetari polici can be effect in respond to a sharp drop   if there is one   in   hous price   so i come away somewhat less concern about the size and consequ of a hous bubbl than i was befor   the question i had relat to what governor   was ask about   financi innov  i was go to make a similar point   the fact is that there has been a great deal of financi innov in hous market in the unit state   the averag person can borrow veri easili on  his home these day   and i was wonder if there have been   or if it is possibl to do   ani  intern comparison on this   i wonder whether the price rent ratio in other countri that  may not have had the same degre of financi innov we   ve had differ substanti from our
well  i trust you did receiv or are awar of the background document we circul on the foreign experi
we didn   t do price rent ratio  and given what josh has describ in term  of the care he has to put in befor he feel he has someth close to the right number  i think we might feel a littl hesit to do so   i take it back  there are price rent ratio    laughter  in the back portion of that paper   what data we have  we use   but there are huge variat in the financ practic in hous market across foreign countri   there is some degre of securit but less than here   practic with respect to the tax favor treatment of borrow to financ hous  differ relat to those in the unit state   there   s a host of differ characterist  in term of variabl rate  fix rate  and other type of instrument use in various foreign countri    but one of the thing our paper was intend to point out was the preval of realli rapid rise in hous price   accord to this chart   the first few page of which are right here anyway    that show through to an increas in the price rent ratio as well   so  i refer you back to this paper    there is onli a subset of the countri we cover for which we have price rent chart  but there are some in the paper
but you can   t realli associ it with the degre of financi innov that we   ve had in the unit state becaus of this great variabl   is that what you   re say
i guess i wouldn   t necessarili associ it with  say  the develop of the secondari market or the eas of equiti extract  and those sort of thing  but i   m not say they   re irrelev   for exampl  in this chart  switzerland   which is a countri that i think of as   have made littl progress in that regard    sn   t have much of a price rent ratio increas   and  the u k   which   have a more market orient approach  has a huge one   but it   s also true that that   s where the price differ have been   i think we   d be hard press to link too tight the increas liquid that we ascrib to u s  home equiti as now have taken on the role of the singl drive factor anyway   it might be relev  but i don   t know that it distinguish these countri
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to thank the author of the  paper   the intern paper as well as all of the paper that were talk about today   becaus i  found them veri help and reassur  along the line that michael   was discuss   i  also thought that     s comment on the financi innov were insight   despit the fact  that it   s hard to sort out the u s  experi vis  vis other countri  the whole point of this   to me anyway   is that we   re see a phenomenon in the hous market   so the question is  do the fundament explain it or don   t they   and financi innov are certain part of the mix  in   term of chang in the fundament   so  to the extent that they   ve made mani of the transact in the hous market easier to do  that has to have had some impact on the under asset price  so i thought that argument was a veri interest one  and it will be interest to see if there is ani way one can teas out the effect of that   my second point is that when you look at the relationship between rise price on either the ofheo or the constant qualiti index against dispos incom as oppos to median household incom  you see an even more reassur chart   and i would think there   s at least a littl bit of logic to do that  base on dick peach   s chart about the differ in hous price acceler depend on incom   with the valu of higher price hous move up fa  than lower price hous   so i would think that there is some logic to look at this with dispos incom   i know that you have done those chart   i think we have everi chart you could do    laughter   but it is interest that one see in that perspect somewhat less acceler and a somewhat more reassur pictur   final  and this is more of a question  we talk about a    percent declin in hous price  and what that would do in term of the basic macroeconom effect of it   but  of cours  that wouldn   t happen overnight   someth would make it happen   and  as we consid our current polici stanc  one of the conundrum   though i hate to use that word   is whi haven   t the    year  yield and  therefor  mortgag interest rate  taken the same upward path as rate at the short end of the curv   so a question i was ask myself   and i think it   s probabl not so difficult to figur this out   was where the point is  as mortgag rate start to go up  when we look at that afford curv and start to worri about household begin to get into troubl   that would then have an  impact on hous price   obvious  higher interest rate would tend to level hous price off or take them down   they also would have an impact  other thing equal  on peopl   s abil to afford the   hous that they   re in   how far do interest rate have to go up befor that afford curv start to move in the direct that caus a problem in that regard
if you look at the hous afford pictur   basic relat hous price and interest rate and incom   it has been move around in a fair stabl and favor  area for the last  say    to    year
as you know  mortgag rate have been move up and down but on balanc they have flatten out a bit over the past few year  if you compar  say       to now   so what has been happen over that  e period is that afford is edg down to the lower end of the rang in which it has fluctuat for a while   there   s noth scari about it  but afford  has been move down   certain  we can take this argument a littl further   if mortgag rate stay pretti stabl and dispos incom keep rise at reason rate  afford is go to start look wors and wors if we keep get the hous price gain that we   ve been see   that   s  not necessarili an argument for overvalu or undervalu   but it is an argument for the view that the recent increas in hous price gain are not sustain   if rate flatten out  afford will start to deterior fair signific
if rate flatten out or if they rise
if rate flatten out  that   s becaus we would not be get a kick ani more  from lower rate   hous price can go up and hous remain afford if rate are lower   but if  they flatten out and stay flat  one might think that it   s go to be hard for hous price gain to keep hum along the way they   ve been go   that   s go to start to eat into afford
okay   i guess i was come at it the other way
i   m sorri  then
no  no   let me just think about that for a while   go on
let me make one other point on the reason whi there may have been an increas in the equilibrium price rent ratio  becaus i certain agre with you and presid   that there are some good reason   those reason could well includ financi innov  chang in capit gain taxat  and suppli constraint   howev  lot of asset price misalign start out with situat where there are good reason whi those price are rise rapid   product innov and chang in busi model  and so forth  were i think probabl valid explan for the increas in stock market price  but that  sn   t mean
while they were probabl valid explan for the stock market rise in the      s  they didn   t necessarili  in the end  go all the way to explain how far those valuat had move  even if they had somewhat of a solid econom impetus to begin with
i was think primarili about the afford issu   i know the afford ratio involv at least three thing move simultan   the valu of hous  dispos incom  and interest rate   i was more or less look just at the interest rate compon
i was wonder if interest rate were move up instead of not move up how that affect afford
it   s go to make hous signific
well  yes  but where is the break point   if the    year rate goe up    percentag point  say  are we go to get worri about whether peopl can afford their hous   or  is there some rang over which the rate can rise and we shouldn   t be concern
i certain wouldn   t want to say the break point is here or there   but  again  go back to some of the convers i   ve had with homebuild  for what it   s worth  they indic that they   re not go to be too worri unless we see an increas   and one that occur fast   on the order of     basi point
so   percentag point  or     basi point  in a short amount of  e
yes  but that   s base just on talk to some builder  as oppos to ani  firm statist analysi   so i would be veri cautious   i would certain hesit to draw a firm conclus about a particular increas be a tip point or a break point
if i could just add a point   in the spring of        we had a veri rapid increas  in rate       basi point   as we did again in       and the hous market prove to be surpris resili in the face of those fair steep increas
thank you  mr  chairman   i have three question   the first one is on the  price to rent ratio   we   ve been treat it as if most of the adjust has come on price   and i want to ask josh particular whether  as you   ve been look at the micro data and think  about this  the dynam of some of these innov that have led to a shift from rent to home ownership might have artifici depress rent relat to price   and i wonder  after that shift is over  if rent will start rise fa  and close the gap that way   use up some of that    percent  my question is what you thought of that   and my observ is that that would present a much more difficult situat for us sit around this tabl   it would be kind of like a suppli shock  becaus price would be rise  inflat would be higher   and that homeown    equival rent  would be rise fa    and we   d face a more difficult situat   we pretti much know what to do   if hous price fall   that   s a pure demand shock   but if rent start rise  that   s anoth matter   so i wonder if you   d comment on that   and then  while i have the floor  let me ask my question of   and        on the      bubbl analog  i was surpris to see that classifi as a bubbl   i think there was some inflat scare then  but there was also a real rate adjust at the same  e   if you look at ani of the survey  i think you wouldn   t have seen much of an increas in inflat expect   i agre that we had to rais real rate in order to prevent that from happen   but that seem to me a veri differ anim than equiti price chang or hous price chang becaus we are respons for  inflat   so if we see inflat move  we   ve got to do someth about that  wherea we   re not respons for the relat price of hous or equiti and other thing   so i wouldn   t have put       on a list of situat we might think about as we   re look at this issu of hous price gain   it  seem to me veri differ   i   d like to hear your comment on that    and final  my other question for   has to do with this point about the misalloc of resourc    sn   t it matter what the state of the busi cycl is   if we hadn   t had so mani hous built and so much consumpt over the last few year  we would have had more unemploy   so it   s not obvious that resourc have been misalloc   the resourc that went   into build hous  furnitur  and car  and so forth might have been unemploy  especi if we  had rais rate more in order to lean against the hous price increas   if we had  sure unemploy would be higher   so it seem to me that it   s one thing to talk about misalloc resourc between two state of full employ  but it   s anoth thing to talk about a misalloc of resourc where there would otherwis be slack in the economi   and the latter case i don   t think realli is a misalloc of resourc   there   s no opportun cost
did you want to start on rent   that will give the other some  e to think     i   ve look at the rent side of the pictur   as to this idea that perhap price are get too high relat to rent  i   d argu that they   re go to come back in line   now  mayb rent are go to be do some of the correct  as it were   the work that i   ve done give just a littl hint of evid that mayb rent do a bit of the correct   so  what we might see go forward is rent growth slight higher than it otherwis would have been   but statist speak  it   s basic  no differ from zero   statist  it  sn   t look like rent do ani of the correct   what realli seem to be happen is that rent go up at some rate determin by econom condit and then price move around them
you don   t see anyth in the current situat that would differenti it from past histori in that regard   i guess that was my question
i do not  certain not with respect to the rent   i would like to say also that i agre with the comment that financi innov could veri well be a justifi reason for  hous price to be higher than usual relat to other price   i do think some thing are differ   but i don   t see anyth to suggest that we have to be worri about rental inflat and  as a result  overal inflat
with regard to equiti price and bond price  the reason i includ that comparison was to make a coupl of point   for one  the comment is often made that we can   t second guess financi market or financi market particip   it seem as if that may be true for equiti market particip but less true for bond market particip   there i take    inflat scare    or    credibl gap    or    conundrum    all to be anoth term for a situat in which we have an idea of where the fundament are and we   re not sure what bond market particip are think    now  it   s true that there   s a differ in that you have a clear idea about the reaction function or where monetari polici is go and presum can guid bond market particip   with transpar regard your notion of fundament   so there is a clear differ between the market   the hous market is differ from both the bond and the equiti market  and the question is  where can we draw the lesson   the region dispar is complet differ from  both market  and that   s just a separ issu  in ani event  one reason behind the hous price appreci  perhap  is that we have veri low long rate   this is a bond rate conundrum   perhap the misalign in bond price is lead to this misalign in hous price   so  one could perhap make the argument that it   s the bond  price experi in      that may be the relev one for today   i think i   ll stop there and leav it at that
in fact  the third scenario that i consid involv tri to emphas   that point   name that  at least by some measur that peopl have come up with  there is a big  differ in where bond rate are relat to standard es  of fundament   it   s actual a much bigger problem for the economi than just the hous price effect direct  at least accord to the frb us model   more import  it could be one of the factor drive a big part of the hous price appreci   in term of need strong hous price to keep the economi move  the way i   view your third question is that if it weren   t for the hous price run up  monetari polici would need to be easier  given current econom condit   and i think that   s absolut right   one way to think about my scenario is just to revers the sign  especi in scenario   and    and think about it as this as the posit s ulus we   ve gotten from a    percent appreci    of hous price and this is the posit effect we   ve gotten from some other factor   especi scenario    i think you can see that way   the reason i mention the misalloc of resourc toward hous relat activ in my present is that in quit a bit of the econom academ research about bubbl  the emphasi   is that they actual lead to  as   mention  a misalloc of resourc   therefor  these gap between fundament price and actual price should appear in the policymak   s object function  in addit to inflat  output and employ   so there is a notion here that that   s just anoth  problem that you would want to balanc off if you could    now  i   d like to emphas in my close remark that the assumpt that you could affect the bubbl is veri problemat   as josh himself mention  these relationship between hous price and interest rate are just not as strong as one would think and not as strong as econom  theori would suggest
okay   presid pool
just for the hell of it  i   d like to offer the hypothesi that properti valu are too low rather than too high    laughter   if you believ that treasuri index bond are a good  measur of the real rate of interest   and we were get into this discuss   the real rate of interest has been cut in half in the past five year   for ani asset with a perpetu stream of return  like land  the capit valu has doubl   now  it may well be that the issu is with the index bond and not with the hous price   it may be that the right way to state this hypothesi is instead to say that the conundrum is that there   s a disconnect between the price of some of these asset    in ani event  if we are go to be in a world in which the real rate of interest is truli much lower than it was befor   if that is go to be the situat for some  e to come   then it seem to me that we could expect some long continu appreci of land valu in particular   residenti structur have a veri long life  so they are almost price that way   and let me link this analysi to the tear down phenomenon that mark olson was talk about   i   ve been told   i don   t know the data here   that hous replac tear down may account for about         unit a year    which is a signific part of new build   mayb someon know the data on demolit and replac   i don   t
that   s rough the right number
okay   it   s a signific part of total new construct   and i know in the  communiti where i live   i thought this was real estat hype when we bought our hous   we were  told that we had bought the land and got the hous for free   but that   s just about the case  becaus  the hous in my area   a subdivis built in the     s   are be torn down  and hous with        squar feet are be replac by hous with       to       squar feet on nice one acr lot   so the land valu is signific   on this question about what is realli happen to land valu in urban area  i don   t know whether the data are avail to answer that   i suppos a detail look at real estat record and tax record  if you had enough resourc to do it  would enabl you to look at properti where the hous are be torn down and replac with new home   and that would probabl give you a pretti good measur of the under valu of the land in those area   in ani event  when real rate  of interest come down  one would expect to see increas in the valu of the land relat to the  structur   so one would expect  i think  to see more teardown   i gather that  though it   s not a brand new phenomenon  the scale of it is probabl much increas in recent year from    or    year ago   at ani rate  i offer those observ becaus  if we are in a world that is go to have much lower real rate of interest for some  e to come  one would expect to see the price to rent  ratio go up   mayb this line in the chart has anoth    percent to go to get to equilibrium   laughter
mr  chairman  i   d like to propos that he buy my hous in washington    laughter  given that confid
if i   m right  you won   t need me to buy it
i have an observ and a question about what has been happen to the mix of mortgag product in the last    to    month   in       we saw refinanc peak  and then in       total origin went from      trillion down to      trillion   so they drop and are  continu to be soft this year   but what happen dure that     to   month period of  e is that the number of arm shot up to about half of the origin   and base on anecdot evid  arm still seem to be run at least at that pace   initi  with rate at record low relat to those prevail in the last    plus year  it made sens that ration consum were lock in their mortgag rate and get the hous they could afford    now  we embark a year ago today on a path of rais interest rate   we haven   t had a compar movement at the long end  so long term rate are basic about the same as they were  whi are so mani more arm be generat   is this an afford issu   is this a mortgag  broker issu  where the broker want to get a deal at ani cost   what is happen   i   ve heard some folk say     well  the arm is a way to do the loan now  and then we   ll turn around and do the fix  rate next year
okay  let me tri to answer that question   i can   t realli comment on the hype mental or the mortgag broker who use a high pressur sale tactic   but in       for  exampl  i believ that  of the arm that were origin  less than    percent were tradit arm with a one year reset period   the remain    percent were hybrid that had a rate lock featur where the borrow is protect from interest rate movement for some period of  e   the   data on this are a littl difficult to get  but it look as if the median rate lock period was five year   if we think about peopl   s typic tenur in hous  five year isn   t a bad guess for how long peopl  are go to stay in a particular hous   a    year fix rate mortgag is  in effect  a hybrid mortgag that reset the day you move   so  i think of this to some degre as a financi innov   and one that peopl are learn about through advertis or the press or whatev   and i believ this type of hybrid arm probabl make sens for a lot of peopl who are make a decis on a   mortgag loan   the other point that i   d make is that the fraction of origin that are arm often can  overst the role of arm in the total mortgag market  becaus peopl refin out of arm  into fix rate mortgag frequent   in fact  i   ve read in the wall street newslett that some peopl seem to believ that the current rate of refinanc is elev by this flow out of arm into fix rate loan
well  that was go to be my next question   the other part of this is that we have these older         and   year arm  and      is the initi wave of the   year arm have their first bump up in rate or be refinanc out of exist
and the number i   ve seen suggest that in the next three year    percent of these arm are go to have the rate bump up or be refinanc   so  as we look at the cumul impact of this   i   m go back to the afford issu   what do we realli see  happen go forward in these mortgag
well  as you say  the rate are go to reset  and household will make decis about whether to refin to a differ point on the yield curv   or peopl can decid to move   i don   t think there   s go to be a catastroph on the averag reset date that
no matter how fast rate move up
obvious  if rate went up sharpli  that could be a problem
you have to think in term of the environ that we are forecast to occur   it   s a pretti tame interest rate environ  so it   s not one that will necessarili generat signific concern about the cost of those reset mortgag   now  obvious  we could be wrong in both direct   one could imagin a situat where the rate rose fa    and that   s one of the channel by which monetari polici has traction on the economi  if household face higher rate  they would curtail their spend in respons to that   but presum you   d onli be rais rate  more rapid becaus  in essenc  you need restraint on aggreg demand   so you would  welcom that result  as long as it wasn   t precipit some big nonlinear type of event in term of peopl respond veri  veri sharpli to that kind of chang in the environ
the second question i have relat to the natur of the price declin risk   if some of these arm can   t be refinanc and foreclosur actual start to occur   where financi  institut take over the properti   are there ani studi out there that indic how much   foreclosur volum could hit the market befor it had a materi impact on local hous price
not ani recent studi that i   m awar of   we propos do a studi  joint with a privat data vendor compani on precis this topic but it didn   t realli go anywher  the question is whether foreclosur clu  can have a pernici kind of spillov effect   i would say that lender and loan servic aren   t unawar of this problem   in my convers with them  they   ve all said that their loss mitig program involv hold down the inventori of foreclos  properti that are on the market   they do not want to let them turn into this sort of    pocket of  blight      that is the term they use   as a result of the foreclosur process   that   s all the  reassur i can offer you
we   ll just have to see how they realli are go to engin those process  thank you
yes   i have just a coupl of comment and a question   clear  there are some perspect from which hous price seem to have drift out of the usual relationship with  indic of fundament  and joshua document some of them   but it seem to me as if there    are a lot of plausibl stori one can tell about fundament that would explain or ration hous price   obvious  low interest rate have to top the list   strong incom growth among   homeown popul would be on the list  as would land use restrict  which were mention earlier  and the recent surg in spend on home improv   i found presid     s suggest intrigu   i   d like to offer my own  just in the spirit of ad potenti explan here   and it   s realli a version of someth governor kohn observ  which is that hous price are relat price   i   ve been struck by the fact that a collect of larg metropolitan area increas domin the nation hous figur and that hous price appreci seem differ across various urban region   it suggest to me that hous valu may be affect signific by   i  don   t know exact how to phrase this   sort of the relat microeconom valu of agglomer   by that i mean the valu of the amen in a citi or the enhanc product associ with live in or near where one work   now  in this age of telecommut and the internet  it   s easi to deduc that the valu of live in a citi has declin   but it seem plausibl to me that the valu of a thick labor market might be increas import for certain skill specialti   and it also seem plausibl that the strong demand for urban amen is evid in the recent vital of mani older   urban core   so i   d be interest if ani of our hous data expert have ani inform relev to that issu   while i have the floor  i   d like to make just an observ   it seem to me like that a   confluenc of sever fundament factor might ration the current level of hous price   so from that point of view  it   s hard for me to see how it would be reason to place a great deal of certainti on the notion that hous is signific overvalu  or that there   s a bubbl  or that it   s go to collaps realli soon    i think these market   this is echo presid pool   s discuss   are too complex   i think our quantit understand of them is too limit to warrant second guess market  forc   and beyond that  the model that we have of bubbl     wrote it down   are just some  statist nois ad to an equat   i don   t think we have ani model that give us ani reason to hope that we can understand how interest rate chang would affect this littl random statist term ad on to these equat  have said that  hous price pose a dilemma for us and are go to pose challeng for us soon  i think   rapid appreci in asset price can make monetari polici more difficult   they tend to be associ with tighten labor market   at the same  e  there is a rise in the downsid risk   so  even though i   m not veri far down     s decis tree  these are still issu  i   m pay attent to   it feel as if it could well occupi our attent here    but i   d be interest in your reaction to this agglomer stori
well  i think there   s someth to it   there is the view that peopl   particular higher incom peopl  place a high valu on their  e   if you don   t want to be caught  in washington  d c   traffic  say  you might decid to sell your hous in the suburb and move into   the citi and in the process drive up land price in d c   which happen to be one of the metro area with the highest rate of price increas   i   m not a region specialist  but i know there are peopl at our bank who are work on  this issu of agglomer benefit   and i think their conclus is that there are a lot of reason  particular labor market associ reason  whi there may be more agglomer benefit now than previous   that is exact the opposit conclus a lot of peopl thought would be the case  as we move to more telecommut and that sort of thing
that certain seem possibl   when i look at josh   s exhibit   on page    i see the miami price rent ratio at    percent abov it trend   now  it   s possibl that everybodi just woke up and decid  boy  there are peopl in miami who are just realli terrif to be around   it   s an excit citi and fascin peopl live there    laughter   but it   s also possibl that that statist could be an indic that peopl have unrealist expect about the rate of  increas in hous price expect in miami   and there is certain a lot of anecdot evid that  in that particular citi there is a lot of flip of properti go on as well as other develop that might not be reflect of a pure equilibrium move in hous price or of agglomer economi   so i   m still a littl nervous about this   there are a lot of good reason whi price ought to be high relat to rent and relat to incom   and i think even presid pool   s suggest that  mayb hous is undervalu can   t be rule out   we   ve done simpl dividend discount type calcul on rent and interest rate   and if you make a certain assumpt about the growth rate of real rent go forward and the persist of low interest rate  you can get figur show further appreci of mayb not    percent but rate that are pretti high   so we think that   s within   the probabl distribut   but we   re also worri that we   re see in mani market and for the   nation as a whole a run up in price that certain look veri unusu by histor standard   it could veri well be that this  e is differ and it   s all be driven by fundament   but we don   t think you should rule out the possibl that you could be face a period in which price could be  declin or just be softer   one point that has been made is that we obvious don   t know how the end will look   if   there is an end   the end could come through a long period of just relat subdu growth in  nomin hous price   it wouldn   t have to be associ with a    percent declin   as we note in  the  book  that is an extrem drop   in fact  to get to     s scenario    a lot of extrem thing   have to happen   it take an unusu larg drop in hous price and a lot of spillov effect   as you recal  the first scenario was pretti tame  if you move down    basi point on interest rate  it  offset that   but if you layer on top of the declin in hous price a big drop in consum confid  a big equiti extract effect  or a much bigger wealth effect from hous   which  look to us to be pretti much on the edg   and throw in some covari with a bond market event  the situat worsen substanti   but it take a lot to get to a real disast type of scenario    so even though we feel that hous price have move out of align with the fundament  we don   t necessarili think the implic of that are that you   re go to be confront immedi with some larg problem   in fact  our best guess would be that the misalign would unwind in way that would be quit feasibl for you to offset and insul    there are question on the supervisori side   there i don   t think the histor evid suggest that supervisori polici has been use effect to head off asset bubbl or to eleg deflat them when they occur   what you might hope to do is to have in place polici that will prevent the kind of spillov effect of     s scenario   so that you just have a wealth effect   in other word  hous price might go down or soften and that will show up on various agent    balanc   sheet as a reduct in wealth   one might hope that they respond accord and that we won   t  have the complic with intermedi or other kind of thing that would add to that effect   so our stori basic is that we   re worri about valuat in the hous market  but we don   t necessarili see that as have profound consequ for your polici go forward

yes   i have a question for   about a coupl of the chart   one of the  thing that struck me in look at the chart for the unit kingdom   whether you look at price  to rent ratio or real hous price   is that they obvious have gone through sever veri sharp  swing  if you look at the u s  histor chart  they   re pretti benign   dave was just talk about the possibl fallout of sharp swing in those measur here  and i was curious whether we could learn anyth about the macro consequ or the macro condit associ with what has happen in the u k
well  for one thing  the u k    s      cycl was amplifi by regulatori chang that preced it  which led to mortgag lend that was excess and not well supervis   it was a kind of blind lead the blind situat  the regul chang the rule and the financi institut move into the market and practic and norm chang   a great deal of lend took place   the supervisor were learn as much as the lender were and   well  let me put it this way   it didn   t go well   in the past  there has certain been a correspond between household consumpt and hous wealth in the u k   so when they suffer the big drop in the      rundown of hous price  they also had a big chang in household consumpt out of dispos incom  and so forth  and they had the make of a recess as a result     now  a coupl of the characterist of the u k  market have alway led us to think that it   s not a tell exampl   one is the preval of variabl rate mortgag  which caus the process of tighten monetari polici to contain the macroeconomi to have a bit of extra leverag over the  discretionari incom of household   to an extent that is not the case with fix rate mortgag obvious  there   s a counterpart effect on the earn of mortgag lender  and so forth  in the u s  economi that you need to take account of to fulli understand that   but there is that characterist   and there is the fact that hous price actual fell in the u k   so they had big negat equiti problem  which complic the process of how to unwind the interact of household behavior and financi intermediari behavior   to the extent peopl walk away from the hous  the financi intermediari were get collater that perhap no longer equal the valu of the loan   on the other hand  some household didn   t walk away  they just remain in a negat equiti  posit for some  e   and that had a long  dampen effect on their spend pattern   so there were complex reaction involv    but this  e around  at least base on my convers with u k  offici  they think they   ve improv a lot of those thing   so in that sens  there is someth to be learn   financi institut now know better how to maintain their balanc sheet and how to do this lend   the household know better  too  they   ve learn a bit   u k  offici think they   ve seen a lessen to some degre of this tight link between hous wealth and consumpt so that they   re not both on the run up and then  when it stop  extrapol what the consequ would be   on the other hand  i have to admit that i occasion read my littl machin while i sit here   and in the last hour it carri three statement from a member of the bank of england   s monetari polici committe who must have been make a speech   and all three statement the media chose  to pick up pertain to whether or not hous price ought to be relev for monetari polici     laughter   and all of the statement were slight two hand  along the line of  monetari polici should not be driven by hous price  but we must look at them close    laughter    i think there are lesson to be learn  i   m not say there aren   t   but certain the     s  episod had some characterist that were far more extrem and that would never happen here  becaus of institut differ   and the present episod  which has remedi some of those earlier problem  i think is not such a bad deal   they   ve slow the increas in hous price  they aren   t have negat equiti   they don   t have financi institut that look like they   re  go to becom or technic are insolv   i think in that sens they move to improv their infrastructur  so to speak   they talk about the issu a lot but i think they feel the situat is okay at this  e
may i rais a question  which puzzl me  on chart      that has the new home price index and the ofheo index   i don   t think there   s a big problem understand the price of new home ex land   sinc home are larg custom  one would  expect that  as inde the data show  the growth in product   and presum in unit labor cost  in residenti construct   is less than the averag   that would lead you to conclud that at constant margin the averag real price of home is go up   and the number is  as i recal    somewher between     and     or      or someth like that   now  after a hous is construct and price  the price from there forward either is flat or goe down   i don   t think anybodi presum it goe up   this get to the issu of whether the modern or the depreci  overwhelm  you have a system in which you have initi price of new home  and let   s assum there   s a decay rate   so  as the home age  if the decay rate are all constant  clear ani measur of constant age exist home will exact parallel the new home price   look at this chart  it   s veri evid   that price of exist home on averag are rise fa    general go almost all the way back   than those of new home   that could impli that there is a chang in mix   in other word  if there   s a decay rate  then the presumpt is that the averag age of exist home that are be sold is move down   but none of the credibl hypothes   becaus that can   t go on veri long     explain this differ   we know that the constant qualiti new home price is a hedon  reason well construct seri   how do we reconcil these data   what   s happen
well  i think in part it may go back to one of the issu discuss earlier about the rate at which replac is take place   now  i haven   t done this in the most scientif  way  but if you just take period es  of the stock of hous  whether from the census or   from the american hous survey  and tri to line up chang in the stock with new product  it appear that we   re in a period when a lot of destruct of old hous is take place   as you   mention  the averag es  on tear down is          but i   ve seen es  as high as         unit
let me just say this   we have this seri on vacanc rate   and ratio  and that seri actual has an implicit hous stock figur   if you take the figur for  complet and match it up against that  for a good portion of the last    year you get negat replac
so it   s not evid what those replac number are  we   re realli at sea on what the actual total hous stock is  which is the problem we have with measur popul as well   so i   m not sure you can make the statement that you just made
well  i think for a shorter  e horizon you can say that
do you mean like the period we   re in now
yes  over the past four or five year  i think it   hold true
you mean as far as the complet rate be so high relat  to household format   if you believ the household format data
right   well  and also to the es  of the stock
okay   so you   re suggest that this is   but this pattern has  gone on sinc          speaker      page     mr  chairman
it has been go on for a long  e  but i think the separ has been most  pronounc more recent
that   s certain true   but is it credibl that we can have a consist more rapid rise in price of exist home unless the valu of the land is rise fa  for those home   then there   s the issu we discuss earlier about move out into the suburb  which undercut the land price valu of the new home   do we have ani insight into that at all
that is my opinion on the matter   if you put a new home into place on a plot of land and follow that over  e  the valu of the structur might rise  reflect an improv to the hous  or it might deterior   but as for the land  onc the hous is built  it fall into exist hous land   that   s what it is from then on   and if the valu of that packag of land and structur is go up and you think the valu of the structur is not  it   s come in through the land   if you flip to the veri last page of the handout  page     the lower panel show level of the repeat transact price in red  level of the constant qualiti price index for new home in      and an es  of construct cost   that basic reflect the cost of a bundl of construct  materi over  e   a certain amount of lumber  a certain amount of
that can   t be far wrong
if you look at the pattern of the   line  the constant qualiti and the cost line move rough togeth   obvious  the constant qualiti price index has increas more rapid recent  becaus that index   captur partial  i think  increas in land price   but i think that the gap between the three line are tell us quit a bit about what   s go on with regard to the price of land sit under the entir stock of hous
you   re impli  howev  an answer to the question i ask you befor which you refus to answer  laughter   which is the ratio of the land valu to total valu
there   s a differ between refus and inabl    laughter
the ratio is   unless you were infer it between the two price  which beg the question
well  that   s exact what morri davi
yes  i understand that   but it rais the question of whether the price data are accur
absolut   as i said  this is what i think is go on   in my view  that   s what is captur land price
did you ever say what adjust you make in the repeat  transact ofheo number
in my prepar text  no  i didn   t   but i can go over them briefli   would you like me to
can you do it quick
yes   i made an adjust for improv rate and depreci rate   and there are actual two type of transact bias i made adjust for   one is the fact that home that have greater appreci tend to transact more and  therefor  they show up more in the repeat transact databas   so i made an adjust for that   also  two economist at ofheo wrote a paper show that there   s anoth kind of bias   basic the high end home tend to appreci fa  than the low end home   and that   s bias the ofheo as well   so i made an adjust for that   those are the three main adjust that i made to the repeat transact price data
governor    did you want to make a comment
i have three quick point   on sue   s point earlier about foreclosur  i think foreclosur rate nation are too low to do anyth with analyt   but in my world of  low incom hous  in certain urban neighborhood they get up to    percent or so   one can   t help  but think that what happen   it   s like the old redlin issu   is that first some foreclosur occur on a block  and pretti soon the valu of the home start go down  and then a lot of peopl stop make mortgag payment   i don   t think that has macro signific  but it is a big problem in certain neighborhood   and that   s actual one thing i would like to work on when i leav here   on the discuss between josh and cathi earlier about afford measur  i think that cathi was tri to get you to say  josh  what would happen if interest rate went up and noth  els happen   but   pardon
that probabl wouldn   t happen
well  that   s right   i understand that the link between interest rate and  price is weak   but realli  there ought to be a full general equilibrium  if you will  calcul there    afford rate may tend to be a lot more stabl than we would think just from interest rate alon  if it turn out that they do have an impact on price   the third point    rais what i thought was an interest idea earlier that some peopl have pick up on  which is that mayb these credit innov are endogen   i recal a brief  that we had just a short  e ago where the staff suggest that  in effect  what was happen   and i  frank  was a littl skeptic at the  e   was that peopl were identifi by how much they could pay for their hous   and that  i think  make the credit transact automat endogen    that may be a better way to look at the whole situat  and i guess research at the board have alreadi start do that   i don   t know how complet their research is  but given our myopic societi  that may be a much better way to look at it   how much you can pay   and then nobodi worri about what the implic are down the road   but that explain the initi buy decis
is that a statement or a question
yes    laughter   do i have to say   if somebodi want to comment  they can
let   s choos to leav it as it stand and we   ll end this  discuss with presid     do you want to make a comment
no  sir   mine was on a similar line  neither a question nor a statement   laughter
dino  how long are your remark
about    minut
whi don   t we leav them until first thing tomorrow morn   is that okay   let   s adjourn   meet recess      june      morn session
mr  kos will start this morn
thank you  mr  chairman   most major asset market were littl chang in the intermeet period   the except were  the price of oil  which rose  the euro  which fell  and corpor credit market  which face some turbul after the downgrad of gm debt  the top panel graph the   month cash deposit rate in black and the   month deposit rate   and   month forward in red   the   month forward rate has been in a tight corridor for sever month  therebi compress the spread both to the   month forward rate and the cash rate   this compress reflect the widespread expect that the end of the tighten cycl is approach   market particip briefli flirt with the notion that the tighten cycl would end as earli as this meet  after presid     s comment on june   and the weak employ report two day later   but subsequ remark by the chairman in his tes oni and by other committe member quick revers sen ent   the    year yield fell    basi point in the intermeet period   that  coupl with the rise at the short end  led to a further flatten of the curv   this caus a flurri of commentari about what signal the flatten was send  and more omin  the implic of a possibl invers of the yield curv   the middl panel

histor averag   the flatten in this cycl has been dramat but is not without preced   note that the flatten in the earli     s was of similar magnitud and was follow by a period of pretti robust growth   second  the level of the curv  at    basi point  is not out of line with other period   as shown in the shade rectangular area  the    to    year spread is now at level that were travers in the second half of the     s  moreov  the spread was onli slight steeper dure the     s expans   a  e when both rate and risk premium were no doubt higher   the conclus that i at least draw from look at the histori are   that the current flatten has earlier preced  that the current shape of the curv is well within histor norm  that invers are rare  and that while an invers caus by further tighten cannot be rule out  the scenario that is at least as like is for long term yield to rise in respons to higher short term rate   the bottom panel show the    and    year tip  treasuri inflat protect

year  they began to fall as inflationari expect reced and the price of oil back off from it earlier high   in recent week oil and breakeven have diverg  with breakeven rate continu to declin while oil rose to new high abov       one explan for this paradox is the reviv of the notion that higher oil price will act as a restrain factor on activ and therebi depress inflationari tendenc   tip trader  howev  have been push an altern explan  that technic reason relat to the season of price increas creat this pattern where breakeven widen earli in the year and then fall back   in either case  the tip market is not send out warn flare from the most recent burst in oil price    while the treasuri market has been relat well behav  the credit market experienc some volatil relat to the news surround general motor and ford   two day after the committe   s may meet  the debt rate of gm and ford were downgrad to non invest grade by standard and poor   s   as shown in the top panel of page    gm and ford spread widen dramat ahead of the decis and were both trade at spread far abov the high yield index  the   line    those spread came in a bit but then widen again and are now near level observ when the two compani were first downgrad   i should note that ford was not downgrad by the other two rate agenc and thus was reinstat into the invest grade index   nevertheless  it trade at spread that are well into high yield territori   as i mention at the last meet  the transit of billion of dollar in debt from the larg invest grade market to the far smaller non invest grade market is like to take month   those investor need to sell are like to seek to avoid sell at fire sale price   but the slow pace of divest creat an overhang that is appar to everyon and probabl help explain the wide of spread relat to the index   and yet the perform of the broader high yield and invest grade index was rather tame  as investor appar did not extrapol the problem of these compani more broad   the problem at gm and ford  and for that matter some smaller auto part compani such as collin and aikman  did show through into the credit deriv market  which exhibit some sign of strain as price model

the middl panel graph the jgb curv as of ye day and as of one year ago   the weight of liquid from the bank of japan   s quantit eas polici has pull more of the yield curv toward zero   final  let me say just a quick word on global equiti   the bottom panel graph the perform of select equiti index in local currenc term  the blue bar  and in dollar term  the red bar    the stock market of the u  k

was difficult to find evid of that in the past seven week   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
i   m fascin by the correl in the daili movement of rate among the five major countri shown at the top of page     i   m even look to see whether or not it is appar in the data that australia is    hour behind the unit state  and i can   t tell whether we   re follow australia or they   re follow us   but the converg in these market is get to be notabl  on page    the bottom chart on the tip breakeven and the crude oil futur price  i can understand whi there may be a debat with respect to the diverg from earli may between the crude price and the tip   but the  argument that are made for that diverg then make me look at the previous period where the correl is in exact the opposit direct   so  it  sn   t strike me that either explan is particular credibl
i think that   s one  of the reason some of the trader are look for other explan  such as technic explan relat to the season pattern
that would be a huge season adjust   it  sn   t make  ani sens   i cannot believ  with all the hedg fund lose money  that the abil to pick up a season and exploit it has not been ground away  e and  e again   is there ani evid that  season still exist in these market that are arbitrag
i haven   t done the analysi   the way the stori is told is that becaus the tip work off of the non season adjust index  you do get these pattern becaus of price
yes  but we know what the season is
exact   so  you would expect peopl to take advantag of that  which
i think the explan   base on my long term recollect   is that peopl look at three year and they see  for three year  price move a certain way   therefor  though there   s no substant reason  they base judgment for later year on that  and the fourth year  obvious  when they tri to play it  they lose money
i think the argument  mr  chairman  is that the residu season is in the under   that is  the compens you get is base on the not season adjust cpi  so the arbitrag is actual to have the real rate get a season to offset the season in the under   the one thing i would note in term of the diverg between the near term oil futur and the tip inflat compens is that we   ve also seen a differ in the behavior of the front month contract and the longer date contract in oil futur   dure the latter part of the period  where they   ve move differ  it has been more of a parallel shift   that is  if you don   t anticip futur declin in oil price   if you were read it off futur market   wherea earlier you did   tip market particip would presum price in anticip futur declin in oil price and it consequ for the cpi   but in the last month or two  it has been flat
further question for dino   mr  vice chair  would you move approv of the domest oper
without object  they are approv   let   s move on to the chart show present by   olin  dave    and   leahi
we have receiv a fair amount of data sinc we close the  book   just this morn  bea report that real consum expenditur  shown in the top left panel  were flat in may   this was actual a bit stronger than we had expect  but there was also a small downward revis to april   for the second quarter as whole  shown in the inset box  we project that real pce increas at a     percent rate  unchang from the  book forecast   meanwhil  hous activ continu to be robust  with sale of new and exist home  shown to the right  have remain at histor high level in may   turn to busi spend  we receiv new data on order and shipment of nondefens capit good after the  book close   as shown by the red line in the middl left panel  shipment edg up in may  while order  the black line  soften a bit   these data were near spot on the  book es  and point to a moder rise in real e s  equip and softwar  spend this quarter   look ahead  the result of the reserv bank queri on capit spend plan appear broad consist with a solid upward track for outlay   as shown in the panel to the right     percent of the respond expect to increas their spend over the next six to    month  while onli    percent plan to decreas spend  similar to the result in januari   move to the lower left panel  the data on initi claim releas this morn show that the four week move averag  the red line  edg down to about          a level that we es  to be consist with moder growth in payrol employ   round out this review of recent indic  we receiv new data this morn on pce price   as shown in the inset box to the right  the core index rose     percent in may  a tenth below our  book forecast   also  the increas in march was revis down a tenth  although that revis was confin to the nonmarket part of the index   the latest data leav the    month chang in the core pce index at     percent   your next exhibit briefli describ the key background factor for our project  as shown in the upper left panel  we assum that the feder fund rate  the black line  will gradual rise to    percent by the end of next year  veri similar to the path    the materi use by messr  olin     and leahi are append to this transcript  appendix           in the april  book   long term treasuri rate  the red line  are expect to hold about steadi through next year  follow a path just a shade below that assum in april   as shown to the right  the impetus from fiscal polici step down this year to   percent of gdp and remain at about that level in       these fiscal assumpt are essenti unchang from the april  book   among the other key background factor  we have taken on board the upward surpris dure the intermeet period for equiti price  the middl left panel  and hous price  the panel to the right   which rais the assum path for household wealth   in contrast  the higher oil price in this project  the lower left panel  and the recent appreci of the dollar  shown to the right  were negat for our growth forecast   on balanc  the revis to these background factor had littl net effect on our project of real gdp   the next exhibit summar our forecast of growth and inflat   as shown by the black dash line in the top left panel  we project that real gdp will expand rough     percent this year and again in       just a bit fa  in both year than the growth of potenti   as you can see in the tabl to the right  sinc januari we have revis down the forecast of gdp growth about   percentag point in both      and        on our current forecast of gdp growth  we expect that the unemploy rate  the middl left panel  will hold steadi at it current level of     percent through the end of the forecast period   as shown to the right  the project path for the unemploy rate has not chang much sinc the januari  book   with regard to inflat  the lower left panel show that we project core pce price to rise a bit more than   percent this year and a tad less than   percent in       up from the     percent increas record last year   the tabl to the right show that  the project for this year and next are each up half a percentag point from the januari  book   dave   will now continu our present
as you know from the  book and as is shown in the upper left panel of exhibit    the unemploy rate is current just a tenth of a percentag point abov our es  of the nairu   to put the matter delic  howev  the most impress aspect of our es  of the nairu may be the imprecis of it  accord to one repres econometr equat  a    percent confid interv around the point es  of the nairu extend   full percentag point from top to bottom   accord  one might reason ask whether ani evid can be marshal to corrobor our view that a smidgeon of slack still remain in the labor market   the upper right panel present one such bit of evid   as shown by the black line  the particip rate has declin a percentag point over the past five year   to be sure  the model that we use to analyz movement in the particip rate write  off part of that declin as reflect trend demograph develop  summar by   the red line   but the larger part of the overal declin  accord to the model  reflect a swing from a particip rate that was abov it trend level through the late     s to one that has been below it trend level the last few year   on our interpret  condit in the labor market were suffici uninvit to caus some worker to take themselv out of the workforc   but as job opportun continu to improv  these worker will be avail to rejoin the labor forc   and will do so in great enough number to hold the particip rate steadi despit a declin trend   the middl left panel show a broad measur of condit in the labor market    total hour work relat to trend   this measur combin the effect of the unemploy gap  the particip rate gap  and the gap in the workweek relat to it trend  not shown but current about zero   as you can see from the chart  total hour work remain a littl below the es  trend despit the recent gradual improv in labor market condit   the idea that some labor market slack remain is corrobor by a few other indic   for exampl  as shown in the middl right panel  individu still perceiv job as somewhat harder to get than they were in the first half of       when labor market seem rough to be in equilibrium   similar  as shown in the lower left panel  the nfib  nation feder of independ busi  report that small busi still are not encount quit as much difficulti fill posit as they did in the first half of        i should also note that a few other indic suggest that the labor market is at least as tight as it was in earli        for exampl  as shown in the lower right panel  the percent of employ peopl work part  e for econom reason has fallen below it averag over the first half of        that said  we still see the balanc of evid as suggest that a littl slack remain in the labor market  but that the margin is narrow  and narrow today than it was six month or a year ago   moreov  such slack as may still exist will  on our project  essenti be taken up over the cours of the next year and a half   other thing equal  in the past  labor market slack has restrain the growth of nomin compens and thus has help to keep price pressur in check as well  and yet  as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit    compens per hour as measur in the bls   s  bureau of labor statist  product and cost  p c  system soar more than    percent in the fourth quarter of last year and post anoth hefti increas in the first quarter of this year   as shown by the black line to the right  even on a four quarter basi  the growth of compens per hour has pick up sharpli in the last two quarter  rais the question as to whether under compens pressur are build and whether they may be feed price inflat   we think not  for two main reason   first  as shown by the blue line in the upper right panel  the other main indic of compens trend  the eci  employ cost index   has actual been deceler slight sinc mid       suggest that the compens situat may be a good deal less alarm than one might conclud   base on the p c measur alon   second  we diagnos the recent bulg in compens per hour as have been influenc by a spike in stock option exercis  which we think have littl bear on firm    price decis   inde  the last  e a bulg of this sort occur in comp per hour  in       core pce price inflat   the red line in the upper right panel   respond littl if at all   the middl left panel review some of the consider that lead us to implic option exercis in this matter   for now  in the interest of  e  i will onli touch on the first and most obvious factor  name  that option exercis are includ in p c compens per hour but not in the eci   the attribut of a sizabl portion of the spike in comp per hour to option exercis is import  becaus growth in that form  of compens is not like to persist at it fourth quarter pace   inde  to that point  the middl right panel summar our outlook for the growth of compens per hour   as shown on line   of the tabl  we have the four quarter chang in p c comp per hour come back down sharpli this year  as about half of last year   s fourth quarter spike is unwound   as shown on line    we have eci compens per hour move up along a smoother trajectori  push up by the gradual tighten of labor market  the continu pass through of increas in structur product to real wage  and the lag effect of higher consum price inflat last year and this year   overal  on our number  the growth of compens will be moder enough to allow a gradual deceler in core consum price from here forward while still permit firm to maintain the markup of price over unit labor cost  not shown  notic abov it averag over the past    year   but we could be wrong about all of that  and the bottom two panel illustr the potenti consequ of a misjudg on our part   as outlin in the lower left panel  we sketch an altern scenario in the  book in which hour compens increas   percentag point fa  than in the baselin over the remaind of this year and next   in addit  we assum that firm have suffici price power to protect their profit margin  and are abl   by the end of the scenario    to return the markup to it baselin valu   as shown by the dash red line to the right  the result boost to core pce price inflat is substanti   by the end of       core inflat is run at a   percent annual rate and head further north from there    while we view a compens led spiral as a risk to the outlook  we do not see compens as have been a major sourc of the recent upward creep in core inflat   but if not compens  then what    the top left panel of exhibit   step back and review the scope of the recent run up in core pce price inflat   the red line in this panel show the evolut over the past    month of our forecast for core pce inflat dure        as shown by the leftmost point on that line  back in decemb      we forecast that core pce price would increas about     percent over the cours of        as shown by the   peak in the red line  by august of last year  we had mark our forecast up  on net  about   percentag point  to     percent   thus far  in ani event  that august forecast has prove to be a littl too pessimist  as shown by the rightmost point on the red line  our latest es    which now simpli track the publish figur for      from the bea   is     percent   the blue line similar track the evolut of the forecast for        there  as you can see  the upward revis in our forecast has been more pronounc   as shown by the rightmost point on the blue line  the current  book call for core pce inflat to come in this year at     percent   as shown by the   line  we did not begin provid a forecast of inflat in      until last septemb   s  book  but sinc then  that forecast has follow a similar upward trajectori   so what has been go on   the panel to the right provid half of the answer   as you are well awar  oil price have surpris both us and the rest of the world great to the upsid   as you can gaug from the vertic distanc between the dot blue line at the bottom and the dash black line at the top  the forecast implicit in oil futur contract back in decemb      for oil today was too low by about     per barrel    but other develop have work in the same advers direct   as shown in the panel to the middl left  the ppi for core intermedi materi price also has risen consider fa  than we expect as of a year and a half ago  and is expect to continu along it current higher trajectori   similar  import price  shown to the right  have risen fa   on net  than we expect in decemb       even though event have unfold a littl more favor than we had expect as of decemb        the tabl in the lower left panel trace through the implic of these develop for our inflat outlook   as shown on line    between decemb      and last week   s  book  we   ve revis up our es  of core pce inflat in      by     percentag point  on net  and have mark up our forecast for inflat this year   percentag point   line   and   show that the deterior in the oil outlook can account for about half of the upward revis in both year  while  import and materi price can account for near all of the rest  leav onli a small amount  line    to be explain by other factor   we take some comfort from this result becaus we expect the upward impetus from the sourc repres on line   and   to prove transitori   as shown in the tabl to the lower right  as those transitori influenc wane  we expect the inflat pictur to improv   for this year  as you know  we have toplin inflat  line    come in at     percent again  littl differ from last year  befor drop back to    percent next year  under the influenc of the swing in energi price   and  as shown on line    we have core pce inflat step up    percentag point this year befor moder slight next year     given that oil price have surpris so much to the upsid  one might have expect our project for the growth of real gdp to have been mark down substanti of late   but  as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit    that has been onli part true   this panel   for the growth of real gdp what the one from the preced exhibit did for core pce inflat   thus  the red line show the evolut of our project for real gdp growth over the four quarter of        as shown by the steadili sink portion of that line  which parallel the feel we had in our stomach at the  e  we mark down our project for the growth of real activ substanti as the bad news came in dure the first two third of        by contrast  our project for      and      have been remark stabl   how could this have been so   the panel to the upper right show that the increas in oil price relat to what we had assum in the decemb       book in fact were  on our es   a major negat for the growth of real gdp both last year and this   as shown by the red line  we es  that oil price increas trim half a percentag point from the growth of real gdp in        and  as shown by the blue line  they will cut near a percentag point from the growth of real gdp in        clear  oil price effect can be onli part of the explan  becaus they fail to explain the full extent of the disappoint in      and they explain too much in        the middl left panel fill part of the gap   as you will recal all too clear  our es  as to the influenc of the partial expens provis prove rather wide of the mark   as shown by the declin height of the bar mark             over the cours of the past year and a half  we have progress trim our es  of fiscal impetus in       explain anoth     percentag point of our overal downward revis   by the same token  the bar mark            show that the patch of the pothol plus some unanticip defens spend have ad to the project growth of real gdp this year   the tabl to the middl right summar the net effect of these two influenc  as shown on line   and    the increas in oil price and the reduct in fiscal s ulus can explain about half of the shortfal in      growth relat to our project on the eve of the year   the remain     percentag point was a puzzl in real  e  and larg remain so today   for       the pars out exercis yield a tidier result   by our light  oil price were inde a big negat  but that negat was almost complet offset by our miss on the partial expens provis   without doubt  other influenc have been bear on the growth of real gdp but  conveni  they happen to net to zero in the arithmet for        one implic of this exercis is that the under growth of demand    support  to be sure  by low interest rate and appreci gain in hous and stock   market wealth   has been pretti robust   look ahead  we expect oil to remain a negat for the level of real gdp  but not to ani great degre for it rate of growth go forward   thus  if oil price flatten out  as we assum  we would expect the relat robust pace of under demand to show through to toplin growth   the tabl at the bottom of the page summar our outlook for the growth of real gdp   as shown on line    for this year and next  we expect real gdp growth to averag about     percent per year   this growth rate is close to our es  of the rate of growth of potenti  so  as shown on line    the output gap close onli a littl from it current level of about   percent   throughout the project period  domest final sale are the key driver of aggreg demand  support by interest rate that remain quit low   net export  line    subtract a littl less from the growth of aggreg demand this year  but resum their more substanti pace of eros next year   inventori invest  line    is expect to be about neutral for real growth this year and next
we will now focus on a set of key financi issu for the outlook  your next exhibit explor whether market appear to have built in suffici allow for risk   in effect  take ye day   s discuss of asset

rais the same question for commerci real estat   as presid   note ye day   fulli anticip my remark   the middl right panel show that the price of commerci properti  the red line  have been rise at a good clip in recent year even though the net oper incom   or noi   that they generat  the black line  has been fall   this diverg has push down the ratio of net oper incom to properti price  the analogu to an earn price ratio for equiti   the lower left panel plot the noi   to price ratio against the synthet treasuri perpetu yield   as you can see  the gap between the two seri has narrow in recent year and current sit in the lower   part of the rang observ over the past decad  which might be view as caus for concern   howev  the case for overvalu in commerci real estat is not open and shut by ani mean   net oper incom has been held down by the unusu high  vacanc rate that emerg sever year ago   but  as shown in the panel to the right   the fundament for commerci real estat appear to be improv   the vacanc rate for offic build   one of the hardest hit properti sector   start to tip down last year and  accord to preliminari data  it fell further in the second quarter   in addit  the market rent for avail offic space has turn up in recent quarter   if demand for space continu to firm  the appar rich price for commerci real estat may turn out to have been justifi  as investor   in retrospect   will have correct look through a temporari period of weak   your next exhibit address anoth question that has attract attent   is corpor credit qualiti start to slip   the first point to note is that  at present  the corpor sector is in excel financi shape overal   as shown in the upper left panel  the default rate on corpor bond and the delinqu rate on c i  commerci and industri  loan at bank are both veri low   in addit  as shown to the right  the share of cash flow that nonfinanci firm devot to meet interest expens  the red line  has continu to declin  and these firm still have a larg stockpil of cash  the black line    that said  we believ that the high point of the credit cycl is now behind us   for starter  firm have begun to disgorg the cash on their balanc sheet   as shown in the middl left panel  cash payout to sharehold jump in      and remain high in the first quarter of this year  reflect increas in dividend  the dark blue part of the bar   share repurchas  the lighter blue part   and cash paid to the sharehold of target firm in merger  the red part    these payout may well repres the best use of otherwis idl cash  but they do lessen the resourc avail to repay the firm    creditor    two develop in the bond market are noteworthi as well   first  bond issuanc has shift toward weaker firm   as shown in the panel to the right  high yield firm account for more than    percent of the bond issu by nonfinanci compani in       the highest share in more than a decad   the high yield share thus far this year  while down from       remain well abov it histor averag  second  the use of the proceed from high yield bond issu has shift in a direct that is less support of credit qualiti   as indic in the lower left panel  from       to       fulli    percent of the proceed from these issu were use to refin exist debt  as firm focus on improv their balanc sheet  howev  that share declin last year and fell again in the first half of this year   this drop has been mirror by a sharp increas in the use of bond proceed to financ lbos  leverag buyout   other merger activ  and payout to sharehold     ul   the financi health of the busi sector depend on it capac to generat profit   as shown to the right  the profit share for domest nonfinanci firm  measur as econom profit divid by sector gdp  now stand at a relat high level   we expect this share will retreat somewhat over the forecast period  as it normal   in a matur expans   even so  we anticip that profit will remain strong enough to prevent a sharp deterior in corpor credit qualiti    your next exhibit turn to the question of whether household are face signific financi stress   judg by the delinqu rate shown in the upper left panel  which are all relat low  the household sector appear to be do reason well   moreov  lender seem to have a sanguin view of household financ   as shown to the right  the most recent senior loan offic survey   taken in april   indic that bank  on net  have been eas their lend standard for consum loan   to dig beneath these aggreg indic  the staff has begun to analyz the household level data collect from the      survey of consum financ  scf   as note in the middl left panel  the result are preliminari and will be subject to some revis as the scf staff continu to process the data   i should stress that the result are confidenti until the public releas of the      data  which is schedul for januari of next year   the black line in the panel to the right plot the share of household that report have ani debt payment at least    day past due   as shown  the share in the      survey   at near   percent of household   was higher than in ani prior survey  indic that financi stress has becom more widespread   this trend would appear to conflict with the low delinqu rate i cite a moment ago   howev  those seri were base on the dollar amount of delinqu debt  while the black line in this panel measur the fraction of scf household with a late payment   the red line put thing on more of an    appl to appl    basi with the upper left panel by present the share of aggreg debt held by scf household with a late payment  as shown  these household account for    percent of total household debt in the      survey  a figur within the rang from earlier survey   thus  from a macro perspect  the scf data suggest that repay problem are not unusu sever  although the incid of stress has risen   the lower left panel summar some addit find from the survey with regard to household balanc sheet   first  the substanti rise in household asset from      to      was driven by the appreci in hous valu and was fair widespread across incom group   at the same  e  the survey reveal rapid debt growth throughout the incom distribut   for household with incom near the median  asset and debt move up by about the same amount  leav net worth littl chang between      and        howev  net worth rose quit a bit for high incom household     turn our attent back to aggreg data  the panel to the right indic that we expect household net worth  scale by dispos person incom  to rise a tad further befor edg down next year with the assum slowdown in hous price appreci   take account of the lag respons of spend to chang in net worth  this contour impli that wealth effect will make a sizabl posit  contribut to the growth of real consum outlay this year and will be rough a neutral factor in          leahi will now continu our present
the top left panel of exhibit    present our outlook for foreign real gdp growth   we forecast total foreign growth to move back up this quarter from  a soft first quarter pace and to rise a bit further go forward   the pickup is modest and reflect our assess of the balanc between some oppos forc   on the one hand  higher oil price  while support for some economi  are expect to damp activ  on balanc  for our foreign aggreg  which is weight by u s  export  on the other hand  financi condit appear to be more uniform support of growth abroad   mani foreign currenc have depreci against the dollar sinc the begin of the year and  as shown on the right  stock price in emerg market and industri economi have move up sinc the middl of last year   emerg market bond spread  shown in the bottom left panel  back up a bit from their low earlier this year but are still tight by histor standard   and benchmark long term interest rate abroad have move substanti lower  as shown by the red line in the bottom  right panel   the widespread declin of long term rate has been a promin topic of  discuss recent  and mani hypothes have been offer to explain it   i do not propos to resolv that debat    laughter   howev  the extent to which rate have declin has vari across countri   whi this might be so is the subject of your next exhibit   as shown in the top left panel  the yield on the german govern bond was essenti equal to the    year treasuri yield in octob       a date that fall befor ani of the central bank discuss on this page began tighten monetari polici   sinc then  the bund yield has declin about     basi point and is current just off it record low of      percent   the yield on the canadian bond  shown in the next column to the right  has declin near as much  at     basi point over the    month period   these develop contrast with the smaller net declin of    basi point in the unit kingdom  and the much smaller net declin of    basi point in the unit state  and    basi point in japan   the size of the declin may have been more limit in japan than in the other economi becaus of the proxim of the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate   as shown in the middl row of panel  most of the declin in foreign long term  yield appear to be relat to a slide in real interest rate   inflat compens  as measur by the spread between these nomin and inflat index interest

the final chart display your econom project for      and        as shown in the top panel  the central tendenc of your project for the growth of real gdp this year came down slight from the project in februari  while the central tendenc of the project rise in core pce price was revis up a bit   the central tendenc for the project unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of  this year is now a shade below that in februari   for       your central tendenc indic essenti no chang in real gdp growth from this year   s anticip pace  no chang in the core pce inflat rate  and no chang in the unemploy rate   if you should decid to updat your project  we request that you submit your revis forecast to dave   by the close of busi tomorrow   we would now be pleas to take ani question you may have
on chart four  suppos we took the lower left chart     job hard to fill     as be repres not onli of small busi  but liter of the economi as a whole   wouldn   t that  in fact  be the best measur we could possibl get to determin the slack in the system   wouldn   t that be measur it right at the point where it matter
i think there would be someth to be said for that   as i look at these indic  i see profil that look veri similar across the six panel  and so
do they ever diverg signific  as far as the signal they are give
well  our interpret has been that the labor forc particip rate  shown in the upper right panel  has been send a littl differ signal from the unemploy rate over the last year or so   that the particip rate   whose sourc we understand imperfect    declin suggest that there is a littl more product capac remain or more of   an underutil of labor resourc than one would infer from the upper left panel on the unemploy rate
on exhibit    in look at p c compens  it   s not onli  that it surg at the end of last year  which we attribut larg to bonus and the exercis of stock  option  but it has surg realli sinc the second quarter of        sinc that  e the quarter increas have been                 and     percent   how do we interpret that   do we basic  have the same stori for those data  or is someth els go on
as i look at the upper right panel  i see two indic that seem to be swing around each other   p c comp per hour had been a littl to the soft side of the eci for a  e and then it move a littl to the high side of that   i don   t have a particular stori for the chang in the profil from earlier
main it was the second and third quarter of last year that were signific abov expect and  inde  quit abov the eci   yet i don   t recal our attribut that to stock option exercis or anyth like that
i assum it   s not just benefit but wage and salari also
i think that   s correct
we didn   t think at the  e that we need much special explan becaus  as you can see in     s upper right hand panel  the four quarter chang in comp per hour was still below   percent and it onli edg a bit abov the eci   so  we didn   t realli see that as a  diverg   as   note  we went through a period from mid      through mid      where comp per hour was run below the eci   we were view the acceler that occur in the p c measur through the middl of last year as a seri be just a bit noisier and run a littl   abov the earlier pace   it was realli when we got to the fourth quarter and had that extraordinari  increas   which we do think reflect to some degre the stock option exercis and bonus   that  we thought that stori was an import one in explain the diverg
now we have the april and may data   rough  what do they tell us about the second quarter annual rate
well  in a sens  we   re carri two set of book   and this my i isn   t go to get unwound for quit some  e becaus it won   t be until august that the ui    unemploy insur  data are incorpor for the first quarter  and that will give us the begin of a read on whether we were right or not
so  essenti  the bea wage and salari data are mere  extrapol   inde  from an econom point of view  they don   t realli give us new evid  they are just extrapol the basic chang
our understand is that they   ve taken down a wedg   to run off some of that   but we think it   s go to come down a lot more in the final statist
yes  but that  sn   t tell us anyth   that just tell us what they are guess at
that   s exact right   i have here the quarter pattern that we have written down for comp per hour  and i   d be happi to give it to you   it   s a littl mislead becaus what we   ve done is assum that that runoff is go to happen over the cours of
you actual have answer my question   you won   t have ani real new data until august
that   s correct   that   s when the ui data will be incorpor for the first quarter
sticker shock question   in the histori of the world  has a countri ever run a    trillion current account deficit
i don   t think so    laughter
is that your question
yes   i didn   t say it was heavi    laughter
that   s call truli rhetor   presid hoenig
i may be ask your question over again  mr  chairman  but i   m look at  exhibit     at the pce project and the explan for whi core pce is increas   i guess  what you   re say is that these are the reason whi   then  go back to your discuss of labor cost  there   s no discuss of product   so  are you more or less dismiss that as a factor in  term of have a follow through and push up core pce   are you say that labor is not that signific a factor   the issu of product come down seem to me to be more relev than suggest here
you   re correct   in our analysi  these are the key driver  in term of the factor that are shape the contour of
not compens and not the possibl of product come down and be less abl to absorb that factor in the futur
no  that   s correct   in term of the factor contribut to the deceler in core pce price inflat between      and       what i   ve shown here   energi price  import  price  and these other relat price that i   ve chosen to proxi by the intermedi materi   price   are take off somewher between   and    percentag point from core pce inflat  in  our es    at the same  e  we think that some of the past increas that have occur have   gotten built into the structur of inflat a bit   whether one label that    inflat expect    or     inflat momentum     it is aw hard to disentangl   as for product  we think that it   s main structur product that matter for firm    price decis  not fluctuat in actual   quarter by quarter product   so we have that as essenti a neutral influenc on inflat over  the project period   the fact that we tie price decis to structur product develop rather than actual product may be what is collid with your intuit
part of what leav me uneasi is that in the  book the last sever   e we have recogn that pce inflat has been higher than we thought it would be and we  are project it to turn back down again   in this sens  there   s a continu of the view that these  thing are temporari and that they will back off at some point
this chart is tri to get at exact that sort of iter process of a futur market that  meet by meet  ratchet up it expect of oil price  as illustr in the upper right hand panel   and yet  meet by meet  the futur market   and we along with it   figur that oil price would level out from that point forward   some   for our inflat outlook  the absenc of a negat is a posit   in the sens that with oil price not move up further in our project  we don   t have that upward impetus
the way we handl the oil price is realli a technic assumpt
futur price of oil cannot move up at an except rapid pace and stay signific beyond the cost of storag and interest becaus there   s an arbitrag  there that will convert the forward demand back to the spot demand   so  if you have a run up in spot price  it   s almost never the case that the futur market will be at that same pace   so this type of environ would tend to bias those project down
i agre with that  but the profil of oil price is mark differ now  with an extraordinari skyrocket of the far date futur   one of the most amaz develop over the last
i   m realli surpris   i mention that in a speech recent    the spread between the six year futur price and the spot price has close   and no one has pick  that up   it   s unbeliev
it   s illustr in   leahi   s exhibit     on the chart in the middl left panel   there has been a mark chang in the relationship between near date and far date futur
i get quot on everyth under the sun that is irrelev  but  that was a realli meaning insight and it got lost    laughter   vice chair
let me just follow this convers a littl further   if i  get this right  what is new in the forecast  base on this convers today  is that you   re anticip a littl more persist in what we view as the under rate of the core pce deflat   and it end the forecast period higher than we previous expect   again  that is in the context of a forecast where you   re expect both oil and commod price   and import price  too  i think   not to be a sourc of negat pressur   they constitut a sort of posit factor on the inflat dynam   and you   re expect structur product growth to stay fair high   what is interest  i think  is that you haven   t chang your impli path for the fed fund rate signific   i guess my question is  whi is that   it   s not that your growth forecast has come down and is signific softer   it   s not as if you   re substanti more pessimist on the outlook for growth relat to potenti   so whi wouldn   t that view on inflat  if it   s right  have induc  you to prescrib a slight higher path
in part i   d answer that question by say that i don   t view our fund  rate path as a prescript   we are not tri to convey to you what you should do   in our think about this  we were confront with a coupl of crosscurr in the forecast this  e around that  led us just to leav the fund rate path unchang   one was that we got higher inflat and higher  inflat forecast  which might have been push us up   on the other hand  much of that was a suppli shock kind of effect where we were get higher oil price and a stronger dollar  and those factor would have been weaken gdp had we rais the fund rate   so  that confront you as  policymak with the choic   it   s not that we think you ought to pick the fund rate path we wrote down as the baselin forecast   it   s a case in which you   re confront with a shock  and that has made the tradeoff less favor for you  and you   re go to have to think about how much of that you would want to take in lower output and how much in higher inflat   so  you   re right  we could have rais the fund rate path   we show an altern   simul in which you tighten a bit more aggress and that bring the inflat rate down to    percentag point at the cost of someth on the order of   percent gdp growth go forward  that   s about all i   d have to say on that
if i understood the bluebook discuss of this correct   in that op  control exercis  whatev it merit  with your assumpt about the symmetr toler or intoler to deviat from your object  still you have the nomin fund rate  go to   percent with an inflat object assumpt of     percent in that context   and the differ between that view and the view that you put into the  book  which i realiz is not a   prescript   i   m sorri i use that term   is what explain the differ between those two thing
i think part of the purpos of put that in the bluebook was to suggest that if you in fact view your object as     percent on core pce inflat and you want to   react in the way that op  path suggest  you would need to be tighter than in the baselin  assumpt in the  book   those differ are pretti small becaus while i don   t follow that path precis  i use that as some guidanc in think about where to set the fund rate path for the    book   our goal is to put a forecast on the tabl that would be help to you in your discuss
but are you assum a higher implicit inflat  object in the way you think about the  book construct
you could view that either as a higher inflat object or  as i   m  assum  more patient monetari policymak   a case in which you achiev that object over a longer period of  e
i want to ask a differ question on the intern  side      on the extern forecast  how much of a chang is this view of where the current account gdp ratio goe relat to your expect six month ago or thereabout   it seem to me that it look slight darker
i think it   s the dollar
yes  that   s my point   where do you expect it to stabil  now
no   what happen to the current account if you project out a littl longer than the forecast horizon you have now
sticker shock  sticker shock  and more sticker shock
i know  but it cross   percent and goe to what    path
it depend on how far into the futur you want to go   it   s an unsustain
absent a dollar depreci that   s now probabl on the order of       or    percent  the deficit is go to steadili worsen   if the dollar were to start depreci  that would slow the rate of deterior   if the dollar depreci that we put into the forecast were to get as high as   or   percent  that might plateau the deficit
one thing we can be sure of is that the valu of the dollar will be worth     cent    laughter     do you contempl that the end of month nipa revis could alter the intermedi histori  which could have an effect on the forecast
at this point  obvious  what we don   t know dwarf by sever order of magnitud what we do know   we do know from the annual survey of manufactur that the  m  data probabl overst the growth rate of capit spend in        that could be a sourc of downward revis   and the annual retail sale revis also point to a littl softer path for  consum spend   i wouldn   t want to make a big deal out of those thing  simpli becaus there   s so much els that we will learn that could complet offset them   but if we had to guess now  we   d expect the chang to be in the direct of a small downward revis on the level of gdp
gross domest incom has start to run well ahead of gross  domest product   is that someth that is like to be exagger or amelior   do you have ani notion of that at all
if i had to guess  i   d say amelior in the sens that in the last coupl  of quarter when that gap has gotten quit larg  it was be driven by the veri rapid gain in compens per hour   now  anoth reason for us to think that these increas are probabl   reflect of someth like stock option is that if you want to measur output from the incom  side  what the incom side would be say is that there must have been an explos of growth in   output over the fourth and first quarter   we just don   t see that confirm by other evid either  in physic product data from industri product or labor market develop   we see noth  that would suggest that that in fact occur  we   re expect that the bea is still not go to know anyth for probabl anoth coupl of year in term of get incom data that would actual allow them to pin this down  but our expect is that there probabl would be some downward revis to corpor profit in       to reflect the fact that some of that involv stock option exercis that have not yet been pick up in corpor report  mr    even there  though  the  e within the year is veri uncertain   we don   t know how they pars it out across the quarter and whether it would line up tight with the stock option stori
i want to take up the issu of oil sticker shock and particular the distant  futur price   the revis over the past    month or two year have realli been extraordinari    essenti a doubl in the long term price of oil   my impress is that the market revis have been driven probabl by upward revis of the impact on oil demand associ with long term growth in china  and perhap india as well  and also question about product capac in the middl east   some of the reserv number have been revis down  and that sort of thing   but i  haven   t seen much discuss about the long run demand elast   you   d think that with this big a price chang that would be an issu   and also elast of altern suppli of which i suppos the most import over a horizon of five year would not be nuclear but coal  the latter has   possibl of signific expans   what do we know about the longer run demand elast that might start to come into play over the next few year and that might check this upward momentum in the long run price of oil
i think we   re see attempt now in some part of the middl east  such as saudi arabia  to tri to expand capac for oil   as for these altern sourc  i don   t know if we   ve reach the trigger point yet where expand their product has becom profit
i understand that with altern like shale and that kind of thing   but how about the more convent altern  which i guess would be coal  by and larg   there must be expans opportun there  it   s import for generat electr
i   m not sure
to the extent that china   s electr system is a sourc of demand  china has a lot of coal reserv  wherea they have no petroleum reserv   so in principl they could expand their electr capac   which is obvious a big part of the infrastructur effort that   s go to be necessari for china to keep grow   by use coal   most of the thought about the long run pictur in this regard relat to the uncertainti  impos by environment consider   whether it   s refin capac  expand use of coal for the generat of electr  more use of lng  liquefi natur gas  to spread the natur gas resourc of the world in way more in tune with demand for natur gas  and so forth   all of these thing pose fair substanti environment hazard or have shortcom  and they get tie up in the polit of it   now  we   re fair convinc that in the long run these elast are power  but the peopl who trade on these forward curv know at least as much as we do  and they probabl know a whole lot more than we do   so we   re implicit say that we think this is built into that forward curv    like
what about on the demand side   what do those longer run elast look
one issu is the fact that some of these countri subsid   that is  the price run up to date has been pass through onli partial to consum demand in mani of the  emerg asia countri   and as a consequ  some of these govern have had a big hit to  their budget deficit becaus of these subsidi   now  if you think about      versus       the run up in oil price last year prove to be a  transitori phenomenon  and i think they believ that that polici work well   they buffer their popul a bit  and they didn   t take the polit heat about higher oil price   and they were right  the oil price came down and all was well   they tri it again this year  and they are now  confront these high futur price that   was emphas   so some of them are now   relent and are propos to pass through into consum price  over some stagger path  the price increas that we   ve seen   i would assum that will have a measur effect
what would the demand elast be in the unit state   we pass those through pretti quick
i can   t give you an actual number  but i   m sure in the longer run it   s minus   or someth like that   peopl will say that in the short run it   s almost zero   i think even that is an exagger   you can alway turn down the heat  or whatev   but i think you   d get a  reason number like minus   if you look over a five year period
you think it   s even as big as minus     over the horizon here  these long  term futur   that   s six year out   you   d probabl get a good part of that over a six year horizon  if it   s view as a perman
we know from past histori that the oil intens of gdp step down in the period immedi follow the oil price shock event  but it did not continu to improv continu   that chart is veri much like a step function  most of the gain occur earli on  when we first experienc the signific chang in relat oil price   we also know that there   s a lot of differ across countri in oil intens   some peopl conclud that that mean we can all be as effici as the most effici countri  so there   s a lot of room to improv   that   s a littl naiv becaus some of those differ reflect industri structur and the like   somebodi has to produc the aluminum  right   we can   t all save money   save oil and energi   by not produc aluminum   so  some of those differ are more perman   but some of them involv just a failur to take the step that other have taken   there   s scope there  too   i think there   s no better solut to this problem than to let price show through
i   ll continu to plow that ground just for one minut   i   m struck a bit by the fact that the stori on the run up in commod price and oil price are all about china and india   you have a forecast here where china   s growth fall off fair dramat   growth in the   rest of the world i would describ as mayb more of a downsid risk   you point out the uncertainti  in europ and japan and you   ve even mark down econom growth in the unit state   yet your commod price tend to be rather flat   all this run up was associ with china  india  and global growth   you have global growth dampen  but we don   t seem to recov much in the way of these commod price   oil be one  but other in general   i   m obvious miss someth  what is it
in part it is the suppli respons in some of the metal and presum in food and other
you   ve told me in the past that the suppli respons in copper tend to  take a year or two   the price has not been high enough necessarili  but one would have thought we   d start to see some suppli respons  get these price to come down even more quick
these forecast are base on the futur quot   there may be some  differ in view between our forecast for china compar with what the futur market are think   they might be a bit more upbeat about the outlook for china   but we do have a littl downward tilt here  and i think it   s consist with some slow in china
yes   and rememb  what we   ve done is just deceler foreign activ  and we   ve huge deceler commod price
i think that   s a fair point
thank you  mr  chairman      i want to ask some question about your exhibit   and    have to do with the high yield debt market   if i put togeth the middl left panel   of exhibit   and the middl right panel of exhibit    i begin to get worri about whether the market is price for risk appropri   the upper left chart on exhibit   show that default jump in the           period   from your chart  it look like those bond were issu in      and       and it appear that that was the last  e spread were so skinni   we   re back to skinni spread now  we   ve got anoth bump up in issuanc   and i know bank are eas credit standard   is the  market be too sanguin about the inher risk in these   if there   s someth like a three year cycl  should we expect to see in      anoth jump in high yield default
earlier this year  we were realli concern that the market was underpr risk   if you look at the panel you refer to at the middl left of exhibit    when the gap narrow  to it narrowest point there  we realli did not understand what had caus that   our view is that   default are go to rise somewhat   you can see our forecast in the black line in the middl left panel of exhibit     that   s our es  of the compens for both default and loss due to less than full recoveri that would be need in the current environ   we have that drift up  some  we don   t have it rise dramat   in our view what is differ now from  say  the late      s is that a tremend amount of balanc sheet restructur has occur   that has left even high yield issuer  on net  in a better posit with regard to their interest servic capabl and their cash on hand than they were in that earlier period   we see them start from a veri healthi posit after a tremend amount of restructur and turmoil in that sector   we think it   s downhil from here  but not steepli downhil in our judgment   so  we   re take a middl of the  road view in expect thing to worsen but not dramat over the forecast period
mr  chairman  could i just correct someth that i said earlier   on the revis to gdp  we have receiv data that we think will ul  result in a downward revis to e s spend  but it   s not clear that they actual are go to get incorpor in the annual revis that come out this year   evid the census schedul current call for their revis  data to be given to the bea after the annual revis  so they won   t be pick up   that   s the biggest of the compon of the data that we   ve gotten toward revis gdp
i think i   m go to cede my  e  mr  chairman
i found the exhibit   discuss on the evolut of the  book forecast interest and inform   there   s one thing that i   m still a bit puzzl by as we look forward from here   the forecast has a gradual deceler of price increas between this year and   next   at least some of that is a deceler associ with import price   i guess the question i  have for you is  how confid are we that import price deceler will give us the kind of inflat moder that is in the forecast
is the question about the import price or about go from import price to the inflat measur
the import price
well  our forecast  obvious  is for import price to deceler   that   s base on forecast that the dollar will flatten out  rough  or declin onli moder go forward  and  that commod price will also be relat flat   so  to the extent you put a lot of confid into those forecast  i think you could transfer that to our outlook for import price   that   s how we do the forecast
okay   let me put it more point   do you put much trust in those  i can do the arithmet  but do we believ it
i think forecast asset price has a high standard error around it  it   s not a veri precis art
this is realli an extens of the first point that presid    made   that the context in which we   re make these polici decis is a framework base on a  forecast of inflat   to the extent that we   re get this   i   ll call it exogen   declin in the inflat pressur associ with import  that say someth about the op  strategi from a monetari polici point of view   on the other hand  to the extent that that   s an assumpt in which  we have littl confid  the implic is that we may find ourselv back at exhibit   again   we would be ratchet up our expect of inflat becaus what was suppos to reduc it     name  the reduct in inflat of import price   didn   t materi
but the risk that you are point to  presid santomero  is illustr in the middl right panel   that show the step up from the trajectori in the decemb       book  the dot blue line  to the decemb       book  the dot red line    now  as it  happen  the revis to the outlook sinc decemb      is a littl to the favor side in term of  u s  inflat perform  as shown by the downshift from the dot red line to the dash black line   so there is risk   i think     s point is that we think we have the risk reason balanc  the risk are two side   so we could be come back to you with an exhibit   that would have a figur in the lower left that was revis down or revis up from the     of a percentag point   it   s not a one way risk  that   s the point
the dollar could well continu up   much of this more favor outlook owe to the fact that the dollar  on balanc  has risen rather signific over the cours of       and inde it has risen rather signific over the past six week   in look at the global economi and listen to the chatter out there  i think there   s no reason that one could ever say with confid over a horizon of one year   or even two or three year   that we know the dollar will be   lower at that futur point than it is today   we don   t know that   we know that probabl a lot of thing that are consequ of the dollar continu to rise will lead to some buildup of pressur  to eventu stop that rise   but over the kind of horizon we deal with in the  book  we have learn the hard way that the random walk is the best attitud to have
i just have a quick question  go back to the oil issu   there are some          outstand futur contract on the nymex   if you look at the cftc  commod futur trade commiss  data     percent of those are noncommerci player   what they call wall street and citi refin   to the extent that the staff measur that as an influenc  i   m curious   as to what percentag of the spot price or of futur price do you consid to be weight by the nonfinanci player   are they a drive forc or are they inconsequenti
well  we   ve certain been hear a lot about so call specul player  in the market   with respect to oil market  inventori actual have been trend up a bit even as price are go up   so  there   s some kind of specul activ go on current  it would appear   but as for pars out exact how much reflect the trader on the exchang  i don   t know
we do  obvious  have the data week on the net posit of noncommerci parti   and they are effect a claim against the inventori  which by  definit are held onli by commerci parti   my recollect is  howev  that the inform has not been terribl use in project price   there  sn   t seem to be a systemat compon  in the crude price pattern that is mirror in those data   i think these are larg hedg fund and the  like  and they basic follow trend   even though they   re not all that small in term of the contribut to the overal demand and suppli contract  it   s hard to use them as you indic  we   ve tri
i was just curious about whether we know or feel that they can exacerb trend in a direct
yes  they probabl do   but the explanatori part of the price move owe to that particular set of data is less than signific   or at least we haven   t been abl to infer ani signific
thank you  mr  chairman
who would like to start the committe discuss  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in recent week we   ve heard a wide varieti of view about busi condit in the seventh district   most sector have good news as well as some bad news but  overal  condit are posit and seem consist with an economi grow near trend   evid  accommod polici is offset the drag from energi and the intern sector  within manufactur  heavi equip produc continu to report strong sale growth  for exampl  all    of caterpillar   s busi unit are abov plan   this year some of their product line have sold out for       and they have begun take order for        in contrast  one of our director who is the ceo of a larg diversifi manufactur compani report a surpris sharp slowdown in order  although he conced that busi had been grow at an unsustain high rate   the chicago purchas manag    index  which will be releas today  edg down from      in may to      in june  in retail  apparel sale are general strong and mall traffic seem good  but a retail in  home furnish report a mark slowdown in sale dure the past six to eight week   in motor  vehicl  gm note strong sale in respons to it new market program   gm and ford both continu to forecast light vehicl sale of about      million unit in        the consensus forecast  from our recent auto outlook symposium had similar number for        and they expect sale to remain near this pace in       labor market continu to improv   temporari help firm report that growth is moder  not spectacular   they say demand is soft for low skill worker  but it is stronger for profession    technic  and cleric worker   and averag temp wage and benefit increas have held steadi in recent week    the news on the price front is similar to what we   ve seen in the last few meet  with increas for plastic  rubber  and heavi machineri   and  of cours  energi   integr steel  produc are burden by high coke and iron ore price   in contrast  steel scrap price have fallen    percent from their peak in novemb of last year  which reduc the cost for the mini mill  turn to the nation outlook  sinc our last meet we   ve learn that the soft patch was  temporari  as mani of us expect   furthermor  the core inflat number improv but energi price move up even further  as we   ve just been discuss   look forward  our outlook is veri similar to the forecast in the  book  with growth  slow in the current quarter but pick up somewhat in the second half of the year   on balanc  we project that gdp will increas at a rate near     percent both this year and next   the stori under this forecast is a familiar one   accommod monetari polici and the trend in under product appear suffici to offset the current drag from higher energi price   on the inflat front  we don   t see broad base resourc constraint push up price   the  pass through of cost pressur to consum price has been modest   in fact  mr  chairman  after you left our board meet two week ago  my director gave me a hard  e regard the suggest that busi had ani price power at all   in addit  inflat expect remain  contain  even with the most recent increas in energi price   so we see core pce price inflat peak at   percent this year and edg off a touch next year   of cours  we should not be too sanguin   it would be unfortun if under core  inflat drift abov   percent  and there is some risk of that happen   resourc slack has  narrow  as dave   point out earlier   and given our uncertainti as to the true level of potenti output  we may alreadi have close most meaning resourc gap   with oil price   reach     a barrel  we have to be veri care that inflat expect do not increas   this   could happen if we are perceiv to be improp monet the higher oil price   therefor  it  will be import for us to continu to remov polici accommod in order to contain inflationari pressur and inflationari expect   so at this meet  we should increas rate by    basi point   for the remaind of       we may need to increas rate more than current expect by the futur market   i agre with the view express by some peopl dure the chart show  risk manag suggest that a path with higher interest rate would be a better cours for our polici than the one outlin in the futur  market   and given the risk to the inflat outlook  a flat feder fund rate of    percent  throughout       as the market expect  is simpli too low
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district soften somewhat in late spring  but this appear to be temporari and our busi contact continu to expect gain in line with recent trend   retail sale fell in may   for mani area retail   this was attribut to cold and raini weather in the earli spring  and earli report in june suggest that sale have pick up with the return of warm weather   the outlook for auto sale  howev   remain subdu   earlier in the year  dealer had been op ist that auto sale would improv  now they expect fewer sale this year than last  manufactur activ in the district also weaken in june   after show a sizabl rebound in april  the index of general activ weaken in may and turn negat   with a read of minus       in june  which is consist with flat manufactur activ   the index on new order and shipment remain in posit territori  and our respond did not expect this lull to last   they general expect activ in employ to pick up over the next six month    as part of the board staff   s survey  we poll the district   s busi contact  includ those in manufactur  retail  and servic  on their plan for capit spend over the next   to    month   about half of our firm report that they plan to maintain capit spend at  current level   plan for increas spend were more preval among nonmanufactur than manufactur  while plan reduct were scatter across both type of firm   activ in other sector of the region continu to expand in the intermeet period   the  downward trend in nonresidenti construct appear to have bottom out  and commerci real  estat leas activ has been rise   there have been six consecut quarter of posit absorpt   the pace of home sale has risen sinc the winter and was about steadi dure may  at a veri strong pace   hous price appreci continu to be strong  region employ continu to grow  although not as strong as in the first quarter  employ rose in each of our three state for the first two month of the second quarter   the three state unemploy rate declin from     percent in the first quarter to     percent in april and may   busi contact continu to report that it is difficult to find employe to fill open  one of our contact say the labor shortag in southern new jersey has reach crisi proport  one pharmaceut firm in the district is bring in worker from it plant in seattl  while a larg energi compani in our district is tri to attract skill labor from as far away as alabama   other compani report that it   s take much longer to hire peopl than was true a year ago   price pressur in the district continu to build but at a slower pace than earlier this year  the current and futur price index in our manufactur survey moder in june  but remain  at relat high level   a special manufactur survey question in may reveal that near half of our particip had rais price of their product line sinc the begin of the year  and about     percent said they expect further increas this year   retail report that  while wholesal price   of the good they are purchas have been rough steadi  fuel surcharg are common on good ship to them  in summari  econom condit in the third district soften a bit in the late spring  but indic suggest that this is temporari   region busi contact remain upbeat and general expect an improv in the region   s economi in the month ahead  my assess of the econom condit in the nation is similar to what it was last month   the expans continu with the fit and start one expect to see as the economi approach a  sustain growth rate and full employ   the revis data suggest that there was not much  if  ani  soft spot in the first quarter   while some of the recent month data have been on the soft side   for exampl  may employ growth and retail sale   these follow month where the data were on the high side   payrol employ has averag         per month this year  consist with our forecast   although the second quarter is like to be softer than the first quarter  averag through the month volatil show an economi that is grow near it potenti and is close to full employ  higher oil price will like have some dampen effect on econom activ and put some upward pressur on inflat  but the effect need not be strong enough to divert the expans   the economi has prove quit resili as the price of oil increas from     a barrel at the begin of      to over     a barrel more recent   i   d like to compliment the board and reserv bank staff on the hous price discuss   i found myself somewhat comfort by the analysi show rather benign effect  at least at a  macroeconom level  from the potenti drop in real estat valu   and i also want to  compliment the staff on the analysi of the behavior of long term interest rate   it was use to   review the various potenti explan for the declin in long rate as short rate have risen and to  think about their differ implic for monetari polici  that said  i find the argument that lower long rate might be signal a persist econom slowdown unconvinc   none of the forecast we poll is predict such a scenario    for exampl  our most recent survey of profession forecast suggest sustain output growth over it forecast period   i find the explan that focus on an increas in demand for long term  debt relat to suppli more interest   but as the staff point out  the reason for the outsiz demand would be relev  as would inform concern it expect persist   the   implic for monetari polici would presum depend on the sourc of the demand and it  perceiv persist  put the piec togeth  our forecast is similar to that in the  book   we both see the  economi expand at near potenti and close in on full employ   the major differ is  that the  book project a declin in core inflat between this year and next  while we are project a rise in core inflat  henc  my question earlier   we think there is less slack in the  labor market  so we expect growth in hour compens to run abov product gain and to acceler modest in       lead to a modest rise in unit labor cost   this rise in unit labor cost  translat into a slowli increas core inflat rate   we also anticip some depreci of the  dollar  which will caus a modest rise in import price  and we anticip some pass through from the energi price increas into core inflat   i believ inflat will remain well contain over the period  provid we remain focus on our goal of price stabil   consist with all of that  our forecast incorpor a steeper path for the fed fund rate than    the  book   given my assess of econom condit and the forecast  i believ it   s prudent to take anoth measur step in remov polici accommod   as we discuss at our   last meet  it seem like that we will continu to rais rate until we actual come to what we perceiv to be the end   given the under strength of the economi  the potenti for increas inflat  and the fact that polici remain accommod  i do not think we   re at the end of the tighten cycl   regard the languag  i   ll leav the specif to the polici discuss   but our discuss last month persuad me that we have suffici flexibl with the current languag and that the  e to make signific chang may be when we paus and feel uncertain about the futur  direct of polici or when we think a signific chang in polici is requir   thank you  mr   chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   anecdot report from our region contact  and the most recent data releas suggest that busi condit in the southeast have remain  posit sinc our last meet   florida  as has been the case for some  e  has been domin in term of both employ growth and the pace of econom activ  given the strength in sector such as tourism and hous   coincid indic  like person incom and state tax revenu  suggest that our  district   s growth over the past sever month has averag about   percent  with major  contribut come not onli from florida but also from alabama and  to a lesser extent  georgia and mississippi  district employ growth has been averag rough        per month until the   disappoint report of onli       new job in may   our region unemploy rate has been run about     percentag point below the nation averag   howev  absent florida  the rest of the district underperform the nation as a whole    the appar slow in employ growth was a concern in term of the region outlook  although i would say that recent anecdot report on hire are more encourag than the offici   data   it seem to me that the key question from a polici perspect is whether there are sign of  region imbal on either the price or the real side that might shed light on the nation pictur  and on the broader risk to either growth or inflat   with respect to growth  the capit spend survey suggest that plan invest  spend in our district remain solid   and the motiv for this are now more root in the  expect of increas sale rather than the need to cut cost  improv product  or to replac obsolet technolog   have said that  let me note that we receiv some interest and sober anecdot comment from our director   one director from the paper pulp and forest industri  express concern  perhap selfish concern  about the overexpans for certain manufactur  build suppli   he indic  for exampl  that product capac for build product such as gypsum wall board  concret  and manufactur lumber was on a pace to expand    to    percent  worldwid over the next three year   in the specif case of one product that is dear to his heart   orient strand board  he said that the increas look more like    percent   he character the industri   s veri aggress invest spend plan as prepar to  and i quot     jump off the cliff yet again      laughter  our report indic that invest spend has also increas in the air cargo freight area    driven by intern demand   our banker tell us that commerci and industri lend remain high competit  with a result narrow of spread  although credit qualiti continu to be good   our director from the forest product sector note a continu soften in paper box demand  which he has found to track nondur veri close    final  there is the hous situat  which we talk about for a long  e ye day afternoon   as i   ve been report for sever meet  some of our market  especi those in  coastal area of south florida and the florida panhandl  are experienc a level of build activ and price increas that are clear  in my view  unsustain   near everi major florida citi now has experienc increas in the doubl digit rang  and some  like miami  palm beach   sarasota  and west palm  have been report increas in hous price on a year over year basi  of between    and    percent   while our discuss ye day did not seem to indic a consensus on a nation hous bubbl  base on past experi i   m reason comfort character  the hous feed frenzi in some of our market as be a bubbl or a near bubbl  for exampl  the number of major project plan or under construct in miami now  total      most of which are high rise develop   that includ        condo unit   eight  e the number that were built in the last decad   and a total of         new park space   i  know we don   t have ani process for introduc exhibit into the record  but i   d like to pass dave    this pictori of the new project in miami  so that he can continu to worri a littl bit along with me   laughter  my supervis and regul staff think this is an accid wait to happen in our area  and while the local market excess probabl do not repres system nation risk  the shakeout could have serious region consequ   my bank supervis staff point out that hous relat credit risk to our bank lender are not so much from default on perman mortgag financ that we talk about ye day  but rather from lend for land acquisit  develop  and construct  the ugli pictur we have seen befor   and that they think we may veri like see again  befor long   goe someth like this  the dri up of sale of new unit  the pain decis of   develop to go ahead and complet the construct of addit unit to make them saleabl  further depress the market  and specul who had hope to see big capit gain walk away or default on their contract  give their properti back to the lender   perhap it   s becaus of where i sit  but i am less comfort than some of my colleagu about the hous situat   as for the nation economi  my view is that real gdp growth is most like to remain on  it recent path  averag around     percent  which we judg to be veri close to trend   consum  spend seem to continu to be rough in line with gdp growth  confid has rebound  invest spend is still support  and manufactur has seem a bit brighter in recent data report   i would character employ growth as better than the    improv gradual     languag would suggest  and i think it should be suffici to at least keep the unemploy rate around current level or perhap nudg it even lower  i am less sure about the prospect for under inflat   but given the amount of polici accommod that remain in place  and that will remain in place even if we rais our target rate anoth    basi point today  i believ the inflat risk are now on the upsid   while the most recent month inflat number dip a bit  the overal path for the last year has clear been up  and the  book forecast and other forecast of inflat have been rais for the remaind of this year and into next year   until further evid is avail  there is the risk of put too much weight on the high frequenc number  such as the may ppi and cpi releas  and lose sight of the longer run inflat path  even more import than this  howev  is the presenc of the longer term imbal that    we   ve talk about  which increas the risk to the economi   most of these are larg beyond our  control   i have in mind here not onli the fiscal deficit and the trade situat  but also the continu   troubl in our domest auto industri and  of cours  problem in the airlin industri   both of these latter problem area may have undesir spillov effect to financi market   it also look as if higher energi price are here for a while  and this is reflect in futur price   higher energi cost will clear squeez energi depend busi first  but i think we   ll   also have uncertain t l down effect that can   t be good for other industri  i   ve alreadi express my concern about the unstabl path of hous in at least some  import local market   i believ that the least riski polici strategi through these unusu  e is  to set monetari polici so that it   not contribut to unsustain activ   therefor  i believ that continu on our recent polici path for the next few meet would be the best cours of action   thank you  mr  chairman
let   s take a break for coffe   but owe to what must have  been a record question period after the chart show  we   re run a littl behind schedul  so let   s return quick
presid hoenig   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  our view regard the nation economi is basic similar to other i have heard here   we agre with the consensus of gdp growth run about     percent  slight over our potenti rate   and we see that go forward  through the rest of this year and into next year  i also would say that the anecdot evid come from our region is veri consist with this abov trend growth rate   consum spend continu to grow solid  with retail report that sale were general abov plan and higher than a year ago through the first and second   quarter   tourism continu to expand brisk  boost occup rate at hotel and resort in our region   and energi activ remain high  one of the interest anecdot aros dure a recent visit i made to the cessna plant in wichita  which is boom right now   they have back order for their jet   general aviat aircraft   run well into       with price run from a mere      million to a littl better than     million for their citat     which fli at     mach   and the demand is incred   so the general econom environ reflect in these part of our region realli is consist with a strong growth rate go forward  on the nation inflat outlook  i understand the argument given today for whi inflat   should continu to eas off   for that to occur  it is critic in my view that we continu to move  polici out of it current accommod stanc   if we don   t  i think we are s ul demand   i   think it   s reflect in some of the other comment here and in some of the anecdot that i   ve point out   and i think we will have futur upward adjust in inflat as we move forward  so i think it is critic that we get ourselv closer to that neutral zone that we talk about  which no one can pinpoint with certainti but which is probabl somewher between     and     percent   i   ll leav it at that
thank you  mr  chairman   new england continu to expand but probabl more slowli than the nation   at our last meet  i spoke of a coupl of bump along the road to a stronger region economi   those bump remain   in particular  rise concern about slow job growth  rapid grow input cost  the strength of demand  and the avail of skill labor    moreov  with the base realign and closur  brac  propos by the pentagon now   public  there are clear challeng to be face in both connecticut and main  which togeth bear  about half of the relat job loss for the whole nation   while there will be extens effort in washington by new england legisl to modifi the brac result through the work of the  brac commiss  judg by the outcom of the last four round of base closur  littl will chang   this will be particular difficult for main  with it smaller and less differenti economi   and i expect the news of the mbna bank of america merger won   t go over well in  main either   so it   s not hard to see whi the general tone in new england seem a bit on the soft side  employ in our district is grow but at a slower pace in may than in the three previous month   unemploy has edg up  and most other indic of econom health show  onli modest growth   inde  busi confid has trend down sharpli  and commerci real estat market remain sluggish across the region   region manufactur   those contact for the beig book  those who sit on our new  england advisori council  or those who particip in our econom forum   are for the most part experienc rise demand and volum growth   but they view increas in cost as a particular  impedi   they see the cost of raw materi of all sort  includ energi and transport  as  problem   and they believ pass on such cost is difficult  except when they have uniqu or  technolog advanc product   mani talk about margin pressur and  as compar to the  last sever meet  fewer talk about price power   perhap this is becaus energi surcharg alreadi have been implement and accept but other price chang are prove more difficult  health care cost are a concern as well   and the rise cost   or unavail of   necessari skill labor are issu    to end the region discuss on a littl more posit note  there are industri that are clear do well   as a generic categori  the leisur and hospit industri is grow   tourism is solid and hotel margin are good   retail are more op ist as well  though the wet weather in  may dampen sale  laughter  and caus inventori level to rise   mani softwar compani are face good demand for their product  and busi servic firm say that job market are tighten  especi for technolog worker  and i   d have to say that in my    year of read the note on beig book discuss  i   ve never seen a descript of the busi outlook quit like the one i read in our recent note  which  was  i quot     crazi  bust at the seam      that was the case for one veri larg region produc  of aircraft integr system   for this compani  demand from the airlin for retrofit and for fuel manag and diagnost system has taken off  liter    laughter   so  not everyth is grow slowli in new england  turn to the nation scene  there is clear evid that the econom soften we note at the last meet has revers cours  at least partial   the so call soft patch in the first quarter  is in the process of be revis away with the chang to net export and inventori level   and  while the second quarter will suffer some from the unwind of auto inventori  there   seem to be a solid pattern of under growth  look further ahead  there is veri littl differ between our forecast in boston and that  in the  book   through late       and into        we continu to see an evolv handoff from polici s ul  consum led growth to a solid pace of under demand led by increas busi spend that is be driven by relat sound fundament   incom data  while  bumpi  continu to suggest that this evolut will occur    we  like the  book  see four quarter growth rate in both      and      in the mid three  unemploy close to the staff   s es  of full employ  and both core cpi and core pce edg downward   this isn   t terribl differ from our outlook at the previous meet   but  while some aspect of the earlier soft patch have gone away  new or perhap more sharpli drawn risk have emerg   in particular  oil price continu to surpris on the upsid   this could both  dampen growth and contribut more to inflat than we current expect   the baselin forecast see inflat moder over the next year and a half  but that assum that oil price flatten and don   t continu their upward climb  by the end of the forecast period  some slack remain  but there are risk on the upsid that  resourc pressur could occur sooner   inde  some compens measur may be hint at  this  and slow product could also contribut   risk exist on the downsid as well  in particular that the drag of higher energi price will slow worldwid growth even further  work to creat greater slack here in the unit state  the other major area of risk  as i see it  involv a wide array of asset and financi  variabl   we   ve discuss whether there is a hous bubbl or just symptom of froth in some market   while much of the rise in hous price can be explain by rise incom and  demograph  low interest rate clear have been a contribut factor   they have also contribut  to what most market practition view as a sens of reach for risk in market and to relat narrow credit spread   the complic of some of the newer  more intric  and untest credit  default instrument caus a bit of market turmoil recent   this was far from a system event  but it   i think illustr the fact that nasti surpris can occur when market overdo  i found the paper prepar by   and his colleagu on the conundrum of low    year    treasuri yield veri interest and veri help   i happen to fall into the camp of those who put   more credenc in the low    year yield as a signal of increas financi eas rather than potenti  econom weak   but the case for both interpret i thought was well made  for both these major risk   rise oil price and excess in asset and financi market    there are possibl downsid effect on growth and upsid effect on inflat and market volatil  so how should polici react   or  more point  when should we paus from our    measur pace    to assess where thing are  given the  book forecast and reason assumpt about remain slack  one could look at the downsid risk and say that a paus should occur sooner rather than later   but one could   also look at the upsid risk and decid a paus should come at a later point   frank  i think the latter cours is less cost   that is  if we err on the side of tighter polici  eas can be done quick if it   s necessari   and at littl relat cost   higher rate  if approach sensibl and cautious  will  help to wring out of the system some excess and protect against unexpect surg in inflat   if we stay too accommod for too long  then the price of correct in term of econom growth may well be higher  but  realli  paus is not the question for today   i think our best cours of action should be to repeat what we   ve done over the last sever meet and move the fund rate up   i know we   ll  have more to say later about the languag in the statement  but for now let me emphas onc again  that i think say what we did and whi we did it should be enough   i know there will be no desir to chang the statement in ani fundament way until we take a paus or decid to move fa    that may be wise  and it has work pretti well so far   but i continu to believ that there is a risk in continu to impli that we know more than we do about what the futur cours of polici will need to be
first  let me say that i   ll eschew ani and all sport analog in my present and give it to you more or less straight up  the odditi about our district is that we have almost no bank but we have enorm  produc for the economi   for exampl   and i   m prefac my remark this way for a purpos     togeth with the maquiladora in mexico we have two million manufactur worker   we have two of the largest airlin compani   we have some of the largest railroad   we have dell  texa  instrument  ed  and so on   and i have assidu been call around and talk to the ceo of those compani in order to get a feel not onli about develop in our district but also in the   nation economi   and this is my report to you  first of all  mr  chairman  our district lag the nation in recoveri and realli didn   t come out of the recess until        we are now grow on pace with the nation economi  at a rate of around     percent plus   that   s the good news   on the price front  obvious  there have been increas in the price of oil   and we do have   some major oil compani and oil produc   but other than in oil  oil field worker    wage  price of ranch land that may have miner right  and in health care  we see no evid of the price pressur and price power that we   ve talk about befor   i   ve taken some liberti  and with my colleagu   s permiss i   ve talk to a neighbor to the north who is an offic of the nation   s largest retail   wal mart   the coo  whom i use to   advis in my previous capac  and i had a convers two day ago and i was struck by his  statement that    we   ve been surpris at the lack of inflat across the store      it   s a rather larg store  i might add   he indic that the dynam of the world economi are exert downward price pressur  still to this day   deflat price in electron  cloth  and almost all retail sector   there is one except  which is a     percent price increas in diaper   but other than that    my contact note that they were have troubl make ani price move other than in a flat to down direct  this was confirm by the ceo of penney   s   it   s a differ price point   they have about a     percent overlap with wal mart   but in household furnish and apparel   again  there are concern driven by chines product level   they are tri to make up in volum for what they  see as continu downward pressur on price   this is despit the exist of quota in certain area   and  in fact  my contact point out that they are forecast that such pressur will continu for sever year to come  in term of residenti construct  as i mention ye day  i talk to someon at one of the nation   s largest homebuild   a builder of        home who has about    billion a year in revenu   interest  with construct cost   the cost of materi  plumb  furnish  and fixtur   there is continu price deflat   again  that is base on import come into the unit state   the two area where they do see constant price   cement and lumber   mr  chairman  are larg due to trade restrict  lumber sale from canada and cement sale from mexico are be restrict by trade arrang  the largest paper product compani  kimber clark  is in our district   interest  it ceo report onli one product line where they feel the abil to pass on cost base on energi  price  which again was the diaper market   that has been the subject of quit a lot of discuss in our district    laughter   the stori is differ for price of paper base hospit product  which constitut a grow market becaus of linen be unsanitari   they have a labor compon  and becaus of the labor compon from china  the philippin  estonia  and elsewher  there is continu price deflat    our contact in the chemic industri  which is substanti in our district  report that they cannot pass on price increas and have no price power   in the it  inform technolog  sector  our sourc at dell  ti  and ed say that hardwar and telecom cost continu downward  and india has begun to exert an effect that is keep a price ceil on softwar cost   as for the shipper  i spoke with ceo of three shipper   one again a former client in anoth district   and they report that they see growth    a tad bit slower      they are constrain by competit from dhl and the u s  postal servic and by their inabl to pass on cost increas other than standard fuel surcharg  the ceo of the largest railroad in our area report soft patch in the economi   he note particular that growth in shipment for tran pacif trade has slow to the high singl digit from  signific doubl digit   most notabl  by the way  this is occur in steel where price have come off dramat  most interest of all were the discuss we   ve had with shipper   i previous serv on a norwegian ship board   got off at just the right  e   but have use those contact to get a  better understand of the ship industri   and i think here are some interest data   other than the categori of lng tanker  which was cover by the financi  e adequ this  morn  the baltic dri index  for exampl  has been drop dramat   in fact  the cost of ship at one point  as you rememb  exceed the cost of good ship   last year  it cost           a day to charter a ship to carri iron ore for the manufactur of steel   as we saw in the  chart   from either brazil or india to china   now the cost is          but here is the clincher   china has enter the shipbuild busi in a dramat way   it current account for    percent of the shipbuild market     percent is produc by korea and    percent by japan   china will doubl it shipbuild capac in the next five year  and the data   show that an addit    percent of the exist contain fleet and    percent of the exist tanker fleet will come on stream in the next three to four year   needless to say  there is no price power in ship  so in summari  mr  chairman  while the eleventh district has caught up with the nation   sound in our district and nation indic no price power   and i detect a slight  but notic  shift among the peopl we speak with toward concern about slower growth and away from concern about inflat   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   busi activ in the fourth district has not chang veri much dure the intermeet period   busi condit in the region are okay   but not great   mani of the busi contact i talk to report that their busi is better in other part of the countri than in our district  recent credit downgrad of debt issu by gm  ford  and some of their supplier have receiv a lot of attent in the district   longer term  compani in the automobil suppli chain are brace for consolid  as ford  daimler chrysler  and gm grappl with their cost structur  my district  though  has a number of honda and toyota plant and supplier to those plant   so the longer term adjust in the district are not like to be quit as sever as in other part of the midwest   nevertheless  the fourth district compani that sell to the automobil suppli chain are not op ist about the sale and profit outlook for that sector   one banker i talk to  confirm that his custom in the automot suppli chain have becom veri cautious about their invest spend recent  at the  e of our last meet  my greatest concern was that the pace of real econom activ might slow and that the pace of core inflat might pick up   as it turn out  econom   growth has held up fair well and inflat has held fair steadi   nevertheless  i   m not feel ani more confid or certain about the outlook   especi the outlook for inflat   than i was in  may  i approach this meet think about inflat in the same way that     did in his present   the  book baselin project for core pce is close to   percent for near all  of this year and next year and onli veri slowli return to my prefer rate of     percent   and i  find this long  e frame to be discourag   even more discourag is the prospect that inflat  could veri well turn out to be greater than that baselin project  as   point out in his exhibit    in earli      the  book baselin project  call for core pce to increas over the four quarter of      at a rate of   percent   by the end of  last year  that was move up to     percent   then over the past six month of this year it has been move up anoth    percentag point to   percent   i   m not repeat these number to cast  aspers on the staff project becaus  after all  when they were made i thought those were   veri reason project and i agre with them   as a group  we report to congress in februari that our central tendenc project for core pce was     percent to    percent this year and the same for next year   and  as   point out this morn  in our preliminari number  the project for core pce has been move up to    to   percent for this year and next   i know that i have consist underes  inflat   and now we   re face oil price of close to     per barrel and there is a risk  i believ  that unit labor cost could trend up   assum that the real side of the economi   hold up  the potenti inflationari consequ of these develop give me second thought about paus too soon in our remov of polici accommod   but i   ll hold my comment on polici for later on in the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   anecdot from our director and other  incom data on the region and nation economi  and the result from run our forecast model all appear to me to be consist with real gdp growth of   percent or more   person   like mani other  i expect growth of around     percent   the kind of expans we have been experienc   i   ve been struck most recent  as i review the latest anecdot and the incom evid on the economi  by the breadth of the posit report  though of cours much of what we have  been see is a continu of what has been go on for some  e   so i   ll just cover the posit thing veri  veri quick  sustain strength in home price  sale  and residenti  construct activ  incipi improv in nonresidenti construct activ  expans in  manufactur in the aggreg  moder gain in employ  continu increas in consum spend  and a posit situat with regard to capit spend  as sandi pianalto just note  there are part of our economi   what i guess i would call    old industri america      such as domest own automobil produc and their supplier  and though not industri  the hub and spoke airlin  where there are lot of problem   but it seem to me that the forecast adequ allow for those circumst alreadi   so  to me  the economi and the econom expans appear to be on solid foot  as to inflat  i have not chang my forecast  but i must admit i am a littl less comfort about the situat than i was former   that   s part becaus we   ve gotten a littl   more inflat this year and last year than i had earlier anticip   but also  as i listen to dave     s attribut analysi  i got a littl nervous   i   ve had a lot of experi do those kind of thing  and one can alway pars the number that way   what i think it miss from  e to  e is   the under dynam or interact of the price perform   so i   m a littl more concern than i was former that inflat  if not tilt to the upsid  is at least get lock in at a somewhat higher rate  have said all of that  it seem to me that as far as polici is concern we have been on the   appropri cours and we should continu on that cours   i think the polici implic are realli rather straightforward
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last fomc meet  i worri about a slowdown in growth and a pickup in inflat   i hypothes and hope that both would prove  transitori   on the whole  i consid recent data reassur that the soft patch in the spring was just that   mayb not even that   and not a precursor of a more entrench slowdown   while the  book subscrib to the view that the slowdown in growth was transitori  the staff has made an upward revis  by a coupl of tenth  to it forecast for core pce inflat for this year and next year  now project inflat of about   percent in both year   i   m a bit less pessimist on inflat than the staff   recent data on core inflat have been pretti good of late  moreov  i see the fundament   name  the pressur on futur inflat   as provid room on balanc for some op    the most worrisom factor is that oil price have risen further  although this should tend to boost core inflat more this year than next year  as   note  the recent jump in compens per hour should probabl be discount  sinc it appear to be due to one  e factor   on the encourag side  i see a notic declin    about    basi point   in inflat compens at both the    and    year horizon  high markup  an appreci in the dollar  a level off of commod price  veri modest increas in the eci  still rather robust structur product growth  and some indic of remain slack    the situat with regard to slack  as   note and emphas  is complic becaus the unemploy rate is relat low  near most es  of nairu   but sever other  measur  as he point out and as we also routin monitor   includ the employ to  popul ratio  capac util  the output gap  and the other indic that   show us    do suggest that slack remain  one final point on the inflat outlook is that one of the best forecast of futur inflat is past inflat   and i   m told that this is a point that was emphas at a special topic session a coupl of year ago   on this score  thing look fair good  with core pce price inflat at     percent over the past    month  while i guess i can and have quibbl a bit about the inflat outlook for the next year  overal i think the  book forecast seem reason   real gdp appear pois to grow just  slight abov it potenti rate  gradual elimin remain slack   and core inflat  while  current near the upper end of my comfort zone  at least to me seem like to moder a bit over  the next few year  the  book forecast depict an almost textbook scenario of an economi continu along the path toward a rather attract steadi state   go forward  there are obvious some sizabl risk  and i count the unwind of possibl hous and bond market bubbl as one or two  that are high on my list   but i think the most like outcom is   as in the  book project    that we will continu to move in a posit direct over the next coupl of year   and given what we now know  i think the fund rate path assum in the  book  which is veri close to the market   s current view  is appropri   that is  we are like to need to rais rate a coupl more  e befor slow the pace of tighten rather substanti   and i want to emphas that  in my view  the well calibr monetari polici we   ve had has play an import role in keep the   economi move along this textbook path dure a period character by some quit difficult  circumst  i know that monday   s pre fomc brief emphas that econom activ has been  burden by some major drag over the past year or so   these includ the oil shock  the deterior in the trade balanc  and the still low level of invest spend relat to gdp  the result is that we   ve had to keep interest rate except low for a long  e  just to get respect econom growth   in fact  respect and not stellar growth is all we have gotten  even  with except low long term yield and unexpect rapid gain in hous price   and those are two factor that  on their own  would be work to push up the equilibrium real fund rate  so the mere respect growth in the economi has realli rest on the back of just a few interest rate sensit sector   busi invest  consum durabl  and hous   from that  perspect  it   s realli not all that surpris that hous price have risen a great deal  and it   s not surpris to hear our director and other contact comment that liquid is abund and that lend is take place for deal that one of our director simpli character as    stupid      i think  he meant by histor standard    laughter   my point is that to offset the drag  we   ve need to  give the economi a strong dose of s ulus  which inevit boost the hous sector   and that just to get reason econom growth   that is equival to say that the equilibrium real fed  fund rate is unusu low       percent in the  book path   so  for me  the polici imper that follow is that we need to be care not to overdo the pace of polici tighten   i note that in recent month sever fomc member have comment   that we usual know we   ve come to the end of the tighten phase when we have tighten one or two  e too mani   i think we should be especi attent to this concern this  e around  becaus the expans   depend so heavili on just a coupl of interest sensit sector   and         s analysi ye day highlight the fact that if hous and or bond price fall  the zero bound could becom an issu we would be discuss again  to conclud  i   m all for rais the fund rate by    basi point at this meet  and i  believ the languag in the press releas should seek to maintain the path for the expect fed fund rate that now exist in the market   my worri is that unless we   re care in craft the languag as  we rais the rate today   and like again in august   market will start to build in more increas in  subsequ month than they have so far   i think we are near the point when we will need to    start paus  and i hope we can maintain that expect in the market in the period ahead
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to start by say that i thought the staff present was veri comprehens and veri sound  includ the discuss of risk and standard  error   so i congratul the staff on a veri fine job there  let me just summar veri quick key anecdot inform that i have gather   first of  all  my sens from my contact is that the real economi is grow moder  continu the  growth of about the past year or so   second  labor suppli of hour worker is plenti   there are lot of anecdot of that type  but a dramat exampl is a new wal mart store open in san diego  where there were        applic for     job   that   s a veri typic stori  the margin   may not alway be that big  but it   s a veri typic stori   i get the same kind of inform from my contact in the transport industri   the onli except there seem to be truck driver  a posit for which qualifi applic seem to be in chronic short suppli  third  manageri and technic skill are becom in somewhat short suppli   a contact with a major softwar compani told me that their outsourc to india was actual more a matter of the suppli of those skill   with mani of them just not readili avail in the unit state   rather   than the cost   this is  i   m sure  for standard sort of softwar code write   anoth item in that vein is that later this year we could see a strike of up and fedex pilot   there are ongo negoti   the contract expir some  e ago  or at least becam avail for a reopen  some  e ago   and the pilot appar are quit far apart from the compani in those  negoti  fourth  i don   t think there   s ani doubt that energi price are have a signific effect on the purchas power of  let   s say  the lower half of the incom distribut   wal mart has been talk about that for some  e in term of their same store sale   but anoth veri interest wal mart anecdot was that they   ve observ among their own employe a reduct in health care util   that is  fewer doctor    visit   but an increas in emerg room visit   appar employe are struggl some to make the co payment and that kind of thing  again emphas the stress that exist in mani lower incom household   that   s where i   ll stop   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the fifth district advanc moder in may and june   the survey result we releas earlier this week show  that manufactur shipment edg higher and that revenu of servic firm grew somewhat more quick this month   new order in manufactur seem to slip this month  howev   growth in retail sale moder in june  as our big ticket sale index contract slight after have move  sharpli higher in may   district hous market remain fair hot   mayb not as hot as miami  but fair hot   home sale continu at high level   bid abov ask price were common in  popular locat   market for beach properti and for condo in downtown area are especi strong   busi op  seem to be hold up   survey respond expect the pace of demand   growth to pick up over the next six month   our contact also expect an upturn in capit spend  growth over that period  and price pressur in the district remain contain  indic are that the nation economi continu to perform well  although concern about the hous market and energi price are caus jitter in some quarter about the sustain of the expans   averag net job growth for the three month end in may exceed         per month   a rate suffici to keep up the steadi improv in labor market  we   ve seen sinc last year   and the  book expect real gdp to averag abov     percent through the end of       slight fa  than potenti   to me  the most strike revis in the june  book was the     increas in the project path for core pce inflat through        expect inflat is now     percent for       and     percent for         i found this revis strike  becaus   percent is the upper limit of my own comfort zone for core pce inflat   moreov  market particip are awar that the core  pce index is the fed   s prefer inflat measur   and if we allow it to drift much abov    percent  we run the risk of unhing longer run inflat expect  especi if energi price spike up further as well  have said that  i take heart from the fact that inflat expect have fallen somewhat in the past coupl of month   tip inflat compens  both near term and longer run  has continu to declin even in the face of climb oil price   of cours  inflat expect build  in belief about our futur behavior   i read declin inflat compens  along with the  appar fall in inflat uncertainti for which     s staff appar find evid  as impli that market expect us to do whatev is necessari to hold the line on inflat   i see three main risk to the outlook   first  with oil market as tight as they are  the world economi is obvious vulner to a suppli disrupt that could send price signific higher    second  we   ve been anticip a handoff from hous invest to busi invest over the   cours of this recoveri   while busi invest has continu to pick up  the demand for new  capit appear to be limit now by the rate at which firm expect their output to grow   so the potenti problem is that busi may be reluct to pick up more slack befor they see that hous is head for a soft land   yet that reluct would interfer with or imped a smooth handoff  make it more difficult to achiev  third  i find myself worri about the possibl of an inflat scare in the bond market   despit the recent declin in tip spread   it   s not clear how like this is  but if it happen  it would be veri cost   a spike in long term yield could be particular harm today for elev hous price   it would rais long term mortgag rate direct  obvious   moreov  it would    forc us to rais short term real rate   and in such circumst i think it would be even harder for us to facilit this handoff of invest from the hous sector to the busi sector without an interven recess   thank you
thank you   we   re somewhat more confid in the strength and sustain of the expans than we were in may   our view is veri similar to the  staff forecast   we expect real gdp growth to averag rough     percent over the forecast period   we expect core pce to follow a somewhat higher path and to end the forecast period slight higher than we expect in may  at just under   percent  this forecast assum that we   ll continu to tighten monetari polici  perhap by a bit more than foreseen in the staff forecast and than is current price into the market   to us  the risk to this forecast seem rough balanc   we see no new sourc of potenti risk   this is not to say  that the usual sourc of uncertainti and the usual candid for a negat surpris are not   daunt   it   s worth note  though  that these risk   from a cliff in hous price to a sharp increas in household save  to a larger and more sustain oil shock  to less favor futur  product outcom  to a sharp increas in risk premia or to declin in asset price   in general   are risk that we can   t realli mitig substanti ex ant through monetari polici  howev  by make sure we get the real fed fund rate up to a more comfort level we can help   the altern strategi  to oversimplifi it  would be to follow a softer path for monetari polici to provid a preemptiv cushion against the negat effect on employ of a fall in  hous price  a rise in risk premia  some rise in save and a fall in consumpt  and so forth  this would  i believ  be a less prudent strategi   although there have been persist concern about the vulner of this expans and  about some of it less robust characterist  the two most remark aspect of this recoveri are encourag   the first is it resili   so far  each episod of incipi soft has prove to be shallow in depth and short in durat   despit veri prolong and substanti headwind in the  context of an oil shock  a larg ongo drag from net export  a signific tighten of financi condit  a modest withdraw of fiscal s ulus  etc   quarter gdp growth   as   said    has shown impress stabil around a     percent annual rate over the last year and a half   and this is a dramat reduct in realiz macroeconom volatil   it make the much herald    great moder    look turbul  the second posit featur of this period has been the behavior of under inflat and  inflat expect   of cours  under inflat seem to have move up a bit  but larg chang in oil and commod price and import price have produc period of substanti acceler in headlin inflat without  at least to this point  caus more than short live upward move in core inflat or inflat expect    the behavior of product growth and expect about futur product growth explain some of this   also import  of cours  is the credibl engend by the record of the fomc   chang in the structur of the financi system must matter  too   there are almost sure  other factor   luck for one   that are at work  among the choic in   reinhart   s note on interest rate  i   m inclin to support the more benign assess of the recent behavior of forward interest rate and term premia  even  though these factor can   t fulli explain those move  and even though the futur may prove to be more volatil and advers than the market now seem to expect and than those explan would impli   so what about monetari polici go forward   there are two salient dimens of the forecast   one  of cours  is growth slight abov trend from a start point where the remain amount of resourc slack  if ani  is substanti diminish   the other is an under inflat  rate   just to focus on the core pce   that now seem to be run at a modest margin abov     percent and that we expect will end the forecast period abov     percent   and inflat expect  at the horizon over which monetari polici oper and with reason adjust to translat them into a view on the pce deflat  are still some margin abov     percent  we don   t consid this inflat forecast a caus for serious concern   we anticip upward  pressur on inflat from some firm of compens growth and from higher unit labor cost  we expect those pressur will face the countervail forc of relat moder inflat expect  strong competit pressur  still substanti profit margin  the potenti for some increas in the labor forc particip rate  and pretti strong expect futur product growth  and yet it should matter to us that  even in a world where the nomin fed fund rate peak  at   percent  model envis a relat extend period dure which the core pce deflat stay   meaning abov     percent   the rang of es  in the forecast and model simul befor us  and the expect we can deriv from the market  place the termin rate of the nomin fed fund rate now between     and     or between    and perhap    percent   these es  have move down a bit over the last few month  but the shape of the path has steepen a bit   i don   t think we realli know how much confid we can have in these es   even if the   forecast unfold as we expect today   but my view remain that we are better off follow a path that would put us at the higher end of these es  than in take the risk of do too littl and   stop prematur or tri to manag the communic challeng of a temporari paus when we still believ we have further to go   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the issu befor us at this meet are two  the first is  are we go to be dissuad from the announc strategi of anoth modest tighten in monetari polici   and second  is there palpabl need to adjust market expect of polici  go forward  we might be dissuad  or feel oblig to chang market expect under one of four  circumst  and i will go through each of them in order   the first is if we thought the baselin forecast itself  which i think is built basic around the announc strategi  was unaccept   i find the baselin forecast basic accept  although i am somewhat concern  as are presid   and a few other who have alreadi spoken  that the inflat drift seem to be upward   so i think there is some risk there  but by and larg it   s basic an accept forecast    the second reason i think we would chang strategi or chang polici in term of our  announc is if the incom data made a basic accept forecast seem high unlik  and here i   d say that the incom data  at least on the real side of the economi  are pretti much   consist with the baselin forecast   consumpt is like to hold up well  as outlin in the baselin  becaus labor market do appear to be gradual improv   as     indic  not onli has the unemploy rate edg down a littl but  more import from my standpoint  the broader indic of labor market condit seem to be consist with improv  econom condit have strengthen enough to bring some individu back into the labor market  as evidenc by a gradual rise in the labor forc particip rate   there is also a declin in the share of individu work part  e  for econom reason  as shown on exhibit   in the chart show as well   and i think the tone in the survey data from both busi and household has been relat posit   moreov  i continu to believ that low interest rate are  like to support wealth creation in the hous market  as we discuss extens ye day  and i have veri littl concern about a sudden fall off in that regard   and  final  with respect to busi fix invest  i would say though the invest to gdp ratio has been relat low   a point i will return to later   i agre with the assess in the  book that the fundament are at least consist with ongo busi fix invest  on the inflat side  i would say that   handl the incom data well in term of whi one should not put too much weight on some of the data   the one point that he didn   t touch on  was unit labor cost   they rose quit dramat in the fourth quarter of last year  but i think the good news is that in the first quarter of this year the increas in unit labor cost on an annual basi   quarter over quarter  seem to have subsid somewhat   so there may be less inflat pressur in that regard   so by and larg  in term of the second reason  i   d say the incom data are consist with a pretti good outlook  the third reason that might forc us to chang our view is if the market signal indic that   our read of the economi is like to be flaw   and here  as other have indic  the work that     and the staff have done i think firm outlin at least some of the issu   the fix incom  conundrum has been much recogn   addit  risk premia in the fix incom univers are also quit low   in the equiti market  i think the signal are somewhat contradictori   and here i  pick up a littl from exhibit     one thing that   s not shown there is that the impli share price volatil of both nasdaq and the s p     are realli quit low  and yet the risk equiti premium is relat wide   toward the wide end of the norm that we   ve seen over the last decad   so in lieu  of decri these conundra with which we are confront  let me at least do what michael wouldn   t do  which is ventur a hypothesi on whi some of these thing are true  with respect to the fix incom market  i have reach the conclus   from these various observ of low rate and the flat yield curv   that the explan probabl relat to the fact that  at the global level  domest absorpt has fallen   i   m not tri to sort out  invest versus consumpt   overal i think it has fallen below what it would have been  otherwis   this suggest to me a fall in the neutral rate  not a global slowdown   to cite the two choic that were in     s model   i am heavili persuad by the work that we saw on monday  which   mention  about the number of real side factor that may be hold back the economi and therefor reduc the neutral rate  i   d also say that the invest gdp ratio  which has been quit low  has fed into fix incom market perform becaus it has led to a chang in the corpor financ gap   between      and       the financ gap rose from less than     billion to a peak of more than      billion   that rise reflect the veri sharp increas in capit expenditur that we saw and have talk a great deal about in the telecom  high tech  and transport sector  etc   but the import thing is that the financ gap fell abrupt in      and       turn negat in       and stay negat until the fourth quarter of last year   due to the microsoft dividend and the expir of the   acceler tax depreci  the financ gap return to slight posit territori in the first quarter   but overal the negat financ gap  which has been widespread across industri  indic to me that the busi sector as a whole is generat enough cash to purchas capit expenditur without borrow   it is also true that the dividend payout ratio has been relat low   the dividend payout ratio as a percentag of s p oper earn turn out to be  base on a report that i   ve just receiv  about    percent versus the    to    percent it has averag over the last    year or so  so it   s clear that corpor are realli sort of hoard this cash  sinc corpor do not tend to invest in equiti  they do tend to invest in a number of fix incom secur relat short term   i think that   s one of the thing that have been drive these relat low interest rate   and just to put a final point on that  sinc the begin of       liquid asset in the nonfinanci corpor sector rose from about      billion  or more than    percent  to a total of      trillion   while the rate of accumul of liquid asset has slow  i think the ratio is still a factor that has been drive this relat low interest rate  in equiti market  my read of the data is that the low volatil is tell us a better stori  than the rise in the equiti risk premium we   ve seen   as   point out  or at least impli  the earn price ratio part of the equiti risk premium realli hasn   t chang veri much over long period of  e   it is still in the     to   percent rang   so it realli is the fix incom side that has  been drive the slight widen of the equiti risk premium  the final market signal that i think would be import to us is the read on interest rate   some peopl have alreadi talk about the interest rate signal we   ve seen   i won   t belabor the issu   i will pick up a point that   made  which is that there are a number of differ measur of inflat that come not just from the market but from other   our  book turn out to be one   of the best forecast of inflat   it   s not the onli reason good one   from the philadelphia feder reserv district  for exampl  the survey of profession economist also has a fair good track record on forecast inflat   and as   point out  a random walk   or at least look back to recent inflat histori   has been a good forecast   the good news for us is that almost all of those forecast fall in a rang that   s veri close to the  book forecast  which give us perhap  some comfort that the  book has the forecast on inflat about right  the final point i   d make   if you rememb  there were four reason   is   would we be  dissuad from rais rate or would we chang the signal if we thought it would creat some financi instabl   in this regard  i ask the staff to do a veri quick simul of the effect of a  rapid   percentag point rise in the fed fund rate over what is in the  book forecast   it turn out that if we were to be so rash as to dramat rais rate by   percentag point over the  baselin forecast  that would creat by the end of      a rise in the financi oblig ratio of onli  about   basi point   i won   t go through all the math of it  but obvious it has a fair amount to do with the fact that a vast major of the mortgag in this countri are fix rate mortgag   and  second  by definit  if we were to rais rate so dramat that it would result in a slow in the economi  we would see individu take on less debt   but the bottom line is that i think the strategi we   ve outlin  if execut in a reason fashion  should not creat financi instabl   let me conclud by say that i think the strategi we have is about right   i don   t believ  there   s a reason to chang market expect quit dramat   i do think there   s some  downward pressur on the neutral rate  and i think the  book has pick that up   so  by and larg  i think the appropri cours is full steam ahead   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i made onli small revis to my forecast from  last januari   we   ve seen some notabl fluctuat in data and sen ent over the last five month  but basic i think we   ve end up pretti close to where we start  with prospect for growth that  are close to the growth rate of potenti  perhap a bit abov  and core pce inflat stabl at a littl over it rate of last year  the data we receiv over the intermeet period reinforc this favor outlook  assuag some of the concern on both the demand and inflat front that i had at our meet in earli may   growth in privat final purchas has been good  with the second quarter forecast to be around   percent   slack in labor market has continu to erod gradual   core cpi inflat slow  support the notion that some of the earlier pickup was a product of the pass through of previous increas in energi and other import price  and core pce inflat has been stabl  commod and intermedi good price pressur have abat  consist with the moder pace  of increas in product and a judgment that the global economi was not face signific bottleneck  except possibl in energi market   and import  inflat expect fell on balanc despit the further increas in oil price   the recent further rise in oil price will inde put some upward pressur on core inflat  but that should be limit in  e  and increas in the  price of other import should abat consider  owe to the strength of the dollar  moreov  the behavior of most measur of labor compens suggest to me that labor market are not in the process of overh and may even have some degre of slack remain  and declin in inflat expect provid some assur that past increas in energi and other price aren   t like to becom embed in persist higher inflat    over  e  of cours  it is appropri monetari polici that will keep the balanc between demand and potenti suppli and inflat in check  and i actual found that think about the appropri path for polici was harder than think about the outlook  in a fundament sens  the favor outlook rest on a judgment that over the last year or  so monetari polici has been well calibr to the evolv situat   market particip seem comfort with polici to date and with their expect for the futur   the simultan declin in expect fund rate and inflat expect over the intermeet period indic confid that inflat will be contain   and the rise in equiti price and still fair narrow risk premium in credit market must rest on expect of continu solid growth  i think we can be fair confid that appropri polici is like to requir addit tighten even beyond this meet   that   s what is built into the yield curv  and that structur of  rate seem to be consist with growth continu around or perhap a littl abov the rate of  potenti and with the output gap about disappear   and with output probabl close to it  sustain potenti and inflat alreadi have pick up a littl  i agre with the rest of you that we   re at a point in the cycl at which we need to be especi care about keep inflat  pressur contain   but how much further we need to tighten in order to accomplish that  and at what pace  are the interest question  the staff and market have built in a level out of the fund rate at about    to   percent  that   s quit low by histor standard   the  book has an impli short run r  of onli      percent   still  that   s not implaus  judg from the experi of the last few year when veri accommod polici has been associ with growth onli moder in excess of potenti   and the recent downward revis to market expect for growth abroad   and expect polici path abroad   reinforc the possibl that low equilibrium rate appropri reflect weak global   demand   nonetheless  the under truth is that we realli don   t know how much we need to  tighten  and  fortun  we don   t need to figur that out today   i recogn that the    basi point per meet path is not an op um polici   as we can see from the bluebook simul  an op um polici would tend to flatten out the trajectori as we  get close to what we think is a stop point   the risk is that the    basi point per meet pace   will tend to ratifi your predict  mr  chairman  that our last tighten will be one too mani  given the lag in the effect of polici  if we wait to see confirm sign that past increas have  slow growth on a sustain basi   and we aren   t see just anoth soft patch   we probabl  will inde have overshot the mark   the path could be especi problemat if it extend into the fall when our meet get closer togeth   sure  the pace of tighten shouldn   t be dictat by the meet schedul rather than econom need   but i do take some comfort in the expect that polici  sn   t have to be that precis   the market will tend to compens for ani overshoot by build in a revers  provid we let it know that we are open to that possibl  when the  e come    for now  stick to our path of gradual rate increas would seem to be the most prudent cours  but such a path is condit on the economi follow it expect path   we should be will to deviat either way  even as earli as august  should the data indic a veri substanti deviat in the path of spend or price   and our statement today should not be read as impli  anyth about our expect beyond august   that will depend on data   the higher we go with rate  the more we need to keep an open mind about stop place and possibl even the pace of tighten   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i   d focus my remark today on the topic we discuss ye day   the hous market   and then i   d like to talk a littl bit about some of the liquid issu in hous market and relat that to monetari polici   let me start by say that overal i agre that there is not a major risk of signific  problem in the hous market   but there is momentum build in the hous area that is    rais some issu about which i am not as sanguin as mani of the staff who gave the present ye day   but i want to compliment the staff from both the board and the reserv bank   i thought they did a fantast job in pull all of the inform togeth    while inflat overal is appar well contain  i  too  am general concern about the continu ratchet up of our expect   the one thing that stand out is how much hous price have jump relat to overal price level   we know that the averag price for new home  in may was up   percent from a year ago   exist home price were up      percent  as was said  ye day   but inventori remain relat lean  even though the suppli has risen by about half a month sinc the begin of the year  when i look at the jump in hous price  i   m tri to see if consum are say     we  have good  strong incom growth and we   re abl to afford more      or are they see these price increas and tri to jump in while they still can afford a hous  befor home price get total out of their rang   are they view real estat as an altern for invest purpos  after be stung in the stock market drop of a few year ago   realli  all of these factor may be at the heart of the strong demand for hous  but i also think that the financ market are send differ signal in these area   i know mark is go to talk about some of the specif but i want to discuss some of the macro aspect of this   when the refinanc boom got start about three year ago  most we saw   custom go to bank to refin and take advantag of low  long term fix interest rate   so most of the mortgag origin in the           period were predomin fix rate loan or they were arm that had fair long fix rate period befor becom adjust   what is strike is how this has been chang in the last    month   arm of all type have jump from about    percent of origin in      to about one fourth in      and       to over half of mortgag origin last year   this is happen in a period when short rate are rise and long  rate are flat to down   if banker are realli work to the benefit of their custom  whi aren   t they lock in long rate in this environ  it is also the case  when we look at the mix of product  that more of the mortgag are subprim product   subprim origin have climb to over    percent of total origin   in term of where these mortgag are be park   whether they are on the book of bank and other financi institut or are be securit   about two third of origin continu to be securit   so the use of the market is about the same   but the type of mortgag be securit are chang   again  these are predomin arm  and more of them tend to be option arm   the higher risk kind of structur  as we saw in the inform present about the real estat mortgag pool that are be creat  the risk profil in those pool is chang   interest onli mortgag were basic nonexist in those pool two year ago  they are now run over     percent of them   wherea a lot of these io mortgag had veri conserv loan to valu ratio   under    percent   more and more of them now have loan to valu ratio in excess of    percent   and about   percent of the io in these pool are go to subprim borrow   that is  the riskiest custom   yet those loan requir interest onli payment  no amort   two week ago s p requir addit guarante on a few of these mortgag pool  which is anoth signal of concern    heloc are be use more for purchas money down payment   peopl no longer have to save to make a down payment   and when we look at heloc in general  for the last three year  they   ve grown at a compound rate of over    percent a year   as would ani supervisor  when i see a  product grow    percent a year for three year  i tend to get a littl nervous about the concentr risk   where is the liquid come from for these   again  a big chunk of it is go  to the securit market   i think one of the challeng we have as bank supervisor is that  to the extent the bank are origin these loan with the intent to sell them to the market  they   re look to the market for the credit definit  we know from our qis    quantit impact studi    result  look at the basel ii exercis  that we had a huge dispar in the result on loss expect on home equiti loan and other mortgag product   a lot of these are new type of product   the confid interv around the expect default  i think  are a lot wider for them than for those that have tradit structur  we also know that there   s a lot of correl risk that could happen here   if the hous  price bubbl   break in a market where employ is drop  peopl could be leav an area and we could have more default   in addit  we know that the drop of home price  in and of   itself  tend to creat more default  especi with neglig equiti in these properti   also  to the extent that peopl default and the bank have more properti to foreclos  there are  neighborhood effect  with loss get bigger when the default do occur  so  what i am concern about from a liquid perspect  sinc these are be securit and move into the market   and there is plenti of appetit in the market to take these product     is the lack of disciplin relat to previous period   in the ancient day  when mortgag loan  stay on the book of financi institut  liquid limit forc them to choos the higher qualiti credit   this isn   t happen today   and it isn   t clear if the marketplac current   understand the structur of these loan ani better than some of us do in term of price the risk  as evidenc by the s p move two week ago  so  again  i   m not over concern   especi with the record profit and capit in bank  i think there   s a huge cushion   but the implic of this for hous wealth and for investor who  take the ul  risk in these secur could creat some problem in term of the way econom  growth proceed go forward   and it   s someth that i think was appropri to spend the  e talk about today
thank you  mr  chairman   as susan indic  i  too  look at the mortgag market in anticip of the theme of our discuss ye day   but i also had a concern about the extent to which the mortgag market might be creat froth in the market   i interview sever of the largest mortgag origin   i talk to contact at bank  nonbank  and one of the  larg subprim lender and ask them to approach the question from the same perspect   that is  i ask them  what are you find that is new or differ in your market   what attract your eye becaus it   s new  and where do you see the risk embed in the natur of the mortgag market today   this   not address the question that presid guynn rais about the risk associ with the activ of contractor or real estat develop  which is a separ and veri signific risk   it may get at the question that presid   ask as to where the ul  sourc of the stupid is in the market   not whether or not there is stupid in the market  in conclus  mortgag term are inde becom more flexibl and less restrict  creat certain defin risk exposur   while each of the risk exposur appear to be both  manag and  to an extent  manag as isol risk  they pose heighten risk in some area   due to the layer of the exposur   it   s the layer that realli caus the risk   and  in part  it  mean that the most signific bodi of the risk exposur is in identifi market and lender  there is a lack of consensus as to how the relax of credit standard will impact safeti  and sound   to date  loan delinqu have remain modest  both within and outsid of the bank industri   howev  the undiminish appetit  particular for the nonconform  mortgag product  has allow for the flexibl to continu   and there is no slow in sight  despit all the warn that we have heard and indic in some market that there has been a level  and even a declin  in some properti valu  while that environ is clear like to produc unrecogn risk somewher in the financi system  it seem unlik that that risk will be in ani of the portfolio lender  includ the  bank lender  to ani signific extent  becaus of the avarici natur of the mbs  mortgag  back secur  market   the risk  as susan and other have mention  are pretti obvious   the io loan  now for term of up to    year  may account for    percent of total loan in some market   so there   s a greater risk of negat amort   also becom more popular is what is known as the alt a mortgag product  which make loan base on state incom and state asset  and carri a higher interest rate in exchang for fewer verif of the incom and asset  figur provid by the borrow  let me give you an exampl of how the layer that caus the risk can work   let   s take as an exampl a loan in a high end market such as california   the mortgag sought by the borrow   would exceed the maximum of fanni or freddi  automat make it a nonconform loan and automat remov the risk paramet that are embed in the conform product    becaus it is nonconform  it open the opportun for the alt a product  which mean that it  may be an io loan or allow a more aggress loan to valu ratio   the risk premium that should be   associ with that instrument   not seem to be captur in what the secondari market is   look for   so the secondari market will buy it   the origin of the loan is abl to meet the competit and rid itself of that risk   that said  there are some identifi risk that are clear be manag   accord to  some lender  about    to    market bear care watch  and lender have start to exercis restraint in those market   most of the market were mention ye day  but obvious they  includ place like florida and las vega  there is also an abil to look at investor properti and subdivid that categori into three   group   one of them is the typic purchas of a vacat home  jack guynn is buy in the blue ridg mountain  for exampl   or  as susan mention  anoth good exampl is the investor who is concern about the equiti market and want to move into residenti real estat   so that isol  those in the third group   the most high risk borrow   they are the one who want to get by with  the greatest amount of leverag   that is the borrow who is simpli look to take immedi   short term advantag of ani increas in valu   and that is a buyer those care mortgag lender can address with more specif  a great deal of uncertainti  frank  surround the interest rate risk exposur  becaus there  have been veri few advers interest rate period in recent year and the industri experi is limit   but the avail and prolifer of fico score mean that interest onli and high loan to valu mortgag are given onli to those within certain fico band  where the lender has the greatest confid in the borrow   s repay capabl  which is base on the histor experi of that borrow in term of his or her debt repay record  to date  foreclosur have been limit and minim at bank and bank mortgag subsidiari in the prime market for nonbank lender   that has a lot to do with the natur of the   secondari market   one lender told me that they are use the secondari market first of all for their conform product  second  for their nonconform product  third  for their heloc  and  fourth  for loan on first delinqu   and for the latter  this lender is sell them at onli a   or   percent reduct to book   so that loan is go off the book  and in some instanc  they are even  sell the residu in the secondari market   so there are five differ channel through which this lender is abl to use the secondari market   it sound to me veri similar to what the     s new york yanke were do with the old kansa citi a   s under   o  finley   use them to   improv asset qualiti    laughter   they were unload high risk properti  and do so without ani expect of compens from the counterparti   and they were do it annual   so it   s much the same thing that is happen now  as for the secondari market  whi is that market so avarici   i   d cite a number of reason  there are mani new investor  includ the hedg fund  with minim experi in deal with  market uncertainti   there are mani new product     percent of the mortgag back product  are either alt a or nonprim   that   s the flow  as we discuss ye day   there is evid of a lack of secondari market discret  includ the abil to price for risk  the risk premium simpli   not reflect the risk embed in that product   there have been some indic that the secondari market is start to tighten it standard  one of which susan mention  which is the  new guidelin from standard and poor   s   the other is the begin of some chang  particular in the aaa tranch  where a slight price increas recent was pass on  in summari  the activ in the mortgag market show no sign of abat   the risk   exposur remain  and the risk exposur seem most like to be in the mbs market   the place to look for the first evid of weak would be in the first loss posit  wherev that first loss posit happen to be   it   s not clear at this point if the mbs market will be an effici distributor   and dissemin of risk or if those in that market will be the last to recogn the risk that   s  embed in what they   re do and know how to price it  mr  chairman  i did not address the statement today becaus i see no need to adjust our      measur pace    languag or to make ani other signific adjust to our statement at this meet   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll let tom respond on behalf of the kansa citi royal    laughter  this will be my   nd and last statement at one of these meet  and if you   ll bear with me  i   d like to give a few part thought befor i ride off into the sunset  i believ most of us think about monetari polici in term of what i will call a modifi taylor rule   we don   t necessarili follow the explicit taylor rule outcom of the bluebook but we look at inflat and unemploy and tri to make them hit our target valu  at least over some  horizon   from  e to  e  we may shade our judgment base on some other factor that may  seem relev  which is fine   but the basic focus remain on inflat and unemploy   i  strong agre with this basic focus  and i get veri irrit when i see column suggest that we are tri to inspir or should be tri to p  a hous bubbl  for exampl   there is no way to do that and still maxim the inflat unemploy outcom   monetari polici is broad and has broad effect   when we take rate down in a soft economi  we probabl will be creat some bubbl  or at least mini bubbl here and there   not  becaus we want to  but becaus it is inevit   in the late      s  hold out against rais rate and henc let the economi achiev veri low unemploy rate probabl did add to the internet bubbl   in the past few year  keep rate down for a consider period probabl did   add to the hous bubbl  if  in fact  there is a hous bubbl   given our primari focus on inflat and unemploy  i   m not sure there is anyth we could have done about either bubbl  and i am sure it would not have been wise to go out of our way to tri to p  either bubbl  today   s polici challeng is to revers the high accommod polici we follow a few year ago in respons to what i still think was a real threat of deflat   there has been lot of  specul about the so call neutral level of the feder fund rate  as if onc we hit neutral we can stop rais rate   first off  this specul is naiv in the sens that whatev neutral is  it is more like a zone than a precis rate   moreov  neutral would onli be desir if the rest of the economi were in balanc  which is probabl never strict true  and certain isn   t true now   for these reason  i   ve alway been disdain of the search for neutral   whatev neutral is  i think in the current circumst we ought to take rate somewher  north of it   the reason is simpl  lag   we have taken the fund rate veri low in respons to threat of deflat   that mean that at the magic moment when we hit neutral there will be still some  accommod polici in the pipelin   polici that would have to be offset with at least a slight overshoot on the other side   this is a well known shower problem that has enliven countless   macro classroom   one can also see this overshoot in the op  polici simul in the bluebook   one issu that has alway been import to me involv nation save   i continu to be a  nation save freak   our rate is too low  no two way about it   continu low nation save impli either a drop in invest  which is undesir  or continu intern borrow  which is unreli   like other  i would great prefer to correct the problem through fiscal  au    but despit some welcom bulg in feder revenu  we all know that this is not real fiscal au  and that we are quit unlik to get real fiscal au  ani  e soon    given that fiscal polici is not measur up  can we do someth about nation save with monetari polici   unfortun  i think the answer is no  at least as long as we are oper under a modifi taylor rule   basic  our approach can determin the level of total output but not it composit between consumpt and invest   regard this composit  there is an interest new develop result from the financi innov we talk about ye day   i  admit to have alway been skeptic of the empir import of interest rate on consumpt  i would have thought that the form of hous wealth  whether cash or not  should not matter to  ration consum and that these consum should realiz that interest rate have ambigu effect on their life  op  decis   howev  if consumpt in fact   depend strong on interest rate  as our econometrician say  at least some of the crowd out impact of  higher interest rate will be felt by consumpt   so i will swallow my empir misgiv and at  least hope that our present easi fiscal and slight harder monetari regim will be at least slight less restrict on invest and slight more restrict on consumpt  anoth issu is  of cours  the hous bubbl   my own view is that there probabl is now   a slight macro hous bubbl  with the problem obvious be wors in select real estat market   as argu abov  it would be a great mistak for the fed to renounc it primari focus on inflat and unemploy and start fight bubbl   but might it be possibl to shape polici in  the direct of fight bubbl   the question sound veri reason   the problem come when  one tri to get specif   a few month ago there was a confer at princeton to address this veri question   what should monetari polici do about bubbl   i was enlist as a speaker in this session  and i then character my view in gilbert   sullivan term as     well  never   oh  hard  ever       laughter    there are sever argument whi we should hard ever tri to p  bubbl   asset bubbl may be too small to matter much in macro term  they may be endogen   the result of  expansionari polici we have conscious follow  and p  bubbl may run at cross purpos with the monetari polici proper base on inflat and unemploy   but i think the real  problem with p  bubbl can be seen from ye day   s discuss   how can we make that  type of polici stabil   if one read the press or listen to european   and i did that this weekend at basel   the high level of hous price should lead us to rais interest rate higher than we otherwis would   if one read the  book or the staff document we talk about ye day  the high level of hous price relat to rent lead to the expect that hous price are more like to declin than to rise  so that stabil polici would be to keep interest rate lower than we otherwis would  in that sens  the bubbl polici conundrum is similar to the bond market conundrum   great analysi  guy  but do we move rate up or down   in general  i think we aren   t go to know  hous price are high   do we respond to the expect by lower rate to fight the anticip   collaps   to put it mild  this polici would be veri hard to explain and carri the risk that our  more accommod polici would drive hous price even higher   imagin what   roach and   makin would say about that   if i can coin a term  this would be view as a  span    shotput       laughter  on the other hand  do we do what the press would have us do   rais rate and like destabil   this is a tough  perhap imposs  question   and our best approach is most like to  do noth   in that sens  mayb my princeton answer should have been a straightforward    never       whatev the case  i   m happi to rais the fund rate anoth notch today and to continu with the     measur pace    rhetor   for the futur  my own five dollar say that you will never figur out what neutral is  but i am confid that you will be abl to tell when to stop rais rate   this lead me to my final point  which is to say how much i   ve enjoy work with all of  you   these meet have been interest  challeng  and product   i can   t say that monetari polici is the hardest thing i   ve ever done in my life  becaus i did spend three year tri to get divers peopl to agre about social secur  but it was hard   and i think we did well   the staff  has been superb   i can   t imagin better prepar for meet like this than from read the  book and the bluebook   all of you have been consist interest and sensibl   and the chairman has run great meet and has admir meld our divers view into a coher and effect monetari polici   i will be etern grate for have been a part of it    applaus  thank you
governor  i don   t recal when  anyon got applaus   laughter   i think what they were applaud was not necessarili your speech but your charact  sever   hear  hear
i hate to put you in a posit to follow that   laughter
i   m fair confid  mr  chairman  that this will not end with applaus    laughter   i will be refer to the materi that were hand out dure your break   no one would be surpris if you admit that you agre with yogi berra   s character that it    feel like d©j vu all over again      onc more  the market backdrop for your deliber is  as shown by the black line in the upper left panel of your first exhibit  one in which expect seem firm fix on a quarter point firm today   in addit  it   s hard to find ani market particip who believ that there will be ani materi deviat from the script of the past few meet in the announc this afternoon     the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix          there have  howev  been some chang   market particip  appar take comfort in incom econom data  revis down their expect of the end point of this firm cycl  shift from the expect in earli may of around   percent  the red dot line  to the current read where the black line flatten out at under    percent   with a quarter point hike today seen as a certainti  this impli that market particip also forese a paus some  soon   the black bar at the upper right show that investor assign about three fourth probabl weight to your be done befor novemb and a nineti five out of one hundr chanc of your finish up by the last schedul meet of the year   the issu befor you today would seem to be how to describ the reason for your action and whether to ratifi current market expect of a paus some  soon    decis that  in turn  like depend import on the answer to two question relat to the econom outlook and polici strategi   for one  what do you make of the further declin in the    year yield   that yield  plot with the black line in the middl panel  end the intermeet period a touch over   percent  further narrow it spread over short  and intermedi term rate    as can be seen in the lower left panel  the nomin    year treasuri yield   line      is now    basi point lower than it level just befor your meet one year ago  back when the fund rate was   percent   as note in line   and    index debt quot indic that this declin was two third real and one third inflat compens   with short rate rise and long coupon yield fall  the arithmet of the term structur requir that far ahead forward rate fall by more than the note yield   inde  the   year forward rate matur    year henc   line     shed     basi point over the past year   also of note  the declin in treasuri yield show through to privat yield  with the aa corpor rate in line   of the tabl drop a like amount   similar  the yield conundrum is not a domest phenomenon alon  as   leahi show   euro swap yield  for exampl  have declin by more than dollar one   the bottom right panel make one last point  the declin in yield over the past year has come as a surpris   by the expect approach to the term structur  the upward slope yield curv of one year ago   the dot line   predict that it successor would shift up and flatten over  e   instead of the long dash curv that was predict one year ago to prevail now  we observ the veri flat solid line  market particip got about right what would happen at the front end of the term  structur   probabl becaus your action were so telegraph   but after that  they went increas astray    the flatten of the yield curv is put in a longer perspect in the upper panel of exhibit     the sharp declin in the spread of the    year over the   year yield may not seem so scari if you ascrib it to shift in the demand and suppli of longer durat secur  the subject of the two left panel   as discuss in the memo i sent to the committe last week  the allur of longer durat fix incom secur   might have increas of late if investor perceiv the macroeconom environ    both nomin and real magnitud   to be more predict   an appreci of the signific demograph shift in our near futur may also have encourag some shift toward longer term asset by institut fund manag   at the same  e  the u s  treasuri has been make relat fewer of those oblig   with the averag durat of treasuri debt outstand declin by about one half year sinc issuanc of the    year bond was discontinu   last  befit the global dimens of the declin in long yield  the downward pressur on domest yield may owe to burgeon save relat to shrink invest intern  includ the effort of foreign offici entiti to direct their own surplus toward dollar asset    chang in demand are difficult to measur   and it is incipi demand that need to be measur  not quantiti realiz after asset price adjust   one way to quantifi the relat shift in demand is to consid the predict of multifactor model of the term structur   those model tri to explain the behavior of yield across matur as parsimoni as possibl while make sure all asset are price consist   the model we keep in hous predict  as in the lower left panel  that a substanti portion of the reduct at the long end of the forward rate structur owe to a lessen term premium   the current read of     percentag point is inde low in it histor rang  but those es  do tend to be volatil   if that repres an exogen shift in investor prefer  then it also repres increas financi accommod that warrant a higher polici rate than previous expect  but not much is realli exogen when you talk about financi market   if investor are buy more long date treasuri  what are they buy less of   that is  the financi impetus associ with a lower term premium might be trim by lower stock price and a higher foreign exchang valu of the dollar than would otherwis be the case    the flatten of the yield curv would seem more worrisom if you thought investor were predict that short rate should be lower than previous expect    perhap becaus  as in the middl right panel  they expect further restraint on spend from high oil price  some rebound in the domest save rate  or continu drag from the extern sector   note that the flatten of the yield curv need not be predict slower growth  onli that you will run polici on the easier side than previous expect to deliv good macroeconom outcom   as shown in the bottom right panel  predict of gdp growth from a simpl regress employ the term spread inde have come down appreci   but level matter  and a forecast of   percent growth over the next year in an environ in which slack has been materi reduc may not seem so unwelcom   as es  of resourc slack narrow  committe member might be particular intent on ensur that polici accommod is correspond remov   if it is ani consol  the top left panel of exhibit   show that the current set of the nomin fund rate  the black line  is well within the polici prescript of the standard rule that we follow   moreov  recent increas in the real fund rate  the   black line in upper right panel  have push that indic closer to the rang of es  of it equilibrium valu   as secretari to the committe  i spend some  e worri about the documentari record of your deliber   thus  i can recogn a pattern in these meet   you repeat predict that your last polici move will be a mistak  state so blunt  it is a paradox worthi of bertrand russel  but practic it mean that  as in the middl left panel  you may be close to the point where you should worri about what can go wrong   and that is the second major question pertin to your polici choic i put befor you   logic  there are two possibl  as in the middl left panel   you might be worri that you will stop firm polici too soon or too late   if market particip came to believ that you were behind the curv in polici tighten  inflat expect could becom unmoor and a good portion of your subsequ action would probabl be direct to reassert your inflat fight credibl   that risk is whi the committe highlight it watch about price develop in the rational part of the statement and ad a sentenc to it statement underscor it vigil against inflat   such a risk seem well contain  at least as judg by the measur of inflat compens deriv from the treasuri market plot at the middl right   inflat compens   base on the cpi   has move well south of     percent over the forese futur   the other mistak you could make would be to stop too late   that is  move the fund rate up beyond the level requir to work down resourc slack and keep inflat control   this could prove problemat if the committe subsequ took some  e to recogn it mistak or desir particular compel evid to revers itself   howev  the committe has been relat nimbl   say  in      and       as seen in the lower left panel   in unwind some of it polici restraint  besid  with corpor risk premium as low as shown in the bottom right panel  it seem unlik that market particip view you as about to overshoot in polici firm some  soon    as laid out in the matrix at the top of exhibit    in draft the bluebook  we tri to captur the implic for polici choic given the potenti answer to these two key question   that is  you could take the yield curv as signal  as along the column head  econom weak or a declin in term premium and you might fear  as along the row head  stop either too soon or too late   accord  altern c offer both a firmer stanc of polici and word that would lead market particip to project even more firm to come   altern a was structur to express more concern about the outlook and to signal that the tighten cycl may be draw to a close   the passag of  e may make some of the word of these altern relev for futur meet  but they   re probabl not today      you may see littl reason to diverg at this point from what seem to have work fair well thus far   measur polici firm   and therefor be attract to altern b   although aggreg spend and output growth evid slow in earli spring  the economi appear to remain reason robust   moreov  the recent evid may be read as indic that the pace of expans is like to rebound dure the second half of the year to a rate somewhat abov that of potenti output  even with further modest polici tighten   and if inflat expect were seen as well contain in may  they would seem even more so now   not to nag  but the structur of the exist statement will becom increas strain over  e at the four stress point list in the bottom panel   you current describ polici as accommod  product growth as robust  the risk as balanc  and the pace of tighten as like to be measur   an issu of strategi go forward is whether the statement should be patch up as the situat warrant or left intact until the  e come when you believ addit polici tighten is no  longer like   if the latter  you   ll have to come to grip with just how much guidanc you want in the statement in the futur   for complet  i   ve enclos the latest version of tabl    which was distribut this tuesday and vari onli slight from what was in the bluebook  that complet my prepar remark
thank you   question for     if not  let me proceed  this is a quit interest meet in the sens that we   re obvious approach the transit  we   re not quit there but we   re debat all the various element of it  and i suspect that   s the right thing to be do at this stage   inde  i suspect it   s the onli sensibl thing we can be do  for the moment  the under economi  from  my point of view    seem to be move forward   the industri product index for june  judg from the week data  look reason robust   the first figur on initi claim   the one that came out this morn   indic an economi with ongo strength   the week industri product data plus the initi claim may be the most current global data that we have for the u s  economi  and both suggest that no immedi deterior is occur  we had a long discuss about hous ye day   it   s veri evid from the backlog of the major builder that new home sale will continu apac  as the backlog presum at some   point wind down   the buildup has taken a veri long  e  and even though there   s some evid  of top  there   s realli no meaning evid in the market that hous demand is fall   inde  if anyth  it   s still on an upward track  and the feel is not that it will fall apart but that it will get much stronger and creat some realli serious problem in the adjust period   so  all in all  i myself am not uncomfort with the   percent plus rate of growth in gdp   go forward   but i do worri about the fact that oil and gas cost are begin to eat into profit margin of non energi produc corpor in the unit state   and even though our overal  data indic that margin continu to move up  when you disaggreg the segment of the corpor sector into energi and non energi  it   s fair appar that the margin for non energi  firm have alreadi peak out and presum at this stage may be move down   and rememb   this is not onli oil  but gas as well   a signific amount of the product inflat that we have seen is be partial offset by improv product in the use of energi  but not enough to prevent a signific rise in unit cost   as a consequ  pressur seem to be mount in that area   i am particular concern about it becaus even though we are publish fair larg increas in output per hour   in fact   percent plus in the first quarter   when we disaggreg the quarter into month data  it   s appar that the reason the product gain in the first quarter are as high as they are is that we move into the quarter from a veri high level   decemb was high and  as best we can judg  there  sn   t appear to have been much in the way of gain in output per   hour from decemb through april   these data are subject to signific revis  but it   s fair  appar that the momentum  at least for a while  has been lost   nevertheless  the  book    not project ani particular strength in unit labor cost  larg becaus it forecast a     percent increas in compens per hour   this  as i believ   was mention  is a flatten to a trend valu   that   s more hope  i think  than forecast    what concern me is that we are look here at a potenti pickup in the pace of unit labor  cost overal and especi for non energi corpor   moreov  a number of you have cite anecdot evid indic that price power  after exhibit some sign of potenc  is begin to be restrict   this  of cours  is the usual sign that profit margin are under pressur  inde  if we start with unit labor cost and the evid of diminish price power  we   re  obvious begin to look at the process of pressur on price  that has two potenti implic   one  the histori tell us that when margin turn down  the economi invari run into some difficulti one or two quarter   some  a littl more    later   we   re not quit there yet   we   re close to the peak in total  and in this respect i   m not sure one should look strict at non energi corpor becaus energi is an industri in this economi  and the domest earn of the oil and gas compani are quit substanti   much more so than they use to be becaus a good part of domest oil earn is now in refin and market  area where for a long period of  e the number were neglig   so  it   s in the system   it   s  expand  but we seem to be peak out here   have said that  it   s not clear to me that we   re see ani under weak yet  but i think we have to be care becaus we   ve had a  substanti ongo expans and that has occur in the context of fair good product number   if it turn out that the recent data on product are accur   and as you know  the  book project a     percent annual rate increas in product for the second quarter and a  return to our normal trend in product   then this weak will gradual dissolv   and the reason it will dissolv is that unit labor cost will start to flatten and margin will open  as they do in the  book  the problem with inflat  howev  is that if margin start to come down and you are confront with rise unit labor cost and you don   t have the buffer to absorb the rise  it   begin   to give you a cost push type of inflat  the like of which we have not seen for a veri long  e  the number have been caus for a littl despair  at least in recent month  and that   suggest that we have to be care on this  have said that  i think the risk are clear balanc with respect to the outlook for both  output and inflat   but i conclud from all of this   and a number of you have indic that you   ve reach the same conclus   that when you   re deal with a situat like this  polici tend to get creat not by your econom outlook  but by your loss function   and here i believ it is reason clear  at least to me  that if we err in stop too soon and are prove wrong  the cost are veri high   if we persist and it turn out that the economi is moder and the disinflationari pressur  especi the worldwid one  are as strong as indic suggest they may be  then we can recov relat quick   and i don   t perceiv the cost of make that type of mistak as one we need to be great concern about   i conclud  therefor  despit the fact that the risk to the outlook are truli balanc  that our   action should take into account that veri clear bias in interpret the loss function   accord  i would propos that we make anoth    basi point move on the fund rate today and chang the languag as littl as possibl  recogn that there is go to come a  e   it may be at the  august meet or it may be later   when the market and the data will have given us a consider  amount of inform as to when we ought to start to flatten out the fund rate path   my guess is that at the point we have a meet and decid that we   re go to chang the languag and skip an increas  the market will have been three week ahead of us   when we do it  i think we   re more like to do it in the context of veri littl market reaction becaus that will be the general consensus of the market as well as our own   so  i don   t think we have to fret excess about how we   re go to get there  the market will help us    i must say to you that this is not the way the market were function in term of be  inform when i arriv on the scene   we now have a feder fund futur market   we have everi sort of financi indic   everybodi is involv in forecast what we   re go to do and  inde  they do it for the reason that we would   so  it   s actual easier to implement monetari polici now than it was when i first arriv here   and i guess for my last meet i will pull a          and go over this in some detail   ned has been here a long  e  and he has been a major level influenc on the rest of us   like ned  i have been here a long  e   mayb too long alreadi   but it   s fascin to look at how the system has chang and where the signal are chang  in ani event  i put the recommend of    basi point on the tabl and the languag that appear in altern b  which will be distribut by michell   vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your propos to rais the fed fund rate anoth    basi point  and i support the languag in altern b  which i believ is accur repres on this piec of paper   in my view  this statement is as close to neutral as we  could get relat to current expect  and i think that   s the appropri signal for us to deliv at this  e
i  too  agre with your recommend  mr  chairman  and with the  languag of the draft   i particular concur with your assess of the loss function in term of   how we should think about polici   while i   d like to make ongo chang in this statement  now is not the  e to do it   so  i   m on board
i support the    basi point increas in the fund rate   my onli concern about the statement is the word    elev    in refer to pressur of inflat   but  like presid     i don   t think this is the  e to argu
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend  and i agre   with the altern b statement that you propos   i have two comment   one is that you said market would be three week ahead of us   but one thing that   s differ is that we   re provid them with more guidanc now   so i think we need to be veri care not to provid them with too much guidanc   i hope that   s clarifi at least in the minut if not in the statement   and my second comment is that the way you describ what might be come  with weaker growth and higher inflat  i think we   ll all be jealous of ned after a while    laughter
i support everyth  mr  chairman   i would have never guess that this tautolog balanc of risk statement would outlast me    laughter
presid  n
i  too  support the recommend and the languag  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
yes  i   m fine with your propos
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   like presid    i   m  concern about the languag describ inflat   i think it will be somewhat of a surpris to the   market  which is take some comfort from recent inflat data  and it may well perturb expect upward   but i support the recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend on both the languag and the increas in rate   i would just add two point   one  in the go round there was a clear concern that core inflat forecast have gone up  and a number of peopl said that the forecast were now in a rang that was at the upper end of their comfort zone   i   d be delight if the forecast come  down  but i think that   s a low probabl   second  to ned   s point about the tautolog  i can assur him of one thing  at some point the balanc of risk statement will come out    laughter
i support both part of your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend and the word   i also like the way you express the loss function  it correspond close to my own view on the  matter
i support the recommend on the polici action and the statement
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support the recommend
would you read the appropri resolut
i   ll be read the direct from page    of the bluebook and the balanc of risk assess from the draft statement      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent      and for the statement      the committe perceiv that  with appropri monetari polici action  the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil should be kept rough equal   with under inflat expect to be contain  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
