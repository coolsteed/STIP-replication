thank you   in term of market develop  i would like to focus on three major topic   first is the sharp adjust in market expect concern monetari polici sinc the last fomc meet   second  i will talk about the persist of high risk appetit in credit market  with a focus on what may be the most vulner market in the unit state   the subprim mortgag sector  third  i want to discuss the possibl factor behind some of the sharp shift we have seen in commod price sinc the last fomc meet  in particular whether these price movement reflect a shift in risk appetit among noncommerci investor or fundament develop in suppli and demand   first  there has been a sharp shift in market expect with respect to interest rate sinc the last meet   at the  e of the decemb meet  the consensus view among market particip was that the fomc would begin to lower it feder fund rate target this spring and that this eas process would continu into       with cumul rate cut of about    basi point   as you can see in chart    which look at the feder fund futur market  and chart    which look at the yield spread between the march      and the march      eurodollar futur contract  expect have shift veri sharpli over the past month   there is now no eas price in through midyear      and a residu of onli about    basi point of eas price in beyond that   this shift in expect can also be seen across the treasuri yield curv   as chart   show  the treasuri yield curv is now slight abov where it was at the  e of octob fomc meet   sinc the decemb fomc meet  there has been a rise of about    to    basi point in yield from two year to thirti year matur   the shift in expect is reflect predomin in real interest rate   as can be seen in chart    breakeven inflat rate have not chang much sinc the last fomc meet   the declin in breakeven rate that occur earli in the intermeet period has been revers more recent  and so we are at or slight abov where we were at the decemb meet   this upward shift in real rate appear to reflect a reassess by market particip not onli about the near term path of short term rate but also about what level of real short term rate is like to prove sustain over the medium and longer term  the buoyanc of the recent activ data may have caus some market particip to reassess what level of the real feder fund rate is like to prove    neutral    over the longer term   regard the issu of risk appetit  there appear to be no signific chang sinc the last fomc meet   risk appetit remain veri strong   corpor credit spread remain veri tight   especi in the high yield sector  as shown in chart      and impli volatil across the broad market categori   equiti and interest rate  see chart    and foreign exchang rate  see chart      remain unusu low  moreov  the turbul in some emerg debt and equiti market experienc    materi use by mr    is append to this transcript  appendix     earli this month was most transient and has subsid as well   so thing appear calm   but what are the area of greatest risk   in the unit state  the subprim mortgag market appear to be a particular vulner sector   the vulner stem from four factor   first  this market is relat new and untest   chart   show the overal trend of first residenti mortgag origin and the share of these mortgag by type   conform  jumbo  subprim  and alt a  which is a qualiti categori that sit abov subprim but is not quit as good as conform   as can be seen in this chart  subprim mortgag origin have climb in recent year  even as overal origin have fallen   in       subprim mortgag were    percent of total origin  up from a share of about    percent in        the second factor is that credit standard in this market appear to have loosen in       with the proport of interest onli loan and low document loan climb as a share of the total   as a result  there are some sign that strain in this market are increas   as chart   show  delinqu rate have move somewhat higher   in contrast  charg off remain low  held down by the rapid hous price appreci that we saw in recent year   most noteworthi  as shown in chart     the most recent      vintag of subprim mortgag is show a much more rapid rise in delinqu than earlier vintag show   the third factor is that most outstand subprim mortgag loan have adjust rate   there is signific reset risk given the rise in short term rate in      and the first half of      and the fact that mani of these loan start with low    teaser    rate   fourth  hous price are under some pressur  and this could contribut to further credit strain   i see some risk of a vicious cycl   if credit spread in the securit market spike becaus loan perform is poor  a sharp downturn in lend could result as the capit market for securit subprim mortgag product close   this constrict of credit could put downward pressur on price and lead to more credit problem among borrow  the result would be addit credit qualiti problem  wider credit spread  and a further contract of credit   fortun  to date the news is still fair favor  the strong demand for the credit deriv oblig creat from subprim mortgag product has restrain the rise in credit spread   as can be seen in chart     spread are still well below the peak reach in late      and earli        thus  the econom of make such loan and securit them into the capit market still work   but this situat could chang veri quick  especi if the labor market were to becom less buoyant and the perform of the under loan were to deterior  lead to a surg in delinqu and charg off   let me now turn to the commod market   the issu i wish to examin here is whether some of the sharp movement in commod price that we have observ sinc the last fomc meet repres shift in the risk appetit among noncommerci investor who have put fund into commod as a new asset class versus the contrast view that these price movement predomin repres chang in the under suppli and demand fundament   to get a sens of this  let   s look briefli at three commod that have move the most and are repres of their class   copper  corn  and crude oil   as chart    show  the sharp declin in copper price appear link to the larg rise in copper inventori at the london metal exchang   if anyth  the price declin appear overdu   for corn  the rise in price also appear consist with declin stock both in the unit state and global  see chart     as well as the grow demand anticip for corn in the product of ethanol   for crude oil  the declin in price is more difficult to tie back to inventori   although u s  inventori remain high relat to the five year histor averag  as shown in chart      this situat has persist for some  e without have a big effect on price   instead  the shift in oil price appear to be driven most by longer term forc   this can be seen in two way  first  as shown in chart     the chang in oil price has occur in both spot and forward price   the oil curv has shift downward in most a parallel fashion  which also call into question the role of unseason warm weather as the primari driver   if weather were the primari factor  then the declin in price should have been reflect much more strong in the spot and veri short end of the oil price curv   second  as shown in chart     opec spare product capac has been increas and is expect to continu increas in        this grow safeti margin reflect both slower growth in global demand and the expans of non opec output   the improv safeti margin may be an import factor behind recent develop in the energi sector   final  there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the decemb fomc meet
thank you   are there question for bill   presid pool
i was astonish when i saw the note   i think it was in the wall street   journal a coupl of week ago   that oil consumpt actual fell worldwid in       relat to        which realli surpris me   i don   t know quit how to explain that becaus the economi around the world are pretti strong   i   m assum that the longer run price elast are take hold and that a lot of the trader probabl believ the elast is zero and they push price up pretti high     that make sens
i think that is definit part of the stori   anoth part of the stori is that in some countri  especi emerg market countri  the oil was heavili subsid  and some of those subsidi are now come off becaus continu to subsid as the oil price climb entail a rather heavi budgetari burden   so you   re also see a sort of normal of oil price in a lot of place   think about the oil that russia use to sell to ea n europ or some of the surround countri at preferenti price   they are no longer get those preferenti price  so there is a demand respons   i think it is happen on both side   there has been a demand respons to higher oil price  and there has been a suppli respons come out of place like africa
if i may add a footnot   i think you also need to watch the pattern of how inventori have behav   when price were be push up in the process from  say  the end of      to their various local peak  the incent to hold inventori rose   at some point in       inventori were veri high   we had basic fill everi bucket we could find with crude oil   and inventori feed back   it   s a dynam   price chang creat the demand for inventori  the real  e valu of inventori feed back on the price   so i think you saw some of that go on as well in      in term of drive the price versus drive usag   purchas for inventori is not well measur   we have inventori onli for the oecd  so separ product from consumpt is not perfect becaus we can   t alway captur the inventori and they are measur as consumpt in some case
bill  if you talk to the produc and the refin   you   ll find out that i like to do that kind of thing   there has been some concern  although one can   t measur it with ani precis  that the so call citi refin in london or on wall street  mean the specul  do affect price   we have had some discuss with your predecessor  but i   m curious as to what your view on that phenomenon are
as you know  this topic is undergo a lot of further research   the academ literatur that i   ve survey has yet to uncov a strong causal relationship between a climb in specul open interest and the effect on price   one reason that is hard to imagin happen to a power degre in the end is that the specul realli don   t want to take actual deliveri of the physic commod  and so the price realli should clear in the spot market on what   s happen to under suppli and demand   but this topic certain remain under investig by a number of research   i don   t think we have the definit answer to the question at this point
but we   re still work on it
bill  could you or dave remind us what share of the total outstand stock of mortgag consist of subprim or what share of the hous stock do we think is financ at the subprim level   my recollect is that the share is still small even though it has been a larg part of the recent flow
it   s quit a bit smaller share of total outstand becaus the averag life of the subprim mortgag loan  i   m told  is onli two or three year   in other word  if your credit qualiti improv  you will refin out of your subprim mortgag into a higher qualiti mortgag   so origin are    percent  but the actual number of subprim that are actual outstand is much lower
we report in ye day   s brief that subprim borrow constitut onli about    percent of all mortgag outstand
ex post subprim mortgag back secur seem to have been overvalu in the sens that they underes  default risk for some market segment   so the presumpt would be that such inform get taken on board and reflect in the price of new mortgag back secur and that it would translat into higher credit spread at the retail level   in your remark you seem to suggest that there is a chanc that this process of adjust might caus market not to work   i   m wonder what you meant by that
it   s not that market won   t work   it   s just the econom of origin subprim loan and sell them into the market would no longer work   in other word  at some point  if the actual capit market are not will to accept those subprim mortgag at the right price  then the abil of the person to origin the mortgag and sell them into the market goe away    now  would this wreck the market   well  it depend  becaus some subprim origin can carri these loan on their own book   but the industri is quit fragment  with a lot of these issuer not have the abil to carri these subprim loan on their book   so that part of the subprim origin market would go away   some of the monolin subprim origin would be unabl to exist if there weren   t a securit demand for those asset
so quantiti would go down
you could think of the situat as credit avail to that sector diminish  which could have feedback effect on price   that   s the risk
are there other question   we need a vote to ratifi domest oper
without object   we turn now to the econom situat  mr
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll wait for my colleagu to come to the tabl   we   ll be use the chart packag that you all should have on the econom outlook   separ the signal from the nois in the recent econom data has not been easi   what with the motor vehicl anomali  the defens spend pull forward  and the transitori swing in oil import   we tri to cut through the clutter by highlight in the  book real privat domest final purchas  or pdfp   that is  the sum of consumpt  residenti invest  and busi fix    materi use by mr     mr  wascher  and mr  gagnon is append to this transcript  appendix     invest   we think this aggreg  which is shown on line   of the tabl in exhibit    current is give a fair represent of the thrust of aggreg demand  the data that we have receiv sinc the decemb meet have been stronger than expect   as a result  we have revis up our es  of the growth of pdfp in both the fourth and the first quarter to annual rate of about   percent   rough the same rate as those in the middl two quarter of        the remain panel of exhibit   highlight some of the indic that have inform our judgment about the current pace of activ   start with the labor market  the middl left panel  increas in privat payrol employ averag         in the fourth quarter  close to the averag pace in the preced two quarter  as you may rememb  at the last fomc meet we comment on the stronger signal for activ come from the labor market compar with the spend data  that tension seem to have been larg resolv  not becaus of weaker employ but becaus of stronger spend   especi consumpt   retail sale increas brisk in novemb and decemb  accord  in this  book  we boost our es  of fourth quarter real pce growth  the middl right panel  to an annual rate of about     percent   the fundament for consumpt remain quit solid   steadi employ gain  recent declin in energi price that have rais real incom  well maintain consum sen ent  and further increas in stock market wealth   that said  at least accord to some of our model  the fourth quarter pace of consum spend was stronger than would have been consist with those fundament  our forecast for the growth of real pce in the first quarter  at     percent  reflect a bet that some of the surpris fourth quarter strength will carri forward for a while  turn to hous  sale of new and exist home   which are not shown in the exhibit   appear to have stabil in recent month  and the ratio of new home inventori to sale has move down a bit   as shown in the bottom left panel  the appar stabil of hous demand may now be start to show through to permit and start for singl famili home   of cours  the unusu warm weather in decemb make a definit assess at this  e particular difficult   in the busi sector  invest spend slow appreci in the fourth quarter   in particular  shipment of nondefens capit good  the red line in the panel to the right  have been unexpect soft recent  includ the decemb figur that we receiv after publish the  book   part of the recent weak in this categori appear to be for purchas of equip relat to construct and motor vehicl manufactur   with order remain abov shipment  we expect real equip spend to rise modest in the first quarter   exhibit   take a closer look at some recent develop  start with an examin of the effect on the industri sector come from the recent sharp declin in the product of light motor vehicl and residenti invest   by our reckon  product of light motor vehicl  the top left panel  tumbl near    percent at an annual rate in the third quarter of      and drop further in the fourth quarter   meanwhil  we es  that residenti invest  shown to the right  plung at an annual rate of about    percent in both the third and the fourth quarter   in think about the effect of these develop on industri product  we need to keep in mind the upstream effect   as note in the bullet item in the middl left panel  the drop in product of light motor vehicl affect ip not onli through it direct effect on light motor vehicl manufactur but also indirect through it influenc on product in upstream industri such as primari metal  tire  and  nowaday  semiconductor   in the case of construct  of cours  all the ip effect come through the influenc on upstream industri   lumber  concret  plumb fixtur  and so forth   the tabl to the right show the es  effect on ip growth  includ upstream effect  associ with the declin in the product of light motor vehicl and residenti construct illustr in the top panel   we have use input output relationship to es  the direct and upstream effect and then translat these effect into their ip contribut   line   and   show that  after we account for upstream influenc  motor vehicl and residenti construct were sizabl drag on ip in the third and fourth quarter   yet  as shown in line    the drag from those two sector was not the whole stori   even so  we think the more like track from here forward involv modest growth rather than a cumul weaken of industri activ  in part becaus we think that most produc have been move reason prompt to address ani emerg inventori problem   the bottom panel widen the scope from the industri sector to the economi as a whole and address the question of whether develop in less cyclic industri have been help support econom activ   my colleagu stephani aaronson divid the establish survey employ data into three categori   high cyclic industri  moder cyclic industri  and acycl industri   base on the correl of individu industri employ chang with the gdp gap   the bottom left panel present some histori  with the high cyclic group plot by the black line and the moder cyclic plot in red   to keep the chart easier to read  the acycl group is not plot   the chart show what you might have expect ex ant   fluctuat in both seri are high correl  but the amplitud of swing in the moder cyclic is more damp   the panel to the right put a microscop on the past few year   note the chang in scale   as you can see  despit the step down of employ gain in the high cyclic industri  employ in the moder cyclic industri has continu to grow apac   this suggest that the soft we   ve seen late in residenti construct and some part of manufactur has not spill over to other part of the economi   that conclus is an import factor that has shape our view about the longer run outlook for the economi   the subject of exhibit     as shown in line   of the tabl in the top panel  later this year the growth rate of real gdp is expect to move back up toward our es  of the growth rate of potenti  and it stay there in       this basic pattern is unchang from the last  book   the bullet in the middl panel highlight some of the major forc shape this project   the most import is our forecast that the restraint from hous will diminish this year and that it contribut to gdp growth will turn slight posit next year   second  the recent declin in oil price  plot in the bottom left panel  have rais real incom  we believ that the drag from the earlier increas in oil price should dissip in the near term  and over  e the s ulus from the recent price declin should begin to predomin   third  feder fiscal polici  the bottom right panel  also is a bit s ul  although the impetus is project to ebb over the next two year   final  given our condit factor  the assum path of the nomin feder fund rate is consist with a real fund rate that close the output gap over  e   exhibit   focus on the compon of pdfp   as i note earlier  the level off of home sale  the uptrend in mortgag applic  and the improv in homebuy attitud suggest that hous demand may be level off   the top panel show the histor relationship between hous demand  as measur here by sale of new home  the red line   and hous construct  shown here by singl famili hous start  the black line    the shade area highlight previous hous downturn as well as the current situat   as you can see  cyclic recoveri in sale and start have general been fair coincid histor   you   ll have to take my word for it  but this has been the case even when the inventori of unsold home has been high   accord  we think that the recent stabil of sale should be accompani soon by a stabil of start   then  as sale move up  so should start   the middl panel focus on the consumpt forecast   we expect real pce  the red bar in the left panel  to increas    percent this year and next   the forecast reflect two main crosscurr   on the one hand  real incom growth  the blue bar  is project to be robust  reflect  in part  continu increas in real wage as well as further employ gain   on the other hand  the wealth incom ratio  plot by the black line in the panel to the right  fall in our forecast as hous price appreci onli about   percent per year   with slower gain in wealth  and spend gradual come back into line with fundament after the current period of unexplain strength  the save rate should rise   the bottom panel present some detail on the outlook for busi fix invest   as illustr in the bottom left panel  total real outlay for equip and softwar  exclud the volatil transport equip compon  are project to increas about   percent both this year and next   you can see from the red portion of the bar that the bulk of the support come from spend for high tech equip as telecommun servic provid further expand their fiber optic network and as busi continu to invest in inform technolog equip and softwar   we expect the contribut from the other equip categori  the blue portion  to narrow this year and then to edg up in       larg reflect the pattern of chang in the growth of busi output   the bottom right panel show our forecast for nonresidenti structur exclud drill and mine   the incom inform on construct outlay for nonresidenti build and the forward look indic that we monitor suggest that spend growth has downshift   accord  after rise     percent in       real outlay for this compon of nonresidenti structur are expect to deceler to a pace of     percent this year   our project for      bring growth in this compon of nonresidenti structur down to it long run averag   bill will now continu our present
the top panel of exhibit   summar our assumpt about the suppli side of the economi   as indic in line    we assum that potenti output growth will edg down over the forecast period  from     percent in      to     percent in        this slow primarili reflect our assumpt about trend hour growth  line     which step down from about   percent last year to    percent in      becaus of a steepen downward trend in the labor forc particip rate and a gradual slow of popul growth   although we are comfort with these assumpt   and  inde  have not made ani chang to them in this project   we do see risk on both side of our point es    for exampl  as shown in the middl left panel  mani outsid forecast are base their project on a signific higher es  of potenti output   in some case abov   percent per year   we suspect that these differ  at least in part  reflect differ view about the under trend in the labor forc particip rate   the particip rate and our es  of it trend are shown in the middl right panel   as indic by the black line  labor forc particip has risen about    percentag point sinc it trough in earli        some forecast appear to have taken this increas as a signal of fa  labor forc growth go forward   howev  we see it as larg a cyclic respons to steadi employ growth and a tighter labor market  and we expect it to be revers in the near futur as the pace of hire slow and the under demograph forc show through   in part  our view reflect the fact that the particip rate tend to rise abov it trend when the unemploy rate is low   period in which the unemploy rate was below the staff   s es  of the nairu are denot by the yellow shade area in the chart  and the current gap between the actual particip rate and our es  of the trend   not appear to be outsiz relat to histor norm   in addit  as shown in the bottom left panel  the increas in the particip rate over the past coupl of year has been fuel by a rise in the percentag of individu who move direct from out of the labor forc to a job  this flow also exhibit notic sensit to labor market tight   that said  some group have behav differ than our model would have predict   on the one hand  the particip rate of older individu  shown by the red line in the bottom right panel  has risen steadili for some  e  present an upsid risk to our forecast   on the other hand  particip among teenag  the black line  has remain surpris low  and there are undoubt downsid risk to our forecast of an upturn for this segment of the popul   exhibit   describ anoth sourc of tension in the recent data that may have implic for our es  of potenti output   as shown in the top left panel  our standard     s law simul  the red line  suggest that the unemploy rate  the black line  fell more last year than would have been expect given our current es  of real gdp growth in        in the baselin forecast  we assum that an increas in the unemploy rate caus that gap to disappear gradual  an assumpt that   not seem unreason given that the error in     s law at the end of last year was within the bound of histor experi   howev  other interpret are possibl as well   one possibl is that current es  of real gdp underst econom growth last year   one piec of evid in support of this hypothesi is shown in the top right panel   we current es  that real gross domest incom rose   percent in       about   percentag point more than real gdp   as shown by the   line in the top left panel  if we replac real gdp growth with our es  of real gdi growth over the past year and re run the     s law simul  the actual unemploy rate in the fourth quarter line up veri close with it simul valu   an altern interpret of the recent error in     s law is that potenti output growth was weaker last year than we have assum   perhap becaus of a downshift in structur product growth   the middl and bottom panel address this possibl   as shown by the differ between actual product growth  the black line in the middl left panel  and a simul from our standard model  the red line   labor product deceler much more last year than the model would have expect   as shown in the panel to the right  a pure statist model base on a kalman filter would have respond to the incom data sinc march of last year by cut it es  of structur product growth by a full percentag point   in contrast  becaus we place less weight on the recent data that have not yet been through an annual revis  we have reduc our own es  by onli     percentag point   the bottom panel provid a coupl of reason for our reluct to lower our es  of structur product growth as much as the statist model would have lower it   first  as shown on the left  labor product in the nonfinanci corpor sector was quit strong last year   in part  the better perform of product in this sector reflect the fact that it output is measur from the incom side of the account and thus incorpor the differ between gdi and gdp note abov   in addit  this compon omit some sector that are notori difficult to measur   second  as shown on the right  a measur of product that exclud the residenti construct industri also held up fair well last year  suggest that much of the deceler in nonfarm busi product may be cyclic   as shown in the middl panel  all told we expect actual labor product growth to step back up to an annual rate of about     percent by the middl of this year as busi reduc the pace of hire in lag respons to the slower rate of output growth in recent quarter   the implic of this forecast for the labor market are shown in the top panel of exhibit     in particular  gain in nonfarm payrol employ   shown by the black line in the top left panel   are project to slow to about        per month by the second half of this year   this pace is somewhat below our es  of trend employ growth   the red line   as a result  the unemploy rate   shown in the top right panel   drift up to just under   percent  our es  of the current level of the nairu   to help gaug whether the es  gap between the unemploy rate and the nairu is send an appropri signal about the degre of tight in the labor market  i have includ some other measur of slack in the remain panel of this exhibit   as shown in the middl left panel  the job open rate from the bls   s jolt  job open and labor turnov survey  rose over the second half of last year to it highest level sinc earli        becaus the job open rate has such a short histori  it equilibrium level is difficult to es    howev  we can learn someth by combin the open rate and the unemploy rate to form the beveridg curv shown to the right   the curv is es  use data from the first quarter of      through the fourth quarter of       with the open rate on the vertic axi and the unemploy rate on the horizont axi   the relationship between job open and unemploy appear to have been fair stabl in recent year  which suggest that the nairu has not chang materi over that period  moreov  the latest data point is in the far upper left portion

 an earlier period when we thought that labor market were rough in equilibrium  also  as shown to the right  the capac util rate in manufactur remain a littl abov it long run averag level   exhibit   present the inflat outlook   despit our view that labor and product market are tight  other influenc on our inflat project have been more favor than we were expect at the  e of the last  book   perhap most notabl  the recent data on core consum price   shown in the top left panel   have been lower than expect   core pce price were about unchang in novemb and  base on the latest cpi read  we expect an increas of onli     percent in decemb   as a result  as shown in the second column of the tabl  we have mark down our es  of core pce inflat in the fourth quarter by    percentag point  to an annual rate of     percent   as shown in the top right panel  the lower path of oil price led us to revis down our project of consum energi price   these lower price direct pull down our forecast for total pce price  they also impli somewhat smaller indirect effect from energi cost on core price over the forecast period   as shown in the middl left panel  a higher exchang valu of the dollar in this forecast led us to reduc the project path of core nonfuel import price   the combin of these various influenc led us to shave our project for core pce price   line   of the middl right panel   by     percentag point in both      and       to     percent and     percent respect   as befor  the slight downward trajectori to core inflat reflect our project of wane indirect effect of the earlier increas in energi and other commod price  declin relat import price  and a deceler in shelter cost   in light of my earlier discuss of the risk to our assumpt about potenti output growth  the bottom panel present one altern simul from the  book  in which we assum both a higher trend for the labor forc particip rate and slower growth in structur product   specif  we calibr the simul so that overal potenti output growth was essenti the same as in the baselin forecast  but with structur product growth    percentag point weaker and trend hour growth    percentag point stronger   as shown in the

panel to the right show that yield spread on dollar denomin sovereign debt of emerg market countri have drop to histor low level   but emerg market  in the aggreg  have gone much further than just reduc their borrow   in recent year  emerg market have experienc record outflow of offici capit  the gold bar in the middl panel    these offici outflow are compos of the accumul of foreign exchang

net offici flow  the gold bar  relat to industri countri gdp  with negat valu denot net flow into the industri countri   the statist account do not report the destin of all these flow  but the avail evid suggest that the overwhelm major is destin for the industri countri   befor       net offici inflow or outflow from the emerg market had never exceed   percent of industri countri gdp   but sinc       thing have chang   net offici outflow from emerg market are now es  to equal     percent of the combin gdp of the industri countri  as shown in the panel  the  e of this unpreced increas in net offici flow correspond well with the puzzl declin in real short term interest rate in the industri countri  the   line  that persist long after industri countri gdp growth  the purpl line  rebound from the slowdown earli in this decad   the evid suggest that aggreg polici driven capit flow from the emerg market may be an import factor behind low real interest rate in the industri countri   moreov  low real rate are not limit to short matur instrument   the top panel of exhibit    show that ten year index bond yield are also low and have been for sever year in the major industri countri

  in canada  polici is expect to remain on hold   if these project prove to be the peak polici rate for this cycl  they will be the lowest cyclic peak for short term interest rate in these countri for at least forti year   nevertheless  we judg that these polici stanc are like to be consist with low and stabl inflat this year and next   the larg capit inflow and low real interest rate in the industri countri have contribut to rise hous price in mani of these countri   higher home price in turn have s ul hous construct   the top panel of exhibit    show that the extent and  e of the hous

again modest last year   despit lower hous price inflat  residenti invest has continu to rise toward histor high level   the relev of these foreign experi for the unit state is difficult to gaug  but they provid some support for larri   s forecast that the downturn in u s  hous is near over   in light of the signal from financi and commod market  as well as other real side indic  we project continu solid growth in the foreign economi at rate that are not like to strain resourc or to put upward pressur on inflat   as shown in the bottom panel  total foreign growth  line    is es  to have step down last year from     percent in the first half to about     percent in the second half  and it is project to remain around     percent over the forecast period   this project is about   percentag point stronger than the staff   s project for u s  growth  shown at the bottom of the panel   the foreign industri economi  line    overal are project to grow at about the same rate as the unit state  japan a bit slower  line     and canada a bit fa   line      the emerg market economi  line    are project to grow at near twice the pace of the industri economi over the forecast period   we expect that emerg asia  line    will continu to grow veri rapid and that latin america  line    will grow at a solid  though not except  rate   our forecast assum that the chines govern will take addit measur if necessari to reduc the growth rate of invest  and we project that chines gdp growth will be slower this year than last   but the risk to our growth forecast for china are probabl greater on the upsid   exhibit    provid an assess of what all these foreign influenc mean for the u s  economi   overal import price  the black line in the top left panel  fell sharpli last quarter and are project to continu to fall in the current quarter  primarili owe to the drop in the price of import oil   as oil price stop fall and begin to move gradual back up  overal import price inflat should turn posit  price of import core good  the red line   which exclud oil  gas  comput  and semiconductor  rose at a rate of near   percent in the middl of last year  primarili owe to sharpli higher price of nonfuel commod   with commod price project to stabil and with onli a small depreci of the dollar in our forecast  price of import core good should increas at a subdu pace over the next two year   the contribut of export and import to u s  gdp growth are shown in the lower panel   we now es  that the extern sector made a posit arithmet contribut to growth last year  the first posit annual contribut sinc       import growth step down from previous year as u s  gdp grew more slowli  export growth benefit from robust foreign econom activ  but export turn out even stronger than our model project   line   in the top right panel show that  for the first eleven month of last year at an annual rate  export of good grew      percent from the previous year in real term   line   through   show that three categori of capit good   aircraft  machineri  and semiconductor   contribut near half of total export growth   although it is possibl that bli  growth rate in export of these good may continu  we base our forecast on a return of export growth to a rate more consist with histor relationship   with the vast major of aircraft product be export in recent month and with aircraft factori run at high util rate  further larg increas in export from this sector  at least  do not seem like   return to the bottom panel  we project that the negat arithmet contribut of import  the red bar  to gdp growth will outweigh the export contribut  the blue bar  in      and      by about   percentag point  the black line    this project is driven by the histor tendenc of u s  import to grow at a much fa  rate than u s  gdp   in addit  the larger valu of import relat to export mean that  even if import and export were to grow at the same rate  the negat contribut of import would be greater than the posit contribut of export  the project strong growth rate of foreign gdp  discuss in your previous exhibit  are not larg enough to outweigh these factor over the next two year   on balanc  relat price have littl effect on net export over the forecast period  as the real trade weight dollar has move in a relat narrow rang over the past coupl year and is not project to move substanti over the forecast period   and now larri will complet our present
the final exhibit present your forecast for      and        i   ll be merci brief   the central tendenc show real gdp increas     to   percent this year and rough the same next year  with the unemploy rate hold in the rang of     to    percent dure both year   the central tendenc of your project see the core inflat rate fall   percentag point over the next two year   that conclud our prepar remark  mr  chairman   i   ll be happi to take your question
thank you   that was veri interest   i have a coupl of  question about your counterfactu   in exhibit    you look at the simul rate of unemploy  assum that gross domest incom is the true measur of output  and you find that unemploy fit     s law   but then below you also use gdi to measur product  you   re not do the same thing in both simul  right   if you assum that gdi measur output and use it to calcul both     s law and product  i think the puzzl come back   i think you just increas potenti output  and you   re back to where you start
that   s right   the potenti output measur are base on a gdp concept  and product in the nonfarm busi sector is the measur of structur product that we   re use for potenti gdp   the upper panel is just to illustr what might happen if  for exampl  the real gdp number for last year were revis up to show the same growth rate that gdi show now
okay   the other question is about exhibit    where you consid a simul with a declin in product and an increas in labor particip and you get a higher rate of core inflat   in that simul  the decreas in product and the increas in particip offset each other  on both the aggreg demand side and the aggreg suppli side  and the result is  of cours  that the unemploy rate  sn   t chang so that demand suppli balanc is unchang   i assum the reason you get inflat is that nomin wage are sticki  and therefor  as product slow  labor cost go up and firm can push them through   i guess i would question whether that   s realist  for two reason   one is that this increas in unit labor cost is clear temporari  and i think we tend to believ that longer increas are need to affect price   the other reason is that with the demand suppli balanc unchang  whi would firm be abl to pass through those cost in this scenario when they couldn   t rais price absent that increas in unit labor cost
well  real wage wouldn   t be differ  but the adjust could come either through flexibl nomin wage or fa  increas in price   in the frb us model  which is use to generat these simul  trend unit labor cost do caus an increas in the rate of price inflat  which is what you see here  and that help equilibr the labor market
for a given level of resourc util  you   re get more cost pressur  and you   re get more upward pressur on price   so it   s not a matter of their absorb all of it in their profit margin when they   ve got that increas in cost   you   re absolut right   in our basic framework  we don   t think that actual year to year unit labor cost influenc overal price set   it is in some sens a trend unit labor cost measur  and that actual was incorpor in frb us through a move averag or a set of lag   so there is still some upward pressur on trend unit labor cost come about through the slower product growth  some of which in essenc would be perceiv to be lower trend product
you also have to assum that the fed accommod with increas nomin gdp growth as well
thank you   are there other question for our colleagu  presid
just to follow up on your point and go to exhibit     about foreign gdp growth rate  which joe talk about   in term of ani pressur on unit labor cost that you see develop  i didn   t quit catch your statement  or i may have misinterpret it  but basic i thought i heard that these growth rate are not like to lead the inflationari pressur
that   s correct
so i would be curious as to what your observ is in term of trend unit labor cost in our import trade partner
actual  i   m not sure of the answer about unit labor cost per se  but these growth rate are close to what we think these countri can sustain without exceed their capac limit
so it   s a gap analysi
they are close to what we think their potenti rate are  and they don   t seem to be abov or below their potenti rate by veri much in the aggreg   there are a few except  of cours   argentina  perhap  and venezuela
presid  n
i want to see if i understood someth you said that pertain to exhibit      i think you said that u s  export were stronger than expect   stronger than the model would have predict in         even though growth abroad turn out to be quit strong   is that right
by about what order of magnitud   i   m just tri to determin whether this was realli signific or we   re talk about a tenth or two
well  the export contribut to gdp growth last year was about    percent  and i would have to check  but i   m guess that it might have still been zero if we hadn   t had this surpris   it would have been close to zero   i can check on that
well  you can let me know later
may i follow up on that
on the same chart  joe  i was wonder whether there is ani evid that the foreign demand for our export  that elast  is come into closer align with our demand for import   that differ has realli been drive the trade imbal  and i was look for littl clue that this wasn   t all special factor  that mayb they   re catch up to us in their appetit for import
this topic is actual close to my heart in term of research  and i wish i could say it was so and mayb it will be so    laughter   i thought it was so around       when we had realli strong export we couldn   t explain  and then it all went away with the recess of          and it   s onli now come back   but i look at a lot of other countri  and it   seem that you can explain these differ between export and import elast base on potenti growth rate   the one countri that seem to fit the worst is the unit state  and i have never understood whi the most import countri is the one that  sn   t fit   i won   t go into detail  but there are theoret reason to believ that  inde  you shouldn   t expect such elast to be structur differ
i have two question   the first is about our inflat forecast   we   ve discuss sever  e the basic question about whether the now prevail level of long term inflat expect in market is like to provid support for forecast of further moder or like to constrain the prospect for further moder in core inflat  my recollect of that discuss  although a littl hazi  is that expect might be a bit of a constraint   am i right in my recollect   has your view on that chang
well  your recollect is correct  i think   that was probabl just a hazi answer  not a hazi memori on your part   in some sens our basic view is that get to   percent is the gravit constant that we current see   we haven   t realli seen ani evid to suggest ani signific shift in that view in recent month   someth below that number  on a sustain basi  is harder for us to see   in some sens  implicit in this forecast is that  at the end of      and into an extend  book forecast  we get   percent without creat an output gap that would actual drag thing down further   then the question is how quick the dynam might be to take you to   percent   the view in our forecast is that the movement would be slow over the next two year   but one could imagin a fa  adjust  especi if it were aid by a stronger dollar and by weaker oil price   so there are reason for think that the adjust would be fa   but it   s also possibl that some of the recent incom data have given us a bit of a head fake   mayb we   re not quit as far along in the process of get back to   percent  and mayb we   re too op ist in that regard
this is a differ question for joe   your exhibit    describ broad trend in net offici capit flow from emerg market to the unit state and global real interest rate   has your view about the relationship between them chang   i thought we had sort of the convent view   the accept view within the system was a littl skeptic that there was much of an effect  and i didn   t think the research that look at the relationship between these two thing suggest that the effect was that larg   has your view about that chang  or is this exhibit consist with it
the relationship between the offici flow and the current account surplus
no  between offici flow and global   realli industri countri   real interest rate
peopl often talk about china   s reserv accumul affect u s  interest rate  but they are onli two countri in a big world and you may think that the unit state  europ  and japan have relat open financi market with a lot of mobil   if you look at all the industri countri togeth and the flow to all of them togeth  howev  mayb there   s less mobil between the industri countri as a group and the emerg market as a group   that might be more believ   that   along with the fact that these flow are big  even when you distribut them over all the industri countri   is what make me think that there may be an effect   that may rais a doubt in your mind   it   s not just to the unit state or just to europ  it is in the aggreg  to answer presid  n  it look to me   and i   ll doubl check with our expert   as though  accord to our forecast  our model would have predict negat real net export last year   so all the growth is a surpris
just to clarifi the respons   overpredict what
the posit contribut from net export last year  about    percentag point  is entir a surpris   in fact  it would have been negat  if i am read our model correct
so it was an upward surpris in term of what your model would have predict
i   m interest in the risk you see around the gdp growth rate in your forecast   i note a coupl of thing   first  some of the growth rate depend upon consum get the messag that they realli ought to be save for the futur instead of spend as they have been  i wonder whi they   d do that this year if they didn   t do it last year   second  i notic that  if you compar the  book gdp forecast with the central tendenc of the member of the committe  growth is a good deal slower       or     slower  which in this realm is a lot   i   m interest in how you see the upsid risk to this  particular given that  even with your slower growth rate  you get to zero output gap relat quick
let me first comment specif on our consumpt forecast and the larger question that we rais   dave may want to add some comment   with regard to our consumpt forecast  as i had mention and as we suggest by the altern simul that we show in part   of the  book  clear the unexplain strength that we   ve been see in consumpt spend in the second  third  and fourth quarter is an upsid risk to the forecast  we   ve carri some of that through into       as we note in the  book and i note in my brief  and we think that it will eventu correct   we base that forecast just on the histor pattern in the data   in the past when spend had gotten out of line with what we think of as be the fundament for consumpt  it eventu correct over  e   there are a coupl of possibl   one is that we   ve got the  e wrong and that the correct is go to take longer  in which case there would be more consumpt   anoth possibl   and this goe back to the point bill made   is that we could be wrong with regard to incom growth   that might be revis up  and we will find that a lot more incom growth is out there   now  take our forecast rather than the altern simul at face valu   yes  we are slower than the fomc   i suspect that part of the reason may be that the staff has a lower es  of potenti output growth than most member of the committe probabl have in their mind  we can   t know for sure  but i suspect that it probabl goe a good way toward explain the differ
you   ve got seven altern scenario there  if i recal correct
we were busi
yes  you were   all kudo to you guy   four of the simul have slower gdp  higher unemploy  and a lower fed fund rate   in a coupl of case you had  even in the context of slower growth and higher unemploy  somewhat higher inflat   then you have three or so that show stronger path   i   m wonder  do you weight these altern scenario equal   you know how dri  dri is the wrong name now  but i mean the successor compani    it   they give their baselin forecast a certain rate of probabl  and then they give altern rate of probabl to the various scenario   do you have a sens of that   would you weight the stronger consumpt scenario somewhat higher than the rest or no
i don   t think so   person  i could think of equal plausibl reason that we could get stronger aggreg demand growth or somewhat weaker aggreg demand growth over the next year   we highlight one possibl in the  book with regard to the weaker invest scenario   anoth could be the hous forecast   hous could turn out to be weaker than we   re forecast   so  on the aggreg demand side  i   d give them equal weight   with regard to the aggreg suppli side  i suspect there  too  the weight probabl is equal   it   s a littl harder for me to judg   i don   t know whether bill want to add someth
i think that   s probabl right
at the  e of the last fomc meet  we were feel as though the incom spend data were come in pretti darn close to our expect and were pretti consist with our stori about enter a period of below trend growth   as we note  and presid   quizz us about  the big fli in the ointment with respect to our stori was the labor market and it ongo strength   sinc then  as larri note  the spend data have move toward the labor market data rather than the labor market data move toward the spend data  the develop have certain brought into sharper focus the upsid risk associ with buoyant consum spend   if we made an import polici magnitud type error  it might be that the third quarter was just a period of low measur gdp growth but basic we haven   t move much below trend   i think that you would need to take that risk veri serious as you thought about the current set of polici  there are some critic reason for remain patient about whether  in fact  we have or have not move below trend   i think that we still haven   t seen the full effect of the hous shock that we had in the second half of        i suspect that we are go to see more of the employ effect associ with that go forward   i don   t think that we   ve seen the full multipli acceler effect of that  and we certain haven   t seen  if our es  econometr model are anywher close to right  the lag effect of the slow hous price and consum wealth that we think will be part of the reason for motiv a higher save rate   so we   ve rais the forecast  and we   ve rais it signific  but i don   t think we   re yet surrend the notion that this current set of polici can produc a period of modest below trend growth   now  i think that the upsid risk continu to be the labor market strength  as larri said  even given the overal dimens of the hous shock  we   ve been encourag about our stori of stabil   but i rememb that  as we went into the invest shock earlier in this decad  we just didn   t have enough imagin about how bad thing could get  and we kept think that we were see sign of slow or stabil  that the new technolog was still great  and that there should be reason or under motiv for invest  perhap what we   ve seen recent as stabil are the benefici effect of the drop in long term interest rate that occur from last summer into the fall and pull some peopl forward  but realli we may not have fulli made the adjust yet   the overhang of unsold home out there is veri larg  and we could be underes  the size and durat of that   so even given the recent stronger data on spend  i still don   t see all the risk on that side of thing   i still think there are some signific downsid risk that you ought to be at least concern about
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to follow up on vice chairman     s first question   on inflat   it seem to me that most of the factor that are lead to lower inflat in this forecast period are temporari   energi price  owner    equival rent  and import price   the longer term factor are the pressur in the labor market that we   ve talk about and mayb some follow through from the earlier accommod financi condit that we   ve had   as you said  chart   of the bluebook  when you look past the forecast period   sn   t show inflat come down   inflat actual goe up a bit with both the     percent target and the   percent target    sn   t this mean that expect have move up a bit when you see inflat go up in       and beyond
mani of the factor that you   re cite as temporari on the downsid regard inflat we see as have been temporari on the upsid regard inflat as well   the higher energi price and the pickup in import commod price were some factor explain how we got abov   percent  and their dissip is princip the reason that we go back to     now  for the extend  book scenario that we show in the bluebook  one reason for the upward pressur on inflat beyond the near term is that part of the construct of that forecast is an assum   percent depreci of the dollar that has to go on almost forev   so we have built in some upward pressur on inflat   we have to do that in the model simpli to begin make some progress on the extern balanc   whether that happen in       in       or tomorrow would be hard to say  but it is one reason that the pickup is not princip the dissip of the temporarili good factor   it   s realli more of that built in dollar depreci effect
so that   s a key variabl
to go back to what i said to the vice chairman  implicit in that long run scenario is a   percent inflat expect that is sort of peg inflat   obvious we could be serious wrong about that   we could also be serious wrong about the degre of resourc util in the economi right now   that   percent come about becaus we don   t have a big posit or negat output gap either now or go forward   if the nairu is more like     percent  then you might  in fact  make some progress in long run inflat expect   if the economi slow  you push the unemploy rate to   percent  and you get a bit of output gap  then you might get some good behavior there   anoth issu with which i know you   ve been grappl is that headlin inflat has been high in recent year   if that condit were to persist  it could lead to some deterior in inflat expect that might rais us from   to someth abov   go forward   we haven   t seen the evid of that in measur of inflat expect either from survey or from financi market  but that   s someth we   re watch to see whether or not our stori is right
thank you   i have a question that is relat to this issu  but it come out of the bluebook   i think i understand how this model is work  but then i get a surpris  and i realiz i realli don   t understand how it work   i notic in the bluebook that there was a jump of    basi point in the  book consist es  of the real fund rate   at the same  e in the model and the simul  you keep the fed fund rate constant  which would be slight below what that  book real rate might suggest   the unemploy rate remain somewhat below your nairu es   and yet you still have inflat modest declin   i   m tri to figur out how that work   is there someth that i   m not understand  or can you clarifi the mechan by which those thing fit togeth
well  i can speak to the  book consist measur  and perhap   will want to talk a bit about the simul of the bluebook   one thing that you have to keep in mind is that the  book consist measur of r  is the level of a real interest rate that would be requir for the output gap to return to zero in twelv quarter   in some sens  given that is what   s built into the  book forecast  the current level of the real interest rate is deliv that particular outcom   it   s not that we have those longer run es  of r   which are  in essenc  the monetari polici that is assum to return the economi to equilibrium over the next three year and then beyond that to stabil the economi   that   s a differ construct   the  book consist r  is answer a veri specif question that is of limit valu   those longer run simul give you a clearer pictur of where we think real interest rate would have to be to equilibr the economi over the longer haul  not just over the short run
the     percentag point increas in the  book consist r  is realli due to a collect of factor   in the model  the es  bond premium come down a littl  and the equiti premium came down over the intermeet period   that just mean you need a higher real interest rate to get the same level of polici restraint   also  they take the model and forc in the error to get the  book simul   effect the model is less enthusiast about the economi than the  book  and so the model error tend to rais r    as to whi inflat is come down  we do have the lag effect of the drop in energi price  inflat expect are contain  and the output gap is close
other question   presid
i   ll follow up on the question of vice chairman   and presid   about the gravit point of     percent   i rememb ask you about the nairu and get a respons that suggest i should think of a cloud of probabl surround that es   i   m essenti ask you for your character of the cloud you have in your mind around the idea that   percent is the number to which core inflat is go to have some gravit pull  what come to mind here is that vinc told us sever meet ago that   to     on core pce inflat was the rang that he thought expect were lie in  and tip number and survey number haven   t come down much sinc then as i recal   i am also interest in your commentari on the kind of technic adjust factor that travers the cpi  which the tip are base on  and the core   when you plot that  it move around a lot   so i   m wonder whether you have sharp view about that go forward or how you   d character your uncertainti about that factor in help us understand what the tip spread impli about gravit point
i   m not sure i have an empir base respons   we can actual es  from the model a confid interv around a paramet es  of the nairu  which as i indic  is wide  but i don   t have a similar thing for inflat expect   howev  i would argu that  if you just look at the confid interv around inflat forecast over the longer haul  they are pretti wide   obvious you control inflat over the longer haul   if you would tell me what your toler is for five year from now  given our abil on a year to year basi to forecast inflat  plus or minus   percentag point  actual inflat would fall plus or minus   percentag point around whatev you tell me your longer run inflat object would be   in term of the measur that we look at   and i think those probabl have not chang much sinc   present them in the bluebook a while back       percentag point is just on the differ in the measur alon  it is not actual a measur of uncertainti around ani individu measur   so it   s wide   i don   t know if you would want to add a confid interv around that
the interv are  no doubt  wide   in the materi we sent to you in octob  when you were talk about your inflat goal  a staff memorandum look at the gap between the cpi and the pce price index   from      to       the minimum is minus      and the maximum is       they do move around   we found in the regress that we report in the bluebook box that they   re not veri precis at all   the standard error were quit larg   so i think the answer is that we don   t have a measur of inflat expect that we could put much confid in
see that there are no further question  i propos that we start the econom go round   rememb  we do have the two hand option if anyon care to exercis it   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data on econom activ have been load with upsid surpris for most spend categori and also for labor market   our respons  like the  book  has been to boost our es  of growth last quarter and our forecast for growth this quarter   for      as a whole  we have revis up our project for real gdp growth about   percentag point  to about    percent  which is just a bit below our es  of the trend  which is a bit higher than the  book   this perform continu to reflect the so call bimod economi with weak in hous and auto coupl with strength almost everywher els  look beyond the first quarter  we interpret recent data as suggest that the drag from both weak sector is like to diminish  provid impetus for an acceler of activ later this year   even so  the  book forecast  and we agre  that other factor will like offset this acceler so that gdp will grow slight below trend in        in particular  the  book hypothes that the growth of consum spend will slow  with the save rate rise from minus   percent at the end of last year to plus   percent at the end of next year   this forecast strike us as quit reason   hous price appreci has slow dramat  and the impetus it has given consumpt should diminish over  e   in addit  the  book note  and larri emphas  that consum spend has grown more rapid than fundament can explain  and it   s sensibl to predict some unwind of this pattern   such an outcom  howev  would repres a notic chang in the trend of the save rate   so to me the possibl that the save rate will not  in fact  rebound to the extent anticip in the  book constitut a serious upsid risk to the outlook   of cours  the staff has emphas this  an altern simul in the  book illustr that if spend instead advanc in line with incom  the unemploy rate would declin notic further from a level that is alreadi low   it is precis becaus we are start from a situat in which labor market are alreadi arguabl tight that the upward revis to growth dure the intermeet period particular concern me   some period of below trend growth may ul  be necessari to address inflationari pressur eman from the labor market  in decemb  i emphas the puzzl present by the combin of an appar sluggish economi and a robust job market   upward revis to es  growth in the fourth and first quarter resolv a portion of that discrep   even so      s law still suggest that the excess demand in labor market as reflect in the low unemploy rate is abnorm larg relat to that in good market as reflect in es  of the output gap   the current low unemploy rate may turn out to have benign implic for inflat   for exampl  labor market tight may well diminish somewhat over  e  given that the lag between output growth and labor market adjust can be quit variabl   anoth benign possibl is that the unemploy rate may be overst the tight of labor market   for exampl  some indic of labor market condit  like the confer board index for job market percept  suggest a bit of soften   inde  avail index of labor compens do not provid compel evid of cost pressur eman from the labor market   howev  compens data are mix  and i must admit that the signal from them is somewhat confus  while i remain concern about the risk that labor market pressur could boost inflat over  e  i   m still fair op ist about the outlook for inflat overal   core inflat has come down in recent month  which is welcom  although we must be care not to overreact   recent favor data could reflect the dissip of pressur from energi price and owner    equival rent  these sourc of disinfl are inher transitori  and onc they are fulli work through the system  we will be left with the influenc of more endur factor  such as the extent of excess demand or suppli in labor and product market   if these market are  in fact  unduli tight  we could eventu see rise inflat   inflat expect also matter for the inflat outlook  and i see the stabil of inflat expect as contribut to a favor inflat prognosi   as i previous mention  my staff and other research find some evid that inflat has becom less persist over the past decad  a period dure which inflat and inflat expect have been low and stabl   both survey and market base es  suggest that longer term inflat expect remain stabl and well anchor  so to sum up  i continu to view a soft land with moder inflat as my best guess forecast  condit on maintain the current stanc of polici   we expect core pce price inflat to edg down from    percent last year to about   percent in        while there are risk on both side of the outlook for growth  i   m a littl more focus on the upsid risk after the recent spate of strong data   it   s encourag that the recent inflat news has been good   howev  there   s a great deal of uncertainti about inflat go forward  and to me these risk remain bias to the high side
thank you   presid
thank you   mr  chairman  some of my colleagu have told me they expect me to brag today becaus both team in the super bowl are from the seventh feder reserv district  but i assur them i would not do that    laughter
i notic that they   re not play in the seventh feder reserv district  though    laughter
some day we   ll have the super bowl at the seventh feder reserv district   but turn to the busi at hand  busi activ in our district continu to expand at a somewhat modest pace  but the tone of my busi contact was more posit than at our last meet   manufactur activ in the district is current a bit soft   the chicago purchas manag    index fell from      in decemb to      in januari  and this number will be releas tomorrow morn  mani of my contact are expect a signific pickup in activ in the second half of the year   we heard this from manufactur of build materi  agricultur equip  construct machineri  auto and steel  temporari help firm  and even from sever retail   though a number of manufactur thought that the recent soft was temporari and reflect the need to work off some modest inventori buildup  they said the final demand for their product remain solid   the steel industri is a good exampl of this kind of dynam   industri product has fallen sharpli sinc the summer  but when i recent talk to the head of a major steel compani  he note that demand from end user had remain quit stabl  and he expect it to stay that way   the product cutback were main the result of inventori fluctuat at the servic center  which buy bulk quantiti of steel to process and distribut to final custom   the analyst in the industri are divid on when this inventori correct will be complet  but even the pessimist think that it will be done by late spring   with the steadi demand from end use custom  my contact thought that product and price would definit be rise by the second half of the year   there was an articl in the paper today that mention that nucor is tri to rais price by     a ton in march  my auto contact had mix view about        last year was especi tough for the big three  high gas price shift sale from suv to car  and then the mix of sale shift from retail toward fleet sale  where their margin are lower   gm thought that gas price probabl have fallen enough to stabil the market share of light truck and that retail sale were now down near their long term trend level   ford was not as sanguin about either of these develop   final  the strength of foreign demand and the weaker dollar seem to be show through to increas export demand for a number of our district   s manufactur  and this situat support the comment in the chart show  the nation economi is clear show more under strength than we thought in decemb   moreov  the downsid risk scenario now seem less like   the hous market look to be near the bottom  and the spillov to other sector now seem like to be minor or is be offset by other posit factor   import  tight labor market and lower energi price are boost consum spend   we continu to expect that growth will be modest below potenti in the first half of the year  but like my busi contact  we expect activ to pick up in the second half and growth to be a touch abov potenti by        unlik the  book  this project is condit on market expect for interest rate  which impart some degre of accommod next year   so current i see the risk to the growth forecast as be fair well balanc   on the downsid  we could be wrong about the stabil in hous  and on the upsid  consum spend could remain robust or demand from abroad could acceler  overal  the recent data on inflat have been posit   as a result  the forecast from our inflat model are lower by a tenth or two   the model es  use data onli sinc      predict that core pce inflat will be flat at     percent through        so i   m less op ist about inflat than the  book   in my mind  there are two key question concern the inflat outlook   first  what happen in      and beyond   as we were discuss befor  in chart   in the bluebook  for whatev reason  inflat is move up  and i think that   s a concern   second  there   s the issu of longer run inflat expect   in the  book forecast  by the end of        inflat would have been at or abov    percent for a year and a half with no chang in the fed fund rate and a reason strong econom environ   i think market might interpret this inact as a signal that we   re satisfi with    percent inflat  not the   percent to   percent comfort zone that mani of us have said we prefer   this view was share by the particip at our recent gather of academ and busi economist   we have an advisori committe that meet a few  e a year  inde  sever academ thought we were alreadi at this point   in their mind  the current polici stanc and inflat pictur reveal that we were satisfi with inflat stabil at or a bit abov   percent   the busi economist also were predict that we would find ourselv in the posit of need to increas rate some  e this year in order to put inflat on a pronounc downward path
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   trend evid in the district economi for some  e fundament are continu   specif  employ is increas moder and steadili  most compon of aggreg demand are expand  and i would note  in particular  strength in nonresidenti construct   there has been no signific acceler of inflationari pressur or of wage pressur   the hous sector is subdu  but the district data on sale and start suggest stabil  as do the nation data   the data on the inventori of unsold home perhap are contradictori to that statement becaus there are still a lot of unsold properti  at least those data suggest that it will be some  e befor there is ani pickup in hous activ   in ani event  as bill   mention  mortgag delinqu and foreclosur are rise  albeit start from a fair low level  and though that probabl won   t have a signific effect on econom perform  it could be a polit issu in minnesota and elsewher in the district  as far as the nation economi is concern  it seem to me that the incom data over the past sever month underscor a coupl of thing   first  the data demonstr  again  the under resili of the economi   second  they bol  the case for sustain growth over the next year or more  accompani by steadi to diminish core inflat   let me elabor briefli on those observ   the economi appar grew better than   percent in real term again last year  despit the signific run up in energi price  the appreci declin in hous activ  and problem in the domest auto industri   as i think about the prospect for        i see littl in the broad scheme of thing to suggest that overal real growth over the next year will be much differ from that over the past year or  for that matter  much differ from that experi from       through         it also seem to me that our earlier concern about the possibl of a further acceler of core inflat have diminish  larg on the basi of the incom inform on inflat  therebi through the process of elimin heighten the outlook for steadi to declin core inflat   i actual think that case is pretti good  part becaus some of the factor that boost core inflat were transitori and part becaus inflat expect  as best i can judg  have remain well anchor   that   s the messag i get  at least from financi market  from labor market  and from convers with our director  other busi peopl  and so forth   so for me  overal the near term to medium term outlook both for real growth and for inflat is construct  i   ll stop there
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   the new england region economi continu to grow at a moder pace with relat slow job growth  low unemploy  and moder measur price trend   consum and busi confid is solid  and while retail contact report an uneven holiday season  manufactur were general upbeat about busi prospect   skill labor continu to be in short suppli and expens   in everi one of the new england state  there is concern over the long run prospect for labor forc growth  given their mutual low rate of natur increas  out migrat of    to    year old  and depend on immigr for labor forc growth   new england is an expens place in which to live  and concern abound about how to attract and retain the high skill worker that are need for it high preponder of high valu ad industri   obvious  there   s noth new or particular cyclic about the forego comment   but i   ve been to quit a few begin of the year    let   s take stock of thing    confer in all the state recent  so perhap i   ve becom more impress than usual by the medium term to long term challeng face the region   in the short run  howev  the posit overal trend of the region economi   seem to be a power offset to the continu declin in real estat market   at our last meet it seem as though new england   s real estat problem was more signific than that in the rest of the countri   but now it appear that both are similar affect whether one look at price  sale volum  inventori growth  or declin construct   as with the nation as a whole  there are sign of stabil  but at least in new england  make ani judgment about the immin reviv of real estat market in midwint is foolhardi at best  on the nation scene  the data have been more upbeat sinc our last meet   appar the holiday season was a bright one  with consumpt like grow at a pace of more than   percent in the last quarter   that   s remark strong given the continu declin in residenti real estat and proof   to reiter what presid  n said   that the u s  economi continu to be unusu resili   support consumpt are tight labor market  lower energi price  tighter though still reason accommod financi condit  strong corpor profit and some sign of reviv in busi spend after declin relat to hous and motor vehicl expenditur  and continu strong foreign growth   even inflat has moder a bit  with three month core price increas in both the pce and the cpi trend down   our forecast in boston and that of the  book are virtual indistinguish   the last quarter of       was stronger than expect   the first quarter of this year will be slight better as well  but after that  the trajectori remain the same as it has been for the past two or three meet   an increas pace of growth in       and       as the hous and motor vehicl situat unwind  a slight rise in unemploy  and a fall in core pce inflat to near   percent by the end of the forecast period   in mani way  this is the definit of perfect  a forecast that is seem get better each  e we make it  with growth a bit higher  unemploy a bit lower  and inflat eb slight more   the under mechan that produc this outcom are relat straightforward  but i wonder whether we should have a heighten sens of skeptic about such a halcyon outlook   let me focus on two reason for such skeptic  first  all other thing be equal  inflat could be less than well behav   one reason that inflat eb in earlier forecast was that slower growth brought about a small output gap and rise unemploy   now  the output gap is virtual elimin  and unemploy remain below   percent   eb inflat is sole the product of recent favor inflat read  which are assum to persist   lower energi price  declin import price  and fall shelter price   it   s hard to tell at this point whether the recent read on core inflat are the result of fundament lower inflat pressur or just luck or mayb a combin of the two   i think a similar rang of uncertainti appli to oil price and the strength of the dollar   with virtual no output gap  it seem to me that  while the baselin best guess might be lower inflat  for all of the reason discuss in the  book one should approach that analysi with some caution  second  demand could well be stronger   the baselin forecast assum that consum somehow get the messag some of us have been tri to deliv about the need for an increas in privat save   the save rate move from a negat   percent to a posit   percent  the highest save rate in sever year   as i note befor  i have to ask myself whi this is like to happen over the next come month when it hasn   t in the wake of the hous situat in        clear  the downturn in residenti real estat  an import polit issu in all our district and certain devast for subprim borrow in particular  hasn   t affect consum spend in general   in fact  household net worth as a share of dispos incom remain quit high  buoy in part by a like overes  of real hous valu but also by rise equiti market   the  e of the need increas in the person save rate could well be further out in the futur  creat some version of the buoyant consum altern scenario instead of the baselin   again  with no output gap  the potenti for increas inflationari pressur is obvious  in sum  the  book forecast remain in my view the most like baselin   there are downsid risk  as i mention befor  for the seven altern scenario do anticip some downsid risk  but if the hous situat is begin to stabil  i find it hard to believ that broader anxieti about it will affect busi spend or the consum as some of these scenario contempl   the bigger risk may well be that busi spend pick up in light of consum strength  unemploy stay low  growth exceed our current project  and resourc pressur becom more intens   i am concern that risk to inflat have grown somewhat sinc our last meet   i think i   m still in a    wait and see    mode  as i do believ there are downsid risk to the evolut of hous market   but if the  book growth forecast is right  the best risk manag on our part may have to be to seek tighter polici sooner rather than later
thank you   presid    just to clarifi  i think that the forecast of consumpt is not base on the idea that the save rate has to rise   rather  consumpt is model use under determin  like incom and wealth  and an endogen indic of that is that save rise
anyway  you gave the impress that higher save was itself someth that was go to happen natur
as i look at the forecast in the  book  the higher save rate   money out of incom that   s expect to be there go into save   is one element that make consumpt lower than it would otherwis be
but the save rate is not drive the consumpt forecast  rather  the consumpt forecast is drive the save rate
in the forecast  yes
well  mr  chairman  first on our cheaper  more afford  and perhap luckier eleventh district economi  we es  that employ growth ran at a rate slight greater than     percent last year and our output growth exceed   percent   we do see some possibl slow  but there is still veri strong momentum in the texa economi and to an extent in the new mexican economi  despit a lower rig count  what i   m about to talk about is not base on the buoyanc of the eleventh district economi but on my talk with ceo as well as the econom project of our own staff   i   ve talk with twenti five ceo for today   s discuss   i   ve ad two  and just for the record they are the ceo of disney and the ceo of ma card  first  my retail contact  with one except  report a pickup in dollar volum and foot traffic that began with the second half of decemb and has continu   as a result  the wal mart ceo for the unit state is much more op ist and is now forecast volum expans of about   to   percent   my contact from jcpenney  which is in an incom rang that is doubl that of wal mart  report a similar pattern of behavior that start the friday befor christma and has carri forward and say that the consum    feel good about the economi      the one except  incident  is   eleven  and i would be upset  too   tobacco constitut    percent of their sale  and texa just levi a     tax on a     carton of cigarett   otherwis  the retail seem to be much more op ist than they were when i last report   a not unimport factor in this report has to do with the phenomenon of gift card   in the public releas of safeway is an interest piec of data   their gift card busi  which is call blackhawk  grew     percent last year and drop      million to the pretax bottom line   wal mart report   and this is not yet public inform   a peak gift card balanc for this season of      billion   now  mind you     percent of the card use occur befor februari     so this busi has extend the retail season  and it may well have affect the buoyanc that i   m hear from retail in term of their current activ  ma card confirm the pickup in consum activ  particular that it began late in the christma season  and it ceo report from his contact certain much less    nois    about a possibl recess and see that risk abat   just to jump forward  we forecast  base on econom research  econom growth in our district of     percent for       which is what ma card happen to be project   so i found that ceo to be instant credibl   disney report extrem strong advertis growth   they expect the year over year growth to be    percent in term of their first quarter network advertis  with strength in everi sector except for auto  accord to the ceo  they also report record foot traffic at their park over the holiday   in contrast  up report a weak start to decemb but a strong finish in the last seven day of the year  with year over year number for januari not as robust as expect   run around   percent   the rail also report a bit slower volum  as the ceo of one of the larg rail compani said   there are clear shift take place  for exampl  lumber shipment of union pacif and burlington northern are down    percent year over year  reflect the falloff in the construct of home   both ceo caution that compani year over year number are like compar appl and orang  given the robust growth in the first quarter of        i did talk to two of the top five hous ceo and a third one  a smaller compani  they seem to confirm the sens of the staff in that they feel that the hous situat is bottom out  but they continu to caution that ani read of the hous industri between thanksgiv and the super bowl is of question valu
the one with two team from the seventh district   laughter
yes   but here are some data to put this statement in perspect   the contact from the largest compani report that cancel rate  which were run at    percent in their most stress market  particular in california and florida  have come back to    to    percent   relat good news   one aspect worth note is that they are get relief from their subcontractor   they es   on averag across the industri  about    percent cost relief   anoth predict behavior pattern becom manifest is that the larg contractor with veri strong balanc sheet are look to buy the distress smaller contractor      i agre with you that we haven   t seen all the downturn in hous yet in term of it effect on the economi  but we may well come out of it with an even more tight consolid industri   the bottom line on growth from the eleventh district perspect is a wagnerian summat   that is  the economi   s growth dynam is not as bad as we thought it was sound when we last read the score   i would summar it by say that the tail in term of the risk of recess has becom much slimmer  howev  my conclus is the opposit with regard to inflat   that is  on reflect and work with our staff and listen to ceo  i think the tail in term of risk of higher inflat has fatten  and this is reflect in sever report   just veri quick   becaus of my australian dna   anheus busch decid to rais beer price   to   percent at year end   that  sn   t bother me   what bother me is the price of skill worker who drink that good beer in term of what   s happen for wage and total compens of skill and unskil labor   you know that i have talk about the massiv project that texa util plan for coal to gas convers and whether they get the so call dirti dozen that they   re plan or just a hand   i did go over with the ceo the studi that mckinsey  bcg  and bechtel have provid for them  and some interest data point came out that i want to summar   in the summer of        they es  that all in labor cost for these plant  which they es  per plant  would take     million worker hour at        an hour   today they don   t believ they can get the job done for less than     an hour  and becaus of worker qualiti issu  they now believ it will take     million worker hour for each plant   so if you have a    percent per hour increas and a    percent increas in hour  one wonder about the abil to see a short term reduct in skill and unskil labor cost   these number  by the way  take into account the recent slippag in oil rig activ  which is down for the fifth straight week  and also the slowdown in hous and some initi slowdown in commerci construct   it dovetail with report like that of bp   s to us that they decid to pay all their salari oper  to whom onli two year ago they were offer incent packag to leav          bonus per year for the next two year to stay   fluor   s ceo report that they are have the largest year in their histori of hire colleg graduat  and the     mechan who work for a larg truck dealer with which i regular talk are now fetch     an hour  anoth piec of data come from a studi by mckinsey and bcg  and i want to talk about it veri briefli in term of the intermod transport system of our countri   the shipper tell me that port congest is veri high   the fleet util rate is run at about    percent   you know that i like to talk about panamax ship rate becaus of their size and liquid   price have not eas sinc we last met  and the interest factoid is that the ten year old fleet is avail for purchas at the same price as the fleet expect to be deliv two and a half year from now  these ship run     million apiec befor their add on  which tell you that there   s a short term tight   if you talk to the rail and the effect two oper   there   s realli a duopoli in this countri between burlington northern and union pacif   their price is base on opportun cost becaus they do not forese the abil to expand their network   this may well facilit an upward price spiral as all the infrastructur project current on the draw board begin  whether txu   s or some other liquefi natur gas compani    project that we have heard about  a coupl of other point with regard to inflat that i think bear watch   these input are anecdot  but i think we have a pretti good survey in term of the oil and gas oper   most of the major oil and gas oper would not be surpris to see     oil and to see a rang between     and     oil   that fit with the brown ycel model that we develop in dalla   and for natur gas price to eas to a level of about    in the spring   that   s the good news  i want to mention two other negat news item   one was refer to earlier  and that regard corn price   the price for corn was       a bushel last year  if you look on the graph that bill  i think  present earlier   corn is now run       a bushel  and the food product compani we talk to project the price to be       by the end of the year   now  this is good for farmer   it   s good for   deer   it   s not good if you rais a chicken  a cow  or a pig  and it   s certain not good if you   re a human who eat at whataburg  one of my other new contact   i won   t use the languag that the ceo use  but he report that his margin are come under pressur  the second develop may be a bit more disturb  it concern the cost of import good from china into wal mart   s network   accord to wal mart   s ceo for intern oper and their vice chairman  chines import price into wal mart   s network were depreci at an annual rate of between   and   percent   recent  howev  the rise in china   s labor cost for their supplier net of the increas in product is lead to import price cost that are increas at a rate of approxim   percent   to me this develop rais an issu that i think presid   touch on regard our view on inflat and perhap rate go forward  which we   ll talk about tomorrow   at home  we   re see unaccept high and sustain wage develop for certain critic compon of labor  which i mention earlier   abroad from germani to china  we   re see econom growth rate that are well abov sustain trend  which is whi i ask the question about your gap analysi earlier   my own staff calcul that  if you do a gap analysi   that is  if you compar current growth to what they es  trend growth to be   there is no signific inflationari pressur   howev  if you analyz capac util rate in the g  countri and in the bric  we are get closer  given the econom growth that has been experienc  to more heavili use capac and to ignit inflationari pressur    the bottom line for inflat from our perspect is that what was onc a tailwind generat by global may be closer to becom a headwind than our model indic and our limit understand of the effect of global otherwis lead us to understand   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    just a quick question   i couldn   t quit gather whether you were say that commerci construct is overal slow   you mention that onc  but then you talk about a varieti of project
it appear to be slow in certain area and in our district but is nonetheless run at a stout rate   it seem to have come off somewhat but  given the larg project that are plan  the number work out to show increas pressur on the labor that   s avail to construct those project
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i have the sens that sinc our last meet we   ve receiv a wealth of data but not necessarili a wealth of inform   between the data that have come in and the convers that i   ve had with my district contact in the past six week  i   m a littl more confid about the outlook for real growth  and i view the inflat outlook as unchang   hous is an exampl of have more data  but not necessarili more inform  though some aspect of the residenti hous data have been encourag  neither futur on hous price nor report that i have receiv from peopl in the busi suggest that the slowdown in that sector will end ani  e soon   despit that  it still look as though the spillov to consum spend and financi market have been limit   at our last meet  there was also some uncertainti regard the health of the manufactur sector   for the most part  the intermeet data have been favor for the manufactur sector   the industri product number  for exampl  have been strong  but manufactur employ remain flat  the usual stori that make sens of these dispar trend is the continu strength in manufactur product   but i   d like to mention anoth element in the pictur   other have mention it this morn   and that   s the skill mismatch   my director and busi contact in the manufactur sector tell me that they have job avail but that they face great difficulti in fill those job becaus they can   t find peopl with the right skill   interest  as was mention in the staff present earlier  the jolt data show open as rise  and that   s also true in the manufactur sector   open have been rise over the past two year   this news realli isn   t so good per se  but it   suggest that at least some of the sluggish in manufactur job growth is come out of the structur element in the labor market and is not pure a cyclic declin in aggreg demand   in a somewhat relat vein  accord to the nation associ of colleg and employ  colleg placement are up    percent this year  the strongest show sinc        the stori is that relat high profit and good busi prospect are drive up demand   we also understand from the ohio governor   s offic that last year  although sale tax receipt were lower  incom tax receipt were stronger than expect  these bit and piec combin with some of the posit news in the aggreg data report in the past coupl of month make me somewhat less worri about the downsid risk to econom growth than i was at the last meet   i don   t want to go overboard on this   i had that feel sever  e last year onli to be subsequ move in the other direct   it is hard to tell whether some of this good news has been relat to weather   that is  some spring activ might have shift into the fourth quarter  on the inflat front  both the offici data and the anecdot stori from my contact continu to provid some encourag that core inflat will moder over the next year  but the data are not yet entir convinc   my staff has note that for most of       especi in the later half of the year  the growth rate of individu cpi compon exhibit a bimod distribut   on an expenditur weight basi  most compon were either fall in price or rise at a troubl rate   veri few cpi compon were rise at a pace that the cpi tell us is about averag   this pattern is high unusu  and i don   t know what to make of it  except to say that it   make it more difficult to tell which way the inflat trend is lean  my onli materi differ of opinion with the staff baselin project concern the assumpt about labor suppli   economywid  there is some reason to think that aggreg labor suppli is more abund than the  book baselin contempl   labor forc particip rate for most demograph group have been run stronger than the staff has been expect  indic that the growth of potenti output could lie somewhat abov the  book es   that   s what i am assum  and therefor i get a slight better combin of output and inflat   in the end  my outlook for the economi hasn   t chang   the general contour of the forecast for a modest slowdown in growth coupl with a veri gradual declin in core inflat make sens to me   howev  i have lower just slight my assess of the risk that real growth will fall short of my project  and i have not chang my risk assess of inflat   there   s still a notabl risk that year over year chang in inflat might remain stuck where they are today as oppos to drift down half a point or so over  e as i would prefer   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the third district have continu to evolv much as they have for most of the past sever month   econom activ is still expand   i think i can use the word    moder      i don   t think anybodi els has use that yet  and our contact expect the pace to be maintain in the come month   there has been littl chang in the pattern of activ over the sector   retail in our region indic that their holiday sale were about as they expect or somewhat better   hous continu to weaken at a somewhat order pace  but there are sign of stabil of demand   inventori has remain elev  and construct continu to declin   howev  the weak in residenti construct is be offset by continu strength in nonresidenti construct   offic vacanc rate continu to declin in philadelphia and in the near suburb as well   the net absorpt of offic space has increas for the past twelv quarter   manufactur activ in the region hit a soft spot in the fall  as i indic in previous meet  but our most recent busi outlook survey  in januari  present somewhat posit but also somewhat mix signal   the general activ index return to posit territori with a read of plus    indic a slight increas in manufactur activ  and there was a signific rebound in shipment   new order  howev  remain close to zero   that   s somewhat of an aberr becaus new order and shipment tend to move veri much togeth  and so there are some inconsist there  which is whi i said the situat is a bit mix   accord to our survey  howev  the firm expect a rebound of general manufactur activ and order over the come six month   inde  most of our busi contact see moder growth in the region continu for the forese futur   their posit attitud are consist with the recent posit news we   ve had about condit in the nation   firm remain concern about their abil to hire both skill and unskil labor   labor market are tight for mani of the reason that presid   describ in new england  we have some of the same thing go on in the third district  regard nation condit  the unusu warm weather in decemb may have temporarili buoy some of our number  but base on incom inform  i   ve becom increas confid that the nation economi has a posit under momentum   at the  e of our last meet  there was a contrast between the mix data on consumpt and product and the relat strong indic from the labor market   the pictur that appear to be emerg from the latest econom inform is one of stronger under growth that has been temporarili weaken by hous and auto   there is littl  if ani  evid that the hous and auto correct are spill over into the other sector of the economi   we   ve been look for those spillov for the past six month and have yet to see ani signific evid that they are occur or are about to occur   of cours  spillov may yet materi with a long lag  but that likelihood to my mind is diminish as we have begun to see some hope sign of stabil in hous   labor market condit remain firm  and manufactur indic improv in decemb as did capit good order   although i didn   t talk to the chairman of disney  i did talk to a small manufactur firm with total revenu that come to    million   he has been veri posit about the outlook   his sale depend a lot on construct  and he said that  after the most miser august and septemb he had ever seen in his twenti year of run the busi  the pickup began in late novemb  continu through decemb  and has continu into januari as well   other contact from bank  particular credit card issuer to whom i   ve talk  suggest that bank are see number come across their book on credit card purchas continu to be strong even after christma   so that also is good news  all of this suggest that the downsid risk to growth have reced sinc our last meet   i believ this is the market   s assess as well  as expect of futur polici firm   my outlook is that the economi will return to trend growth  which i put at about   percent this year  and will continu at that pace into        of cours  as everybodi has indic  that   s a littl stronger than the  book   s outlook  and it is  again  base on my view that potenti growth or trend growth is somewhat higher than the  book has state   i expect the unemploy rate to rise slight  mayb to     percent by the fourth quarter of this year  and then to stabil into next year   i think this is go to be accompani by employ growth of near   percent  and again  that   s what account for the differ in the trend growth  i anticip a declin in core pce inflat of about     percent by        i would like to underscor that this forecast is not driven by a lower pass through of oil price  which have declin   my read of the empir evid  includ work done by some peopl on the philadelphia staff  is that it   s veri difficult to attribut movement in core inflat of six month to twelv month or longer period to chang in oil price   in fact  there   s grow empir evid that neither movement in oil price nor phillip curv type factor signific improv our root mean squar error forecast of core inflat two or more quarter ahead   i note that this refer to forecast of six month or longer and not to short run high frequenc movement   this suggest that we should be care in the languag we use describ the reason for our project of futur inflat to avoid perpetu view of inflat process that we can   t empir substanti  in my view  core inflat will not come back down until monetari condit  which i believ have been veri accommod over the past few year  have tighten suffici   the  book forecast has a slight smaller declin in core pce inflat to about   percent in       but incorpor a less restrict monetari polici than i believ is like to be appropri given my view of the strength of the under economi and of the fundament that we are see   inde  over the past two meet  my feel was that the slowdown in econom activ that we might be see  combin with a constant fed fund rate  might have been enough to bring inflat back to a more accept level   now i   m less convinc that price stabil will be achiev without further action on our part some  e later this year   but i will leav that discuss to the polici go round   thank you
mr  vice chairman
i   m not sure i understand your think   you said that you expect what sound like a pretti signific moder in core pce  but that   s on a monetari polici assumpt that impli further tighten
that   s right  somewhat tighter  somewhat more aggress than what   s in the  book
though i don   t want to pin you down  that sound sort of modest   you are say that with anoth    basi point you   d get what core pce inflat over the forecast period
the path i was think about as i was do the forecast and tri to determin the appropri polici here   my desir is to get inflat down lower  and that   s reflect in my forecast   is one in which the fed fund rate goe up somewhat from where it is today  perhap to     or    percent   but then by the end of       and into        it   s come back down again to more of a steadi state level  and then we can talk about what the real neutral rate is
just in order of magnitud   if we did anoth    or    basi point and there were some sort of associ chang in overal financi condit so that that was reinforc  you   d get a core pce inflat forecast that would go how far down   would it go to
well  there   s some uncertainti about that   i think it would get to between     and   percent
thank you   it   s        whi don   t we take a fifteen minut coffe break   coffe break
would you come to order  pleas   thank you   we are readi to recomm with the go round   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman  now that i have everyon   s attent   laughter  i   m go to start with some inform on the district and then talk briefli about the nation economi from my perspect   let me begin by say that the district   s activ did slow over the second half of      in line with the nation economi itself   the slowdown was most appar in hous and manufactur   howev  the most recent data that we have from novemb and decemb indic a pickup in some of the activ   moreov  report from our director and our busi contact suggest a consider degre of op  among them go forward  more than we expect actual   one area in which we are see sign of improv is hous itself  while new construct activ   remain subdu in our region  sale activ has pick up  and the inventori situat appear to be improv in our major market   nonresidenti construct remain strong and is offset some of the weak on the residenti side   district employ growth has risen in recent month  and labor market remain tight for us   in addit to continu shortag of skill worker in a larg number of technic and profession area  we have recent receiv report that the hospit and recreat sector are experienc difficulti in find lower skill worker as well   we have also receiv numer report from director in district busi indic higher year end wage and salari increas  the situat in agricultur is somewhat mix   the sharp increas in crop price  especi corn  driven by export of ethanol and export of corn itself  have caus the usda to boost es  of      farm incom rather signific   howev  higher crop price are also erod profit of livestock produc and processor in our region  which is a fair import sector  one import sector in which activ appear like to slow in      is energi   the district economi has benefit tremend over the past few year from the rise in energi price  which has spur increas product of tradit product   and that includ oil  gas  and coal   as well as altern fuel like ethanol and biodiesel   accord to report from a coupl of our director  howev  the recent declin in energi price has alreadi led to a reduct in drill activ and is like to caus some cutback in new invest in altern fuel as well  turn to the nation outlook  i  like other  have note the recent strength in the economi and have rais my es  of growth for the fourth quarter and somewhat rais them for the first quarter   i continu to expect growth to rise over      modest toward what i think is potenti  in the neighborhood of   percent   howev  now i expect it to occur a littl more quick than i did at the decemb meet   accord  recent econom inform has led me to reassess the balanc of risk to the outlook   i believ the downsid risk from the further slow of hous have diminish somewhat   moreov  i share the view that the recent weak in manufactur activ reflect a better balanc of product and inventori rather than a fundament weak   go forward  the improv outlook for energi price should support consum spend by improv consum    dispos incom  and we may see addit fiscal s ulus result from the more favor budget posit of the state and local govern  final  in term of the inflat outlook  my view have not chang materi sinc the last meet   i   ve been encourag by the recent inflat data  and i continu to expect inflat to declin over the forecast period   i expect the core cpi to be in the     percent rang and core pce inflat to be about   percent for        howev  as other have note  core inflat is too high  and consider uncertainti remain about whether the recent progress will be sustain  particular  it is not clear how the oppos trend of lower energi price and greater resourc pressur may play out over the next few quarter   consequ  it seem to me that there is upsid risk to the inflat outlook   thank you
thank you   presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i   d focus a littl more today in my comment on the state of florida as it relat to the hous sector   we   ve heard a lot more posit comment in just the past few minut about hous   so let me offer a contrarian view  if you will  florida account for about    percent of our district employ and   percent of overal u s  employ   as for hous  florida repres   percent of u s  home sale in      and   percent in      as sale and construct continu to declin   to put these number in perspect  singl famili exist home sale in florida have drop    percent sinc januari      versus an    percent declin in the unit state as a whole   anecdot report are that builder are continu to work down exist inventori and are not start new project   in most area of the state  start have fallen even more than sale  which should lessen the run up in hous inventori over the immedi futur   permit issuanc for singl famili home is down    percent in florida sinc januari      compar with    percent in the nation as a whole   there are certain encourag sign from report note  as mention earlier  that buyer traffic is better in some area  and sever of the build contact that we spoke with expect or  perhap i would note more accur  are hope that new home sale will improv by the second quarter of       home price have declin modest but remain well abov the level impli by the pre      trend in most area   this place hous afford at a relat low level by histor standard   as i note at previous meet  the demand in coastal market is be constrain by the steep rise in homeownership insur that has caus month hous cost to rise sharpli  even as hous price moder   we   ve heard report that in market where price acceler the most in recent year  such as south florida  employ are struggl to recruit staff becaus of the high hous cost  with some firm elect to leav south florida and other begin to convert corpor own land to corpor hous just so that they can recruit employe   as i report at our last meet  the declin in hous activ continu to have a negat effect on hous relat sector specif in the south becaus of our concentr in the carpet and other relat industri   hous relat employ is no longer a net contributor to year over year employ growth in the unit state  even though overal job growth has remain veri firm  district bank report that credit qualiti has soften but remain at veri strong level  howev  bank are begin to be a bit more vocal in express concern with regard to the possibl that builder will face financi problem in the come month   in addit  bank express concern about the number of specul condominium project in south florida   district bank have lower earn target for       and the expect is that bank merger and acquisit activ and layoff will increas in the come year   some bank are even put out the    for sale    sign in the hope of cash out now  note that thing could get ugli over the next two year in some area  outsid the hous sector  indic of econom perform in the district were mix  report on holiday relat sale were on the posit side  wherea tourism remain relat mix across the district   report from the manufactur sector were also mix  with a weak in the hous relat industri offset to some extent by the expand activ in industri relat to defens and energi  for the u s  economi as a whole  the drag from hous that we experienc over the second half of        not appear at this  e to pose a serious threat to the overal economi  although some forecast anticip below trend real gdp growth for the end of      and the first quarter of        most would say that this situat is temporari and would anticip that real gdp growth will rebound and be close to the trend rate of   percent for the rest of        our staff project of real gdp growth have had about the same tone as those of the extern forecast  our staff believ real gdp growth will be sustain in      by job creation that should match the experi that we   ve seen in       measur core inflat was well in excess of   percent at the end of        the staff forecast is that core inflat will continu to hover just abov   percent for all of        the expect is that price growth in servic will continu to domin core inflat go forward  in my comment i   ve focus a bit more on hous   i would just close by note that my continu concern would be the lack of impetus to drive down inflat over the long term   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i have to start by say that it   s hard to compet with my colleagu      with his stabl of contact   i have perhap just a slight amend on wal mart   my contact there said that he has observ in recent year a chang pattern of holiday shop  with shopper procrastin and put their shop closer to christma  and that might have move some sale from novemb to decemb  also the growth of the gift card busi move some of those sale into januari   those circumst might explain a bit of what we   re see   he said that it look as though the januari same store sale growth will come in at     to    percent   i   m sure that   s consist with     s inform   my contact point out that  although those number are a littl better than what they had anticip a month or two ago  they are still     basi point below the origin plan  which was set about a year ago   for februari their plan is     percent  but he believ that anyth north of   would be good perform   his view is that he  sn   t see a lot of momentum one way or anoth  that thing are pretti steadi  and that there   s been no particular signific chang in the situat   my fedex contact see busi as veri steadi   there was a veri strong peak season  pretti much on project   the one negat he see is in the less than truckload busi  and that confirm inform come direct from a truck industri sourc as well   basic  the outlook is good  steadi  and veri confid   as for capit expenditur  fedex is expect to have    percent abov this fiscal year in the next fiscal year  which start june     my contact   not see ani particular labor market pressur   my up contact said that the compani is cut it cap ex  and they are actual cut capac   he said that they are cut out twelv flight  i think it was  that they had just ad in june   the cut are basic a consequ of a care analysi of their express busi  which show that a lot of it is just unprofit  particular the ship of packag to individu home   they are renegoti contract with onlin retail and mail order retail  and they   re tri to shed some of that busi  my truck industri contact say that thing just don   t look veri sound   freight volum  which would be full truckload  is actual off   percent year over year in januari   ship rate are flat  but there are intens pressur from their client to cut rate   driver turnov is up becaus the driver are not get enough busi to eat well  and so they are shop around for other compani   so they are lose some driver  but they   re not too worri becaus they have plenti of driver at the moment   the intermod busi is hold up well  my contact said   i   d like to just make one brief comment on the nation outlook   i think it   s pretti clear  and it   s reflect around the tabl  that the outlook for real gdp is a bit stronger than it was at our decemb meet  and depend on your perspect in read the data  mayb the inflat pictur is a bit better  too   but i would emphas that  compar with past revis of the outlook  these are realli margin and not materi revis   there hasn   t been ani realli big news here   we don   t want to get carri away with a flow of data that is onli slight stronger   let me also comment  along the same line  about what has been go on with longer term interest rate   at the  e of our decemb meet  the constant matur ten year rate was        at least that   s what i have in my spreadsheet   on friday  it was        there has been a lot of comment to that effect   i think that chang is due part to the string of margin stronger news and part to a chang in the market   s assess about our like futur behavior  the market has simpli taken out the expect of a rate cut in the near term   the market has look again at where we are to a much greater extent than we ourselv have   thank you
mr  chairman
do you think that   s becaus they have chang their mind about our reaction function or about how the shock are like to come in between now and then
i suspect that it   s a combin   but i also think that a number of us in our speech have been say thing such as that we think polici is at about the right place   if we repeat that often enough  the market begin to think that we   re not about to cut rate
so what about our statement in octob   did they miss that
i guess that it   s a consequ of the interact between what we   ve been say and the flow of data   you have to be care about doubl count here  but the flow of data has perhap convinc the market that what we were say is right becaus the market  i think  had develop a somewhat differ sens of where the economi was go than they had thought that we held
mr    have an altern explan
i think he   s right   he is suggest that his belief is that the reaction function they hold to hasn   t chang much in the past month or two but that the shock have come in more consist with our assess of how they were go to come in   is that fair
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   just a few quick point  we feel somewhat better about the outlook for growth and inflat  but we haven   t realli chang our forecast for       and         so just as we expect over the past few cycl  we current expect gdp to grow rough at the rate of potenti over the forecast period  which we believ is still around   percent  and we expect the rate of increas in the core pce to moder a bit more to just below   percent over the forecast period   we see somewhat less downsid risk to growth and somewhat less upsid risk to inflat than we did  but the overal balanc of risk in our view is still weight toward inflat   the risk that it fail to moder enough or soon enough   the basic natur of the risk to both those element of our forecast hasn   t realli chang   as this impli  our forecast still has somewhat stronger growth and somewhat less inflat than the  book     the differ  howev  are smaller than they have been  we see the same basic stori that the  book   in support of continu expans go forward   we have similar assumpt for the appropri path of monetari polici   at least two  perhap sever  quarter of a nomin fed fund rate at current level   the main differ between our view about the economi and the  book   s relat first  as they have for some  e  to the like growth in hour  we   re still not inclin to build in a substanti reduct in trend labor forc growth   second  our view is that inflat has less inertia  less persist  than it has exhibit over the past half centuri   third  we tend to think that chang in wealth have less effect on consum behavior than   the staff   we have seen a general converg in view in the market  as we just discuss  toward a forecast close to this view  close to the center of graviti in this room  and a veri signific chang in polici expect as well   we can take some comfort from this  but i don   t think we should take too much   market still seem to display less uncertainti about monetari polici and asset price and quit low probabl to even modest increas in risk premium than i think is probabl justifi   let me just go through the princip question briefli   is the worst behind us in both hous and auto   probabl  but we can   t be sure yet   if we get some negat shock to incom   to demand growth   we   re still vulner to a more advers adjust in hous price with potenti substanti negat effect on growth  in part becaus of the greater leverag now on household balanc sheet   how strong   the economi look outsid auto and hous   pretti strong  it seem   we see no troubl sign of weak  despit the disappoint on some aspect of invest spend   what   the labor market strength tell us about the risk to the forecast   it seem obvious that on balanc it justifi some caution about upsid risk to growth and more than the usual humil about what we know about slack and trend labor forc growth   but i don   t think it fundament offer a compel case on it own for a substanti chang to the inflat forecast or the risk to that forecast   is there ani new inform on structur product growth   not in our view   we   re still fair comfort with the staff view of around   percent or     percent for the nonfarm busi sector   i   m not a great fan of the anecdot  but i   ll cite just one   if you ask peopl who make stuff for a live on a substanti scale  it   s hard to find ani concern that they are see diminish capac to extract greater product growth in their core busi   that   s not a general observ  just a small one   have the inflat risk chang meaning in either direct   i think the recent behavior of the core number and of expect is reassur   the market  sn   t seem particular concern about inflat  and the market is therefor vulner to a negat surpris  to a seri of higher number   can we be confid we   ll get enough moder with the current level of long term expect prevail in market  with the expect path of slack in the economi  and with the rang of potenti forc that might oper on relat price   energi  import  and other price   again  i think this forecast still seem reason  but we can   t be that confid  and we need to be concern still about the rang of sourc of vulner of that forecast   anoth way to frame this question is  is the inflat forecast consist with the current expect for the path of monetari polici accept to the committe   we haven   t fulli confront that issu becaus we don   t get much moder with a monetari polici assumpt that   s close to what   s in the market   but i don   t think there   s a compel case to act at this stage in a way that forc converg on that   in other word  how tight is monetari polici  and how tight are overal financi condit today   i don   t think there   s a veri strong case for us to induc more tight or more accommod than now prevail   there   s a good case for patienc and for give ourselv a fair amount of flexibl go forward  within the context of an asymmetr signal about the balanc of risk and a basic judgment that we view the cost of a more advers inflat outcom as the predomin concern of the committe
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for submit my forecast  i look at my previous forecast   a humbl but instruct experi usual    laughter  go back a year  i found that  base on the staff   s es  for       inflat and growth had each turn out within a quarter point of my project   i   m quit certain that this is not a consequ of ani particular expertis on my part   rather  it is indic that  in a broad sens  the economi is perform remark close to our expect   presid pool was make this point   even go back a few year to when we start to remov accommod  despit larg fluctuat in energi price in recent year  huge geopolit uncertainti  and a hous boom and bust the dimens of which we realli didn   t anticip three year ago  the economi is in the neighborhood of full employ  and core inflat is at a fair low rate by histor standard   now  the surpris last year were the surg of inflat in the spring and earli summer  that has not been entir revers   the extent of the slowdown in product growth  both in term of trend and of actual relat to the lower es  trend  and the relat declin in the unemploy rate suggest that we are enter      with a higher risk of inflat than i had anticip a year ago   given this risk  it is especi import that econom growth be no greater and perhap a littl less than the growth rate of potenti  and that is my forecast   a small uptrend in the unemploy rate   the issu i wrestl with was how fast the economi will be grow when the drag from hous abat   in earli decemb  the debat might have been about whether demand would be suffici to support growth as high as potenti   but given the stabil of hous demand  the strength of consumpt  and ongo increas in employ  i ask myself whether we might not find the economi grow fa  than it potenti begin in the second half of      and in       therebi ad to inflat pressur   a coupl of forc  howev  gave me a littl comfort in support my project of onli moder growth   one is the modest restraint on demand from the recent rise in interest rate  especi the restraint on the hous market  and the dollar exchang rate   anoth is the likelihood that consumpt will grow more slowli relat to incom and will lag the respons to hous as hous price level out and as energi price begin to edg higher   consumpt late last year was probabl still be boost substanti by the past increas in hous wealth and by the declin in energi price  which combin with warm weather to give a consider lift to dispos incom   on the hous wealth factor  i think our model suggest that it take sever quarter for a level out in hous wealth to build into consumpt   in fact  the data through the third quarter suggest that price were realli just about level out in the third quarter   so it may be a littl earli to conclud that  just becaus we   re not see a spillov from the hous market to consumpt  there isn   t go to be ani   i expect some  though modest  spillov   moreov  some of the impuls in the fourth quarter was from net export   these were spur in part by a temporari declin in petroleum import and an unexpect strength in export   those condit are unlik to be sustain   in addit  busi invest spend has been weaker than we anticip   now  i suspect this is  like the inventori situat  just an aspect of adapt to a slower pace of growth  and invest will strengthen go forward   but it   suggest that busi are cautious   they are not anticip ebulli demand and a press need to expand facil to meet increas in sale  and their sens of their market seem worth factor into our calcul   final  the fact that i would have been ask just the opposit question seven week ago suggest that we   re also put a lot of weight on a few observ   laughter  whether regard the weak then or the strength more recent   i do continu to believ that growth close to the growth rate of potenti will be consist with gradual eb inflat   for this i would round up the usual suspect  reflect the eb of some temporari factor that increas inflat in         one factor is energi price  empir evid sinc the earli     s to the contrari notwithstand  the coincid that presid   remark between the rise and fall in energi price in      and the rise and fall in core inflat suggest some caus and effect   the increas in energi price into the summer has probabl not yet been complet revers in twelv month core inflat rate  so i expect some of that to be die out as we go into the futur   increas in rent are like to moder as unit are shift from ownership to rental market   the slowdown in growth relat to earlier last year seem to have made busi more awar of competit pressur  restrain price power   when we met last spring  we had a lot of discuss about busi feel that they had price power   that they could pass through increas in cost   i haven   t heard ani of that discuss around the tabl today   the recent slowdown in inflat is encourag but not definit evid that the moder is in train   the slowdown could have been help by the declin in energi price  and that declin won   t be repeat   good price might have been held back by effort to run off inventori  and that phenomenon  too  would be temporari   as i alreadi note  the initi condit   the recent behavior of product and the relat low level of the unemploy rate   suggest upward inflat risk relat to this gentl downward tilt   to an extent  the staff has place a relat favor interpret on these develop   they haven   t revis trend product down ani further   they expect a pickup in realiz product growth over this year   they see a portion of the strength in labor market as simpli lag the slowdown in growth   a littl more labor hoard than usual as the economi cool  along with some statist anomali   thus  in the  book  the unemploy rate rise  and inflat pressur remain contain as activ expand at close to the growth rate of potenti   presid   at the last meet and bill wascher today point out two less benign possibl   one is that demand realli has been stronger  as indic by the incom side data  and that the labor and product market realli are as tight as the unemploy rate suggest   in this case  the unemploy rate wouldn   t drift higher with moder growth   busi might find themselv face higher labor cost and be abl to pass them on unless we take step to firm financi condit   the second possibl is that trend product is lower   in this case  actual product growth might not recov much this year   unit labor cost would rise more quick   given the appar momentum in demand  we might be look at an even further declin in the unemploy rate in the near term   now  my outlook is predic on someth like the staff interpret  but i think these other possibl underlin the inflat risk in an economi in which growth has been well maintain   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   like sever of you  i   m go to focus on hous and what we   re see in the bank sector and in mortgag perform   sinc the last meet  i am feel better about the hous market in the aggreg   it look as though home sale are stabil for the fourth quarter   on the whole  home sale actual did go up a bit   the inventori of new home for sale has now fallen for five month through decemb  and mortgag applic for home purchas continu to move abov the level of last summer  when they hit bottom   the nation associ of realtor is es  that exist home sale have alreadi bottom out  and homebuild sen ent improv in three of the four past month   but even if sale realli have stabil  the inventori of home for sale still must be work down befor construct and growth resum in this market   given that some exist home have like been pull off the market in light of slower sale and moder hous price  this inventori correct period will probabl continu into        i think this is particular true in market such as florida  as first vice presid barron mention  where a larg amount of specul invest occur dure the boom period   with three to five year of excess construct from the investor side   so those home still have to be work through   asset qualiti in the consum sector as a whole is veri good   we have come through one of the most benign period   the except  as bill mention in his present earlier today  is the subprim market   when you dissect it  you see that prime mortgag delinqu are flat and subprim mortgag at a fix rate are flat   the whole problem is in subprim arm  which are run into difficulti   the four feder regulatori agenc are look harder at some of these subprim product   we start review      mortgag  and now we   re look at and test some other product   we   re find that the issu are get more troublesom the further we dig into these product   to put the situat in perspect  subprim arm are a veri small part of the whole mortgag market   as   mention  subprim is about    percent  and the arm piec of the subprim is about half to two third  so we   re talk perhap around   percent of the aggreg mortgag outstand   we   re see that the borrow who got into these dure the teaser period now are see tremend payment shock   for exampl      s that are go from the fix two year period to the adjust period basic had their interest rate doubl  so they   re go from a   percent handl to a    percent handl  and the borrow don   t have the discretionari incom to absorb that   this type of mortgag was sold to a lot of subprim borrow on the idea that they are lend vehicl to repair credit score   you will show that you are go to pay dure the earli period  and then you can refin and get a lower long term rate  so you   ll never pay the jump   but we   re find that some of these mortgag have signific prepay penalti  and so to refin and get the better term  some borrow are get into difficulti   becaus of the moder in hous price  these borrow haven   t built up enough equiti to absorb the prepay penalti   so the problem stem from a combin of factor   there are a lot of spin on these product  but we   re tri to take an approach base on principl in look at what   s realli happen   i also want to mention that  although the ownership of the mortgag is veri diffus and so we   re not see ani real concentr risk  particular in bank  we do need to pay more attent to where the mortgag servic exposur are   the servic of these mortgag that are securit is concentr in certain institut   clear  when you have such a high level of delinqu and potenti default  all profit in servic is gone   so there could be some charg off in these securit mortgag   also  i think all of you have notic the number of mortgag broker that have close up shop in the past six month becaus they couldn   t get enough liquid or capit to repurchas the earli default of these recent pool  that is realli shrink the origin pocket   i should also say that  with the except of the subprim arm mortgag  we feel veri good about overal credit qualiti   when i look at the economi as a whole  i also see that except for hous construct and auto  the rest of the economi is sound   the recent growth in employ and the strong wage growth give me comfort that the incom growth of consum is there to mitig some of the wealth effect that we may have with moder hous price   but i also share the concern that some of you mention here  and that presid   spoke of in a speech  about the issu regard product trend and wage growth  and determin how fast the economi is grow   product is go to have to grow fa  to absorb the higher wage growth  particular as employ growth continu strong  and i think the slack in the skill labor forc is get veri  veri limit   when i think  in aggreg  about the data sinc our last meet  i feel a littl better about inflat becaus it appear to be moder  but i   m not jump for joy becaus we need a few more month   howev  the growth inform has been  instead of mix as at the last meet  general stronger  and that   make me feel better   in net  then  base on the recent inform  i   m even a bit further along on the side that the risk have move higher for inflat than on the side of the risk of a slowdown in the economi   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i   d provid just a coupl of perspect  first on the      economi and then  by extrapol  on the trend in         with respect to       i think the economi outperform market expect and  book expect  for probabl at least four reason   the first is the under strength of the employ market  which has been much discuss today   second  the strength and durabl of household financ  which  as vice chairman   said  turn out to be far more determin by w   incom than some of the household balanc sheet item like home equiti and stock market effect   but we need to take anoth look at that trend in        third  the econom outperform in       had much to do with the resili of the u s  capit market as evidenc in credit spread and other financi instrument  particular in the face of some rather seismic event   one  e  potenti system event like the amaranth advisor collaps  cyclic price spike with respect to commod price that may well have been somewhat demand driven  a seri of suppli shock driven by oil  and a seem transit to slower growth in the middl of the year   fourth were the continu power sourc of liquid that smooth the transit over the sever bump in the road   i also look at what the most reliabl and the least reliabl indic of the state of the economi in       were to see whether those signpost might hold for         i think the tax receipt inform that we saw in       was tell us that incom were like ahead of trend   tax receipt for       were up a total of      percent   corpor profit  which were up    percent in the past four year  had anoth remark year  up in the mid teen   stock price  obvious close relat to corpor profit  were up    percent in the past four year and up about    percent in        credit spread continu to trend tighter  high yield spread were down about     basi point from septemb   anoth coupl of reason reliabl indic for       were the household survey of employ  which suggest earli and often that employ growth was like to be ahead of expect  and merger and acquisit pipelin  which suggest a degre of confid in the market by busi leader and other folk involv in financ   a less reliabl indic for      growth was the shape of the yield curv  and the suggest from most of us around the tabl to the market was that the yield curv wasn   t predict much by way of recess in the short term   anoth less reliabl indic was the consum confid and busi confid survey  which seem to snap all over the place  perhap more becaus of geopolit event and some short term data than ani realli drive profil   with respect to inflat  it is hard to find ani indic that were veri good at tell us it path  but i do think that the tip spread  even when there was much talk in the spring and the summer about rise inflat  seem to stay relat well anchor and not to move too much base on some of that nois in the data   so that indic seem to have been reason good   as was mention earlier  month cpi and pce core measur seem to be move around rather signific  so it was hard for us to determin too much from them as      went forward   take all of that into account  as i think about       i find that analyz those indic is not without signific peril  but let me attempt do so   the trend appear support of strong  balanc econom growth for       and although inflat expect are well anchor and recent high frequenc data appear promis  i remain much more concern about inflat prospect than about growth   have said that  i do think that as an institut we go into      with probabl even heighten credibl on the inflat front and in term of our perspect on the economi  which should help us over the next twelv month   two key theme summar my view on        first  strong employ trend should continu to support consum spend   second  strong corpor balanc sheet and balanc global growth should support capit expenditur   now  of those two theme  i would note that i have consider more confid in the former than in the latter   i   ll spend anoth moment on that short   the tone of the market appear to be except strong   spread have tighten  even as yield have trend back to   percent   over novemb and decemb  we had three week  each with more than     billion be price in the high yield market   just to give some perspect on that fact  for the year      there was a total of     billion in the high yield market   but what has happen in the past six week that might be abl to inform our judgment   doubl b spread have tighten about    basi point  singl bs have tighten    basi point  and tripl c spread have tighten    basi point in the past six week  all of which continu to signal to me that the economi maintain a relat strength and that investor feel confid about the bet that they   re make   in summari  i would say there are signific tail on both side of this rather strong base case for the economi  but the economi is more like to track abov the expect of the  book   let me spend a coupl of moment on the consum   contact from two larg credit card compani to whom i spoke last week expect and have seen in januari the same kind of strength that they saw in decemb   the first three week of januari look to be a continu of the late but posit trend in the fourth quarter   for what it   s worth  the contact    own project are that the first quarter will be rather strong  much like the fourth quarter end up be   today  we   ve all tri to wrestl with what the  book refer to as the    unexplain strength    of household spend dure      to determin it effect on         let me spend a coupl of moment on a hypothesi that the contact proffer regard that strength  which the  book refer in it    buoyant consum    simul   what that strength may well prove is that employe work more  earn more  and had more save from their household balanc sheet to fund consumpt than the data to this point are suggest   i think that could turn out to be the case in        first  peopl work more  the benchmark payrol survey on total job creation may well be revis upward again signific  like the revis of last year   gain in servic job may well be less count than some of the loss in other kind of job   anoth bias for upward revis   the jolt data to which presid pianalto refer continu to be veri posit  suggest a real dynam in the economi that may well be acceler   particip rate may continu their recent spike as new worker select choos to enter this marketplac   averag hour work move up in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of     percent  and that trend could continu   so month employ gain have not prove much harder to achiev as we approach what we thought was full employ  and the nairu may be lower than es    second  peopl certain may well have earn more   averag hour earn were up     percent for        an acceler that was rather widespread from       measur   though the data on compens continu to be mix  they do seem to be trend in that direct   the diverg between profit and compens suggest to me at least that there is larg upsid potenti for unemploy to stay low and for wage to acceler  perhap in a catch up for wage gain that we didn   t see earlier in the cycl   third  as a result of work more and earn more  i suspect that worker may continu to spend more  particular with the gift of what seem to be relat low oil price  in the mid fifti   the oil price seem to me to have less of a risk premium and now appear to reflect some elev suppli and at least modest lower demand   in sum  with respect to the consum side  i am reason well confid   i   ll spend just a moment on the busi side of the equat   fourth quarter profit appear to be quit good  with two third of compani beat es    as mani of these compani are challeng to have doubl digit earn in       they may look for other avenu in which to buy those earn   in the m a world   or increas cash outlay through share repurchas from their excess cash on the balanc sheet to maintain earn per share growth in the doubl digit   anoth altern is that they might choos to increas cap ex as mani of us  includ myself  would have expect them to do earlier in this cycl   do so could have a negat effect on short term earn but would show some real confid in their long term invest and growth plan   as alreadi mention  shipment and order fell in the fourth quarter  and our work explan is that much of that fall is realli an inventori adjust  we   ve had that discuss for a while   i would expect busi invest and industri product to pick up   if it  sn   t do so in the first quarter  my confid about this side of the economi  about this leg of the stool  will be signific reduc   between now and the next  e we meet  we will have a better sens of whether that turn on the busi side of the economi is real or whether we just saw a fals start in decemb   so i think we   ll be abl to come to a much firmer view when we meet in six week   all in all  i remain reason confid and op ist about the forecast   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   well  the data have come in so far accord to plan  and you can thank chairman bernank for do that   i think he has some special relat with the bea and other    laughter   exact as we had hope they would and said they would  the data show moder in growth with a prospect for acceler growth through      and moder in inflat   again  accord to plan   i think my view are similar to those that presid  n put forward   the economi has shown an enorm amount of resili   i want to talk about a few possibl puzzl in the way the data have evolv and could perhap deviat from plan as we go forward   one puzzl is the great strength of the consum  the consum has been veri  veri strong for the past five year  and it seem that no matter what has happen   whether a hous downturn  an equiti market downturn  or a septemb      the consum has come through rather strong and continu to be strong   we certain have had a slowdown in the hous market  and mayb we   re wait to see it effect on the consum  as don kohn mention   but it may just be that some special factor have come in  for exampl  we have had veri strong intern econom growth  and perhap that will persist   when you talk to offici and busi peopl outsid the unit state  whether in emerg market economi  in the gulf region  or in industri economi  they are extrem op ist  much more so than i have ever befor seen  and that may continu   obvious  there is a risk factor here   the recent strengthen in equiti market perhap offset some of the reduct in the asset valu of home   lower consum energi price  of cours  have been an offset factor  and labor market strength and increas in compens have been veri import   but there   s an upsid risk that we will continu to have veri  veri strong consumpt instead of have our error correct go back toward more save   second  with respect to invest  we have had order abov shipment for quit some  e  but we have had invest actual declin  or at least not grow as we would expect  overal in this recoveri we have had weaker invest growth  and we have had veri high profit   that rais anoth puzzl for me   whi have we seen somewhat weak invest over the long run and especi more recent  given that most measur of consum confid and busi confid have been posit  equiti market seem to be posit  spread seem to be low  and so forth   whi are we not see more invest   invest may turn around in the next quarter or so  and then we   ll be out of the wood   but i think the condit that we predict will lead to an invest turnaround have been there for quit some  e  and we haven   t seen the invest turnaround  and that is a puzzl to me   third  with respect to inflat  obvious we are all pleas that the number have been come out with greater moder   but i have a discomfort about exact what is drive that moder   we have good short term stori about how the slowdown in energi price in the second and third quarter and some other temporari factor with respect to owner    equival rent could be bring down inflat   but when we consid a longer period and tri to look at the systemat data  we don   t see those kind of relationship   are we just in some sort of regim shift   are those correl not veri good becaus we just haven   t had a lot of variat in the data over the past ten to twenti year  and so those forc are actual there  but we just find it veri difficult to pull them out econometr   for me that is a puzzl  to be abl to tell a short term stori with each of these piec  but when i go to the staff and ask     well  what is the systemat evid on it     they say     well  it realli isn   t there      that is a bit disturb for me in tri to figur out where thing are like to go   thing have move in a benign way   i don   t think there   s a strong expect that they would move in a nonbenign way   but i don   t have a lot of confid that i understand whi they have move as they have   so my concern is that various shock or other factor could come in to move them in a way that is not near so benign   broad  howev  i share the view that most peopl have express around the tabl that we have good growth prospect go forward and so far reason moder of inflat   but precis becaus we have those good growth prospect and becaus we may have had some temporari factor that have kept down inflat  we have to be ever mind of the upsid risk to inflat
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i   m last in this line  and i   ll tri to be brief so that we can get to dinner soon   i do see sign of stabil in the hous market  and the way to think of it in term of spillov is that we do expect some spillov through the natur effect of weaker hous on aggreg demand and on wealth   but we   re not see anyth out of the ordinari or a persist pattern  and that give me more confid that noth realli bad is go to happen here   my view is that the risk to the downsid have decreas substanti   also  the tone of the recent data actual indic that what is happen concern aggreg demand is stronger than we would have expect   as a result  i   m a bit more op ist than the  book in term of what is go to happen next year with aggreg demand   actual  i see  if anyth  a littl more risk to the upsid  so i slant a bit in that direct   the inflat number have been veri good recent  and one view is that they are just temporari blip in the data   i tend to be a littl more sanguin here becaus i think that there are good reason for inflat to gravit toward what are solid anchor inflat expect  that has been veri import in term of the cycl and is one reason that i   m a littl more op ist than the  book on inflat   i do think that inflat expect are strong ground around   percent on the pce deflat   as a result  i expect us to go to   percent inflat over the next year and then stay there but not go below there   i don   t actual like to think of this in term of    persist      it is one reason that i   m unwil to think that thing will get better than that   but i do think that we will like have a more benign path of inflat than we might have thought earlier   even if you think that there   s a more benign path to inflat  which i   m will to consid though we   re not sure about it  it is still true that aggreg demand has blip up recent   that is an indic that the neutral real interest rate has move up  which is veri much reflect in the  book assess   that   s import becaus  even if you   re happi about what   s happen with inflat  you have to be more worri about the fact that the economi is go to be stronger   that   have some implic for the way we think about polici go forward   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   this was an except interest  use discuss   i thought i would tri to summar what i heard around the tabl   if you have comment on that  pleas give them to me  and then i   ll add a few comment of my own   member note consider econom strength dure the intermeet period   labor market remain taut  with continu wage pressur in some occup   consumpt grew strong in the fourth quarter  with some momentum into the first quarter  reflect a strong job market  lower energi price  and higher profit   overal  invest seem like to grow at a moder pace given good fundament   busi peopl seem general op ist  and financi market are robust   we still have what peopl have been character as a two track economi   hous  although a drag for now    show some tentat evid of stabil   howev  some warn about draw too strong a conclus about hous dure the winter month   some also note issu of credit qualiti   the general view was that hous would ceas to subtract from growth later this year   some soft in part of manufactur  especi in industri relat to hous and automobil  still exist   but in part this weak may be an inventori correct that may be reason far advanc at this point   despit the weak in hous and some part of manufactur  there are yet no sign of spillov into employ or consumpt  although some rais the possibl that we may see those later on   some  but not all  member agre with the contour of the  book that has econom growth somewhat slower in the near term  strengthen later this year  with a modest increas in unemploy  the committe is general more op ist about potenti growth than the  book  most becaus the member assum that labor forc growth will be greater than the  book assum   overal  downsid risk to output appear to have moder  while an upsid risk has emerg that growth will not moder as expect   on the inflat side  peopl note that recent read have been favor  although there was disagr about the caus  whether it was energi price  well anchor inflat expect  less structur inertia  or perhap just statist nois   most still expect gradual slow inflat but are cautious and consid upsid risk signific  perhap even greater than late last year   the primari upsid risk to inflat is econom growth abov potenti in tight labor market  which may lead to inflat in the futur if not in the near term   other note that inflat expect may be too high to allow continu progress against inflat   so overal  the general tone was for a somewhat stronger economi  perhap a slight improv outlook on inflat  but  in ani case  a clear view that the upsid risk to inflat are predomin   are there ani comment   let me add just a few point   everyth has realli been said  but not everyon has said it  as they say    laughter   our goal has been  in some sens  to achiev a soft land  and the question is whether we have miss the airport    laughter   we have seen a good bit of strength in the intermeet period  and i think the real crux of the issu is what   s go to happen to the labor market   if the labor market continu where it is or strengthen further  we will see both stronger growth  becaus of the incom effect and job effect  and continu pressur on inflat   again  the central issu will be whether we will see enough cool in the economi to have a bit of eas in the labor situat   this is  obvious  difficult to say   i do believ that the most like outcom for the first half of this year is for some moder in growth  perhap to modest below potenti    if you look at the various compon of spend and product  you note  for exampl  that person consumpt expenditur are like to slow from the veri high level we have just seen recent   in particular  a lot of the spend recent was for durabl good  which tend to be more negat auto correl   that is  they tend to drop more quick when they are high in the short run    we have seen some moder in invest  in both equip and structur   net export were a major contributor to growth at the end of the year  that should probabl revers  as the  book note   a special factor there is that the good weather reduc oil import  which led peopl to spend on domest product rather than on foreign product   if that situat revers and we go back to normal net export  that will subtract from gdp   also  the staff note some like revers in govern spend   so my sens is that we   re like to see someth a littl less hectic in the first half of this current year   i think it also remain reason that growth will return close to potenti later this year  there is certain uncertainti about that   clear  we have seen some sign of stabil in the hous market   i was go to note the effect of the winter month and the weather   i think that we should acknowledg that stabil but not ignor the possibl that we may see further deterior there   against the view that growth may moder this quarter  or next quarter perhap  there is oppos evid that consumpt and employ are aw strong   economist tend to think of consumpt  in particular  as be a veri forward look variabl  and it   s consist with view that we see  for exampl  in consum sen ent that peopl do feel reason op ist about the labor market and about the state of the economi   so i agre that there is certain some risk that the economi will be stronger go forward than we have been project   i don   t have an answer other than to say that we obvious have to monitor the situat veri care and continu to be will to reassess our view as the data arriv   let me say a bit about inflat   recent read have been favor   a coupl of aspect of inflat i do find encourag   first is that the moder we   ve seen in inflat the past few month has happen despit the lack of ani substanti moder in shelter cost  owner    equival rent are actual a construct  imput variabl   they are not seen by anybodi   nevertheless  they are essenti the entir reason that inflat is remain abov our target zone at this point   i know it   s a bit of a joke that i alway refer to the short term inflat number  but i   ll do it again anyway    laughter   just to illustr  over the past three month  core cpi inflat exclud just owner    equival rent was     percent at an annual rate   over the past six month  it was      percent at an annual rate   over the past twelv month  it was        we also get number for pce core inflat exclud owner    equival rent that are all below   percent   obvious that is just carv the data  and there are lot of problem with do that   but to the extent we think that rent will continu to moder  and i think there is scope for them to do that  that   s one factor that should make us a littl more comfort   anoth factor is that there is a fair broad base slow   i won   t take a lot of  e to go through the evid  but particular in the cpi there are some encourag develop on the servic side in term of inflat to go along with the slow in good price   now  i am the first to acknowledg that lot of interpret of the recent develop are possibl   we hope that favor structur factor are at work   one possibl certain is that the wage increas are a catch up for previous product gain and that we   re see a normal restor of capit incom labor incom relationship   in that case  this may be in some sens a transitori adjust that will restor those relationship and not necessarili contribut to inflat go forward   anoth possibl is that energi price effect are somewhat larger than we thought   there seem to be some evid that they are   a third possibl is that what we saw earlier last year was  as governor kohn mention  a transitori upsid  some of which has simpli pass  and we are go back to the more fundament rate of inflat   so there are some structur reason that inflat might be moder   my have said that  we should certain acknowledg the statist nois that is inher in these measur   the month standard deviat of core inflat in      was about   basi point   if the true under inflat is     percent  then you have a veri good chanc of get either     or       therefor  we and the financi market ought to be brace for the possibl that we will get       i hope not wors   in the next few month   i agre with the view that has been express that the trend has not yet been establish  and we   ll have to follow it develop   anoth veri import point that has been rais   presid    i think  was the first to rais it   is that  given the lag from econom activ to inflat that we see in standard impuls respons function and so on  these improv may be real but nevertheless temporari and the under labor market pressur and so on may lead to inflat problem a year or eighteen month from now   i agre that it is a concern  and it goe back to my point earlier that we need to be veri alert to chang in the pattern of aggreg demand go forward  as presid pool mention  one element that will help us is the endogen of financi condit   we haven   t done anyth sinc the last meet  but long term real interest rate rose about    basi point   the yield curv is still invert by about    basi point   so i think even the market themselv have the abil to rais real rate quit signific  enough certain to make a differ in the mortgag market if the data continu to be strong and if inflat   not continu to subsid   then we would have a bit more latitud as we tri to determin whether the fourth quarter was a blip or a trend   i think that   s still an open question   so let me just say that i broad agre with what i heard   the economi   look stronger   that is an upsid risk to which we need to be pay close attent   inflat look a bit better  at least in the short term  but there are some long term consider that we need to keep in mind   final  the basic contour of the outlook are not sharpli chang  but i agre with the sen ent around the tabl that upsid risk to inflat remain the predomin concern that the committe should have   are there comment   yes  presid pool
we have two import piec of inform come in at      tomorrow morn   i hope the staff can give us a quick first read to start our meet   i know that instant analysi is riski  but i ask for it anyway    laughter
and i will provid it    laughter    whether it   s worth anyth or not  i don   t know    laughter
we   ll start the meet with the data   anyth els  there   s a recept and dinner in dine room e   it   s for those who wish to attend   if you have other plan  pleas feel free to pursu them  and we   ll see you tomorrow morn at        meet recess  januari               of     januari            morn session
good morn  everyon   let   s start with ask dave   to report on this morn   s data
so  mr  chairman  this was sort of done on the fli   unlik the bea  i won   t be abl to go back and revis these remark    laughter   total gdp this morn came in at     percent   that was     percentag point stronger than we had forecast in the  book  there were realli two sourc of our miss in the fourth quarter   of that miss      was the net export compon  which   will speak about in a second  and     was nonfarm inventori invest   so perhap   will give the quick stori on the net export side  and then i   ll complet the report
the net export number are base on trade data onli for octob novemb  and we each make an es  of what decemb is go to be   perhap half of our miss  or not quit half  was due to differ of opinion about decemb   look at what they   ve done for decemb  we will take some inform from that   some of what they   ve put in decemb is inform that we didn   t otherwis have   to some degre  it   s statist and not realli about trade   it   s someth call a territori adjust   mayb a quarter is differ about thing in decemb for which we are not prepar to chang our mind at this point   so we would not go to as strong a posit contribut from net export as they go becaus we retain some differ of view about what the decemb number will turn out to be   the other bit of news we receiv was veri strong export of servic   we   ll take that  and we   ll probabl give most of the adjust  but not quit all of it  in the number we write down next for q    we will actual want to revers that thing call territori adjust in q    so we   re actual go to make import stronger and the net export contribut slight more negat in q  as a result
that   s basic half of our gdp miss   the other half is on the inventori invest side   just like with    about half of our miss on inventori invest has to do with a differ of opinion about what the decemb book valu figur will turn out to be   so it   s just a differ between the bea   s es  for decemb and our es  for decemb   i don   t think we   d be inclin to alter our decemb es   so we   d write off rough half of that miss on nonfarm inventori invest   we don   t do that great a job of forecast those book valu inventori figur either   it is not as though we have lot of inform or a good reason for stake ourselv to our forecast versus the bea   s  but i don   t think they have ani more inform than we do   as for privat domest final purchas  which we have been emphas  even given some of the recent nois in net export and govern  there we were  in fact  almost exact right  we were off by   basi point in term of it contribut to overal gdp   in term of the composit  consumpt was a bit weaker  and equip spend a bit stronger  probabl becaus of bea   s es  of the share of auto be sold to busi versus household   so we don   t realli see veri much inform there  on net  govern was a bit weaker   the feder side was weaker by more than the state and local side was stronger
what was the number for domest final purchas  dave
i actual don   t know what the domest final purchas were  but if you includ the govern  which they do  they were a littl weaker than the number we had written down
no  the overal number
yes  i don   t know what the overal number is  i know onli what the contribut are   we   ll be abl to get the overal number by break  e   take on board our differ of opinion about the decemb figur  we   d probabl be write down  with the releas in hand today  a gdp es  for the fourth quarter of about   percent rather than the     percent that is be current publish   and in contrast to the     percent we wrote down in the  book   so then the question is  what   this impli about the overal momentum of activ go into the first quarter   my answer has to be    not much     and i don   t think this is just blind stubborn  although i   m glad my wife is not here to disput that particular character   laughter   but about the two surpris   as   alreadi indic  they would be inclin to actual mark down their contribut of net export to gdp growth in the first quarter on the basi of the net export side   we would probabl be inclin to do the same thing with respect to the higher inventori invest  and so we   re come into the first quarter with somewhat higher inventori sale ratio and mayb some indic that we   re not as far along in work down inventori as we had thought   i   m glad that i don   t actual have to write down that first quarter number today becaus we will have an employ report on friday and some first real read on the pace of activ in the first quarter by the end of the week and in the next week or two   so basic i   d argu that there isn   t a lot of signal in that     percent figur that we   re move into the first quarter with much thrust   anoth reason for not necessarili mark up activ as we move into the first half of this year  even though gdp came in   percentag point abov our es   is that real dispos incom actual came in   percentag point weaker than our  book es    so it isn   t as though  with the higher growth rate of activ  we have more under growth in labor incom that is like to be spent go forward   we have an even lower save rate now in the fourth quarter than we have written down   thus i think there are sever reason for not necessarili read this as a sign of greater strength move into the first part of the year   on the inflat side  thing were actual spot on   total pce inflat was minus     percent   that   s what we had written down in the  book   core pce was       also exact what we had written down in the  book   market base core was      that was actual     percentag point better than what we had written down in the  book   the other major releas this morn was the employ cost index  which show a year over year increas of     percent   that number also is exact what we had written down in the  book  so i don   t think we realli see ani differ   obvious  the number has continu to be veri subdu   so in the total  on the inflat side  thing are look veri close to our expect and i think still pretti good   mr  chairman  that   s all i have to say
thank you   are there ani question   if not
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the handout    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      as note in the top left panel of your first exhibit  the path of polici expect rotat up over the intermeet period  and investor now appar anticip the feder fund rate to move down onli about    percentag point over the next coupl of year   as relat in the panel at the top right  primari dealer are unanim in expect no chang in the polici rate at this meet   inde  near all the dealer believ that you will hold the fund rate steadi through the may meet   as to the word of the statement  some dealer are call for a more upbeat assess of the econom outlook  but almost all expect no chang in the committe   s assess of risk   in the treasuri market  as shown in the bottom left panel  this

latest version of tabl    which circul monday   it trim the word of altern b to be a littl more upbeat about firmer econom growth in section    which feel right this morn   i also hope that you might reflect on the risk assess offer in section   of altern c   the languag about polici firm that you   ve repeat for the past few meet seem a littl stale and potenti mislead if you are not confid that your next polici action will be to tighten   talk about the relat odd of action might be a more durabl structur  but this might be a discuss for a later day out of concern about an inappropri reaction in financi market today
thank you   are there question for     vice  chairman
this is more an observ than it is a question   i guess i   m a littl uncomfort the way you frame  just in the paper  exhibit    in the sens that i don   t think it would be great if we came to view altern b in the statement as  in a sens  valid a higher implicit inflat object than member of the committe heretofor talk about    it is true that  with the stanc of polici impli in market today  under reason assumpt you may not get below   percent ani  e soon   but if you have differ assumpt about the structur of the economi  about the way inflat work in this economi  or differ view about the period that   s op  for bring inflat down  it   s plausibl that you could have a forecast that get inflat below   percent with the stanc of polici not dramat differ from what   s in the  book   i know that you didn   t mean to impli that  but i don   t think it would be good for us to creat a sens of valid the monetari polici expect that are in the market or in the  book   we would be accept that we have allow our implicit object to drift up
you probabl won   t have that troubl in public becaus among the thing that will be releas is your central tendenc forecast and it   have a steeper declin in core pce inflat than the staff   s forecast     so keep polici unchang at this meet   not valid a   percent inflat goal  it just mean you might have a differ view
we   re readi to begin our polici go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start off by say that today i favor maintain the feder fund rate at    percent   as we discuss ye day and we learn this morn  the pictur that seem to be emerg from the latest econom inform is one of reason strong under growth  which has been temporarili weaken by hous and auto   given that temporari weak  i think it would be prematur to rais rate today  but i am not confid that core inflat will continu to deceler in the come quarter  and that could risk our credibl   the level of inflat continu to be higher than i   d like to see  and in my forecast we may not see a return to price stabil unless monetari condit are tighten further   although i don   t think today is the day to do it  i do want us to consid tighten if we see growth acceler back to trend more quick than in the  book   i say this not becaus i think that growth will put upward pressur on inflat but becaus the associ equilibrium real rate that are impli by that higher growth  which we are begin to see in the marketplac  will eventu forc our hand   as i mention in my remark on the economi at the past two meet  i have been of the mind that a somewhat slower economi  combin with a constant fund rate  might be suffici to ensur a declin in core inflat   as the economi strengthen  that scenario becom a littl less like   if the economi continu to strengthen  a failur to act not onli put our price stabil goal at risk but also risk our credibl with the public   thus it would be ill advis to suggest in our statement that we are finish act for a while  and therefor i would not favor the languag that bill pool circul last week   my prefer is for the languag describ the rational given in altern c in tabl   of the bluebook   the rational in altern c  includ both section   and    is realli not more hawkish than the languag of altern b  yet it   s more concis and come closer to my view on the current state of the economi   inde  sinc under altern b  section    or altern c  section    we would be make sizabl chang in the languag from our last statement  i also think that it   s appropri at this  e to purg the languag about the high level of resourc util have the potenti to sustain inflat pressur or lower oil price to mitig core inflat   all the recent work on the forecast of medium term and longer term inflat that i have seen say that these phillip type model don   t help us forecast core inflat veri well  the frb us model of the  book look as though it has veri flat tradeoff  certain in the near term anyway  so i think it would be use to chang our languag at this point   i have not been a fan of that languag  but in the past i was persuad that we should leav it so as to avoid unnecessari chang that might confus the public   but sinc we are consid chang at this  e  i would favor go with altern c  which get rid of this languag   i   m happi to continu with the risk assess that we had last  e  elimin the word    nonetheless     although frank i would not great resist actual go with the assess of risk in altern c   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    just so i   m clear  which section from c
i advoc leav the feder fund rate section as is but use section   and   from altern c as our rational
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i  too  am in favor of maintain polici at it current level   i find myself somewher between polici altern c and b as describ in exhibit    leav out  as vice chairman   suggest  ani commit to either of those goal   i am concern about hous and the possibl spillov  howev  the under pace of growth and activ within the economi   risk take inflat up from where we think it   s go to go  chang the path of it slight   the chairman and a coupl of other peopl mention ye day the uptick in medium term to long term bond  a good point to be made here is that most of the action in the market has result from the releas of econom data   given at least the surfac gloss of the gdp report  i imagin that the market will be firmer rather than softer  will expect less movement on our part  and could move up at the long end and creat some lessen of financi accommod  in effect make financi term a bit more restrict   so i think we will get some help from the market reaction to the current econom data   those thing togeth   my continu concern about the hous situat  though i think it is stabil  and a bit tighter market than perhap we expect   tend to weigh in my mind against my concern that the inflat path in our forecast will not be realiz   so i am content for the  e be with altern b   as i said in my comment ye day  if we continu to see the same pattern of thing  sooner rather than later we may have to contempl  to manag the risk in the economi  an upward movement in monetari polici  but i would not suggest that for today   turn to the languag  i suggest a coupl of day ago that we use section   from altern c   there have been some modif to section   in altern b   i am okay with those  but i continu to believ  as   presid    that section   in altern c is a bit cleaner  a bit shorter  and a bit more reflect overal as to the way i see thing   but i could go with either b or c at this point   vinc mention that we might want to think about section    the assess of risk   i had made a recommend there as well   one somewhat similar to what he was impli we might want to think about in term of the committe   s judg that inflat remain a predomin concern   i think that   s a littl stronger than    the committe judg that some inflat risk remain      i would take the remain phrase of that sentenc out   about near term polici firm be more like than polici eas   as i think that might be a big shock   but chang the languag to    inflat remain the predomin concern    and then pick up with    futur polici adjust    would make a small chang to the inflat risk section  would focus peopl a bit more firm on that  and would be a step in the right direct of caution the market about the possibl  though perhap not veri high yet  that our next move might be up rather than flat for a long period or down   so just to sum up  i am okay with altern b  section     i   d prefer section   from altern c  but i   m okay with b   i would make a chang in the assess of risk   i can live with it the way it is  but i think the altern c chang that i have recommend is a littl cleaner and move in the direct that vinc was talk about
presid    for the risk assess  in altern c  are you propos also the second sentenc
yes  just take out the phrase from    and    to    eas         the committe judg that inflat remain a predomin concern   futur polici adjust will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform
thank you   first vice presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   let me say at the outset that i was truli impress with your summari of everyon   s comment ye day   if i had known that you were listen so intent  i might have scrutin my own comment a littl more    laughter   mani particip  as you summar  report an improv outlook in hous and  perhap to a lesser extent  an improv outlook for inflat   to play off our immedi past chairman   s phrase  i think it might be appropri to guard against what i might call    prematur exuber    on both front with regard to the bottom out of hous and the improv in inflat   i don   t think we gain much at this point in the busi cycl by declar victori on the hous front  and i didn   t hear anyon say that   but i think we have to be cautious in our comment as it could well prove to be a drag go forward   for the overal economi  my own take is that we have more upsid potenti than perhap we have seen so far  put asid this morn   s report   corpor balanc sheet remain extrem strong   although i do not anticip that profit in      will match the level that we saw in       i see no reason that they would drop below trend  and perhap they will even come in abov trend   with that as a backdrop  the job outlook might even be brighter than we   ve discuss   if the job market remain firm  i would have everi reason to believ that the level of particip outlin in the  book might be underst  and so we could well have more posit incom effect from the consum go forward than we   ve wit or that we are think of for the futur   a final point relat to export   ye day even i look back over the inform we had with regard to the consist of a high level of perform of all the economi of the world   i couldn   t find a  e in which we had all the economi of the world perform at the level they are today   if you take that into consider and put asid  as dave so eloqu note  the special factor that we had in the fourth quarter in export  we could well see a more posit effect go forward in net export   on balanc  though  i still have a concern that the effect of hous go forward will be a drag   howev  i fulli anticip that  at the nation level at least  we will be abl to bounc back in the second half   if we do bounc back in the second half in hous  then gdp growth could well exceed what we are forecast now   all of that said  i   m veri comfort with the current stanc of polici   i   m not go to tri to wordsmith on the fli   my own bias is to be somewhat support of altern b as present this morn   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i   m veri comfort with altern b as far as the rate goe   given what we don   t know today  i think that   s exact where we ought to be   we will know more over the next six month about how that should be adjust as we move forward   on the languag  i feel that we would be better serv with section   and   of altern c   that languag describ my own view and much of what i heard ye day  especi as it say    seem to be rebound    and    some tentat sign of stabil         go forward the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace    is good languag   then  more import  i would like to see in section   that    read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month but remain elev      go forward  that is the essenti issu i think we have to watch besid the economi   that   s whi i believ that languag is prefer   the risk assess as describ in altern b is fine   thank you
mr  chairman
may i ask a clarifi question   it   s not actual clear to me  realli  that altern c  section     the inflat section   is more hawkish than altern b
it   s not
so you were speak in it favor not becaus it is more hawkish but for what reason
becaus it describ what is  and that is that inflat is elev
my concern is that  as the chairman has said  if you look at the three month annual rate for a whole bunch of measur of core     elev    might be overst it a bit
it isn   t to me  becaus     year over year is elev
the origin intent was to captur the last relat few month read  so there is a bit of ambigu there
my point is that what you   re describ is the systemat move down  and the margin is bring the averag down  and that   s what you say      read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month but remain elev      so long as we can convey that  i think the market will read us more proper becaus  even though the three month may be come down  it   s still     percent year over year rather than where i thought last june it would be  which was       so it has improv  but we   re not to where we need to be  and that   s my point
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i was a bit loquaci ye day and appar  for some  too anecdot explicit  if not excess    laughter   so i   ll be less friski this morn  shorter  and more to the point   i support altern b   i don   t want to wordsmith it   the onli word i would want to add  which i won   t get  is    worldwid     which i would insert after    resourc util      that   s a realiti  and that   s my recommend  mr  chairman   thank you   i   m sorri if i took too much  e
no problem  presid     thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support bluebook altern b   i think we should maintain the current stanc of polici becaus it is like to fo  an economi that gradual move toward a soft land   at the same  e  the upward bias in the risk assess is consist with my view that upsid risk do predomin for both growth and inflat   my best guess still is that this year   s growth will be slight below trend with the current stanc of polici   but as i indic ye day  for me the risk have shift more to the upsid given recent news   hous remain a concern  but i think the prospect for a realli serious hous collaps that spread to consum spend have diminish substanti   i am focus  as i said ye day  on upsid risk to activ  possibl come from consum spend   on the inflat front  the news has been good  and i continu to think for a varieti of reason  includ my view on persist  that core inflat will edg down over the year  but clear it is too soon to conclud that a new trend has set in   to me  the upsid risk to inflat seem palpabl  especi becaus labor market have tighten   although i agre with presid   that the phillip curv has certain appear to flatten in recent year  most es  that i have seen of phillip curv suggest that the relationship between chang in unemploy and chang in inflat  even though it may have becom smaller  is still signific   the lag may be long so that it effect might not show up veri much over the next coupl of year  but it is a signific sourc of long term risk   i   m pleas with the languag suggest for altern b   i think it effect updat develop sinc our last meet  and i favor keep the same word on the risk assess that we use last  e   that word still convey a sens of upsid bias   i don   t see a compel reason to chang  and i think it still work
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i support no chang in the feder fund rate today   from our comment ye day  it appear that not much has chang in term of our outlook for growth and inflat   so i   d prefer to make onli the chang to our statement that are necessari to keep us current with the intermeet data report   i   m comfort with the languag in altern b   it updat what we   ve heard in term of the current report   howev  i also agre with     s comment that our languag in our assess of risk has becom stale   i felt that way in decemb   but we   re not oper with a clean slate  and ani signific chang to the languag today are probabl go to be interpret as an attempt to signal some signific chang in our outlook or risk to that outlook   so i agre that today is not the day to do that  but i hope that we   ll have some further discuss about how to use some languag in our statement that is more durabl   for now  altern b look right to me   i have one final comment   for the record  i agre with vice chairman     s comment about not interpret our action today or our thought about the path for the fed fund rate as a suggest that we have a differ object on inflat   i think that vice chairman   made a good point  and i want to support it   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
just an interject   i would also like to be on record as not assum that the committe has an explicit object   individu around the tabl have indic comfort zone of one rang or anoth  but as far as i know the committe has no explicit object   we all want to have the best polici we can for inflat and growth in a given period
i tri to qualifi my comment with as mani qualifi as i could   i didn   t mean to impli that the committe had an implicit object
i agre   i was comment on my own outlook   becaus of some of the differ assumpt that we talk about ye day  i just didn   t want to be in the camp of a   percent object
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the sens of the committe that we should not be rais rate today   howev  i do think that  as we   ve all said  the inflat risk still domin and that we   re approach some veri import decis point in the next coupl of meet   if we look back  of cours  the primari risk to our growth forecast has been hous   we have seen an incred sharp declin  and mani of us have the sens that hous is stabil now   there   s still some uncertainti about that  but it seem to be stabil   onc it stabil  our attent will shift to the other part of our dual mandat   to price stabil   as i think we have all said  we   re uncomfort with the current rate of inflat   there has been some improv  we   ll take that to the bank   we   re happi with that   but there is still a lot of uncertainti about the futur cours of inflat  and the project in the  book and the bluebook are not encourag to me   my comfort zone is   to   percent  so i   m in the     percent categori   in view of that rang  as vinc said  we have work to do   i agre with   and sandi that we shouldn   t interpret altern b as say that each individu has a target of   percent   our project for inflat is    percent in both year  and that is clear abov that target   we have said we   re concern about inflat   we said that last  e  and i think it was well put   but we should make even stronger statement in the minut about the cost of inflat run abov forecast and about the damag it can do to the economi on a long term basi   as i said  i don   t think we have the luxuri of wait until inflat rise befor we act   we have to be forward look   the next coupl of meet are go to be import becaus we   ll know a lot more about whether hous realli has stabil further and what the inflat number will look like   in term of the languag  i   m comfort with altern b as it   s state   i like the refer to the high level of resourc util in section    so i would not chang the languag at this  e
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   as i comment ye day  it seem to me that develop  in term of both real growth and core inflat  have been posit recent  and i would say the same thing about the outlook   against that background  i think that maintain the feder fund rate as in altern b is the appropri polici decis   i   m will to be patient to see how much disinfl we get from here   but i guess my patienc isn   t infinit  and so at some point  if we don   t get ani more than is anticip in the  book  we   re go to have to consid further action   but at the moment  that   s not a princip concern of mine   so that   s my judgment about the stanc of polici for now   as far as the languag is concern  i have a prefer for section   and   from altern c   i find those more appropri than the express under altern b   as far as section   is concern  there could be a case for some abbrevi version along the line that presid   suggest   altern b  section    has realli serv us well overal  and so my judgment is that at this point it   s not worth tri to chang that languag   so i would recommend marri section   and   from altern c with section   from b as be about as good as we can do at the moment
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   by way of prefac   i didn   t mention this ye day  but my semiannu forecast project core pce inflat fall to     for        and growth rise from     to     in         this repres both a more rapid return to price stabil and a higher rate of trend growth than provid in the  book   my forecast take serious the instruct to assum appropri monetari polici  perhap more serious than i have taken it in the past   i think it is like to requir that the polici be more aggress than assum in the  book and that communic be forc about our intent to bring inflat down   i think the forecast that i have submit is both feasibl and desir becaus i think we don   t need to use the output gap as our sole mean of hammer inflat expect and we don   t need to wait near a decad  as in the bluebook simul   although i believ that the appropri polici is like to requir a higher fund rate path at some point this year  i   m not too uncomfort leav it unchang today   i welcom the recent good news on core inflat  and like presid  n  i   m will to wait and see whether the good news continu   howev  i have been disturb over the past year and a half  as i have told you  about the extent to which short run core inflat and longer run inflat expect appear to be sensit to energi price movement   we appear to have condit peopl to expect core inflat to rise whenev energi price surg   this will pose a problem for us if energi price rise substanti or if the current lull in core inflat prove to be onli the transitori effect from the recent fall in energi price   both hypothes seem reason plausibl to me for the come year or two   so i believ  as presid   and other have said  that we   re like to face anoth inflat challeng later this year   i think it would help our caus if our polici move were coupl with better communic  but that is a discuss for later today   for now  i   m prepar to support stand pat   i agre with presid   and other around the tabl who prefer the languag in altern c for section   and     i also agre with presid   about the languag in altern c for section     i think that i read    predomin concern    as a littl stronger and better calibr to our view   or at least my view   than the languag in b   i also agre strong with vice chairman   that stand pat today  sn   t impli a   percent target
vice chairman    vice chairman   i   m not sure i understand      with regard to section    what is your prefer
presid     s suggest
yes  presid
this is the problem with edit on the fli   i had recommend that you go direct from    the committe judg that inflat remain the predomin concern    to the next sentenc      futur polici adjust will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth      and so on   howev  leav out the phrase that is in altern b now in section        the extent and  e of addit firm that may be need to address those risk      actual   make that sentenc of section   of altern c somewhat weaker than altern b   i   m get readi to take my suggest off the tabl  laughter  becaus i think that you may be on to someth with altern b  and it may be better to leav it that way becaus it   suggest addit firm as oppos to leav it open
it   s a fair point   i   d agre with that
i take my suggest off the tabl
i withdraw my support for your previous suggest    laughter
you can   t withdraw it  she   s not make it    laughter  presid    pleas just say a word about how we are link energi price and core   in our public remark   for exampl  my speech on energi   i have talk about the import of unlink those two
yes  inde   but if you just plot the two for the past year and a half  you see a kind of two month or three month echo into the core   you calcul the cross correl  they were pretti high befor       they were low from      to        they   ve been high again sinc   my read of the financi press coverag of macroeconom condit follow the hurrican in late       is that we saw a sudden burst of refer to the macroeconom condit of the     s   i suspect   it is hard to disprov this one way or anoth   that rhetor harken back to slow growth and energi price caus higher inflat induc  in the public   s mind  a sens that  when energi price surg  growth is go to be lower   you saw the polici path come down in septemb of        and you   re go to see higher core inflat  and that   s what we saw that fall   to some extent  we tri to speak strong of our desir to hold inflat down  but in hindsight we left that associ in the public   s mind   so i just think this is a condit that appear now to have been built into expect
governor   has a two hander
a two hander on the now disgrac propos on section     laughter   i think the way to rais it back is just take the phrase    the committe judg that inflat remain the predomin concern    and then move on to the sentenc in altern b that start with    the extent and  e of ani addit firm
we could definit do that
if you want to keep it  i think that   s the way to bring it back to grace
presid   has an intervent
i was go to make exact the same suggest   to put it on the tabl for consider by presid      laughter
it also has the virtu of minim the number of word chang and just substitut a phrase from the minut from last  e  for those of you who think that   s the best way to go
but i just rais a question  for those who are make the suggest  becaus i   d like to hear your respons   in say that inflat is the predomin concern  we are acknowledg more explicit than we have befor that we have other concern  that is  we   re in some sens bring into the assess the presumpt that there are concern other than inflat  but we are perhap more concern about hous than we were befor  this is simpli a semant issu   in altern b  we don   t acknowledg other concern   neither of these thing is quit accur  i agre   i just want to point that out and ask for your respons   presid
i think sever of us have use the    predomin concern    languag  so i don   t see it as like to induc a dramat chang in assess about our view
the languag that we have had for some  e has shown concern about cool as a result of the hous market   whether we have explicit refer to it as a concern or not  clear it has been a concern   i think that    predomin concern    is a bit stronger than    some inflationari risk remain    and that such languag correct reflect the sens of the peopl around the tabl   now  it may be too much   i don   t want to speak for    but at one point he thought it was too much
well  no  i   d just make the observ that we debat this befor and we debat sever  e the question about whether the best introductori phrase to that balanc of risk assess was exact that languag   the problem in do it now   this is just one man   s view   is that i think it will be read as a signific alter of our signal  and on the strength of what we   ve discuss about chang to the outlook in decemb  we can   t justifi a signific chang in the signal   the second reason not to do it is the one that the chairman rais   it introduc a slight infelicit frame when there is some risk that peopl will read everyth we say through the prism of whether we   re in the midst of alter implicit the hierarchi of object that we have as a committe in some broad sens   that   s not the way you frame it  mr  chairman
i couldn   t have frame it that way    laughter
but i think we haven   t chang our view of the outlook enough to justifi that signific a chang in the signal
intervent  presid
mr  chairman  i think we have to do this against the background of what we said the last  e   if you go back to section   from decemb  we were cautious about growth   in section   under altern b now  we   re basic say that we are see firmer econom growth   i don   t want to overdo this  and i think vice chairman     s point is absolut correct here   let   s think of where we   re come from and indic the realiti of what we   ve talk about   we are concern about inflat   use the word    predomin    excess emphas our concern   at some point we may need to tighten  but let   s think of this as the migrat from where we were in decemb   i think the migrat is adequ captur in the languag that we have in altern b
let me also support   on this   i have a slight differ slant here  which is that the inflat number have actual come in better   the concern here is that the economi is come in stronger and that it may necessit tighten   but we don   t want to give the impress that we think the inflat number are wors and that   s the big problem   it   s realli a perspect about go forward  and that   s an addit reason for not chang the languag in this case
may i just make one observ  mr  chairman   when you move from b    to c     you make anoth chang as well   b    talk about inflat risk  wherea c    talk about inflat   so you are chang   you   re actual indic distast for the current level of inflat  wherea the previous one could be read as    oh  there could be outcom that are on the high side
altern c  section     the same thing
that   s a good point
ani other intervent
mr  chairman
just to clarifi  i   m assum then we   re float back toward altern b  leav the fourth section as is
oh  you can speak for yourself    laughter
oh  i like that  but i   m not sure that   s where we land   laughter
okay   i think we   re go to have to assert order here   ani other intervent   presid
i would just say that i   m comfort with go back to altern b  section    but one way to help move this forward would be just to strengthen our concern in the minut about inflat and stick with b
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i do favor an unchang fed fund rate target   i prefer section   and   from altern c   as i read the convers around the tabl  i don   t hear anyon say that we need to prime the market for a probabl increas in the fed fund rate in march   possibl in june is my sens  probabl later if we get bad news on inflat and a stronger economi than anticip  i went back in the statement to when we start work on this languag   this languag realli date from march or pretti close to it   in march we said     some further polici firm may be need      then in may we said     some further polici firm may yet be need      in june we said     the extent and  e of ani addit firm       that may be need      i think that  when we start this languag  we had the sens that we were on the edg of need addit tighten   certain the paus in august was not  as i recal it  view as necessarili perman  we call it a paus  we didn   t call it a stop   i had the sens in august and septemb that  if we had had continu escal of inflat  we were readi to move higher   we were say that our best guess was that we were go to hang where we were but that we might be on the edg of tighten   that was my sens at the  e  and i think that   s the way the market read it   over the succeed month  condit chang a lot   the economi came in for a while softer than anticip   hous was in a deeper declin than we thought   inflat number came in on the favor side   not dramat better  but certain it was a favor develop   so the polici mean of the languag has chang as a consequ of the evolut from the  e we first adopt it  we need to view the languag in term of how  let   s say  a graduat student five year from now  look at the transcript  will read the discuss around the tabl   he or she will say that in decemb  probabl octob but certain in decemb and at this meet  the committe was not on the edg of signal an increas to the market   that   s the problem with section   in altern c   it   s a fair clear indic that we serious want to signal the market that we   re on the edg of rais the rate in march  and i just don   t think that   s where we are   so i think that we need to view the languag in term not onli of the current situat but also of it evolut  and sever peopl have comment that  of cours  we are where we are   this is an ideal  e to move away from that languag becaus the market commentari is veri much in the direct of expect that the committe is go to hold the rate constant for some  e   that   s in the market commentari  that   s in the futur market   there won   t be an easier  e to move away from this languag than right now  and that was the purpos of the memo that i distribut   i would realli like to see us get back toward the english languag mean of the word rather than the inherit polici mean that this has come to have as a consequ of it repetit
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor keep rate unchang today  and i favor the languag in altern b in all the section   tri to be cautious  look at the number that just came out  and reflect back to ye day   s discuss about the nairu  last night i look some more at the exhibit   that the staff present ye day   i look at the bottom right panel  which show the labor forc particip rate of those over      there are a lot of us babi boomer  and we   re general healthi folk  and it realli is unclear what we   re go to do   the babi boomer have chang particip in the labor forc throughout our generat   we were the generat that brought women into the labor forc   we now are go to live twenti year after age     and we   re not go to sit idl becaus we   re go to be healthier and we have a lot of skill   the addit skill set that we have could actual mitig the shortag of some skill worker   folk probabl want more flexibl   they don   t want to be on a payrol  but they may want to take a job now and then or work on a contract   whatev histor nairu pattern we have  they are go to be test by the chang labor forc particip due to the babi boomer  that   s a big unknown  but it clear affect potenti growth  the output gap  and inflat pressur  so i realli don   t want to signal anyth   this will play out over a long period  but it is the reason  when i look at the    lower nairu    altern scenario in the  book  that i read it as    higher particip rate     and i want to be cautious   that   s whi i can   t go to altern c   i don   t want to signal as much worri about inflat   i also want to be care that we don   t go as strong as call someth    rebound    becaus i don   t want peopl to think we   re go to go back to mid   percent growth rate with hous still as soft as it is on a sustain basi   we do still need to watch hous   the strong job market will put leg under the growth side of this  and i like the chang that were made in section     i think firmer growth is exact what we want to talk about  so i like the tone that we   ve set in the chang in b
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like the other  i favor maintain the feder fund rate at it current level today   as presid   point out  the strength of the data on employ and spend   impli a higher natur real rate   at the same  e  the inflat data have come in realli more favor than we expect and have point to the moder that we   ve all been hope for   today   s inform confirm that the pce was as low as the staff had thought it was go to be in the fourth quarter and that  at least by the most comprehens compens measur we have  the pickup in compens remain veri  veri damp and might even be consist with a lower nairu than is built into the staff forecast   so balanc these two  i think we   re right where we are   vice chairman   said someth ye day about be patient  and i think we can be patient at least for a littl while longer   at the same  e i agre with everyon els  as i said ye day  that the strength in demand  the low unemploy rate  and the sluggish rise in product suggest that there are upsid risk to the further moder declin in inflat that we   re all seek  on the languag  i   d prefer altern b up and down  and let me give some reaction to the other   i have the same issu with section   that governor bie just mention   it seem to me that the word    rebound     particular after we just publish a     percent q   might impli that this is a process that is continu   the staff   s project is that  if anyth  they would write q  down a bit   i don   t know how peopl would read the word    rebound     it might have more of a sens of continu strength than we see   that   s whi i like the chang that were made to altern b   it is now a littl more backward look      recent indic have suggest somewhat firmer econom growth      that   s kind of what we know   we are also project in a general way moder growth go forward   the word    rebound    in section   has a littl more momentum than i am comfort with  on section    if we went to altern c  we would need to be clear that we are talk about twelv month inflat that remain elev  and that   s     percent on the core pce   if we use that first sentenc  we would need to get a littl more technic than we usual get in the announc and say    improv modest in recent month but remain elev on a twelv month basi    so as not to confus peopl about the recent month   that consider make me favor stick with altern b   i do think the high level of resourc util is at the foundat of my concern about the inflat risk   it mean that labor and product market are fair tight  and if there are increas in cost  busi will more easili pass them through   so i like keep that refer to resourc util in section     it give a littl flavor   a rational   for whi we   re worri about the inflat process  and i would prefer to keep that rational in there  on the risk assess  i   d stick with where we are   i don   t think anyon misunderstand what we   re do   it is less stale in some sens than it was in decemb    laughter  in decemb i had my doubt becaus we realli were more worri about the downsid risk to output   it   s more indic of where we are today than it was in decemb   with regard to presid pool   s point  it   say    the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need     so it leav open the possibl that it isn   t the next meet  that it might be anoth meet   i disagre with     s point that somehow it give us a sens that we   re more certain that we   re go to need to tighten than we realli are   it just say    ani addit firm that may be need     so i don   t think it say we   re definit go to firm   the market understand what we mean   the market   s reaction to incom data over the intermeet period has been veri construct   we   re not say anyth that   s get in the way of the stabil properti of the market  and on section   i   d leav well enough alon   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me spend a minut talk about a market issu befor turn to the languag   we   ve talk a bit and   talk a bit about option impli measur of uncertainti about the polici path  which are near histor low   that   s certain the case now  and it was the case when we last met   even though the expect path of polici and market price have move much closer to our own in the past two month  it   s as though the market are say   to be a touch glib      alway certain  rare right      i would have thought that we would have seen market uncertainti about the polici path chang along with their view that we were go to take less dramat action over the past six week   that tell me that market measur of uncertainti may not be altogeth accur here  and that   s a troubl sign as we tri to figur out whether they are realli tell us about uncertainti or whether they are a separ bet unrel to our futur polici action  today i  too  favor maintain the feder fund rate target  and i general share the view express in altern b   as governor kohn suggest  the jump from    mix    to    rebound    as the oper word suggest a reaction to the data that strike me as somewhat more posit  at the same  e that my own sens hasn   t chang dramat over the past six week   while the market seem to have move dramat  we have realli been a rock in this process   the market have come closer to us  and so i   d rather not appear over reactiv to some veri recent data  with respect to section    i was concern at one point that the word    the committe judg that some inflat risk remain    seem a littl too dovish   through the minut and the speech of our colleagu  that word has come to mean exact that inflat is more of a concern than anyth els   so in some way it has becom ossifi but true  and so i don   t see the benefit of go to altern c   with that  i general support altern b and suspect that we shouldn   t be make mani more dramat chang than that
thank you   governor
thank you   i  too  support altern b and maintain the feder fund rate at      percent   i agre with mani of the argument that were made befor  and so i won   t repeat them   i   ll go to the languag   on section    i think it would be an overreact or appear to be an overreact to the current data if we sudden went from where we were to    rebound      governor kohn suggest that    rebound    has problemat implic for go forward   that is particular true if we think that at least     percentag point of the     percent will be taken away in revis   altern b veri nice encompass that  even if we didn   t know that the number would be a bit firmer than we expect   i also think that in section   it   s problemat to use the word    in recent month but remain elev    becaus in recent month core inflat hasn   t been elev  it look as though the number have been fair consist below   and so fair consist below where they had been six or twelv month ago on averag   that word give a mislead impress   in section    even though i had suggest that altern  i did so realli to clarifi the discuss becaus i thought some of the discuss was not focus on the issu but on some of the word  though we had a veri good discuss   i have been and remain in favor of not chang the languag  main becaus the market seem to have learn to interpret it the way we think would be appropri   exact as governor kohn said  the market is react to the data in a veri sensibl way  given our perspect on the like evolut of the data   sinc they seem to be kind of get the data and the perspect on what we   re like to do right  it would seem to be an inopportun  e to chang the languag   thank you veri much
thank you   governor
i have a slight differ take on where the economi is in that i think the inflat number we have seen recent are like to be reflect someth that   s actual happen   so i   m a littl more sanguin on the inflat front than i was befor and than the  book is   i don   t see inflat risk on the upsid  which is the way mani peopl describ the situat  partial becaus i think we   re go to do our job proper  but i am a littl concern about give that impress outsid   howev  i worri about the upsid risk for output   in that context  the implic is that we should think about some upward bias to the futur path of the feder fund rate   clear  a chang in the feder fund rate is not need today   that   s no surpris  and i think we   re all agre on that   howev  we have a situat in which the real interest rate that will be appropri in term of keep inflat from rise has certain gone up  in that sens  we are more like to rais rate in the futur as a result of what   s happen recent  in term of the languag  i am a bit mix about section     i lean toward a littl stronger languag and  therefor  was lean a littl toward use altern c for section     but i worri a bit about the word    rebound     so i   m not sure   section   in altern b is fine with me as well   a littl mix there   i feel strong that we not move to section   in altern c becaus it give the impress that the inflat risk have gone up  wherea the real side is more of a concern to me   that concern relat as well to my view of section    for which i again strong support altern b   the issu here is not so much that inflat risk right now are the problem but that output may be stronger than we expect  which mean that to keep inflat under control we will have to rais rate in the futur   again  for that reason i strong support altern b for section    thank you
thank you   mr  vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the most import thing for us to do today  and it   s realli the onli thing we need to do  is to convey a sens that  on the basi of recent data  we see somewhat less downsid risk to growth and mayb somewhat less upsid risk to inflat   but the princip issu we face is whether we   re go to see inflat come down far enough with the current constel of financi condit  which we   ve help induc   that   s the issu that we will be debat for some  e   it   s possibl  mayb probabl  that we will have to tighten further  but we don   t know that yet   i don   t think we need to chang our basic signal about the probabl that we   re go to have to tighten more  and i   m veri comfort with the languag in altern b   of cours  all the altern are flaw   altern b seem the least flaw among the altern   an interest question is whether refer to current core inflat as elev today is help   you could amend b    to say     although core inflat remain elev  recent read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month      but you can   t realli do that without do what don suggest   that is  distinguish more clear between a twelv month and a three month rate   and it   s hard to argu that do so is realli worthwhil  so i   m comfort with altern b as it is draft now
thank you   thank you all for your insight   my recommend also is to take no action and to maintain a bias toward further tighten   i have heard veri clear the committe   s concern about inflat risk  and i recogn that we may have to take further action in that direct later this year   i would counsel patienc for the moment for sever reason   first  the level of the feder fund rate is probabl not too far from where we need to be   i didn   t hear anyon suggest that we were    or     basi point away from where we need to be   second  we have clear convey the bias of our polici  and i don   t think there would be a problem with our take action   no one is go to accus us of not have provid suffici warn   third  there   s the confluenc of data that we   ve seen sinc the last meet  includ some improv in the inflat data  which give us  if noth els  a bit of breath space to observ what i believ remain some relat signific uncertainti about the evolut of the real economi   the hous market has look a bit more solid  and the worst outcom have been made less like   but given that we have the breath space to observ how that evolv  i think that wait a bit more would be wise  the other point that i   d like to make   i   ve made it befor as have other  but i think it is quit import   is the endogen of financi condit   the five year and ten year bond rate are    to    basi point below the fed fund rate   that has sever implic   the first is that we don   t want to complet ignor the inform that may be in that   more import from a polici point of view  we could  depend on the inflow of data  see an increas of         or    basi point in long term rate   mortgag rate  in particular   without ani overt action on our part but simpli by maintain our stanc and our languag   we are veri well posit in that respect in term of the way market are like to respond to data that confirm our sens but not the market   s current sens  with respect to the languag  i listen with interest to the discuss   my propos is to take altern b   but i   d like to discuss a bit some of the suggest that have been made   on section    i share the concern that some have mention about use the word    rebound      i think that it impli that we are see the     percent continu into the near term   i don   t think that is the central tendenc of our forecast   altern b  section      i believ  clear signal that we have seen a chang from decemb  when we note that there was    substanti cool of the hous market    and that    recent indic have been mix      there is clear a movement toward a stronger assess of the real economi  skip to the risk assess for a moment  i share peopl   s concern about the accuraci of the languag   like mani of you  i am reluct to chang that assess  given that there   s not a sharp chang in our polici view  simpli becaus this has becom recogn by the market   i think it   s reason well interpret   as i suggest with respect to the    inflat remain the predomin concern    languag  it   s not entir clear how that would be interpret   in ani case  there   s a risk that there would be a percept of a signific polici shift  which is not intend  we do need to think hard about this languag   i note that we   ll be discuss in march a number of issu   perhap we could ask for a bit of discuss about how go forward we assess the risk and what kind of languag we use in describ the polici direct   i think that would be use  and if we are go to do it  my recommend would be to wait anoth meet or two until we either see a signific chang in the outlook or agre among us to a more systemat way of state risk assess  on section   regard inflat  i   ve been go back and forth listen to the discuss  we have drop the word    elev      we could  i think  take the first sentenc of altern c  section        read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month but remain elev      the sens in which that is true is that the fourth quarter core pce was      which is abov some peopl   s target   so it   s not grossli inconsist   at the same  e  the word    modest    convey the sens that we are not complet on board with the idea that inflat has made a substanti move downward or that the magnitud is enorm   i remain open  if you have addit comment about my recommend  to find a way to incorpor the word    elev      but at the moment  i think it is somewhat more accur to use the word    modest    to convey the sens that the improv in inflat is still not that larg   so have discuss these issu and have note that our bias remain clear to the upsid and that we must certain leav open the possibl of futur tighten later this year  my recommend is to take no action and to use altern b as written   anyon like to comment   presid pool
i have one question here   do we intend in the minut to make clear our general   well     expect    is too strong   but tilt or bias in the direct of tighten later in the year  which i think match what you just said
presid pool  i respond to someth that you said in the go round   i think the languag of altern b  section   is not say that we   re about to move at the next meet   it say essenti that the next move is more like to be up  but it   s veri clear that    extent and  e    could mean that it will be some meet befor we respond   i thought the tenor of the meet in the discuss of the econom situat was quit clear that our concern about inflat remain paramount  and i   m sure that will be reflect in the minut
my question had to do with the coordin between the statement and the minut   whether we   re go to indic clear in the minut the sens around the tabl about that tighten   my sens was that we view tighten later in the year as more probabl than we did certain in decemb   that   s all i   m ask about
i   m not sure we   ve done this conscious  but the way the discuss in the minut has evolv in the past sever cycl is that we   ve made an effort not to provid more nuanc in the polici signal that is in that last paragraph   in fact  we   ve adopt the simplifi convent of pretti much repeat the part of the polici statement that is suppos to signal a judgment about what polici is like to be go forward   the minut provid   and this is valuabl   a much more textur sens than the statement can about the central tendenc of the committe   s view of the futur   i don   t think it make sens for us to tri to agre now to provid in the minut more textur about what   s  in effect  an elabor of the risk assess in section    it is hard to do while negoti the minut and there   s not much virtu in tri to do it   all the emphasi should go toward make sure that we character the sens of the committe about the rational for our decis  which essenti concern how our view of the outlook has chang and what the varianc of view is around that
first of all  i   m fine with your propos   i would have gone with the other propos  but neither set of languag bind us  and that is the main thing that i agre with   that bring me to presid pool   s point   i don   t have a sens that we have a great increas come later in the year  and i don   t want to convey that such was the sens of the committe   now  if he   as an individu and would like that in the minut  that   s one thing   but i would not want to have the minut read as someth more than what i heard here today   tri to defin a committe sens of this that wasn   t in the languag here would make the minut more confus   so i   m okay with this languag  and i associ myself with vice chairman   on the use of the minut
there are differ of view about this around the tabl   a coupl of peopl have said that they think it   s like that some  this year we will think hard about rais rate   i would trust that such view would be reflect in the minut   is it your understand  vice chairman    that our convent regard the minut is that we expung from them ani comment within the committe convey a sens of how we think polici is like to evolv at longer horizon
i don   t think it   s a problem regard that penul  paragraph of the minut  in which the staff tri to captur the textur of what peopl say about their thought on what polici is like to do   but in the basic frame paragraph at the end  which is design to captur whatev we as a committe are will to say about what   s like  we   ve tri not to elabor on or add nuanc to the basic statement   so i guess i   m agre with you      i would have thought that the penul  paragraph might describ whatev the rang of view is about that but not tri to captur the consensus of the committe
the issu that presid pool rais was whether the minut would like be out of sync with the statement   what vice chairman   mention and i know to be the case is that the last paragraph of the minut is alway the statement   so while the minut might have a nuanc discuss and possibl tilt a bit to peopl   s concern about resourc util or inflat  howev it get state  and suggest some possibl of upward movement rather than downward movement  the paragraph that relat back to what we actual said in the statement would tend to bring the discuss back and make the two harmoni  as they should be  when peopl read the minut  they are like to say there   s a littl more upsid risk or a littl less downsid risk   that   s what i heard around the tabl   i don   t think that   s inconsist with what you suggest in term of a statement
thank you   governor kohn
thank you   presid   said much of what i was go to say   the minut will indic the tenor of the discuss  which was that  despit some good inflat news  we still see plenti of upsid risk   that will convey the basic view here   i   d be veri concern about be explicit about an interest rate increas down the line   we will be discuss this topic in a few minut  i hope   laughter  about how explicit the committe should be in it forecast about the futur path of interest rate   we haven   t made that decis yet  so i   m a littl nervous about make it realli explicit or even implicit in the minut   thank you  mr  chairman
i thought  mr  chairman  that you describ a convent a number of meet ago  and i thought you express it veri well   the statement that come out of the meet is a consensus statement of the committe  the minut describ the rang of view that are express   that   s consist with the way we   ve been oper  and i think it has serv us well
may  i ask one other question
i just was wonder  sinc we   re focus on altern b  how the staff think the market will react to the current version
as we relat in the bluebook and as a number of you said  market particip understand the risk assess  and they don   t expect polici action or a chang in the risk assess   so it   s hard to see that there would be ani reaction at all   i wonder what our new account manag would say as well
i would agre with that   you have somewhat firmer growth but better inflat news  and so the committe is about in the same place on net that it was befor   i would be veri surpris to see much of a market reaction at all
thank you   readi to vote   ms
i   ll read the direct from page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent     the risk assess      the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform     chairman bernank  vice chairman    governor bie presid hoenig   governor kohn  governor    presid   governor     presid    presid pool governor    yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
thank you   this would be a good  e to have a fifteen minut coffe break   coffe break
the second portion of our meet is devot to communic   presid   submit a memo about extern communic that suggest there might be some uneas in the committe   in the hope of somewhat reduc that uneas  i thought i would tri to state one more  e what i was tri to get at when we discuss this issu befor   perhap without take too much  e away from the import discuss we want to have today  if anyon would like to respond to that  i   d be certain happi to hear  i and a few other peopl had two concern about talk in public about our communic issu   the first was that we would tri to avoid interf with the ongo discuss and the develop of consensus within the committe   the second was to tri to avoid creat ani unnecessari polit problem that might complic the adopt of whatev we decid we   d like to do   so my recommend would be to ask yourselv two question   the first would be     would the remark that i will give elicit opposit or signific disagr from other member of the committe      if the answer is    yes     then by give those remark  you risk the possibl that other peopl might be in some sens compel to respond  and then we are have the debat in public   my sens of that is that therefor it would probabl not be a great idea to give a speech specif on the pros and con of inflat target  for exampl  even if you tri to take a somewhat neutral posit becaus it   s inevit difficult to take a neutral posit  howev  i want to be clear   i think that it   s perfect okay for peopl to talk about broader theme   the import of low and stabl inflat  the import of credibl  the import of commit  and the import of clear communic   i see no problem there becaus those are broad  general issu that i think everyon around the tabl would agre with and that don   t necessarili speak to the issu that we   re still discuss within the committe   the other question i   d suggest you ask is     would someth that i say today be like to end up be repeat to the chairman in congression tes oni       laughter   that is a particular concern of mine   the lesson i would take from it is that  if you do talk about the import of low and stabl inflat  which is certain a good thing to do  you also make the point that we are  of cours  commit to our dual mandat and that one of the princip reason that we seek price stabil is to strengthen the real economi  so those are my thought   i want to reiter that this is guidanc  not regul   i ask peopl just to use their judgment and not to feel constrain about talk about broad issu  particular issu that would command wide agreement in the committe  and you certain don   t have to disavow ani previous posit   if you are press too far on an issu  you can certain alway say  that the committe is current discuss these issu and that we   ll be say more about this in the futur   again  i certain had no intent and have no intent of tri to censor peopl   s word   i hope that you will continu to talk about the broad issu of price stabil and communic  which are so critic to our function as a central bank   i don   t want to take a great deal of  e from our broader discuss  but if anyon would like to react  certain this would be the  e   presid
i think this is realli clear  common sens  and veri construct
thank you   if there are no other comment  i   ll turn the meet over to governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i would begin by say a few word on process   i   ve had a number of question from peopl about where we are in the process of consid communic issu and how we see the next coupl of meet   i hope that today we can come up with some sens of the central tendenc or an express of the committe on where we want to go with the project and the forecast process   i don   t expect complet agreement on where we want to go   i don   t expect everi question to be answer   but i think we can probabl narrow down the rang of thing we   re look at and get a sens of where the modal committe member would like to go with this   i also recogn that the decis we make on other aspect of communic and monetari polici   for exampl  the numer specif of price stabil   would then come back and interact with how you might want to use the forecast  in march  we will revisit the issu of the numer specif of price stabil  which we discuss in octob   i   ve ask the staff to work on some materi   basic i   ve ask them to take the piec of the memo from januari       that talk about thing such as rang versus point  which index or modif of an index  the transform of an index  price level versus inflat target  the horizon  if ani  over which we ought to specifi this   some of these more specif issu that we need to think about if we   re go to have a numer specif for price stabil  the sens come out of the octob meet was that the vast major of peopl on the committe want to move in this direct  although exact what they want wasn   t clear   so i   ve told the staff to assum that the committe is move in this direct  and now the task is not to debat that whole thing again but rather to get a littl more specif   by get more specif we can test our own notion of how this would work out and just how much in favor we are   the march meet will go two day  and we   ll be discuss those thing   the chairman has put on the tabl anoth item for the march meet  which is the issu concern the announc and the balanc of risk   if we have  e in march  it would be great to get to it   if not  short thereaft we need to think about the direct in which we seem to be move on both the project side and the numer specif side and their interact with the announc  the minut  and some of these other modal we have for communic with the public  i would hope that after the march committe meet  the subcommitte   presid  n  presid    and i   could take stock of where we have gotten to  how the issu have been narrow  where the committe seem to be head  what the open issu are  and if we don   t get to the announc or the minut in march  how these thing might interact   then we could come back to the committe in june  the next two day meet  and ask for some more guidanc and just keep push this process to a conclus   we need both some dri run on whatev we decid to do and a strategi for roll that out to the public and the public   s elect repres  onc we get closer to a decis  then we can talk about how to proceed on those two issu   so that   s the general process that i   m envis for the next coupl of meet  mr  chairman   i will turn the meet back to you    actual i   m suppos to call on dave reifschneid to start the staff brief
thank you  governor kohn     doyl    reinhart  and i will be speak this morn on the materi label    staff present on produc and publish econom forecast      as the top panel of your first exhibit note  the feder reserv regular provid the public with inform on the outlook in the monetari polici report  congression tes oni  the fomc minut  and the statement   you presum undertak this effort with an eye toward advanc the goal of econom perform  public discours  your own intern discours  and effici oper   a key issu in your deliber today is whether chang your practic in this area would advanc these goal further or achiev a better tradeoff   as shown in the bottom panel  this morn       and i will address three question relat to this issu   i will start with the product and public option that are open to the committe     will then discuss what we can learn from the intern experi   final    will consid the govern issu that would aris under altern arrang   mani way of chang your current practic are possibl   exhibit   focus on one fundament choic that you confront in this regard   name  how to produc the forecast   as note in the top panel  you have three main option   first  you could continu to produc independ forecast  with each of you sole respons for your own forecast   second  you could choos to produc a singl central forecast  work togeth as the whole committe or deleg respons to a subcommitte   final  you could adopt an intermedi posit and produc    materi use by mr  reifschneid  mr  doyl  and mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     coordin forecast  with your individu project condit on common assumpt for factor such as oil price and fiscal polici   as highlight in the bottom panel  your choic among these three option has import implic for  among other thing  your communic with the public and the oper cost of forecast relat activ   to see this  consid one import communic task  the tell of the central stori of the outlook   as note in the first row under the independ option  distil an inform messag from multipl forecast is difficult  even if those forecast provid a consider amount of detail about the outlook   in fact  it is an open question as to whether it would alway be possibl to craft a central narrat that would command the consent of a major of the committe  given the divers of your view   move to the right  the distil task under the coordin approach might be simplifi a bit becaus your individu forecast would share some common element  nevertheless  tell the central stori would remain difficult if  after settl on  say  a common path for oil price  you still disagre mark about it econom implic   in contrast  as the rightmost entri note  the tell of the central stori would be relat easi under the central option becaus   abstract from the difficulti of produc such a forecast   the singl project would provid a clear and coher messag   your product choic has import implic for anoth communic task   convey the divers of view on the committe about the outlook   as note in the second row of the tabl  the independ option natur reveal this divers through your individu forecast   to a larg degre  the same is true under the coordin option  although condit on common assumpt would obscur some of the possibl sourc of divers   final  the central option would not reveal the divers of your think unless the publish outlook summari includ addit comment about altern view   your product choic also has import implic for the oper cost of both produc and publish the forecast   forecast product is a relat low cost task under the independ option becaus you incur no expens in coordin your forecast effort   still  you could find yourselv devot more resourc to forecast if you chose to publish your individu project   move to the coordin option  here prepar the forecast would be more cost becaus you would need to spend  e choos a common set of assumpt  but you could limit these cost if you settl on a standard process for this task   final  produc a central forecast would be veri cost  especi at first  becaus of the wide rang of econom issu on which you would need to reach consensus   given the practic difficulti of achiev such agreement with a group as larg as the fomc  make this option feasibl might requir deleg the prepar of the unifi project to a subcommitte   final  there are the oper cost of forecast public   this task may be burdensom under the independ option  especi if all of you wish to particip activ in the prepar of the text as you now do with the minut   in fact  given the inher difficulti of craft an accur and inform central messag from multipl forecast  negoti the languag of an outlook summari as a group would like be even more  e consum than prepar the minut if the summari is to be anyth more than a bare bone list of number   publish the forecast under the coordin option also may be burdensom  for the same reason   howev  choos the central option could make forecast public less cost  part becaus you would alreadi have reach agreement on the econom factor influenc the outlook   you could reduc cost further if you deleg respons for both produc and summar the forecast to a subcommitte   the top panel of your next exhibit consid some of your mani public choic   if you choos to continu produc individu forecast  you could releas more inform about those project   for exampl  by publish the forecast themselv   such a step would reveal more about the divers of your think  although it might risk divert attent from ani consensus about the outlook  anoth option avail under all three product choic would be to provid more forecast detail  either numer or in qualit form   such a step would facilit tell a more inform stori about the outlook  although it would also creat addit dimens for disagr   a third possibl would be to lengthen the forecast period   this step could reveal more fulli how you expect ani econom shock and imbal to play out and thus might enhanc public understand of the basi for your polici action  it could also provid more inform about your polici object and expect for the long run   a fourth possibl would be to publish inform about the outlook more frequent than you now do   such a chang might help to clarifi how you see the forecast and monetari polici respond to incom data  but it would also increas oper cost proportion   final  you have the option of publish fan chart and confid interv for your project   this inform could help to emphas the inher uncertainti of the outlook and the condit of monetari polici   befor you could take this step  howev  you would have to settl some issu involv the empir basi of this materi   the bottom panel of the exhibit address two option that you have for set the project feder fund rate   the first option is to condit the outlook on what you see as    appropri    monetari polici   if you produc independ forecast  each of you would continu to make this determin on your own  but under the central approach and perhap the coordin one  you would need to do this as a group   as note in the first bullet point  publish detail on what you see as the appropri path of the fed fund rate could facilit tell a more inform stori about the role play by monetari polici in the outlook   describ your polici assumpt qualit might achiev this object  altern  you could releas  say  the central tendenc of your specif fed fund rate project   one possibl drawback to publish an    appropri    polici path is that the public might misinterpret it as a promis  especi at first  for this reason  you might wish to pair ani publish fed fund rate path with inform on forecast uncertainti   releas inform on the fed fund rate might also generat public critic and polit pressur   a second option for set monetari polici is to condit the outlook on a flat fed fund rate or on the path consist with market expect   this approach might mitig some of the misinterpret and polit problem associ with the releas of an appropri polici path   howev  condit the outlook on such a path would alter the natur of the forecast and so creat communic challeng  in particular  your forecast would no longer repres your best guess for the like evolut of the economi  to the extent that a flat fed fund rate or a market base path differ from what you  individu or as a group  think will be necessari   for this reason  the forecast summari would requir some statement about the desir of the project outcom to avoid misunderstand   you might even find it necessari to provid guidanc about how the polici path would have to chang to bring about a more    appropri    outcom   a step that would like generat it own controversi   i will now turn the floor over to
as dave has explain  polici committe at central bank may choos to produc and publish one of sever differ type of forecast   central  coordin  or independ   or they may choos to releas a staff forecast   in the tabl at the top of exhibit    column a  b  and c show some of the forecast public choic of the central bank discuss in the intern financ divis background paper   seven central bank publish a central forecast  one  a coordin forecast  and one  a staff forecast   in my portion of the present  i will first address some factor  shown in the last four column  that appear to be associ with these choic   by our reckon  the first central bank shown  the reserv bank of new zealand  possess the characterist that would most like lead to a central forecast without dissent   laughter  it has a small polici committe  compos of onli the governor  which   tend to limit dissent   henc it committe is locat in the same place  and it head bear sole respons for monetari polici   the other central bank that produc a central forecast without dissent  shown in row   to   of the tabl  share mani of these characterist   in canada  row     as in new zealand  the central bank head has primari respons for monetari polici   in other case  such as australia and norway  row   and     extern member  who have no execut function  main particip at the monetari polici meet  leav the remain member a larger role in produc the forecast   the swedish riksbank and the bank of england have member who all play a more equal role in shape monetari polici   these bank also publish a central forecast  but they recogn member    dissent from the central forecast in their publish minut   the bank of england has a larger committe than the first six bank shown   the entir committe is involv in the product of each forecast  and with the larger committe size  the process take about four week  includ mani meet to decid on the detail of the project   all seven central bank that publish a central forecast also releas a singl narrat of the forecast to the public   howev  their choic vari about the featur of the forecast  such as the present of uncertainti and the treatment of polici rate   three of these central bank   the norg bank  the riksbank  and the bank of england   publish    fan    chart that convey the policymak    collect view on the distribut of possibl outcom   other describ uncertainti around their central forecast through their discuss of risk or through altern scenario   as shown in column c  some central bank choos to publish their own forecast for the appropri path of interest rate rather than condit their forecast on a specifi path  such as a flat path for the polici rate or one base on market expect   in contrast to the bank of england  the two other central bank with relat larg committe   the bank of japan and the european central bank   do not publish central forecast   to reflect the divers of it nine polici board member    view  the bank of japan publish the rang and the central tendenc of their forecast  along with the median   these forecast are coordin becaus the board member base their forecast on a path of interest rate consist with market quot   these forecast statist are publish with a descript of the outlook  which is draft by the staff with board input and then vote on by the board   board member may regist  with attribut  their dissent from the descript of the forecast in the minut of the polici meet   the ecb   s polici committe   which includ twelv member from the nation central bank  who are locat throughout the euro area     not publish ani forecast of it own but releas it staff forecast instead   the staff forecast is not vote on by the govern council  and it stand with respect to polici decis is not clear   as outlin in the bullet in the bottom panel  despit the differ choic of these central bank  their public of econom forecast is general regard as use   the central bank say that public has eas communic   mani central bank have start publish forecast  none of these has stop  and most have increas the extent of detail report   most observ agre that publish forecast have improv communic and facilit account   mani have comment favor on the qualiti of forecast public   overal  commentari on the public of forecast by both produc and consum is quit posit   howev  we have found veri littl econometr work that specif evalu whether publish forecast has improv monetari polici communic or econom outcom   the public of forecast has near alway been part of a packag   attempt to detect major posit or negat effect of adopt such packag have met with littl success   limit evid suggest that their adopt may have help anchor inflat expect  but whether the public of forecast has made an independ contribut is unknown   a few event studi have found that the releas of forecast has some effect on interest rate and other financi variabl   on balanc  exist econometr evid   not provid a firm basi for assess the cost and benefit of publish forecast     will now complet our present
exhibit   present a decis tree outlin the possibl path you might take in incorpor an econom forecast in the policymak process   i am includ this schemat becaus  among other reason  it is just what you would expect from me    laughter   befor we trace out some of those limb  i want to remind you whi the econom forecast is on today   s agenda   discuss of monetari polici  both here and abroad  has increas focus on the forward look natur of set polici   for the feder reserv  the structur of the current process of releas an econom project was set almost thirti year ago by improvis in respons to congression prod   is it possibl that the committe could arriv at a more coher way of produc and releas a forecast that would enabl policymak to describ better what they do   the possibl for produc and releas a forecast are laid out at the top of the exhibit   note that a coupl of the node correspond to question from the subcommitte to you in a memo i distribut on friday   in particular  as flag by the         in the decis tree and repeat in the list below       the committe want to produc a joint forecast or conduct a survey of individu forecast      the answer to this question is both hard   becaus it has consider implic for your  e and resourc in the system more general   and easi to predict   at least base on convers i   ve had with mani of you and your staff   to make it even easier to answer  let me paraphras those convers     do you want to chang the basic natur of the committe process by ad multipl round of meet so as to enforc a more uniform view of the outlook than has ever exist befor  or do you want to modifi the status quo       laughter   if you prefer to continu the practic of provid individu forecast  you might want to reexamin the extent of coordin in that process   that is item   at the top and bottom     if the forecast are done individu  should they be base on common assumpt about some key condit factor      chief among those factor is the path of monetari polici   do you want to continu with each take your own view of monetari polici  settl on some joint assumpt  or use market base quot   the individu entri in a numer forecast have onli limit use in describ the econom outlook and the backdrop for set polici   rather  the narrat thread explain the forecast is the most use becaus it allow the reader to assess the credibl of the project  to posit his or her own view when there is a differ of opinion  and to gaug potenti risk to the outlook   as pose in question    do you want to accompani a forecast with a minut style narrat descript   as with the minut   and note in question     this document could be circul for comment from meet particip and ul  be approv by the committe through a notat vote   such a procedur  howev  will extend the interv between the make of the forecast and it releas  rais the number of  e that inconveni data releas will render the project moot   if you want a more  e releas  draft and releas such a minut style document could be deleg to either the chairman or the staff   the last four question cover technic attribut of a forecast   in particular  as note in question    how frequent should forecast be made   the current semiannu report cycl was set by the congress  but it mean that the publish forecast becom stale   anoth inconveni with the current setup is that an annual forecast made in june incorpor an implicit forecast of the second half  would you rather be explicit and forecast half year   more general  as in item    how mani year should the forecast cover   seventh  how mani variabl should be forecast  and which should they be   nomin incom  for exampl  remain on the survey by histor accid   from the day when the veloc of money was thought to be predict and know your expect about incom growth would help in set a monetari rang   are there other variabl that would be more help  final  should there be some attempt to convey numer the uncertainti surround the forecast   relay such inform would more accur convey the balanc of risk that is an integr part in your deliber and would remind your reader that it is a project  not a promis   by now  we probabl have your head spin with all the possibl permut of the mani decis that could be made   with this mani move part  the problem is complic   but not all the issu to be resolv are hard   first  you have the forc of preced  which is a power attractor within the feder reserv system  that is whi i wouldn   t worri for a minut about whether the forecast and it descript should reflect the view of the committe or all meet particip   the preced of the outlook portion of the minut and the semiannu survey of forecast establish that ani releas should reflect everyon   s view   second  for the sake of consist  some of the decis about the format of the forecast will be driven by other decis you may make later   for instanc  if in your deliber about quantifi the price object in march you indic a prefer for measur inflat in term of cpi or pce  whether headlin or core  the variabl sampl in your survey should be a good indic of that goal   if you can answer the hard question today   eight of which the subcommitte sent to you   then it would be possibl to frame out a rough structur of a specif propos   detail could be fill in by survey you later on technic matter  and some  thereaft you could get a formal propos for consider as part of the general packag of work on communic   that conclud our prepar remark
thank you   are there question for the staff   presid
may i ask one question of
on your exhibit    you point out that there   s no econometr evid that publish forecast   these improv methodolog   has actual had an effect from an econometr standpoint   but you make the statement that observ agre that forecast have improv communic and account  which is a more subject statement   who are the observ
they would be a combin of market particip  academ  and anyon with an interest in what central bank do or say
how do we measur    improv communic and account      it seem to be veri subject
unfortun it is
final  i am just not as familiar as the rest of the fomc is  but do ani of these bank have a dual mandat state like our dual mandat
certain   other central bank have multipl object   some that are specif state are the one that the feder reserv has state   maximum employ and stabl price   i   m not sure  but some are quit close in term of keep inflat low and watch output as well
may i help answer this
the norg bank is actual the clearest on someth close to a dual object   in their inflat report  they have sever statement of their object  and they explicit say that they have a flexibl inflat target regim   that   s the first statement   what that mean is that they actual are go to tri to minim both inflat fluctuat and output employ fluctuat   most central bank don   t have anyth as explicit as that when they do talk in term of hierarch mandat in some case  a countri   talk about output fluctuat in an inflat target regim and is more explicit   i think the riksbank is go to be move in that direct  it was part of our recommend to them
but current it   s the norg bank
current the norg bank is the clearest
presid    i think almost all central bank  even the so call    formal inflat target     have in their mandat that they are to support econom activ insofar as it is consist with price stabil   presid
this isn   t a question
i   m sorri   is this for a go round  or do you have a question
i don   t have ani question   laughter
just answer    laughter
then pleas start
i thought the document distribut by the staff did a good job of identifi the purpos that publish forecast ought to serv   they   re consist with what i describ in past meet as guid principl   name  that communic is use to the extent that it help the public form better expect about futur polici and inflat and that it will help in that regard to the extent that it provid benchmark against which peopl can assess their futur action   for me the purpos of communic a forecast are  first  to reduc uncertainti in the public   s mind about futur macroeconom outcom  second  to enhanc our credibl and account  third  to improv the coher and intern consist of our discuss   it   s use to stack up differ question and approach against these purpos and to see how they do   in ani case   and this is a theme to which i will return   in achiev these object  i think it   s realli import that publish forecast be clear and understand to the public   now  the cardin rule of communic is to understand your audienc   it   s one thing to explain our forecast and procedur to larri   or goldman sach economist  it   s anoth to explain it to presid     s    million busi head  the helena rotari club  or wherev we find ourselv from  e to  e  befor address vinc   s question  i just want to note that i think the valu of publish a forecast would be greatest if it were pair with an intern agreement about our long run object for inflat   i think have a prior consensus on that would simplifi the process of obtain a consensus on the outlook and about polici   my own prefer is that we state that public   to the extent that an inflat object repres a commit regard futur polici  you can view it as repres an impli forecast of the long run averag valu of inflat  and so public that would help reduc the public   s uncertainti along a veri import dimens  regard vinc   s first question  i believ a singl committe forecast is most desir  this relat to the account object   we are joint respons for the outcom of monetari polici  so i think we should strive for an outlook that we can fair agre repres a collect sens of the committe   the valu of account is that it enhanc credibl  and it   s the credibl of the committe rather than of individu member that   s realli import   i recogn that craft a consensus on a forecast among nineteen or even twelv member  even as collegi a group as this is  could be a daunt task   one approach would be to allow the express of dissent view   this run the risk  howev  of make a committe forecast noth more than a compil of member    forecast  and i think it need to be more than that  the messag that the releas of a committe forecast should convey is that we came to a process with divers view  we talk thing over  our view perhap move closer togeth  and we ul  came to agreement on a singl forecast that most of us saw as not too differ from our own   that mean would be water down if there were a lot of dissent view   if they were too frequent or too numer   so i think there should be sort of a high threshold of disagr befor ani of us insist on differ be separ articul   i would envis a process   i think one of vinc   s option sketch this   in which the staff produc an initi forecast along the line of the  book  they have a great forecast record  and member would send in their own forecast  commentari  or disagr   then there would be some iter communic process on the basi of which a new forecast would be develop for a committe vote  regard the question of condit assumpt  i strong believ that what we publish should reflect our best sens of what is actual go to happen   my prefer  accord  would be to condit forecast on how we think we are actual go to set polici as event unfold   condit on ani other assumpt   a market   s polici path or an unchang polici   mean have to explain that our forecast may be counterfactu   it mean that  in order to figur out our real forecast  peopl have to figur out how our polici choic are go to differ from our assum polici and then guess how we think the differ in polici are go to affect the forecast   it mean that the extent to which our publish forecast reduc the public   s uncertainti about futur macroeconom outcom is go to be limit   it mean that our account will be limit becaus we will be say up front that this forecast might not be our actual one   it also mean that we will be chew up valuabl staff and committe  e construct a forecast we don   t necessarili believ in   here i think it   s instruct to imagin explain a counterfactu forecast to presid     s    million busi head or to the helena rotari club  i realiz that some member of the committe may be uncomfort articul an expect path for the feder fund rate  but what we publish about the natur of futur polici set is a separ question from whether we condit on a cohes view about them   our discuss of the forecast is go to be much more coher if we reach a consensus on futur polici   tell the public that our forecast assum appropri polici obvious make more sens  i think  if we have state what inflat rate that polici is design to achiev   if  instead  we adopt some counterfactu polici assumpt  then not state an inflat object make a publish forecast even less inform sinc peopl would have to know how the forecast differ from our desir outcom befor figur out what to make of it  as for vinc   s other question  on question   and    i think the accompani narrat should be handl pretti much the same way the minut are   draft by the staff and approv by the committe   on question   and    i see greater valu in publish forecast at longer horizon  in the event that we adopt an explicit object  we would want the period to be long enough to show the forecast path for inflat return near to the object   again  if we condit it on market assumpt  the period need to be long enough to determin whether the forecast appear to be move toward our object at an accept pace   question   ask how mani variabl we should forecast   i think the op  number is four    laughter   in case you want to know which one i   d choos  i   d say real gdp  inflat  the unemploy rate  and the fed fund rate   on question    yes  we absolut should convey the uncertainti surround the forecast   i think it   s import for account that we articul our sens of the rang of like futur outcom   this point to the import of not simpli assum a path for the fed fund rate but allow polici to vari across differ draw of the shock that are go to affect our futur econom condit  otherwis our publish fan chart for econom variabl are not go to correspond to the probabl distribut that we believ will actual govern futur outcom  and again  we   ll have to explain the differ to the public   also  i think that agre on a fan chart around outcom is like to be conduc to achiev a consensus within the committe on the outlook  in close  let me reiter the import that i place on clariti   our communic goal of reduc the public   s uncertainti about macroeconom outcom  particular inflat  and enhanc our account strong impli that we should adopt onli a procedur that we can easili explain to the public  that the public will find use  and that avoid the confus of complex and subtl counterfactu assumpt
you said one thing that surpris me      you began by say that the object should be to help reduc the public   s uncertainti about futur macroeconom outcom general   now  i can see that we have some capac to reduc the public   s uncertainti about what inflat is go to be over  e  but is it realist for us to have as an object to reduc broader uncertainti in the public about macroeconom outcom   is that an achiev or desir object for communic   we can mayb reduc our uncertainti about what we think about what those outcom are  but even we don   t know much about the dimens of the futur
i   m not suggest that we reduc the public   s uncertainti to less than our uncertainti about futur outcom   but the econometr evid is that  book forecast are superior to the privat sector   s forecast   so if the public knew them  their uncertainti would be lower   i think there   s reason to suspect that more inform  more communic  from us about our outlook is like to reduc the public   s uncertainti
i didn   t know i was go to go second  but that   s all right
you can ask a question if you   d like    laughter
no  i   ve got plenti of question here   anyway  i  too  appreci the rang of staff materi that went into the prepar for this discuss   an aw lot of altern are on the tabl  and i think it   s good that we   ve been ask to focus on eight question to tri to clarifi thing   but from my view  the most import question was not pose  and vinc light pass over it   yes  thirti year ago or so we fell into the process that we now use for both creat forecast and communic them  and yes  you could assum that anyth you   ve done for thirti year probabl could be improv   i think that   s possibl   but i   d like to have some sens of what is wrong about what we   re do befor i seek major chang to improv it  the staff paper suggest that in decid whether or how to chang the way we communic our forecast  we ought to be look at goal of better econom perform and better public discours and account  presum not just in the short run but also in the long run   there   s some marriag there with the potenti for set long term  explicit price stabil target   a third goal would be better intern discours and tri to do all of that in the context of have somewhat effici oper   i think these are laudabl goal   i continu to have concern about whether explicit long term target for price stabil are realli help   whether they   ll help or hinder our caus   but set that asid  i think we need to think about our forecast not just as forecast but in light of the full rang of communic in which the committe now engag  we have two monetari polici report a year   we have the central tendenc of member forecast around gdp  inflat  and unemploy   they don   t get a lot of attent right now   mayb that   s good in some perspect  given the way we do them   mayb that   s not so good   we have eight meet statement   we have eight set of minut  and we have copious speech and tes oni   so there is a lot of communic  whether it   s in numer form or qualit form  about how we see the futur   each set of minut has implicit in it a qualit discuss and some quantit inform from the  book forecast and an indic of where the member of the committe are in term of how they see the futur unwind   we certain  of cours  express that a lot in our speech and tes oni  in my almost thirteen year tenur on the committe the transpar of polici deliber has increas enorm   there   s a healthi public discours about what we   ve done  what we   ve said about it  and what the like futur cours of monetari polici is   in the end  i think account realli depend on action  not so much on word  and i believ our action and our word have shown us to be account   so i   m question whether some of this move us to be more account   in fact  if you look over the past twenti five year at the rang of our current forecast  albeit they have potenti problem and they receiv littl attent  that rang hasn   t been at all bad in predict what has actual happen over the period for which the project are made  particular when you look at inflat and unemploy   so despit our lack of common assumpt and with the wide varieti of differ  particular over the year  in how we view the mechan of the economi  we have publish a central tendenc that   s been fair narrow and reason accur  at least for the thing over which we have the most control   in particular  inflat   will more communic of forecast result in better econom perform   i think that   s hard to prove   the staff has said it   s hard to prove   mayb yes  mayb no  turn to the object of better intern discours  more communic has alreadi improv the intern discours of the committe   i have some qualm about refer to our nineteen person edit session as an improv  but set that asid  we have move over the year from say noth to formula statement to more flexibl languag combin with earlier releas of the minut   so i think that has all improv our intern discours   vice chairman   circul someth that impli we might further improv by share among ourselv more detail about our intern forecast and the attend uncertainti   i like that as an improv on the intern discours part of it   i think it has some merit for further discuss as long as the intent is strict intern consumpt and there   s no intent to forc us to a common view   so i am a bit at odd with presid    and you   ll see more of that  can we do more than we   re current do   that   s the question here   of cours  it   s alway possibl to improv   but i think there are downsid risk  and i don   t think they were well discuss or articul  or articul in a way i would like  in some of the materi   first of all  the committe is intend to be just that   a gather of independ perspect on polici   that   s whi we have our own staff   our econom framework have converg over  e  but there are differ in focus and in emphasi   if in the end we produc a singl view rather than a rang  what   that say about the need for a committe  particular with nineteen member   if there is a singl  consolid forecast that is  for effici   s sake  deleg to a small group    that not over  e tend to disenfranchis those who are not part of that group   second  committe member in my view should be chosen for their judgment  not their forecast abil   forecast are use tool  but they   re not the onli thing involv in polici   if they were  we could reli sole on a model to set polici  and we know we can   t do that   at some point  the effort involv in creat and refin forecast over and over preclud the work necessari to form judgment about the current and the futur stanc of polici   third  attempt to convey to the public the under element of a forecast  includ the polici path  run the real risk  as the staff has point out  of commit the committe to a particular action   at the tail of the distribut of econom scenario   that is  if thing are particular lopsid from either a growth or an inflat perspect or if there   s a bout of financi instabl   some form of path commit can be use  and we have use that in the recent past   normal polici is more reactiv to incom data than proactiv  and appropri so  in my view   the staff paper say pre commit is not a problem elsewher or can be explain away   but the process of convey such explan in the context of u s  financi market may take more  e and be bumpier than anyon expect   again  i ask myself what greater good would be serv by risk that market reaction   final  if we did decid to move to more frequent forecast  whether central or not  would the result be cacophoni  we   ve got statement and minut eight  e a year  the usual plethora of speech and tes oni  if we ad to that more monetari polici type report with forecast  is there a chanc that we could have too much inform out there  too mani thing that are potenti give rise to commentari that   s not necessarili help understand but rather confus it  so i come back to my answer to the first question that vinc should have ask  i think   i have serious misgiv about whether chang what we now do in the monetari polici report and the relat forecast might be benefici enough to offset the downsid risk   i think there is  howev  some valu in talk about someth along the line that vice chairman   has implicit propos  now  let me just quick answer the eight question that vinc did rais   first of all  i think a joint forecast should be avoid   a survey of individu member forecast is my prefer   i would aggreg them and present a central tendenc either use exist procedur or some modif that seem use   i would not requir that committe member use common assumpt either for the fed fund path or for other element   in my experi  i   ve taken some comfort that differ committe member with differ assumpt and polici prefer most often develop semiannu forecast for the next year and a half or so that are not much differ from my own   i don   t believ that we in boston have the best take on how the economi work or how near term risk will play out  but the fact that the way we see the near term outcom with    appropri polici    is in the mainstream of the way most other see it give me some confid that we   re on the right track   as i note befor  the rang of our forecast hasn   t been a bad predictor of key econom outcom  the third question has to do with whether the forecast should be accompani by a minut style descript   the releas of our forecast is now accompani by the monetari polici report  which by definit is the chairman   s view of thing   as a result  of necess perhap  the forecast we develop get littl attent in the report   if we were to releas forecast more often  we would need some verbal text like the monetari polici report   but perhap we could take a first step by just chang the way the monetari polici report is formul right now to give a littl bit more attent to the forecast that the committe is make   whether that mean that the monetari polici report is a committe report  not the chairman   s report  is an obvious next question  and i don   t have the answer to that   but mayb a small step to take would be to highlight more that the report has forecast in there  the fourth question was whether the committe should joint agre on the minut style descript   frank  i   m wonder when we would do all this stuff   we   ve got a meet in januari and februari that come out with minut and a forecast and a monetari polici report  we   ve got a meet in march   we   ve got one in may   we   ve got june  which is similar to januari  a meet in august  one in septemb  one in novemb and decemb for which we   re write minut   all of which  as i note befor  have implicit in them either qualit or quantit sens of both the  book forecast and the committe member    forecast   that impli that april and octob are the onli month in which we could probabl do this   i think tri to creat   and someon refer to this earlier   a minut like descript of a set of forecast without a meet around that set of forecast would be realli hard   there may be some way of rearrang our meet date to get the date to work out better   howev  it seem as though we   d be work on a lot of stuff  some of it simultan if we were to keep the same rang of thing that we do now   so my answer to question   is that i   m not convinc that the two  e a year we do it right now isn   t about the right frequenc  on question    i understand the argument for a longer term forecast period   i understand that it reveal futur polici prefer and tradeoff  but i don   t think long term forecast provid a whole lot els   a long term forecast isn   t go to be realiz   it   s more a goal than anyth els  it   s hard to make forecast six month out that are right on the mark  let alon sever year out  and they could impli that we know more or control more than we actual do over a longer period of  e   so if we were go to extend the horizon  i would extend it onli a littl   to go  for exampl  from a year and a half to two or three year perhap   i would stay with the number of variabl we current forecast   nomin and real gdp  unemploy  and some measur of inflat  final  i think that convey that we   re not certain about our forecast is obvious desir   i know other central bank have use fan chart   they   ve proven use   i know they   ve been accept   i don   t know how well they   re understood   but i do find myself wonder in the u s  context what the averag person or the averag congressman would actual take out of them  even over rather short period of  e  the rang of outcom about which we   re certain even at the    percent level realli is kind of wide   so my view is that a qualit discuss of the sourc of risk is prefer to a quantit one   over  e anyth can be well understood  i suppos  but i have a feel that the rang of uncertainti without an academ understand of what you   re tri to do is more confus rather than less  so to pull it all togeth  i   m intrigu by vice chairman     s implicit propos of improv intern discuss with more detail about our own forecast and what the constrain factor are and where we see polici go   i would not tri to pull them togeth into a consensus view   if we had a consensus view  we would have to tell peopl about it  and i   d be a littl concern about that in term of commit   i also think that we could work on how our current forecast are actual handl in the monetari polici report   i do not think a central forecast is use   it has problem in term of what it say about the committe and the committe member  i   m not convinc that common forecast variabl or a path of forecast is use   i   m not convinc that you can actual handl a more frequent releas of forecast to the public  and i think an explicit numer discuss of uncertainti is difficult   so that   s where i am  for what it   s worth
thank you   a two hander from presid
i have just a factual question   on the exist monetari polici report  you describ it as the chairman   s view   i look at the exist report   it has a tabl with the forecast and then a few paragraph describ that forecast
it   s the board   s
the board staff   s
no   ul   the board discuss it in a meet  and it   s transmit on behalf of the board of governor to the congress to fulfil it legisl requir   so the board is direct in the law to provid it
not the committe
no   the board is explain committe policymak  but it   s the board   s respons
so you wouldn   t character it as the chairman   s
no   the chairman may choos to talk about the forecast in his tes oni   so in some sens you realli have two opportun to talk about the committe   s forecast
when the act was be rewritten  after the humphrey hawkin report was sunset  we rais the question of whether it should be a committe report rather than a board report   but the congression staff are veri focus on make it a board report  in part becaus they feel that   s where the account is in the appoint process
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to begin by compliment the staff for a veri thorough and thought set of background materi   in recent year we have made notabl stride toward increas transpar  and that has serv to enhanc public account and to improv the efficaci of policymak   at this point  further enhanc to our communic are both possibl and desir  and i think our econom project may be an area with low hang fruit   survey suggest that market particip attach a veri high prioriti to improv inform concern the committe   s outlook for the economi and monetari polici  in fact     percent of the respond to the macroeconom advis    survey accord higher prioriti to this object than to the adopt of a numer inflat object   so the provis of more detail and more  e inform concern the outlook would help market particip form sensibl expect and possibl improv intern discours   we have been publish forecast for almost thirti year  so we   re a pioneer in this area   but i think we have fallen behind state of the art practic  and i think it would be use now to make increment improv to the govern structur  the content  and the procedur of this program  so now let me address each of the question that vinc sent out in the memo   the first is whether we should provid one forecast or mani   my answer is mani   we are too larg and too geograph dispers to make a unifi option practic   the bank of england has a committe a littl less than half of our size   they seem to be the largest to produc a unifi forecast  but the process is report  e consum and contenti  and i fear that the attempt to arriv at a singl forecast could end up undermin our collegi  not to mention our effect   more import than the practic side is that a unifi forecast is not desir   i think we hold a divers of view  and i believ that divers should be respect repres in all aspect of our communic   that divers goe beyond condit assumpt  like the price of oil   some of us have diverg concept about the structur of the economi and the monetari polici transmiss mechan   given the divers of view  it   s fair to say that in most meet  no unifi forecast or forecast stori even exist  and i don   t see how particip who fundament disagre could  if we tri to produc a unifi forecast  speak in public about the economi without reveal those differ   the differ  on balanc  are a sourc of strength   they reduc the odd that we will becom trap in    group think    mental  conform for conform   s sake  and reduc the risk that we will miss import insight that could help us avoid error   the problem is that this diverg make it challeng to articul the type of unifi committe view that i think market realli crave  the first question goe on to ask whether individu forecast should be releas in a disaggreg format or present in an aggreg way   i prefer the aggreg approach that we use now with a rang and central tendenc   most of the  e we   ll end up with the center of graviti for the forecast that can be describ in a use way  even though there are diverg view   also  convey how we interpret the bodi of forecast will be more use to the public than simpli releas nineteen separ project document   in principl  the drawback of a central tendenc is that the result may not be entir coher becaus differ forecast get exclud for differ variabl   base on our past experi  this seem to me more a theoret possibl than an actual problem  but i was intrigu by the discuss in the r s divis   s memo on how it could be possibl to identifi an entir set of variabl for an individu particip as an outlier and exclud them   i think that   s worth think more about   final  besid distribut a central tendenc and rang  provid a histogram show the full frequenc distribut of forecast could be use  the second question ask whether we should base our forecast on common assumpt concern the stanc of polici and other factor or  altern  appropri polici and opinion about other factor   i   m certain in the    appropri polici    camp   i think the altern is problemat   sever  e in the past we   ve discuss the possibl of adopt a common assumpt of a constant interest rate  but that approach could lead to forecast that would not be seen as desir by committe member   for exampl  sinc a constant interest rate may not be the appropri polici  it could produc a forecast with inflat that   s high and rise  and i think that would be confus to the public and not convey our sens of what would happen   the problem can be especi pronounc as the forecast period is lengthen   a second issu is  as i said  that particip differ on the structur of the economi  and ani common polici assumpt may make sens in one model but not anoth   the same comment appli to all the condit and variabl   even thing like the valu of the dollar and hous price are endogen variabl that should be determin within the model be use   so impos common assumpt with a varieti of model could lead to incoher result  now  the third and fourth question concern whether a narrat descript of the forecast should be releas and how it should be prepar   i think we should provid a minut style narrat descript of the forecast   experi suggest that there is common consider overlap among the fomc particip regard the factor that are critic in assess econom trend   for exampl  right now a major of us are focus on develop affect hous and motor vehicl  as well as the implic of tight labor market for inflat over  e  and that was reflect in the chairman   s summari ye day   these factor are usual emphas in the portion of the minut that describ particip    assess of econom condit   the minut do a good job of describ the state of opinion and also briefli describ diverg view concern the economi  and the narrat should also describ the diverg view      s background memo emphas the need for speed in releas this inform becaus new data can make forecast stale   in addit  the chairman   s monetari polici tes oni and the issuanc of the monetari polici report typic occur befor the releas of the minut from the januari and june meet   so it may be desir to devis a procedur that would allow the forecast and the forecast narrat to be releas befor the minut themselv   we could deleg the prepar and releas of the narrat to the chairman   it seem to me that he has over the past sever meet provid an excel summari of our discuss as soon as they conclud  and that   s the type of thing that i would expect in the narrat   my prefer  howev  would be for the committe to agre on and approv the narrat   a committe vote on the forecast narrat would avoid the possibl disagr that might aris after the releas of the narrat but befor the approv of the minut   one way to expedit the prepar of the narrat is for all of us befor the meet to share our individu forecast along with a brief written stori explain them   i thought vice chairman     s summari realli is an excel templat of the form that such a submiss could take   most of the  e we would find that there is an emerg major view and a few altern view   we could allow  e toward the conclus of an fomc meet to discuss longer run forecast  and this would provid the staff with some addit inform concern the committe   s view   i would hope it would be feasibl for the staff then to prepar a minut style summari of view rapid after the meet  circul it  and allow a veri limit  e and veri few iter for comment and revis so that the narrat could be approv and releas befor the full minut were approv  now  i just want to turn to the technic question that vinc pose   with regard to the frequenc of forecast  the shelf life of project general is long enough to support a quarter product frequenc   howev  given that we want to provid forecast for the monetari polici report in januari and june  it   s difficult to see how we could even distribut four forecast over the year   the problem is that we have onli two meet between januari and june   it would be possibl to spread three forecast even over the year in januari  june  and octob  and eight might also work well  but i fear that there could be a staff insurrect    laughter   in ani event  on the question of the forecast horizon  i   m fine with maintain our current practic  but i would not object to a small increas in the forecast period   all we realli know about the more distant futur is what our ul  goal are  and i would prefer that we provid that inform in a more direct way   the next question is which variabl should be includ   i   d prefer to continu to includ forecast for real gdp growth  the unemploy rate  and some measur of consum inflat  depend on the interact with what we may later decid about the inflat object   i don   t think ani of the other central bank forecast nomin gdp   i would drop that  and i think consider should be given to provid inform on the fed fund rate  perhap the fourth quarter level for each year of the forecast or  altern  a qualit statement about direct  the polici path is necessari for understand and interpret ani forecast  and it was at the top of macroeconom advis    list for what the privat sector want to see   larg and widen error band around the central tendenc would help stifl the potenti for market to interpret these forecast as commit   moreov  narrat comment on the forecast could emphas the condit and data depend of polici   we will obvious need to do at least one trial run in produc forecast befor go public with the new system  and i would propos that we includ a numer forecast and a discuss of the fed fund rate path in that trial just to see how it work  of cours  all these variabl will be forecast with consider uncertainti  and i think it would be help to convey this fact clear   one way to do it would be to put confid band around the forecast number  and they could be deriv by look at the track record of the fomc  the cbo  the blue chip survey  the survey of profession forecast  and so forth   one could imagin adjust them a bit base on committe discuss   for exampl  when particip note that they see the risk as abnorm larg or asymmetr   inform on forecast accuraci could be present in a tabl attach to the fomc forecast to justifi our choic of uncertainti band   my staff has develop a mock up of a graphic approach to repres the forecast and forecast uncertainti band  and i brought some copi of what that might look like for you to take a look at   i thought i would just pass it around the tabl here   so in summari  i   m in favor of enhanc the forecast inform that we releas   the key point for me is that we should provid inform on the divers of opinion in the committe about the number and the stori  and i think procedur like the one i describ to produc a    materi distribut by presid   is append to this transcript  appendix     minut style discuss of our stori would be effect and permit this inform to be releas in a suffici  e manner
may i just ask one question
thank you   that was realli interest      your recommend would be not to condit on a common polici path but have    appropri polici      so in the end when we publish the forecast  would it be a rang of feder fund rate
has this sheet come around to you
all right  so it   s a rang then
if you look at this sheet   we might do this for all the variabl   the bottom right panel show the feder fund rate   these are obvious made up number   but we have the histori  and peopl would just add their own forecast for q  for the feder fund rate   we   d report a central tendenc  and we would develop error band around it result in the type of display you would see   so obvious it would be a rang of opinion base on appropri polici report by the individu member
so the background in there is the rang of feder fund rate  of appropri polici that peopl submit with their report
yes  the dark band in the center would be the central tendenc of our report  and the thinner  longer line would be band generat by number we use for forecast uncertainti
thank you   i   m embarrass about  e plan here   these comment have been extrem interest  but i   m worri about flight and thing of that sort  everyon should feel free to give their full view   be mind  if you can  of  e  and if we don   t have enough  e  we   ll have to think about how we might reconven or otherwis extend the discuss   was there a comment
yes   i just want to ask about the    percent interv     that reflect everyon   s uncertainti
we would have to discuss how to produc that  but it might be base on  for exampl  our frb us forecast error that we would appli to the central tendenc rang
sorri  mr  chairman   may i just tri this again   i interpret you as say that you infer a central tendenc from this process you outlin
with respect to the stori
you discern a central tendenc of the committe about our view about gdp or unemploy
well  we   re submit number
then you attach some other method for frame uncertainti base on past forecast error   for exampl  of frb us   book  blue chip  or somebodi els
yes  exact
or our own forecast
or our own forecast
but  no  it can   t be that either   that   s a littl differ  isn   t it
we don   t forecast the feder fund rate  but we do have data on our own error with respect to the other variabl
but you   re not suggest that we tri to aggreg or ask the staff to aggreg our own uncertainti that we convey with our own individu forecast  right
no  i think that would not be a veri use procedur
there   s research at the st  loui bank that say that the fomc forecast are actual pretti good   was there anoth two hander   presid pool
i have a coupl of fair quick point to make   first  in term of the audienc we   re talk to  you realli have to talk to the congress first   we oper under the feder reserv act  and we   re report to the congress   that   s a veri import part of the audienc   i would put the market second and then the general public   so whatev we do has to be coher to all three audienc  i start with a question  and i think it   s exact where cathi was come from   do we need to solv a problem   is there someth that is realli creat a problem with what we now do  my answer to that is    no      do we have an opportun to move forward   my answer to that is    mayb      i don   t think we   re realli solv a problem   my view is that we are not in deep water in what we do now   take the fan chart as an exampl   if you do this six month earlier or six month later  the fan go in differ place   let me use an analog   if you look at the cbo budget outlook  the cbo track chang in the deficit forecast and partit the chang in the deficit forecast into three piec   one piec come from chang in econom assumpt  one piec is chang in tax and spend legisl  and the third piec is chang in what they call technic es    how much revenu you get for a given tax law   i think that   s a veri conveni way of explain the evolut   there is an opportun not so much focus on the forecast   the wide rang of uncertainti make it problemat as to how much guidanc you   re realli give to the market   but to explain whi the forecast has evolv the way it has   my guess is that most of our individu forecast  although they   re not all the same  sort of move togeth   if someth happen  we all move  although we   re not all move to exact the same degre   with the analysi of whi the forecast has move we could provid some insight into how our think has evolv as a consequ of new inform   we don   t do that much right now   it could be incorpor in the monetari polici report   i think some of it is alreadi in there  but whi the committe   s central tendenc has move could be made much more explicit   we would probabl be abl to come to pretti good agreement on that if we were to look at a draft becaus we   re all respond to the same fundament surpris in the inform section
thank you   governor
first of all  i want to deal with the general question that cathi allud to at the outset   i am strong support of more effect report of a forecast for sever reason  one is that it help the market to understand our action better  and i think that has a high valu   it can be part of the process of anchor inflat expect  which i think is a key to success monetari polici   veri import also is that it indic a degre of open and allow public discours about our view  that has polit benefit in term of show that we   re account to the polit system   so i answer this question veri much in the affirm  one issu is what the research has said about this   presid   is absolut right  these issu are subject   the research staff said that there is no strong evid  and the reason is that it   s almost imposs to get and  in term of econometr  it   s veri difficult   the literatur in the area of transpar is  in fact  somewhat unsatisfi becaus it   s veri hard to quantifi anyth   in term of research strategi  it frequent draw peopl to do case studi  and i am one of the crimin involv in that activ   the chairman has also been involv in do some work on case studi that we did togeth   part of the reason is that you can look at the detail and deal with this   if you get involv in evalu monetari polici  which i did for sweden recent  you get to talk to wide element of the societi   in the swedish case  there was tremend support for this degre of open  and it was felt to be polit veri valuabl by some surpris group  the labor union were extrem support  for exampl  of this kind of open and  believ it or not  of inflat target   which was somewhat of a surpris  so let me turn now to the issu that we have to discuss   i want to provid an analyt framework in which to think about this  at least for myself   i think about seven basic principl that are key in term of how we might go about provid more inform about forecast   so here are the seven principl  and i   ll discuss them each in turn   first  we need to allow for the divers of view   second  this process need to be effici   third  it need to be  e   fourth  it need to be relat frequent   fifth  it need to explain the forecast   that is  we need to tell a stori  a good narrat  about it   sixth  it need to emphas uncertainti   seventh  we need to stress that the forecast period is longer than the polici period   let me go into each of these one at a  e  and then you   ll see that it lead to particular answer to the question  at least from my perspect  the first principl is the need to allow for the divers of view   i strong believ  particular now that i   m involv in this process  that the divers of view is the strength of our monetari polici process   in fact  i take the view that peopl have veri differ job here   i   ve been on both side of the fenc   mayb     you have been more so becaus you are a presid  i was just an execut vice presid of a bank   but bank presid bring differ inform to bear than the governor  and this differ help us make better decis   so i believ in this kind of divers   anoth veri posit aspect of divers is that we have a set of staff   we have the board   s staff  and then we have twelv other staff that actual act as a check and balanc on each other   again  that has valu   final  i believ that committe can make better decis than individu   alan blinder has a studi on this topic that i thought was realli quit interest  the second issu is effici   ani forecast process has to be workabl in finit  e  and that   s realli critic   i some  get nervous when dave start twitch at me  but you don   t want the forecast process to overwhelm the staff   i   m veri sympathet   have been in research at a feder reserv bank  i have been on the other side of the fenc  and so i realli understand their pain  as for  eli  there are import advantag to get out the forecast quick   when i said    forecast     i didn   t mean just the forecast  i includ the narrat  too  becaus you   ll see that i think the narrat is import   the key reason for  eli is to give the forecast and the narrat more impact   the quicker you come out with them  the more impact they have   in particular  the environ for get this inform out is much more control than that for speech or even tes oni  and i think that   s the valu   so quicker is much better    eli also make the forecast and the narrat less like to be stale   the longer the interv between the polici meet in which you make a decis and the releas of the forecast and the narrat  the more like they are to be obsolet   one danger is that data could come in and make the forecast look silli   so there   s an issu about our look good   the fa  we come out with a forecast  the better off we are  the fourth issu is frequenc   the key here is that the forecast and the releas need to be done often enough so that market get the inform they think they need to understand what   s go on   fifth  a narrat is import so that market  the congress  and the public not onli see our forecast but also understand them   to be understood  the forecast need a stori behind them   i strong believ that we need to write up a good stori and that a good narrat can help us obtain public support for our polici action   which is  again  a critic factor  sixth  it   s realli import to make sure the public and the market understand the high degre of uncertainti that we face   forecast are tough   not just long term forecast but also short term forecast     is  of cours  nod his head on this   the key reason that emphas uncertainti is import is that it can lessen public critic when we miss   which we sure are go to do at  e   we   ve actual been veri good relat to other  but we   re go to make mistak   at least  if peopl understand the degre of uncertainti  that will help   when you make clear the uncertainti  you make it easier for peopl to understand whi there   s a divers of view in this committe   it   s not becaus the particip don   t like each other  and it   s not becaus we frequent fundament disagre   it is becaus we have differ uncertainti in view of the economi  and that   s actual exact what is indic by the fact that forecast are veri uncertain  also  inform uncertainti is import inform for the market   we want to help the market figur out what we   re do and what   s go on  and we don   t care just about the first moment but also the second moment and even some  the third moment  final  the issu of the horizon   i think we need a long horizon   when you look at the literatur on op  policymak  what come out veri clear is that the horizon that you have to think about in term of the path of the variabl we care about is further out than the polici horizon  which i would say would be about two year   ani sensibl way of think about how we think about polici will typic involv period that are longer than the two year it take to affect output or inflat   we need to express the recognit of that becaus do so will clarifi that  when we have path in our forecast  we can then talk about how they are consist with our ul  object   to give you an exampl   if inflat is substanti abov our comfort zone  get inflat down in a two year period may be too cost   as a result  we may have to talk about a longer period to assur the public  the congress  and the market that  in fact  we   re do someth sensibl   so we need to go to a longer period than we have now   we see this clear in the bluebook   s op  path   i have some issu about their take as long as they do to get to the inflat object   ten year   and about how we build expect  but they do indic that a period longer than two year is absolut necessari for think about polici  let me now use these principl to talk about the eight question that were pose to us by the subcommitte   first  should the forecast be a joint forecast   i answer veri strong    no      the process for do that would be way too cumbersom and ineffici   no matter how charm or color it would be  it would be a nightmar
it   s hard enough for the bank of england to do it with a committe of nine peopl   we have nineteen   furthermor  at the bank of england they   re all live in the same hous and talk to each other all the  e   we have peopl all over the countri with veri differ job  and so it   s just infeas to do it   i think dave would quit    laughter   it would eat up a huge amount of staff resourc  and we might have some of our research director quit or go to the research staff at the reserv bank   it would be veri hard to get a  e agreement on it   and  again  i think  eli is import   it would also be hard to get the divers of view clear express   so i end up where   end up   i think that we need to keep someth like the current procedur in which all nineteen particip give their view   it is veri import that there be no attribut and that we amalgam the view in some way   the procedur we have now may not be perfect   mayb there   s someth better   but it should be someth similar  question     should we have common condit factor   here  again  i believ that the divers of view is a good thing  and so again i agre with   that each particip has his or her own condit factor   the most import condit factor is clear the path of the feder fund rate  but i have mix feel about it   we may want to provid some inform about what individu particip think about this   the concern i have here is that the detail realli matter   there is some danger if peopl seem to be make a commit  becaus we know that ani path one specifi is sure not go to be the path that actual transpir becaus new data are go to come in   i   ve been veri concern about this issu  and in fact i wrote a paper on it that is cite in the r s document   some  transpar may go too far   in particular  i was not a fan of the    moder pace    languag that the feder reserv use in the past   i was not here at the  e  but i think that languag did not express the issu of condit enough   if the committe then had to chang the path  which it sure might at some point  it could be accus of flip flop  which would creat sever problem for the committe   howev  mayb we can do it appropri through fan chart to deriv the degre of uncertainti  but we realli need to discuss this possibl   the detail matter   if we even think about go in this direct  the trial run are go to be critic  so i want to have a bit more of an open mind on that  on question    obvious for reason that i outlin earlier  i strong support a narrat to accompani the forecast   on question    i feel that the narrat and the forecast need to be veri  e   if we could do this  it would be a great advantag to do it veri quick  possibl even at the begin of the week after the fomc meet   that would requir a much more expedit process   we   d have to use some deleg   to the chairman or the staff   for write up this process   that would requir move up the  book a bit   for us to produc our forecast and a narrat  we need to see the  book   i certain need to see the  book to come up with my forecast   but then peopl could provid inform veri much along the line that vice chairman   provid   some might do it verbal   some might do it the way you did it  which was veri nice   that could then go to the staff a littl earlier than now   let   s say  by wednesday   then a narrat could be written up that would go to peopl befor the fomc meet and then could be discuss at the fomc meet   i don   t know how this would work   it would requir that we not go through as much of an iter process as we some  do   that is critic for the  eli issu   one thing that we might think about is that we have the    recent develop    part of the  book  and releas that might have some valu   that would be from the staff  it would not be from the committe   it give some flesh to the discuss that would be in the summari  so we might think about do someth with that as well  as to question    on frequenc  i don   t think that twice a year is enough to give market the inform they need   as for eight  e a year  again  i worri about lose our top peopl from the staff  they might come after us with pitchfork   i tend to lean to four  but there is the interest issu about the  e of our meet  so we   d have to work that out   so quarter seem about right to me   on question    becaus i believ the forecast period need to be longer than the polici period  for the reason i discuss earlier  it clear has to be longer than two year   howev  too long a period might put too much of a burden on us   a period of three year  which is common in central bank  would give the flavor of the direct of the path that we   re think about and would be adequ  on question    to keep thing from be too burdensom  i want to use the kiss principl   the fewer variabl the better   at a minimum  the three variabl that i think are the right one are the one that i think are obvious   an inflat measur  an output measur  and an employ measur   i think we should kill nomin gdp  it   s a vestig of the past   there is an issu about the feder fund rate  but  again  that should be discuss   it hasn   t been mention yet  but i would be uncomfort provid project of potenti gdp   i think we do need it for our own purpos  but it rais realli huge polit economi problem becaus peopl can think of it as a speed limit or a target for growth  which could be danger   so although i welcom it in the feder reserv bank of new york   s document that we receiv  i do not think it would be particular wise to releas it  on question    for the reason i outlin earlier  i think it   s extrem import for us to provid inform about uncertainti   fan chart are the right way to do this   i realli like what i see here  but there might be technic detail that we   d have to decid on   should we give onli one    percent confid interv   should we give more shade   there   s an issu about how this chart would be produc   the realiti is that it would have to be produc in the same way that the narrat is  in the follow sens   it would have to be deleg   the inform from the nineteen particip would help in produc it in term of their view   the staff would have to come up with some measur   then there would be some iter along the same line as the narrat in order to produc it   but it then would have to be  e  it would have to be releas with both the narrat and the forecast themselv   so with that  let me stop   i don   t think i   ve been quit as charm here   thank you
thank you   intervent  presid
i have just a quick question about the narrat   would you see a narrat signific differ from the narrat that   s now in the monetari polici report  other than the fan chart or anyth els that would be ad   would you see the same type of thing   a few paragraph describ the forecast
this is whi we need trial run   the narrat need to be a littl more detail than that and actual a littl more reflect of the differ view   i think it   s a question of write a good stori   one thing i have learn is that  even as a scholar  i learn particular from write   in this case i think the committe will learn from do these trial run   then we might say  gee  this is too short  it  sn   t give the flavor  or it is too long and too involv  or it   s too difficult to come to a decis about it   so my answer here is let   s do it and discuss it  and then we   ll have a much better feel for it
mr  chairman  we talk briefli about the norg bank and norway  which is a countri of     million peopl  a constitut monarchi  and my mother   s homeland   my mother taught me a wonder phrase  which i want to repeat here as an anteced to this discuss   it   s actual a quot from santayana   skeptic  like chastiti  should not be relinquish too readili    laughter   i admit to be quit skeptic about this exercis  and i will reveal my card up front in term of be sensit to the argument that presid   and presid pool have made as to the predic question  which is  is there a compel reason to do this   not onli is the discuss charm  but i am almost overwhelm by the encycloped knowledg of some of my colleagu   i don   t possess that knowledg  and i listen to it veri  veri care   but i have not yet heard a satisfactori answer   yes  we have had an evolutionari process over thirti year  but is there a compel reason to chang the way we do our busi  if you go back to     s exhibit    it say that we presum would undertak this effort with an eye toward    advanc the goal of econom perform  public discours  intern discours  and effici oper      i think of this in a broader context  which is maintain and build or  use presid     s word  enhanc the public   s faith and confid in the feder reserv  and i think the faith and confid in the feder reserv right now is pretti high   now  two word are be thrown around constant in this discuss   one is the    public     and the other is the    market      by the way  i   m not go to get to the eight question   i want you to be reliev right up front    laughter   i can   t get there yet becaus i haven   t answer the predic question   but i would ask the committe to consid what    the public    is and what    the market    are   governor kohn said someth dure our discuss of polici with regard to the market oper   i actual spent three quarter of my life be one of them   that i thought was quit complimentari and summar the current state   he said that noth we have been say is get in the way of the stabil properti of the market   i realli like that   so my question is  what is wrong with the way we   re do thing if we   re not get in the way of the stabil properti of the market   i agre with cathi   s point that  with regard to the market  our action speak louder than our word   day to day there may be varianc  but in the long term that   s what count   i believ that the market may have had a differ of view  they may have been test us  but they   ve come around  and our action have spoken much louder than our word  if the definit of    public    is the academ communiti  i understand their insati appetit in the pursuit of knowledg   i respect that  but i think there may be other way of assist that pursuit of knowledg than by increas the frequenc of our forecast or the complex of our forecast   i want to apolog to my friend from philadelphia in advanc  but are we talk about those who oper the economi   the women and men who run the busi that creat the microeconomi  and mani micro make the macro   whether they are    million busi or big busi   i went back and count   sinc i had the good fortun of come on this committe  i have spoken on     occas to manag of big and small oper   ceo most  some cfos   not onc have i been ask by them for more frequent forecast or for all the variabl that we consid or anyth that project the kind of complex that we   ve been talk about today at this tabl   i   m a former rotarian   i may be one of the few here   i speak to rotari club all the  e   the onli question they want to know is where rate are go to go    laughter   i don   t think they care one whit about the complex of our forecast model  but that   s not the group i   m worri about in term of the public   presid pool rais an excel point  which is that we do have to be mind of the elect repres of the peopl who creat our charter and who in the end we all serv  and that   s the politician   i would just ask you to consid the argument that we   re have against that background and the risk that it pose  this is a one way street   we see this from the excel work that the staff did   there   s no go back onc you go down this path   vinc mention our semiannu schedul set by the congress  need we do more   have they ask us to do more   should we do more befor they ask us to do more   shouldn   t we think of this in term of negoti with the polit class rather than give them someth for which they may not even be ask   if we give it to them  it may lead to still more question that we cannot satisfactorili answer   so i would beg the committe to consid what we   re talk about when we   re talk about the public and the market and whether this is a compel thing that need to be done now  i   d like to emphas a second thing   obvious  be a bank presid  i do not wish to be parti to anyth that emascul the bank   inde  whatev we do and howev we do it  if we do it   and i   m not convinc that we should   we need to respect the bank not onli for their research capac and the divers of view and  what governor   and presid   correct mention  their geograph divers but also as vital link to the public  whether the public is the elect leader  the rotarian  the econom oper  the financi market  or even the academ  a third point  and then i   ll stop  is that i ask that we be practic in the way that we do this  presid   mention that we do a lot   i have no doubt that we could do more  but we have constraint on our  e   in be practic  we also have to be wari of what other question we rais by provid more inform   some element may not be interest in our preserv our independ or may be a threat to our independ   i won   t mention who those might be sinc i don   t want that on the record   mr  chairman  those are my three concern  and i   ll spare you my answer to the eight question  which i hope i   ll have a chanc to give at a later date
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you   i   ll frame my remark around two proposit   the first is the    yes      we should be recept to chang in our practic and procedur to the extent that they make monetari polici more effect and provid clear public benefit   my general sens is that provid more inform about our view on the econom outlook can be a good thing when it come without impair the effect of the polici process   the second is the    but      chang that we make in this regard need to be done in a way that respect the divers of viewpoint that is central to the effect and the effect function of this committe   i believ that the strength of this committe and the sourc of it abil to conduct sound monetari polici and facilit confid in our polici come in larg part from the divers background and view of the individu member   although at each meet we must arriv at a committe decis  the decis and the way it is communic to the public are shape by the view of all particip  in my experi  mr  chairman  as polici evolv  it is rare the case that everyon sudden see the wisdom of a major chang to the direct of polici   rather  one or more member begin to articul concern with our current polici stanc base on their experi and their assumpt about unfold event   as data begin to provid support for this viewpoint  the committe begin to move in a new direct   even when new posit are not subsequ support by the data  our discuss benefit from consid altern point of view and set of assumpt   consequ  as we consid option that we might pursu to increas the effect of our communic  i am strong oppos to chang that would limit the express of altern forecast and viewpoint  either in the discuss within the room or in our communic with the public   i regard step such as produc a joint forecast or requir a common interest rate assumpt as extrem detriment to the committe   s deliber and public communic   such step would lead inevit in my mind to the deleg of decisionmak to a small group of individu  and i don   t think that   s help  with that said  let me focus for a moment on some specif issu on the role of forecast in polici communic  and i would begin with some comment on the proper vehicl for communic forecast inform to the public   if we decid to move forward with discuss of our forecast and provid more forecast  i would like to suggest an altern   and like all the other altern today  it is superior  laughter    and it is base on how we would choos to do this   if we want to convey this inform in a way that is both  e and logist manag  we should use the minut   this is an extens of what we now do   it take us forward but  i think  in a proper step  specif  i propos that we consid releas a summari of numer forecast as part of the minut   we all prepar forecast beforehand   as i remark earlier  it is import that the inform be in the form of a survey of individu forecast  not a joint forecast  and each forecast should be base on the individu   s view of polici and not on a common interest rate path   the minut would contain summari inform in the form of tabl or chart on a small set of key variabl  such as real gdp  core inflat  and unemploy   this inform would be present in the form of a central tendenc and the rang of committe member view   i would not includ specif inform about the polici assumpt use for the individu forecast  member would present their view in the meet and then be permit to revisit their forecast in light of the committe discuss and decis   the forecast period would like be four to eight quarter  as now  with the semiannu report focus on the longer horizon beyond that  if we go there   an advantag of use the minut  besid  eli  is that a narrat is alreadi prepar  there would be less chanc of confus about the ownership of the forecast   the numer forecast inform would supplement the qualit discuss current in the minut  and i think it would enhanc the public   s understand of polici   for exampl  the recent disconnect between our view and those of the financi market might not have develop had the market seen our forecast of temporarili slower growth and persist inflationari pressur  a final issu is the use of common condit assumpt in the forecast   as i indic earlier  i would not be in favor of requir a common fed fund rate path   i think it might be help for the board   s staff to provid inform on some of the condit assumpt they use in the  book as a start point for committe member    forecast   howev  as with the fed fund rate path itself  i would not be in favor of requir a common set of assumpt for individu forecast   i think this help inform the public but also keep the divers within the committe and leav the committe more effect   thank you  sir
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to join the other in thank the staff for their veri help memo   these issu are complic  and some of them are even hard  as has been said  and i found all the memo help to me in frame my idea on this subject   i find myself  import  in agreement with presid   and governor     not in everi respect  but in some respect   so i   ll tri to be a littl more concis than i was go to be   but i do think it   s import to confront the issu that presid    pool  and   have rais   i agre that there is noth fundament broken about what we   re do now   the market do a good job  and the public   a good job  in anticip what we do and understand how we   re go about our busi  and they even do a pretti good job in anticip where we want to go eventu   there is no compel reason to chang right now  but that  sn   t mean we   re in the best possibl place   i do think we could improv what we   re do   to the extent that we can improv the way we explain our polici  particular as a committe  it will help the market anticip   it will help on the account issu   i don   t think we need major surgeri  but there are some thing we can do that might help around the edg on these thing   i also agre that market are insati   whatev we give them  they   ll want more  and most what they   ll want  as presid   point out  is to know exact what we   re go to do with the feder fund rate three and six month from now  and we can   t tell them that   so they will alway want more   one thing that we can accomplish here is to shift attent a bit from the speech of individu to the committe   s document   i have told larri   and   sack that my goal is to be at the bottom of their leagu list on who influenc interest rate    laughter   they don   t like that  but i   m get there    laughter   i don   t want to influenc interest rate when i   m give speech   i think it   s much better if the committe speak and if the chairman speak  particular when he is speak on behalf of the committe  in his speech and his tes oni  so draw attent away from individu speech to the committe   s view is a veri posit thing   understand our action involv understand how much we don   t know as well as what we think we know   obvious  we can   t anticip shock   but as we   ve discuss around this tabl  we have veri limit knowledg of the dynam of the economi   we need to be veri care not to give a sens of fals precis about what we know   we also need to be care that we don   t get invest in specif numer project and becom less will to chang our polici and our project when new inform come in   part for these reason i agre that the stori we tell  the narrat  is as import as  if not more import than  the particular number that we give out   it   s realli the stori that peopl use to inform their own forecast of the futur  to judg how event are unfold relat to our expect  to understand which aspect of the econom environ we   re realli pay most attent to  and therefor to help predict   i also agre with the other that we need to recogn and respect the divers of what is effect a nineteen person committe  we need to avoid do anyth that would discourag altern view  and we need to think about how to repres altern view in our communic   so against those principl  here are my answer to the eight question   not surpris  on the first question  given the size of the committe  the divers  and so forth  i think that we have to stick with make individu forecast   i would publish them in some kind of aggreg way  as we do now   i   m kind of attract to the histogram   let the public see the whole distribut of the forecast   but that   s a technic   peopl worri about inconsist among the central tendenc when you   re choos differ peopl for each central tendenc   but in my experi of write these thing up   when the chairman allow us to    laughter  those inconsist weren   t a major problem most of the  e   you could tell a coher stori around the central tendenc   some  we had to use a littl imagin  but it wasn   t realli incoher    laughter   i think that chairman bernank demonstr this in his last two tes oni   to take the central tendenc as we submit them and tell a pretti good stori that   s help to the public   for mani of the same reason we ought to go with individu assumpt   when we use individu assumpt  such as    appropri polici     rather than a common assumpt  we   re in effect tell peopl the combin of outcom for inflat and output that we think are possibl  if polici is run just right  and that we would prefer   we   re give a lot of inform about where we think the economi can end up and where we   d like it to end up   in effect  we   re give our read on where we   d like to be on a taylor curv that link output and inflat variabl   a common set of assumpt  as other have note  might not coincid with appropri polici for mani particip   we wouldn   t be tell peopl our sens of the best possibl outcom   we could  particular if we use a market rate path  tell them a littl someth about where we expect interest rate to go becaus  if the outcom didn   t line up with where we thought thing should be  the market might sens that and adjust   but there are other way of do the same thing   so i think that individu assumpt  rather than coordin assumpt  are the way to go   should we collect and publish the view of the member about appropri polici in anoth histogram or central tendenc  as presid   suggest   we may end up there  but i wouldn   t start with that   i think it multipli the odd for inconsist among the central tendenc   you   ve got interest rate and output now that could also be inconsist and could creat confus   it risk shift attent from the forecast to the rate path   i was somewhat drawn to somebodi   s suggest that  if we had strong view  we could indic that qualit in the narrat   but for now i   d stay away from the explicit interest rate forecast   becaus i think the stori is import  i think the narrat is import  and a minut style narrat  which discuss signific differ as well as the common tendenc  is import   such a process would be help by our submit note with our forecast that the staff could aggreg and modifi after listen to the meet   i hope that submit forecast and note  sn   t make it harder for peopl to chang their mind at the meet   i   m a littl worri   and governor   mention this   about shift thing forward to befor the meet   it make the inform we get a littl staler at the meet   alreadi we   re get someth that was put togeth on wednesday for a tuesday meet  it   s alreadi a week stale  i   m also concern that  if everybodi has a forecast and circul it  have an exchang of view in which peopl chang their mind might be a littl more difficult becaus you have written down exact what you want   so we need to be care about that tendenc  but i still think we could submit narrat and that would help   i   d favor more frequent updat   i was think about quarter  but then there   s presid     s point about three  e a year   the long interv is between juli and februari   mayb we ought to start by updat between that seven month or so interv and then see whether we want to do it even more frequent   but i think we could updat a littl more frequent than we   re do   i   d keep my focus on just a few variabl   output  unemploy  and inflat   those are the key one   i   d drop nomin incom   we   re not interest in veloc anymor   other variabl  like hous market and energi price  could be cover in the narrat   i would like to formal convey some measur of uncertainti   i   d be tempt to use past forecast error to do that   i don   t think i   d like to tri to fine tune a fan chart to begin with   if the committe had a sens that uncertainti were particular larg or particular small or were skew to one side or anoth  we could cover that in the narrat   then  i have two thought on procedur   first  we need to allow for some dri run to see how thing work out wherev we end up   second  as a former staff member  i can tell you that senior staff member are alreadi stretch veri thin around fomc meet  especi around the semiannu report meet   so if we ask them to do more  we need to think about what els we   re go to ask them not to do that they   re current do   thank you
thank you   first vice presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   it may come as a surpris to some of my colleagu  given my express concern over public of numer inflat target  that i am veri support of public of forecast by particip   the committe has for some  e now made routin refer to the outlook in the statement  without an explicit committe forecast   explicit forecast will  in my opinion  add to the alreadi improv transpar and account of the action of the committe and will  over  e  serv as a refer point for express the import differ view among the committe member at this tabl and in public speech   as cumbersom and as pain as the process might be  at least initi  the committe also need to develop a consensus forecast that would embrac a central tendenc outlook   howev  this forecast should embrac  not truncat  outlier and use those as a signal of dispers of view around the forecast   as for the basi of the forecast  it seem logic that some agreement on assumpt would lead to fewer outlier in the forecast process   while i can appreci the benefit of the    common assumpt    approach  i would suggest that the committe follow the    appropri polici    approach as it relat to the feder fund rate  at least at the outset   that said  one altern might be for the staff to suggest a set of common assumpt that would be use in the develop of altern forecast by the particip   howev  it would be understood that each particip   s baselin forecast would be free from impos assumpt   i believ it is imper that ani forecast be accompani by a stori to support the outlook   this is consist with my own recommend as it relat to question   that we should minim the number of variabl that we use in the forecast for the public   with just a few key variabl put forward  we should be abl to agre on a narrat for the forecast  much as we agre on a narrat for our current polici statement   i recogn that this will be cumbersom and  e consum  but number without the stori would be analog to ask a doctor to treat a patient by see onli the skeleton   the stori could be develop in a minut style descript  but i would suggest that the forecast and descript be an addendum to the minut   this would enabl particip to share their forecast and opinion at the meet   in the discuss process  particip would be given the opportun to absorb the discuss of the meet and the various forecast and then go back and visit with their staff to consid if ani chang are warrant in their own forecast and outlook   i hope that  after the resolut of the start up problem that would no doubt be encount in this process  the current public schedul of the minut for those meet where we do set forecast would be restor   that said  i hope also that the debat over the stori would be limit to substant issu somewhat like a dissent on the current polici decis and not a vehicl to captur everi nuanc in everyon   s forecast   i suggest that the forecast frequenc be limit to two per year to start out but that we would eventu move to a quarter forecast  much as has been said earlier   listen to my staff talk about the plan period and the polici action requir so far as  e is concern  i am struck that a three year plan period would be ideal from a forecast standpoint   the process would be more effect  at least at the outset  with fewer rather than more variabl  and i suggest that those variabl be some inflat measur  real gdp  and unemploy   my prefer is to exclud a fed fund rate forecast becaus it could be interpret  as mention earlier  as a commit   as for the uncertainti  clear our stori must address uncertainti and potenti chang that might come in the futur   i would choos not to use fan chart  at least at the outset  as i could almost bet that a fan chart on unemploy would be on some congression committe member   s desk at an upcom hear  illustr the point that  if we miss our target  million of peopl will be unemploy   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to start by say that the memo that we receiv from the staff befor this meet were help  and i think that   provid the right set of question to guid our discuss   the goal that were laid out in the memo that dave distribut seem appropri to me   from that memo and the comment from   and   this morn  assess whether releas more forecast relat inform will improv econom perform appear difficult   howev  i am persuad that  by make some modest chang to our current practic of prepar and releas forecast relat inform  we could readili and inexpens facilit a richer intern discuss and at the margin better inform the public about our think    so i want to say at the outset that i   m interest primarili in use the forecast to help us better understand each other   s think about longer term object  polici risk  tradeoff  and the work of the economi  along the line laid out in vice chairman     s memo   from my assess of our current practic and the experi of foreign central bank laid out in     s memo  i find no compel case for releas addit forecast relat inform to the public  with one except relat to the forecast period that i   ll comment on later   so use     s languag  i   m in the    modifi the status quo    camp  and i   d like to answer     s question from that perspect   i support the    independ    option regard forecast   i think there is great valu in the divers of opinion that individu committe member bring to both the intern and the public discuss about monetari polici  and i would like to use it as construct as possibl  right now  i am not in favor of pursu a singl offici forecast to be publish by the committe as an element in our polici communic process   although i am not oppos to publish inform about individu forecast submiss  i think it would be fine just to pursu the central tendenc approach that we   re use and the forecast rang summari that appear in the monetari polici report today   regard the condit assumpt  i think it would be counterproduct to impos a common definit of appropri monetari polici or a common set of condit variabl   my hope would be that the assumpt and the condit that are import to each individu   s outlook would be reveal as part of the dialogu that we have among ourselv about our forecast   i suggest that we incorpor a summari of our view in the semiannu monetari polici report   for now  it would be enough for me to simpli reflect the general sens of the convers in the monetari polici report and in our minut  in the same way that we regular summar our view about the outlook and the polici situat today   i have no object to deleg the releas of a minut style descript of the committe   s forecast discuss to the chairman  subject to some consult with meet particip in the draft process   the process that we   re current use to review the minut after each meet could be use for draft and publish such a descript   the narrat then could be includ in the releas of the monetari polici report  much as the central tendenc forecast are includ today   my suggest is that our forecast continu to be share in our semiannu format   i don   t see the need for a more frequent releas of forecast  although listen to some of the comment today i wouldn   t be oppos to go to quarter onc we get some experi with the process   one import chang that i would make is that i would supplement our current semiannu project with a medium term forecast for the relev variabl   governor   mention three year   my person prefer is to go out to a fifth year  so i would continu to do the one and two year and then go out to the fifth year   my guess is that in most case provid someth like a five year period is long enough to assum that the fifth year would obvious be made under the assumpt of appropri monetari polici  and that would general align with individu member    view of our longer term polici object   even if a five year period is not long enough to reveal our long run object perfect  the longer period will help us to clarifi the pace that the committe member view as appropri in term of move toward a more desir inflat rate   it would also provid a descript of ani tradeoff that we perceiv in meet our object   i am comfort with publish a small set of essenti outcom variabl  much as we do today   at some point we might want to discuss further whether it   s still use to includ nomin gdp  as other have mention  and what price index or index we should includ  for now  i am not propos that the forecast discuss be extend to includ ani formal measur of uncertainti   in summari  my prefer is to stay much closer to the status quo than mani of the other option that were present by the staff   we have a lot to gain from shift the focus of our intern polici discuss to includ a medium term  and we can share that inform qualit with the public at a veri low cost   these modest step would not preclud us from make more ambiti chang that the committe might wish further down the line   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much   it is a littl after        whi don   t we take a break for lunch   if peopl could be flexibl  we can start somewher around       mayb a few minut befor  depend on how effici lunch is serv   if anyon has concern about flight or anyth like that  could you pleas let me know dure the break   mr  vice chairman
do you have a sens  a reason expect  of when you think we   ll tri to stop   it   s veri import  but we could do this for day
it should be somewher between      and       if we take a half an hour for lunch now  unless i hear concern about flight and the like   it   s lunch  e  thank you   recess
let   s resum   thank you   let me start by say that we   ve had an enorm amount of discuss   if anyon is inclin to submit a memo to the committe or to the subcommitte elabor on your view or respond to some thing that you   ve heard  pleas feel free   it will be veri help to receiv ani inform like that   let   s continu with our go round   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   in the interest of  e  i   d like to be abl to say that i agre with governor x or presid y and just let it go at that  but there are some nuanc that i feel compel to cover  so i will   let me just start out by say that  while i certain favor some chang to the product and public of the forecast  i do think we need to proceed  at least in some area  cautious and conserv   after all  we are the central bank   laughter   beyond that  onc we make these chang  we probabl won   t be abl to retract them  so we   d better make sure that we want to do them befor we proceed   in that spirit  let me address the question   question   and   fall into that categori   i think that we ought just to continu what we   re do now in term of conduct a survey of individu forecast and aggreg them   i have reserv about tri to come to common assumpt  for lot of reason   practic it would be veri difficult  and i   m not sure at the end of the day that there is a big payoff   so i favor the status quo so far as those first two question are concern   question   pertain to the narrat descript  and there my answer is    yes      the forecast should be accompani by a narrat descript   that step is veri import  and it feed into question     should the committe joint agre on the minut style descript or deleg the releas   we have a number of option there   as some peopl suggest  you could tie this in with the minut in one way or anoth   that run the risk of the forecast   s becom stale by the  e the public see it   i   m perhap a littl less concern about that than some other becaus the public will know when the meet occur   they know what inform we didn   t have  and they presum know we   re not clairvoy    laughter   let me put it this way   i am not clairvoy   some of you perhap are  but if so  it escap my notic    laughter  anoth way of handl this would be to submit the forecast with brief narrat in advanc  then  of cours  we   d have a pretti good jump on prepar the materi at the end of the meet   so if we   re concern about  e and about forecast becom stale  we would have the advantag of have materi befor the discuss at the meet   we can find way to get out the forecast and the commentari associ with it in a more  e way to the extent that we think do so is import   now  here a dri run or two might be veri help  and i think it will turn out to be essenti to chang that we might make   question   is how frequent the forecast should be made   here again  i   m not sure the current schedul is too bad   ad a third forecast each year to fill in the hole in the fall and mayb to address a bit the issu that bill pool articul about provid more inform about how our view are evolv   that might work out   but this is anoth place in which i would be relat cautious about be veri ambiti right off the bat   similar  with how mani year the forecast should cover   i think there are argument for extend it beyond the current period  but again  i would want to do some dri run and look veri care at what we gain befor we commit ourselv to go out three year or five year or whatev the period might be   as for the number of variabl forecast  i think we need an inflat variabl  a growth variabl  and some sort of labor market variabl  and i   d let it go at that   put out more thing would onli add to the confus   we could alway decid at some futur  e to put out a feder fund rate number  a year end number or someth like that  but i wouldn   t start with ad it right up front   final  should there be some attempt to convey formal the uncertainti surround the forecast   there my answer is    yes      whether we do it with fan chart or with some other approach is someth that we can work out  but i think it is veri import to do   i don   t think right now that market particip or the public more general think that there is littl uncertainti associ with our forecast  but it   s import to underscor the high degre of uncertainti associ with policymak   those are my view
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just make an introductori remark  and then i   m go to go through these question fair quick   first  i   ve heard differ reason here for our look at chang   one issu is to improv the credibl of the fed   the point about credibl that i   d like to make is that it is a trust issu   you earn trust by demonstr that you can achiev the object of your organ   i think we have credibl   whether or not we put out a forecast  our credibl is precious   if we don   t demonstr our abil to control the inflationari pace  we   re go to lose that credibl whether or not we have a forecast   account  too  is import   we are a central bank in a democraci  and whatev we can do to enhanc transpar   to let folk understand how we come about our polici choic   is import   i use the word    enhanc      presid   or someon els use it earlier  but i like the word   becaus it say that thing are go well   we alway have way in which we can improv  and we should be look at chang on the margin  not major chang   i also agre with govern   and a few other that the strength of the way the central bank is set up in this countri is the divers of viewpoint   we not onli get differ region input  we also have peopl from differ background sit around this tabl  whether they are ph d  economist and expert in monetari polici  expert in reserv bank oper  or folk from the privat sector   we all come at monetari polici from a differ perspect   for that reason  if we go forward in this vein  i support individu forecast and retain that divers of viewpoint   therefor  i don   t support ani common assumpt  each of us should be free to choos the framework in which we produc our forecast   i worri that forc common assumpt sort of forc converg  and i would not be like to support that   i feel strong that the most import part of issu a forecast is the narrat   if we just put number out  i don   t know what valu ad we have   the number in the  book don   t vari a whole lot in most of the scenario  but the narrat give a differ flavor   as you read through the scenario  you can say     well  i feel strong this way     but the model  sn   t produc a whole lot of differ   so i think it   s essenti that we talk more about it in a narrat form   that qualit aspect realli add valu to a forecast  particular with the divers of view that may occur from  e to  e   in term of how we do the narrat  the propos that vice chairman   circul is a good framework that we could use to start  again  if we do that befor the meet  it may help the  eli of the communic   it should come out at the same  e as the number  whether it   s tie to the minut or tie to the monetari polici report   it is part of the overal process   as for technic aspect of the forecast   again  base on the comment about staff work  i agre that we need to keep thing simpl   twice a year is suffici  at least initi  part becaus we shouldn   t overcommun the abil of monetari polici to fine tune short term variat in inflat and monetari polici   i think about my life as a corpor cfo and the frustrat of be held quarter to quarter to the result of a compani when so much is go on and you are manag the long term success   for that reason  and becaus the lag in monetari polici are so long  i think we   re overcommit   whether to the congress  the general public  or the market   about our abil to implement and affect market by do too short a forecast period or too frequent a forecast   howev  go forward i would lean toward what we have now in the forecast and not go out longer   i understand that peopl want to go out further becaus they think that do so signal what our long run real object are   but if we want to set an object  let   s just set the object rather than have a longer term forecast becaus out in the long run we   re more prone to volatil and becaus  e  too  will be more of an issu   i also would favor just the three variabl that are relat to our mandat from the congress   inflat  real gdp  and the unemploy rate   varieti of which are to be determin  but they should be tie to the mandat   down the road we could add more  but for now let   s keep it to those three   i think it   s import to communic uncertainti surround the forecast  and i would do that with regard to two dimens   first  whatev the consensus  in the five year that i   ve been here  there have been period when we did not know how far polici was go to have to go   one instanc was when we start down the path of rais interest rate  we knew we were go to go at a measur pace and we clear signal for a long period that this was where we were go and that we felt confid that a   percent fund rate was too low   we were not sure of the stop point  but we knew we had a long way to go   second  regard the central tendenc  it is import to signal a rise in uncertainti around turn point   that our forecast about them depend a lot on incom data   if in the committe we have an outlier or realli differ viewpoint  we need to spend a bit more  e in a narrat explain whi we have a differ of view   the onli other comment i would make is that  in think about the altern and the variabl around them  it will be a challeng to communic that effect   so we should  as some suggest  do a few dri run   i   ve been spend a lot of  e recent on basel ii  pillar iii  disclosur regard uncertainti and risk   look at what we realli can control through monetari polici and differenti that from other thing go on  the style that we choos in talk about uncertainti and risk regard the forecast will be veri import   so i think it would be good if we practic that communic a littl first   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i will tri to be brief   i was impress with presid     s excel present and the thought and scope of what she talk about  and i agre almost     percent with everyth she said   but i want to mention a few thing that i think are import   there   s an old forecast adag  if you   ve ever been in the forecast busi   if you can   t forecast well  forecast often    laughter   now  that suggest to me that  if this exercis were onli about the forecast  it might not be so import to do frequent   but the purpos of publish this inform on a more regular basi is not so much about the forecast as it is about communic polici and the view of the committe to a broader audienc   our forecast is almost a byproduct  but it provid  in my view  both the foundat and the context for our current think about current polici and futur polici  that   s realli the valu of it to me   provid a forecast and a narrat would provid a richer context   it would allow us to be perhap a littl more expans about thing in the narrat  i   ll come back to that in a second   we spend so much  e around this tabl pars word in our statement each  e  and have a richer descript of the context in which polici is be made and the view that are be express would allow us to get away somewhat from our focus on the languag in the statement itself   it would provid us with some more flexibl  and we wouldn   t have to worri quit as much about everi word be pars for some new mean  the purpos go beyond just the forecast and it part in this communic   inde  a broader principl is the transpar of the policymak process   so let me go through the question and provid for each of them a quick answer and perhap a littl nuanc   i certain agre with most peopl around this tabl that we need to have individu forecast   i strong believ in the    independ    approach   there is huge valu to the divers sit around this tabl   i don   t think we want to put that at risk  so i   m veri support of that  in term of common assumpt  in particular on the condit variabl  i don   t think there ought to be common assumpt   we ought to use appropri polici   i have a littl uncertainti in my own mind about whether that ought to be an explicit part of the forecast in term of what we publish   i am of two mind on that issu   on the one hand  i   m sympathet to the notion that you want to be veri care about imprint in the mind of the public that the forecast is some kind of guarante or commit   i think that   s not a big problem  it can be overcom with some discuss and fan chart and other thing   on the other hand  publish it has some valu   i think about the  e this fall when we were sit around this tabl talk about the weak in the economi and hous and what we thought our outlook was   at the  e  the market were project that we were go to drop the fed fund rate to someth like    by this spring  but i didn   t sens at the  e that this group would have put as much probabl on that occur as perhap the market was   if we were in the busi of generat these forecast  that disconnect wouldn   t have happen  or it would have been much milder  i suspect   there would not have been as much uncertainti nor as much movement in those interest rate had we been more forthright about what our think was go forward   so i think there are some benefit to report out the rang of what peopl think is appropri polici go forward  but i acknowledg it also has some risk   the narrat is terribl import for make this work   inde  that is where you are provid the rich   i think it ought to be a minut style narrat   i   m a bit torn as to whether or not individu committe particip should have the opportun to write a side bar if they are realli uncomfort with someth   certain  if we allow that  it should be done without attribut   but i believ that the issu here is more about  eli and whether we can do this in a  e way to make it work  which is speak to     s concern   we just have to struggl with that a littl and figur out what might work best   how frequent should the forecast be made   i lean toward four  e a year   i think that   s a good frequenc and put the forecast rough at everi other meet   at first  this will be veri difficult to do  but if we get into a product cycl  i think it is certain feasibl   as to the issu of how mani year the forecast should cover  i think that it should go a littl longer than what we current have   i lean toward three year   as we go out  all we have to do is just say someth about what we believ the long term trend are or  in some case perhap  what our object may be   perhap we want to get far enough out so that the long term trend is reveal   this get back to what issu and what variabl we report   i never have like the phrase    potenti gdp    becaus i have never realli understood what it meant or how to measur it   but i do use the word    trend    a lot   i   m not sure it   s a bad idea when you   re collect the forecast from the member  much as vice chairman   did  to report what your view of trend is  we may or may not choos to publish that for some of the reason that   perhap suggest   although i   m less concern about his concern  i certain understand them   but it would be terribl use to gather that inform and to share it   mayb onli intern so that we have an idea of where peopl think the economi is in a long run sens   the variabl we ought to publish would obvious be real gdp  unemploy  and a measur of inflat  whichev one we decid seem most appropri    i   d be okay with a trend es   although i don   t feel strong one way or anoth   produc a fan chart or some inform about the rang of what the committe think is appropri polici would be inform   in particular  i like     s pictur becaus  as you notic  it has no line in it   there is no point forecast   as we convey uncertainti about the forecast  we want to do everyth we can to steer peopl away from the notion of a point forecast on anyth becaus they   ll latch onto that point forecast and disabus them of that will be veri difficult   steer them away from a point forecast also help stress the import of uncertainti in our forecast go forward  and i think we need to convey uncertainti   i   d even be inclin to report  as these chart do  just central tendenc and not ani median or point es  for ani of the variabl   i think that   s a terrif idea   final  i   d like to make a suggest   it will be veri difficult to design the detail around this with the whole committe   i think governor kohn allud to this consider in the begin   so i would strong support a motion that either the communic subcommitte or a subcommitte that they deleg to would come back to this group rather quick with one or two well thought out  concret propos that we can discuss in detail and begin think about how we might produc one or two dri run to work out the kink   i think we   ll make much more and fa  progress in get an outcom that we are comfort with if we have someth concret in term of a propos to talk about   that   s all i have   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   in my view  i associ most close with presid  n   so i will avoid go through all eight question and will provid perhap three further thought on what presid  n talk about   first  on what our domin goal is  second  on what the benefit of go forward are  and third  on how we might go to market with someth along these line   first  with respect to the domin goal  i think  as governor bie and mani other have talk about  it is our credibl   our credibl today is somewhat asymmetr  in the sens that i think that we have a lot more credibl that we could lose in this exercis than we could gain   not onli is the credibl of this institut veri high  but i would say it is even higher than it was six month ago   that suggest to me that we should go slowli  conserv  and prudent through this process   how   that relat to forecast   when i think about the forecast that we consid ye day for the fourth quarter  which has pass  i   d say that our staff   a better job than anyon on wall street or than mani of us could have done alon  but we see the error involv   which is not at all a critic but a realiti of the busi we   re in   i hesit to think about make forecast four  e a year  includ period we were quit far into  and about how that affect our credibl   instead of extend into a third or fourth year  i would think about make forecast in a go forward  roll eight quarter way so that we would alway have a full two year in front of us   we wouldn   t be in some way culpabl for make an error of inform that we realli should know in the market   s expect   it   strike me as a littl odd that our forecast period chang by virtu of our current calendar   i think about that from a credibl standpoint   i don   t want to mess up in front of these market so obvious   i   d put the question of frequenc in the context of what benefit we are tri to achiev   it seem to me that the predomin benefit is strengthen the transmiss mechan of monetari polici between us and the capit market and the reaction function of the capit market back to us   if we provid forecast four  e a year  i fear that our number might replac the market    own forecast   that is  they might say     well  i   m a littl bit more robust in my view than the fed   so i   m go to take their number and add a coupl of tenth  becaus i   m the chief economist at morgan stanley    or merril lynch or goldman sach   i worri that our number might end up pollut the qualiti of the inform they go out with  and then we would be read back their number and say     boy  our number look a lot like their   aren   t we veri good at this      i worri about that transmiss mechan effect    in term of the quantit and qualit inform we put forward  the focus realli should be on what don describ as the stori  the narrat   one that wall street and the rest of our constitu  like capitol hill  can think about  ask tough question about  and tri to interpret  what we get back then in term of their quantit and qualit assess could be better  all of that speak to the focus on the narrat rather than on the number   final  how would we go forward with whatev we conclud  and what would be the best mean of ensur that this increment work that we   re do has the benefici effect that we hope for   to achiev this goal effici   i   ll use word that may be a bit more glib than i intend   we should use a    benevol leader    model   i   m not say a    benevol dictat    model in which we all say     hey  chairman  here are our best view  they are all your      nor is the model a pure democraci  where all nineteen of us parad     these are my number   this is my view of the world   these are my es       in which case we provid more inform  but i   m not sure we   ve realli help the caus of what the fed is tri to achiev   the    benevol leader    model probabl fall somewher between the two   with that model  we would use the opportun or the  e of the monetari polici tes oni  when everyon   s attent is on the chairman and the fed for those macro forecast   the chairman would report the work product  and the work product would have two piec   the first   and i don   t mean to priorit one over the other   would be the chairman   s work product  which would incorpor the view of other as he see fit  and he might well want to refer where his view coincid with the central tendenc and where they differ   but in that we ought not to constrain the chairman   in that way  i don   t view the chairman  in his tes oni or in his announc of project  as the press spokesman for the fomc   those are his view   but second  and veri much alongsid his view  he would present our view   his present of our view is use in make certain that a lot of attent is focus on them   in answer to one of the question from the subcommitte  in some way we might well be deleg to him the abil to draw a central tendenc and make appropri conclus   i trust in his abil to do this   if a futur chairman  sn   t think independ and honest provid accur view of what the committe member have said  the committe has plenti of check and balanc at it dispos to make sure that we have some disciplin over that second half   so that   s an appropri way to think about get the most bang for the buck of this increment work with which we   re propos to go forward   one of the memo said that the public is like to place the most weight on a forecast made by the entir committe   i think that   s true onli if the chairman   s view happen to coincid with the committe   s   if the chairman   s view differ from the committe   s view   which i presum is not imposs   it is not obvious to me that the statement in the memo is correct   if the chairman   s view differ substanti  there would be  for better or for wors  differ power center and sourc of inform  and i think the market would be look at each   so that   s perhap anoth reason that i think this    benevol leader    model might be the best way to go forward   those are just some preliminari thought   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i thought about the altern befor us for make forecast  i had an even greater appreci for the way we   ve done this to date   i look at the monetari polici report  of cours  and other thing that we   ve done  and i think we   ve been well serv by the approach we   ve taken to date   the twice a year forecast and the central tendenc descript   some of us were here when chairman  span told us that he didn   t realli care for these forecast veri much   he said it was psycholog debilit for him to discuss them in his tes oni  laughter  three week later becaus they becam stale  well  chairman bernank has done an excel job  and i don   t think he has been psycholog debilit so far that i   m awar of    laughter   but you have woven them into your tes oni  and i think it has been veri effect   so if there are import improv that can be made  i certain would favor them   but i don   t have a good sens at the moment  as some other have express  which communic issu we   re tri to address here   the background memo were first class  and i should compliment the staff   they did an excel job of describ how forecast can play an import communic role for central bank that have adopt inflat guidelin in one form or anoth   of cours  we haven   t adopt ani yet  mayb we will   i think that   s still an open question   but depend on the specif mandat of the central bank  the forecast procedur may depend on those detail   in an ideal world  i   d prefer to know more about how we   re go to address the other communic issu first  specif  will we adopt a quantit inflat guidelin   will we specifi a  efram for achiev that object as well   how we answer those question will give us a framework for decid what type of forecast we want to provid   i guess that will be the discuss in march   in the mean   we should go slowli in make chang in our current forecast process  our approach to improv transpar has been increment   we have taken a step  some  a small step  and then we assess that step befor we take anoth step   over  e we make a seri of step that has signific improv our transpar   this approach has serv us well  becaus  as gari said  it would be veri difficult to revers a step that provid more transpar   it would be view as a takeaway   in that context  let me quick go through the question  then just for the record  i   ll make some summari comment   so  one  i would say that we want to have individu forecast   that   s what the sens of the committe seem to be   two  they should not have common assumpt   i think it   s import that they should be base on appropri polici   they should be what we actual think is go to happen   otherwis  it would be veri confus   i think that a minut style narrat would be help   we actual do it alreadi   it   s a board of governor document  but we do it   i   ll say a littl bit more about that later   should we joint agre on the narrat   i think we should   we have to work out the  efram  but i think we should   how frequent   i could see a case made for start out do one more a year in the fall   do it would be difficult  for reason that   gave  given our meet schedul   but it could be done  and i think it could be done without a lot of work   i   ll get to that later as well   how mani year   i would like to go more year  as you know  rather than fewer   i like sandi   s approach  go out five year  but i certain think we should extend the  efram   how mani variabl   i would drop nomin gdp  as other have said   then  on the uncertainti question  my initi instinct is to communic it in word rather than in fan chart  but that   s someth we could learn more about   i   m open to consid other way if we find one that is simpl and that peopl can understand   let me make a few overal comment   first  i thought that the document that   circul befor the meet was use   the major benefit to me in look at it was to see what assumpt you   re make  and i think that   help us in communic and in understand where peopl are come from as they make statement at the meet   it   s not someth i would want to see made public  but i think it   help us in term of communic with each other   second  there was some discuss at one point about actual put out a forecast of the fed fund rate   i   d be veri cautious about that   i know this is probabl at the top of the list of what privat sector peopl want  but for obvious reason   as don said  they   d like to know what it is go to be at our next meet   i would just be veri  veri care about that   third  i thought tom hoenig had an intrigu idea about put this in the minut   from an effici standpoint  do so has a lot of advantag   in the minut we actual describ what we think the forecast is  and we all review that descript and make chang  and the process has been fair effici so far   i could see do that without produc anoth document  so it would still be a committe document   of cours  the narrat would still be the committe narrat  but we   d just do it as part of the process of review the minut   i don   t think you need ani side bar disagr in there becaus we do that alreadi   in some case  we say    mani member    or    some member      i think it is handl quit well   so i   m intrigu by and attract to that suggest from an effici standpoint  and if we were go to do a third forecast  say in octob  it  sn   t have to be a separ document at all   it could just be in the minut   we could have a littl tabl with the forecast  the central tendenc  and the rang  and then a descript in the minut   that bring me to the point that a number of peopl have made about a dri run  which obvious is crucial  becaus we   ll learn more about the process   this get back to the point about who   the descript   is it the fomc   right now  the fomc   the forecast  and the board of governor   the explan of the forecast   if we put it in the minut  it would be an fomc descript  and the narrat would be the fomc   s narrat   in term of  e with the chairman   s tes oni  this  e the minut come out just after you testifi   so to fulfil the account issu that the congress want  we could have it in the minut as an fomc narrat  but the board of governor could then adopt it if the congress felt that was import from an account standpoint   but it could be the same document   that way to do it seem to me to be more effici  and it would be the committe   s view   that get me to kevin   s point about whether we are constrain the chairman when he is testifi or speak about this forecast or about the economi   certain  we don   t want to constrain the chairman   his credibl is the committe   s credibl and the institut   s credibl  and so it   s crucial that we not constrain him in that way   but if he felt strong about a differ between what the central tendenc of the committe forecast was and his own view  i have great confid that he could handl that without detract from his credibl but still enabl us to have a committe narrat on the forecast   as i said  i think a dri run would help us understand this better  but i do think we want to do this in as effici a way as possibl befor produc addit document becaus it   requir a lot of effort  particular from the staff here but also from all of us who are involv and our research staff
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   the question that presid pool        and other ask   whi are we do this    is alway the import one   you alway have to think about the object and what you   re tri to achiev  so that question has to be taken veri serious   as part of our general oblig to improv the monetari polici make process  we are do this as part of the broader evolut in improv transpar   we need to be proactiv   we don   t have to wait for someon to ask us to give them this or that   we should be control that process  and we should alway be think about way to improv  and this discuss is veri  veri use in think about how to move forward   i want to repeat the kudo to the staff for the excel memo that they put forward  give us both substant inform about what other do and way to think about ani sort of chang   i   ll go quick through the question   i think it   s veri valuabl to have differ point of view that are reflect in the forecast   part of the valu is that it is in the spirit of the feder reserv act   a forecast that is seen as pure central would to some extent be contrari to the act and could rais some hackl   it is valuabl to get those differ of view out there   whether there should be common assumpt  i guess i differ a bit from where everybodi els is   i think it would be worthwhil to make some effort when we   re go through the dri run to see if there are area of common becaus it would provid more inform  as presid   said  the clearer  more central  and more consist the forecast  the more potenti inform it is and the more account we can be   so it might be worthwhil at least to explor whether there are some aspect of common that wouldn   t caus inconsist of model or other problem   i   m not sure that we could get there  but i think it is worthwhil to spend some  e on that   part of the motiv for do so is that we alreadi put out a central tendenc forecast a coupl of  e a year   although the market respond to that survey had said they want more of this  when i talk to report or to market particip  they don   t realli seem to pay much attent to it  or it seem to decay veri  veri quick   they may pay attent for a veri short  e  and that   s whi it might be worthwhil to see whether someth a bit more consist could be given out about it   right now  except for a veri small window around the two  e a year that we put it out  i don   t see much emphasi on it   it   s valuabl to have a more rapid releas of inform   howev  the last thing i would want is to feel that we have to get it out fa  and to have that feel imped our decisionmak process   either need to put out the  book earlier or constrain our discuss becaus we had alreadi put a line in the sand   i think it   s      and you think it   s      my memo is out there  and my memo is better than your memo  laughter    i think that would be a mistak   also  particular sinc we are think of frequenc  if we releas inform three to four  e a year  it is go to get stale   but tri to get it out a week sooner so that it   s out there for three month and a week or four month and a week  rather than four month and two week or three month and two week  isn   t that help   i don   t want to undermin the excel decisionmak process that we have   so speed is valuabl  but there is a cost to it  and i don   t see the enorm benefit of get it out a week or two sooner   as i said  three to four  e a year seem reason   i like the evolutionari approach of provid some narrat  becaus i think that   s one of the key thing in provid more transpar   it give us greater abil to convey to the world how we   re think about thing   it also help us becaus we would not be as constrain with the veri few word that we put out as a committe   it would be nice  in principl  to be abl to use more word to convey our idea rather than be so constrain   if we do put the inform out as a separ document  i think that it will get much more attent   that may be valuabl  but it also will get differ reaction   right now  it goe out as part of tes oni that the chairman give   i could certain see request for more frequent tes oni if we start put the inform out more frequent   we have to think about that kind of feedback dynam  when we report more inform  what other demand might come   i   m not sure that would be the case  but i think the form and frequenc with which we put it out may induc that kind of respons   with respect to the forecast horizon  i think the key will be whether we are more explicit on some sort of target or goal  and then horizon should be relat to that   i don   t want it to go too far out   at the council of econom advis  i chair the so call troika process  in which we would do the administr forecast   initi we had to do ten year forecast   what inform do we have today that will tell us anyth about ten year down the line   we would alway revert to the mean  and we would do that over a five year period   basic  we didn   t feel that we realli had ani more inform after two to three year   so i would be reluct to push the horizon beyond two to three year unless we want to tell peopl about what we sort of thought trend rate was   that could be valuabl but onli to tell peopl about trend  not to say that we realli have ani insight into what   s go to happen four to five year from now   general our tendenc will be to bring thing back to trend   in term of what to talk about  real gdp  unemploy  and some measur of core inflat make a lot of sens   i   d be veri reluct  certain earli on  to talk about interest rate or interest rate assumpt   uncertainti is anoth thing   when we were work on the forecast at the cea  one of the thing that i and other had push for was tri to give some sens of the uncertainti when we were make these forecast   we actual got far enough to have some of our peopl talk with peopl on capitol hill  and we had veri strong negat pushback   they were say     well  if you   re not will to stand by your number   we have ask you to make a forecast  and you   re not stand by it if you   re give us this rang      also  peopl will pick out the high end or the low end of the rang for their particular purpos  and so you have to be veri care about how you put that out   in principl  i realli want to provid the uncertainti  i agre complet with governor   on that   but the form in which you provid it is veri import becaus we may think of it as uncertainti but other may think of it as either dodg an oblig or make a particular commit on the high side or the low side   this is as high as you can go and this is as low as you can go   and see it as a bargain type of thing   be an academ  i had never thought about it that way   but it is someth that we should consid in make sure that provid it is improv transpar and the effect of monetari polici   we don   t want to get into side debat about exact number   that would be exact the opposit of what we want to convey about uncertainti   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to say just a few thing quick about intern transpar  about the analyt framework that we use to make decis about monetari polici  and then about the extern dimens of the forecast process   first  on intern transpar  i think that it make sens for us to be a littl more explicit with each other about assumpt underpin the forecast that we bring to the tabl  that   s whi i circul the note   just to lay it out there in a clear way   without that inform  it is veri hard for us to know  when we are debat what to do  what we are realli debat   general  be more explicit with each other in privat   discreet   about the condit assumpt that are import to our forecast  about what we mean by    appropri polici     about whi and where we differ from the  book  how we see the balanc of risk  and mayb  if we can  at least a qualit sens of uncertainti would be use and would enrich the convers   on the analyt framework for monetari polici  i just have two suggest  one i   m go to repeat from our last convers   the first is that i think we need to broaden the set of analyt tool the staff give us now at each meet to think about the consequ of altern view in the forecast of differ monetari polici choic and so forth   you give us a rang of thing now that are veri help   the two thing we don   t get now fall in the follow categori   one is that you don   t give us a simpl way to look at what it might mean for an inflat forecast and an op  polici exercis if you have a veri differ view about structur inertia in inflat   not that there   s ani great way to do that now  given the state of the art   but it would be nice to have a way we could distinguish a littl more clear what a backward look  high inerti view about inflat fundament mean for the way we think about the forecast and monetari polici and what a more forward look view of inflat determin mean   that   s one area in which have someth broader would be help  even if it   s a set of high simplifi  high imperfect analyt prism  refer framework  or refer model   the other thing that we don   t get now is a way to think through how we make more explicit choic about the appropri period  for exampl  for bring inflat down to a more comfort level   that   s  of cours  an import way to teas out what peopl   s differ loss function or reaction function are   right now we aren   t realli present with  for exampl  a set of altern horizon for bring inflat back down to target and what that would mean for the rest of the thing that are import to us   those are two area in which it would be help to have a broader set of refer framework to underpin our convers of monetari polici   that   s an import invest to make if we   re go to do anyth to chang our current regim   whether in the direct of an explicit quantit object for the definit of price stabil over the long run  even with no horizon  and certain if we   re go to evolv in how we public describ our forecast   my second suggest echo a suggest that randi   made befor   i think that we would benefit from spend a bit more  e as a committe on think through what we understand about inflat  both how it is captur in the model the staff use and what are the import distinct between our view on these question   we don   t go veri deepli into those distinct   just a littl   you can see this in both presid     s and presid     s descript of their view of the forecast becaus they have a lower inflat forecast than the staff has without a veri differ view about unemploy and with a modest tighter monetari polici   the case for that view deserv some reflect  and we don   t spend a lot of  e talk through that   that   s an import invest to make if we   re go to be more explicit in public about choic concern  for exampl  how fast we want to bring inflat down to our object   two small thing on that ground would be help when the staff come back to prepar for the discuss in march about inflat object   first  a short treatment about the issu of what make the unit state differ would be interest   we have a lot of intern experi to look at  but we   re not norway  and we   re not new zealand   i don   t know how to think through that interest issu   i   m not sure it   s right  but i don   t think we can dismiss it out of hand  and i   d like some help think it through   anoth small thing  to elabor on a discuss that    don  and i had on the margin   if you could tell us a bit about what the past forecast error is of the mean fomc forecast and how that compar to the  book forecast error  that inform would be interest to have   it   s a small thing
there is research on that by the st  loui bank
good   and about forecast error
final  i have just a few quick point about the extern dimens of the discuss   i   m in favor of explor a narrat that describ the stori of the committe   s central tendenc about the outlook   it   s worth do  and the rang of issu on the tabl today in that direct i feel realli quit comfort with   i   m in favor of do it quarter  but i wouldn   t want to make that decis without think through veri care whether it make sens   i would want to explor differ way of express the varianc across the committe   i like the histogram approach   i   d even be open to the fan chart devic  as   describ it  for tri to captur differ form of uncertainti   i don   t think we should tri to agre as a committe on a path for what appropri polici mean   therefor  i would not be in favor of work toward disclos an agre upon path  for mani of the reason that are familiar to all of us   i want to experi with a minut like iter process for come to some level of comfort with how that central tendenc is describ  but i   d be will to give the chairman the role of final arbit of what get present  to save the staff from endless negoti   i think the horizon question is veri interest   i was inclin to think that three year make sens   a concern i have about three year   apart from the one that   rais  which is that it probabl tell you onli a littl about your view of potenti or your object  and it may not have much inform beyond that   is the follow   if we   re think about the merit of a regim in which we will not have a defin period that we commit to for bring inflat back to target  we need to be comfort with show a forecast that mayb has inflat abov target for possibl a signific period of  e   if the period is two year  it will be easier not to get ourselv in a posit in which we feel compel to show a more acut declin in that path  if we   re at three year  it will be harder to avoid that   we will be uncomfort  i think  if we   re in a three year regim go for sustain period with inflat stay outsid that rang  therefor  i am a bit tentat about three year   whatev we do  we should experi first   we should be care not do ani damag to a staff forecast process that has work veri  veri well and serv the committe veri  veri well   also  we should recogn the ignor we all live with and should be care not to start down a road that would give the market fals comfort  a fals sens of precis  fals confid in our view of the world  and all those other thing mani peopl have spoken about   let me say someth about skeptic   skeptic is a veri import virtu  but it virtu is not in the servic of inertia   it virtu is in the servic of tri to figur out how we can improv what we do and how to save ourselv from mistak along the way   so i don   t want to be    outskeptick    by anybodi    laughter    i think it   s import to think about it that way   as all this impli  i don   t think it make sens to have uniform condit assumpt impos on our individu forecast  certain not uniform condit assumpt on the monetari polici path  but also not on ani of the import dimens that are the focus
thank you   presid pool
may i rais a veri quick question   from  e to  e  the polit of budget deficit get all tangl up with differ between cbo and omb forecast of the economi   do we know whether fed forecast have ever been drag into that argument
not to my knowledg
i think that the longer the forecast period and the more that it is a committe forecast  the more like it is that the fomc may get pull into that argument   whether we   re on this side or that side of the argument   i just rais the question becaus we ought to be sure we   re clear about that befor we make our own forecast period too specif and too long
first  let me thank both the staff and all member   peopl clear took this assign veri serious  and it has been extrem use   i won   t tri to summar    laughter   fortun  we have a tape record   i would like to make a few brief comment   i believ that we ought to increas our emphasi on the project   i   ll talk a bit about some of the paramet of that  but i believ that i owe an answer to presid   about whi   i don   t think the process is broken   i don   t think we have a serious problem   but i do think we could do better   specif  to give some exampl  i think  first  that our statement is too influenti in the sens that we argu today about a coupl of phrase  a coupl of word  know that the market would seiz on them and that they would move market   if we had more inform  more complet descript of our view  the statement would becom less of an issu   second  i don   t want governor kohn move the market    laughter   i think that public comment are often overinterpret   i know in my own case they have been    laughter  i recal the case in which a letter to a senat includ the phrase    well contain inflat expect    rather than    contain inflat expect      that was a letter draft by the staff  and i perhap didn   t read it care enough   it was the subject of commentari in the market for some week after that   we have a bit of space in which to improv our communic with the market and the public   this way to do it would be fundament increment   i   m not propos  and i don   t think that anyon is propos  a radic chang  we can build on someth that has work and that we understand how to do  and of cours we would approach it veri cautious   but i do think that this is  as presid   call it  low hang fruit in the sens that it   s someth we could use to increas our communic and transpar in a fair low risk way   last spring there was a good bit of confus in the market about how quick we want to bring inflat down   the forecast essenti address that issu becaus they implicit incorpor our polici prefer   so i think we could improv our communic by increas inform about our outlook and our polici prefer   anoth issu is a bit hard to explain  but i will tri   i think that our credibl is enhanc if we can deperson it and make the ownership of our polici more the committe   s and the institut   s   it   s the credibl of the feder reserv that matter  not ben bernank   s credibl   i assur you that we are better off with the feder reserv   s credibl   make the credibl of polici part of a broader process  with more input and clearer committe analysi    to some extent increas the sens in which the institut  rather than the chairman or ani other individu  is respons for the outcom and the polici   have said all of that  i don   t advoc ani radic chang   i think we ought to consid three or four addit project depend on the schedul and other factor  governor bie mention fine tune   perhap the way i would look at it is that inform that we have about the outlook chang over  e  and six month is a long  e   our view do chang within a period of three to four month  and i think it would be inform to let peopl know that   i   m open  but i think we should have individu forecast   the solut to the problem of consist assumpt is the one that presid   mention   to have peopl make their uncondit forecast the same way a blue chip forecast would do   that essenti includ the forecast of what the committe is go to do  which is not necessarili the same for everyon but it is base on each person   s view about where they think the economi and polici are go   that   s one approach   there are probabl other  but i want to suggest that as a possibl solut   mani peopl have support the narrat descript   i think that   s import   i think be more  e would be use   i don   t quit follow the idea of put the narrat in the minut   if we actual have this inform  say  a week after the meet  whi would we want to wait until three week   it is more credibl and more use the sooner it come out   the same is true for the minut   when the minut were releas after the follow meet  it was a non event   when they were brought out earlier  they becam view as a veri inform  use piec of inform   so  like governor    i don   t think we should deform our decisionmak process or be overhasti  but if we can make such communic more  e than the minut  we should probabl tri to do that   i agre with the mani peopl who said that we should includ some sens of uncertainti  there are way to do that  for exampl  includ histor number on the forecast error of previous project of the  book  of the blue chip  or of somebodi would give the public some sens of what the histor record is and perhap lead them not to overvalu the individu forecast   again  i don   t think this is particular riski   as i said  i hope we   ll approach this increment   inde  the histori of the feder reserv sinc       when we first began to announc the feder fund rate target  has been one of increment chang   this is a littl unfair  but  presid    you should go back and read the discuss in the fomc befor the decis to begin releas the feder fund rate target  there was a lot of catastroph about what was go to happen and whi what we   re do now is the best possibl approach  and so on   so i think this is realli no more than a continu of twelv or thirteen year of progress in term of inform   the other reason that this is not particular riski  if it   s done care and slowli  is that we have a great deal of intern experi   obvious  we   re not norway  but we   ve seen what work across a whole varieti of central bank  and financi market have becom more accustom to this kind of inform be releas   there are some import govern issu   whether we have an approv process or a consult process  i think we could get a forecast  togeth with some descript  within a reason period   someth on the order of a week or less after the meet   let me make just a suggest along those line   if we were to tie project to two day meet and if we were to have  as we do now  project submit befor the meet  along with perhap a paragraph of descript about the major element of the forecast and the major risk  i think the staff and i could present on the second day a draft of what we took both from the first day   s discuss and from the submiss of the project   at that point  we could get feedback  or there would be opportun for peopl to chang their forecast or their view base on the discuss at the meet   we   d have to allow for divers and dissent  and i think that   s perfect fine   we   ve done that in mani context  and i think we should continu to do that   i would just conclud by say that mani peopl have mention the import of dri run and a slow and care process  and i think it would be veri hard to disagre with that   we   ve done that in other case  and i think we should do that here   so  to summar  i think there is some basi for tri to increas our use of the project   it would be consist with our previous increment movement toward greater transpar   it would provid more inform and reduc the sensit of the market to other type of communic  such as the statement and public comment   but we have heard an aw lot of interest viewpoint today  and i don   t envi the subcommitte  which will have to go through all of this and come up with a set of propos   are there ani further comment  presid
i know you don   t want to prolong this meet  and i don   t either  but i   m interest in what you think it feel like to all of us and to the market to have a two day meet  to have a minut style summari of a rang of forecast come out  and then a week and a half to two week later have the minut come out   how   that work   what is the increment inform that come from those two thing  sinc the minut alreadi have a rang of inform in them that  narrat anyway  goe through a forecast and peopl   s sens of where thing are like to go with regard to the forecast  which i presum would be what you would put into a narrat around the rang of forecast   it is certain possibl to do  but how   that work
i think it   s more inform to combin numer es  with a qualit descript
then a week and a half later have anoth qualit descript
well  that   s not a reason not to do this   i think that you could reproduc the inform in the minut  there would be further amplif and discuss in the minut   i am just think out loud here   the descript i have in mind would be a page or two  noth substanti   the minut would be an opportun to provid more inform and show more of the divers of view
as presid hoenig   s suggest  presid     s suggest  and your suggest impli  there is a rang of varianc around that  and that   s one of the thing we   ll have to work through as well as how this fit within a set of exist process and disclosur that we   re go to preserv
there   s also a question of how it relat to the statement  that   s absolut right   are there other comment   presid
mr  chairman  i thank you  and my mother thank you  for address the skeptic issu   may i just add one other thing   you were veri polit at the begin of this convers  but i   d like to reinforc what i interpret you as have said   the articl from the new york  e a coupl of day ago realli bother me   sinc we   re talk about proceed slowli and deliber and sever peopl have use the term    dri run      which is veri  veri import and i fulli endors   i hope that no one form or advanc the discuss by have a public revel of what took place at this tabl   may i suggest  sinc you constant see certain peopl who are not on this committe refer to  that we be veri care in what we share with those peopl becaus they are refer point   some of them are friend of mani peopl at this tabl  but it appear to me that this   noth but truncat the discuss or risk do so and has outsid rais question that we realli don   t want to answer right now   thank you  mr  chairman
