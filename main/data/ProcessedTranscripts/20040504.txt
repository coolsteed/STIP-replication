without object  they are approv   mr  reinhart  do you want to make some comment relev to this set of minut
i   d just like to report on the first dri run of our experi in expedit the product of the fomc minut   we were abl to produc a propos final version of the minut and get all twelv vote member of the committe to indic by our deadlin that they were inclin to vote to adopt the minut at the next meet   there was not a lot of slack in our  schedul  though  and we receiv the last of the member    respons as to their inclin on the vote pretti close to the wire  two factor contribut to the success of the experi   one was contract for an outsid profession to help provid a type transcript of the meet on an expedit basi   that sped up the process of prepar the initi draft of the minut consider   for anoth  there weren   t all that mani comment on that first draft  so we were abl to incorpor them and turn out a revis draft in fair good order   one problem  which we had anticip  was get inform to and from committe member who were out of their offic   needless to say  we learn a few thing about the process  and we will make some minor adjust  but they will be in the background from your perspect  onc the minut were readi  we ask dave skidmor of the public affair staff to prepar some hypothet headlin and the first few paragraph of a news wire stori on the minut   then board and new york staff member independ look at that inform as well as the minut and tri to es  the like market effect of an earli releas of those minut   the result  which should be taken with a grain of salt  suggest that there could have been a fair substanti market reaction  and that was becaus of the  e   these minut would have been releas on the afternoon of the outsiz employ report  and perhap would have reinforc the market reaction to the number releas earlier that day  i   m sure you note that in this exercis we ask you to indic whether you were inclin to vote to approv these minut but not actual to vote on them   the reason was that if we had ask you to vote  we would have to indic in the next set of minut that the committe had taken a notat vote on that decis   that   s whi two and a half week after the meet we   ll  continu to ask you to give us your inclin as to whether you would approv the draft minut but actual have you vote on them at the next meet   thank you
ani question for
mr  chairman  may i ask a question   it seem to me that we ought to consult with counsel as to whether the so call inclin to vote could be regard as be the equival of a vote and could creat a problem in the futur   i think that   s someth on which we should get some expert legal advic
okay   so it   s perfect okay to put it that way
thought that the word of the request we sent around was perfect appropri
presid   is propos the elect of joseph traci as an associ economist of the fomc   if there are no object  i will assum that his request is approv
dino kos  would you start us off
yes   thank you  mr  chairman  i   ll be refer to the chart that   low just circul   in the intermeet period  stronger econom data and rapid shift expect brought forward the  e of the anticip tighten cycl and affect a rang of asset price   the top panel of page   graph the three month deposit rate in black and the three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward in the dash red line   the first move up in forward rate follow the strong employ report on april     the second move was coincid with the higher than expect cpi data on april     coupl with other indic suggest to market particip that inflationari pressur were build   also contribut to the shift were comment by the chairman and other member of the committe   and even a former member of the committe   that were broad interpret as lay the groundwork for a tighten later this summer   dure april  the three month forward rate move about    basi point higher  wherea the nine month forward    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix      rate move up about     basi point   not surpris  the treasuri curv sold off  and yield move sharpli higher as well   the two year yield  which tend to be the most sensit to polici chang  rose about    basi point between late march and this morn   as shown in the middl panel  the spread between the two year note and the target fed fund rate widen to     basi point  it widest level sinc the spring of        just as a footnot  i would point out that there has been a lot of talk about what would happen to bond yield if the fed fund target were rais   what perhap has been lost in the discuss is just how much yield alreadi have risen in onli the last five week with the mere discuss of a possibl tighten   the bottom left panel graph the two year to ten year treasuri spread   if the market were truli worri about inflationari pressur  one would expect the curv to steepen as the long end rise fa  than the short end   but the spread has not widen and in fact has narrow somewhat   especi after the chairman   s tes oni   similar  breakeven rate from tip have not widen and have also narrow slight in the past two week   the market is certain discount higher interest rate  it is not obvious  howev  that higher inflat is also be price in   the churn of posit and hedg adjust as new data came in did caus a bit of congest in segment of the market   turn to page    the top panel graph the overnight repo rate for the on the run two year treasuri note sinc februari   the treasuri depart auction two year note month so this graph pick up each new issu on settlement   it   s typic for the on the run two year note to trade slight    special      translat into an overnight financ rate a bit below the general collater rate  which itself is normal a few basi point below the fund rate   after the last employ report  the market rush to sell the curv  especi at the short end   in that situat  those with short posit then need to borrow the secur to complet settlement   given the size of the short base  the demand to borrow that piec of paper quick push the financ rate toward zero   the congest also caus a rise in fail for this issu  and to a lesser extent some other on the run issu  though aggreg fail are still signific below where they were last summer  when the may ten year note was in short suppli   the increas in the repo rate at the veri end of april is due to the issuanc of a new two year note that is trade more comfort nearer to the general collater rate   the mortgag market provid anoth element to recent price chang   the middl left panel graph the ten year yield in red and an es  of the durat of outstand thirti year fix rate mortgag back secur  mbs  in blue   with the ten year yield go from      to     percent  the mbs durat index near doubl from two year to more than three and a half year   there was certain some mbs convex hedg  but it probabl play a lesser role than it did last summer when durat widen veri rapid from about one half year to three and a half year   the thirti year mbs spread  shown on the middl right panel  has widen in recent week  but it is still a long way from the high of last summer   this may suggest that mbs holder such as bank and hedg fund are still hold on to their lever mbs posit   corpor spread  on the other hand  actual have narrow sinc the march fomc meet   the invest grade spread on the bottom left narrow to about    basi point   the better economi seem to be part of the explan for the percept of improv creditworthi  the more pronounc move was in the high yield spread  shown in the bottom right panel  which narrow about    basi point  the reason are complex and not necessarili consist   the better econom number  percept of improv price power  and improv balanc sheet are part of the explan but are not fulli convinc   especi given the weak of equiti market and the widen of other spread product   the narrow of the high yield index is even more paradox  given the wider spread in emerg market bond   the high yield and embi spread had been track each other for about four year now until april   s sharp diverg   i   ll get back to the emerg market stori a bit later   turn to page    the dollar is broad higher sinc mid februari  driven by mani of the same factor that sent interest rate higher   at least in this veri recent period  the improv econom prospect in the unit state and higher yield have outweigh worri about the current account imbal   and while u s  data have improv  european growth has lag  and that diverg has shown up in interest rate differenti   the middl panel show the eurodollar and euribor futur curv out to june      as of april   on the left and april    on the right   on april   the euribor curv was abov the eurodollar curv except at the longer date  by april    the eurodollar curv had move higher and had steepen and was trade abov the euribor curv except at the shorter date   the bottom panel graph the differenti between a sampl of two year major sovereign yield and the two year treasuri note   all have narrow in the past month   in some case  dramat   the dollar   s recent move against the yen are graph at the top of page     sinc the last fomc meet the dollar has made a round trip  go from     yen to     yen by the march    fiscal year end date and then back to       one factor that did not affect the exchang rate dure the intermeet period was foreign exchang intervent   the japanes ministri of financ last interven in the market on the date of your previous meet   the chang tactic had trader scratch their head initi  but they have sinc taken the view that japan   s improv economi has made policymak more comfort with the exchang rate   the improv japanes economi has also shown through to fix incom and equiti market   the top right panel graph the continu  if irregular  rise in ten year jgb yield   the middl left panel graph for the past twelv month the rise in the overal topix index and some of the domest equiti not link to the export sector  such as real estat  that are do better   even more impress has been the recoveri of the bank sector   the middl right panel graph the stock price of the big four bank  each of which has risen sharpli   mizuho and ufj  which had fallen  in      and earli       have risen about sevenfold in the last twelv month   the latter appear to have been unaffect by the special inspect that was announc on the day of your last meet   final  equiti and debt valu in emerg market have fallen in recent day   in part that may reflect the implic of an incipi tighten cycl here   but the other factor that may be at play involv an actual or perceiv linkag to china  some emerg market were affect first posit and later negat by this linkag   a few week ago the strength of mani commod price was attribut to demand from china   with strong signal in the past few day that chines offici are intent on slow down credit and invest  these popular trade in some case had sharp revers   non oil commod price are one exampl  they have fallen in recent day   as i mention earlier  the widen of the embi  spread has been sharp  although as i   ve said in previous meet mani emerg market analyst were wari of the narrow embi spread even sever month ago   the bottom panel graph a sampl of major emerg market equiti index  all of which have turn lower in the past week or two with the chang sen ent   mr  chairman  we conduct no foreign oper in the intermeet period   i will need a vote to approv our domest oper
the volum of financ in the mortgag market has come down veri sharpli and has stay down for quit a long period now   i would assum  and inde you impli it  that hedg have alreadi been taken on a good part of the posit held   so the impact of a chang in yield clear has been far less than it was last august when the matur  as you said  went from one half year to three and one half year  or whatev it was   what is left out there to be hedg   and what are the vulner in the event  for exampl  that we get anoth    basi point rise in the ten year note
well  i think it   s hard to identifi what the vulner are   on the downsid  it   s the refinanc risk that is be hedg  on the upsid  it   s the extens risk   as the durat is extend becaus higher interest rate are push off the day of possibl refinanc  there   s a certain amount of sell that portfolio will natur do
but that  sn   t move as rapid as when we get a big interest rate move and there   s a huge option takedown of mortgag posit
exact   we had a flavor of that in       when an unexpect chang in interest rate caus a huge amount of extens hedg   so  that   s alway the risk   now  what will trigger it is difficult to pinpoint ex ant   but certain there would be some amount that would need to be hedg as rate increas
presum there will be a lot of delta hedg move in with that type of oper
yes   i   m look at governor bie  who may have some direct experi in this area   but again  my guess is that there would be a certain amount of hedg that would still need to be done
mr  chairman  you can see in dino   s chart on page   that  when rate are unchang and are expect to be unchang  the durat of a thirti year convent mortgag level out at around four and one half year   so we have at most about anoth half year to go if rate were to rise
well  that   s what histori tell us   that at the lowest level of refinanc  durat has been about four and one half year   but can that chang in ani way  there   s noth mathemat necessari about it  is there
no  that   s more a reflect of the mobil of our popul   when rate are unchang for long enough  the econom incent to refin goe away  but peopl still do prepay their mortgag becaus they move or they trade up   so  i think the four and one half year is not immut  but it   s a reflect of deeper demograph
a reflect of the hous turnov rate
i   m a littl surpris that in your chart new zealand has all of a sudden becom a major intern power   consid the fact that the yield spread between new zealand and australia are lock  you must be tri to convey some subtl messag here
well  the onli messag is that  with the euro have brought togeth a lot of currenc into one  the number of currenc out there with float rate has been reduc   we basic have the euro and a number of fix rate currenc  which are not worth show  so the number of altern in the popul is smaller
you ought to tri the zloti or someth
it may be too calm
there are indic that inventori are build up on the dock in china and that warehous are begin to fill  which i presum is relat to the recent weak in commod price  especi for steel   price for cold roll sheet  which is the premier steel   especi in china   for car make  have come down quit signific   and that   s a classic inventori play   are you pick up anyth that suggest that there   s more to this than just temporari glut   the data are  of cours  nonexist  but what   one hear about the inventori situat in china
we tend to talk to trader rather than to shipper and factori manag  so i would not hold myself out as the expert in this area   certain among trade and invest type  i would say that there   s a lot of confus   the sen ent about china has been pretti volatil in term of whether the economi is overh or not  what the inventori situat is  and what the polici stanc is   some of the volatil that we   re see in market may be reflect of the fact  that peopl chang their mind about those issu from day to day   now  in term of inventori  i don   t know if   has a better handl
we don   t have ani actual real  e data on inventori at that level
there is an old classic adag that suggest that  when everybodi say    nobodi has ani inventori     it is tell you that the rate of accumul is horrend and that the level is alreadi veri high by histor standard but you haven   t sate the demand for the still higher level that occur just befor it turn around   and the first sign is a break in price   what has happen to the copper price in the last three or four day  by the way
copper price are down
they   re down a bit
in the last three or four day
well  they   re off their peak   when we put the  book to bed  they had come down from their peak level  and they have come down anoth    cent  i would say  sinc then   that was larg on news of the macro monetari polici come out of china rather than on news about real econom activ or inventori or anyth els   so  it was in some sens an infer   in effect  that if china   s boom cool  copper would becom less viabl   on the part of those who trade in futur market rather than a direct read on what was go on   now  over the same interv   sinc we put the  book to bed through friday  which is the last date for which i have quot   lumber price  for exampl  both spot and in the futur market  went up not down  that   s part becaus what is drive the lumber specul or purchas or hedger or whoever is u s  homebuild as oppos to chines construct   and these market player thought they were get differ signal  so the futur curv shift the other way   soybean price  which are be driven by expect of the begin of harvest  also have gone up a bit sinc the   book rather than down   but cotton is down a lot off it peak  copper is down notic from it peak  and wheat is down from it peak   so a more inform and discrimin shift seem to be go on  but it is tie to what peopl perceiv to be news about the factor that are drive demand in these market
industri activ or more broad a good part of the gdp is better measur by metal price than by lumber  whose demand is fair concentr  or certain by agricultur product
right   and for metal  i think the stori isn   t necessarili the same for all of them   but copper in particular was thought to be driven by develop in china
aluminum is peak  as is zinc and i think tin   somebodi still buy tin  but that   s down  too  i believ
i have a less detail pictur in front of me regard aluminum   it appear to have stop rise as oppos to fall
it has flatten out
yes  but copper has alreadi start move down
okay   ani other question for dino   if not  would someon like to move the ratif of the domest market transact
without object they are approv   dino  would you like to talk about the swap line
it   s may  which mean it is  e to consid the renew of the swap line   i did send a brief memo around which cover the renew of the swap  and i   m recommend that the committe renew them   there were also a coupl of other item that i mention briefli regard  some thing that we   re do with the euro reserv   i   d be happi to answer question about either item
if there are no object  i will assum that your request is grant   we now move on to the staff report  and i call on dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   after countless meet and much effort to assembl the  book over the past few week  i must admit that it was disappoint to come to work last thursday to find that our forecast had a half life shorter than a jar of mayonnais in the mojav desert    laughter   as you know  the bea report that their advanc es  of the growth in real gdp in the first quarter was     percent at an annual rate   a full percentag point less than the forecast that we had publish onli the day befor   we spent the last few day pore over the detail of that releas in order to assess it implic for understand where the economi has been and where it might be go   that task was made somewhat simpler by the fact that so much of our error was concentr in inventori invest   inde  our project increas in final sale for the first quarter of    percent at an annual rate was onli slight abov the bea   s es  of a   percent increas  with small differ spread out over sever categori of spend   and after incorpor ye day   s data on construct outlay  the bea would like rais it es  of the growth of final sale close to our april forecast   the inventori discrep  howev  was more consequenti   we had been anticip nonfarm inventori invest to contribut   percentag point to the growth of real gdp in the first quarter  while the bea is now es  that contribut to be just   percentag point   about two third of our miss was in account for truck inventori  which might seem surpris given that we have reason good data on the number of vehicl held in inventori   unfortun  the bea   not use a straightforward translat of those data to es  inventori invest for truck   and it appear that our attempt to mimic the more complic bea procedur led us far off track last quarter   i hope that you will take it as a sign of merci and not disrespect if i spare you from the detail   but in the final analysi  we saw noth in last week   s data that would lead us to alter our forecast of truck product for the year as a whole   henc  we believ that  to a first approxim  what was lost in real gdp in the first quarter from truck inventori will be made up later in the year  start in the current quarter   owe in part to a smaller es  drag from the motor vehicl sector  we have boost our project increas in real gdp in the second quarter to   percent from the     percent figur that we publish in the  book   our miss  howev  was not confin to motor vehicl inventori   other inventori invest also came in below our expect  and here we do see the data as have some inform content   the bea   s translat of the book valu figur show a continu liquid of real non auto inventori rather than the stabil that we had anticip   in respons to this appar continu reluct by firm to restock  we are inclin to stretch out the  rebound in inventori invest that we had been project to occur over the remaind of this year and into        that adjust knock a tenth off gdp growth this year and add a tenth to growth next year relat to last thursday   s  book   at this point  you are probabl begin to wonder where the merci is that i had promis earlier  so i   ll leav the tree and return to the forest   and i must say  the forest is look pretti good   much as we expect  accommod monetari polici and a third consecut year of substanti fiscal s ulus are combin to provid a sizabl boost to growth   import  the labor market is begin to show broader sign of life   privat payrol rose         per month  on averag  in the first quarter  up from the        per month pace of the fourth quarter   hire intent as report by manpow and in the nfib survey of small busi also have been move up in recent month   even household    assess of current labor market condit have improv some of late   that said  we still believ that it is prematur to conclud that the employ situat is firm on the path of steadi improv   the event of last autumn come to mind   as you may recal  the octob employ report show two consecut increas in privat payrol close to         per month  with notic upward revis to preced month  the long await job recoveri look to be under way   but by the decemb report  those larg gain had been revis down substanti  and the initi es  for decemb was an increas of just       job   so  the march employ report should be view as encourag but not definit   the gain in wage and salari incom associ with the recent pickup in hire have combin with the s ul effect of last year   s tax cut to provid a substanti lift to household buy power   and household have not been shi about use that buy power   despit a drop in sale of new motor vehicl  total consum spend rose   percent in the first quarter  and with car sale project to move up a bit  we expect real pce to climb at a pace of about   percent in the second quarter   hous activ has remain except robust  with both sale and construct of new home at or near record high   busi spend  too  has continu to increas sharpli   real outlay for equip and softwar rose    percent in the first quarter  and with order backlog for capit equip continu to rise  the outlook remain quit favor   the economi final appear to be fire on all cylind   low real interest rate  tax cut  and larg increas in govern spend are fuel aggreg demand  and final sale are advanc brisk   add to that mix what appear to us to be veri lean inventori  and there is consider tinder for an even hotter economi than we are project   a possibl that we explor in an altern simul in the  book   nevertheless  i don   t think that you should discount the downsid risk surround the outlook just yet   as i note earlier  the improv in the labor market must still be consid tentat  and the ongo liquid of inventori could be a sign that busi caution  while fade  has not yet evapor   even extract the signal from the strengthen of final sale over the past year is not  straightforward   fiscal polici could be prove a more potent sourc of s ulus to the economi than we have allow for in our forecast  and thus as this s ulus shift to restraint next year  the downdraft in demand could be more pronounc than we current expect   needless to say  we believ that we have balanc the risk in our forecast for real activ  but the uncertainti remain substanti   perhap the biggest challeng to our forecast over the intermeet period came not from the real side data but rather from the inflat figur   with onli a few except  the read that we receiv on hour labor compens and price were to the high side of our project   as usual  we can trot out a list of special factor that contribut to some of the fluctuat that have occur over the past six month   use car  apparel  and lodg away from home are among the culprit in the recent pickup in inflat   but the breadth of the surpris that we have experienc thus far this year suggest to us that recent wage and price develop could not prudent be ascrib to special factor alon   confront with last year   s sharp declin in price inflat  we had to make an assess at the turn of the year as to how much of that deceler reflect a signal about under inflat and how much was just nois   we view the recent data as suggest that we attach too much weight to last year   s slowdown and that the under inflat rate has been abov our earlier es    as a consequ  we increas our project of core consum price by between   and    percentag point  on averag  this year and next   i should note that  in respons to this upward revis to inflat  we also rais our fund rate path by a similar amount   although we rais the level of project inflat in this forecast  we did not fundament chang it trajectori   so after a bulg in the first half of this year  core pce price inflat is project to move sideway at a    percent annual pace over the remaind of the project period   that flat path for inflat reflect influenc that are individu small and general offset in our forecast   over the next year and a half  some upward pressur on cost result from a diminish margin of slack in resourc util and an end to the acceler of structur product   but the indirect effect of the expect retreat in energi price and a flatten out of core non oil import price after this year   s commod induc surg are expect to take some pressur off core inflat in        obvious  there is plenti of scope to take issu with the assumpt condit our inflat project   slack could be taken up more rapid than we expect  especi if labor forc particip fail to rebound as anticip   energi price have disappoint both the futur market and us over the past year by move up  rather than down   strong global demand and continu geopolit uncertainti could keep price in these market higher and for longer than is incorpor in our forecast   and if the dollar were to resum a sharper descent  price of import good and servic would rise more quick than project  and domest produc would have still greater latitud to lift their price   there are other risk to our inflat outlook as well   for exampl  despit the upward revis that we have made  our forecast still read some signal in last year   s disinfl   if all of the price deceler last year was nois  then our project of core consum price remain between   and    percentag point too low go forward   a more troubl possibl is that we have fundament mises  the amount of resourc slack in the economi   the most promin error made by inflat forecast in the late     s and     s was a persist over op  about the nairu   that over op  had two consequ  both of which were advers for inflat   first  the economi was allow to overshoot potenti  result in a demand driven increas in price inflat   and second  a failur to recogn and lean against that demand driven acceler in price result in higher inflat becom more firm embed in expect   there is some evid to support these concern   a number of you have report hear stori from employ that find worker with the right skill is difficult  if those type of mismatch are widespread  then the nairu may inde be higher than we current es    the evid on inflat expect is mix   but depend on one   s prefer measur  those expect have been stabl to somewhat higher in recent month   we explor the consequ of a higher nairu in an altern simul in the  book   in that simul  core pce inflat increas to around   percent in      and would continu to increas beyond the forecast horizon without an adjust to polici   while a higher nairu is as a possibl  we don=t believ that it fit all of the fact comfort  import  measur of hour labor compens have been run at or slight below our model  on averag  over the past two year   model that incorpor a   percent nairu   and while there has been some improv  the labor market still look more lacklust than hot   i don   t want to leav you with the impress that we see the risk to inflat as skew to the upsid   after a year of veri subdu read on core inflat  the last three month of larger increas may ul  prove to be the outlier  and our upward revis to the inflat forecast this round may turn out to have been an overreact   moreov  model that incorpor a role for the level of the price markup suggest notic downsid risk to our inflat forecast   the extraordinari gain in product over the past few year have allow firm to rebuild profit margin back to the peak level observ in        in our forecast  these margin narrow onli a bit over the next two year  as unit labor cost acceler gradual and price inflat remain rough stabl   model that assign a bigger role to the price markup expect competit pressur to eventu result in both fa  wage growth and lower price inflat  and thus a more rapid return of labor   s share of incom to it histor norm   a scenario along these line in the  book push core pce inflat down to    percent in        in sum  i know that as the nation   s chief worrier you don   t need the staff to explain to you that the backlog of unresolv worri remain high   as alway  econom  financi  and geopolit uncertainti abound   but in survey the  econom landscap  one cannot help but be struck with how convent  familiar  and balanc the risk and uncertainti look today in comparison with those that we face just a year ago     will continu our present
one element of the extern forecast that may be of greater interest than usual is the recent and prospect behavior of import price  and i thought that i would begin by look at some of the factor drive chang in those price   the advanc releas last week report that the deflat for total import of good and servic rose at an annual rate of    percent in the first quarter  after increas onli a bit more than     percent over the four quarter of        a larg part of this upsurg reflect the upward move in oil price over the quarter  with the price record for comput and semiconductor import provid some offset by declin  but less than in the past on the part of comput   in part  the rise in import price also reflect continu increas in the price for servic import  which rose quit strong in      as the dollar depreci   for the remain import item  which we term core import  the annual rate of price increas in the first quarter was     percent  a bit less than we had es  in the  book but substanti more than the     percent record last year   among the compon of core good  the commod intens categori of food and non oil industri suppli record the greatest jump  with the latter rise at an annual rate of near    percent   this develop is consist with our model analysi  which suggest that the two most import factor behind the rapid inflat in core import price last quarter were the exchang rate and commod  includ natur gas   look ahead  our forecast call for deceler of core import price to an annual rate of about     percent over the remaind of this year and to about    percent next year   this slow import reflect the recent and project path for the nomin exchang valu of the dollar  which paus start around the turn of the year follow a two year period of depreci  has risen slight on balanc so far this year  and is project to declin onli margin over the forecast period   the lag effect of previous dollar depreci were still evid in core import price in the first quarter  but our project for the dollar impli that the contribut of the exchang rate will be a small negat to zero start with the current quarter   we expect that commod price will continu to exert signific upward pressur on import price over the rest of       larg becaus of lag effect from previous increas  but then will hold down import price inflat in       owe to declin expect on averag and in most categori   our index for nonfuel primari commod price rose near    percent in the first quarter  and our model find that the effect persist for four quarter   price in all four categori of commod   food  beverag  agricultur raw materi  and miner and metal   rose in doubl digit in the first quarter  but some have peak and begun to declin   among the individu commod price that rose most rapid are those for copper  which have alreadi come off their recent peak   similar  price for soybean have stop  rise  futur price call for spot soybean price to fall sharpli at midyear as new crop are harvest   thus although our forecast incorpor a rather abrupt chang in the cours of nonfuel primari product price  we believ that the sign of that revers are alreadi evid   accord  we believ that our forecast for signific slow in import price is balanc  with risk on both side   the extrem rapid increas in commod price dure the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year  particular for miner and metal  are link to the rebound of real output growth in some region  especi emerg asia   within asia  the pace of growth in china  which has averag near    percent over the past three quarter  is seen as a major reason for the strong demand for commod   chines author have taken step to tighten monetari condit and to slow the rate of growth of bank credit in order to counter concern about domest inflat pressur and excess invest in some sector   our forecast see these effort as success  with growth slow to a moder     percent rate but not collaps as some fear   at the same  e  we see inflat in china lessen as the rapid increas in food price abat   elsewher in emerg asia  we expect expans to continu at a vigor pace  depend import on continu global spend on high tech good   bol  by rapid growth in asia and continu strength in the u s  economi  we look for global output to grow at near it current pace over the remaind of this year and to deceler onli slight next year   some part of the global economi  such as canada and the unit kingdom  should continu to show firm in domest demand   in japan  we look for domest demand  particular privat invest  to be a sourc of demand s ulus  but net export will be an import element in maintain real gdp growth at around     percent through next year   the outlook for the euro area is more troubl   we expect that export will respond to the improv global economi and grow moder   but given the past appreci of the exchang valu of the euro  import should rise as well   on balanc  we anticip that the extern sector will be a neutral factor and that real gdp in the euro area will expand at about the same   percent pace as domest demand   such an outcom will not allow for much progress in address the macroeconom problem  such as high unemploy rate and excess budget deficit  confront mani of the larg euro area countri   it should result in a small tick down in euro area inflat  permit the ecb to delay ani rate increas until        overal  our forecast for real output growth abroad is favor   when combin with our project for slight depreci in the real exchang valu of the dollar  it yield a rebound in our forecast for growth of total export of real good and servic to more than    percent over the remaind of this year and onli slight lower next year   both core good and servic should respond to foreign gdp and relat price and bounc back from rather weak first quarter figur to moder growth on averag over the forecast period   in nomin term  export growth should about equal  or exceed that of import  notwithstand the strong perform of the u s  economi   nevertheless  the trade deficit is expect to widen further this year and next  reflect the extent to which import alreadi exceed export   accord  the current account deficit is expect to move abov      billion in        dave and i will be happi to answer ani of your question

question for our colleagu   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to ask   a question about china   you mention that china   s growth had been    percent and you expect it to slow to     percent but not collaps  as you put it   there has been a lot of specul about the risk and potenti difficulti associ with a slow chines economi   i was wonder if you could talk about that a bit in this context   we all are familiar with the asian financi crisi of the late      s  and i was wonder what magnitud we would have to see in china in order to come close to what we saw in the late      s and what kind of spillov effect would stem from that
well  if china   s growth fell below  say    percent  i think we   d see fair signific spillov effect   seven percent use to be a sort of    target    rate of growth  then it becam   percent and then it was around    percent   but china grow at   percent would be a return to what we had seen for quit a few year in the     s  which would probabl allow for a better alloc of resourc than growth of    percent is like to be generat  the fact that china is not in fact a fulli market base economi is  i think  the bad news and the good news   the bad news part is that it probabl is lead to a misalloc of resourc and  therefor  to the risk of some over accumul of certain item   and the sudden redirect of effort becaus somebodi may well wake up eventu and realiz that the warehous are full of air condition  say  that aren   t move   on the other hand  it   s part good news becaus there are no phenomena like ceo risk avers or tendenc on the part of market to overshoot or the need for depreci or balanc sheet correct to work their way through befor compani make decis   if the author in china decid that too mani resourc are be use to produc air condition and what they realli want are snow blower  the desir realloc of resourc will happen pretti quick   so  to my mind  the risk in china is more that resourc are be wast   and given that standard of live in china and much of the world aren   t as high as we   d like them to be  that   s a veri signific and import cost   but i don   t think that involv the same system cyclic behavior yet that a truli market economi would have  that said  if the chines run into econom problem in term of their abil to meet the demand of the popul for rise standard of live and job   or if they fail to deal in an order way with the transit from a most rural to a more industri economi   i don   t know what the effect would be   if those effort hit a rough spot  i don   t know that i have ani special expertis to suggest what might polit happen in china or how that situat would resolv itself   i do think the spillov to the rest of asia would be veri sever   at least as bad as in the late     s
may i just add a comment   one differ to note between asia       and china now is that a major issu in the earlier situat was an outflow of capit  but china has a close capit account   so a capit outflow is someth that we   re just not go to see to the same degre in the current case   that   s one differ that may mitig the possibl of a sudden financi crisi similar to what occur in asia in the late      s
and in place such as korea and a few other countri  we   re not see the current account deficit and the need to attract capit  so if the capit were to stop flow  it  wouldn   t have exact the same consequ   on the other hand  outsid of china  domest demand is not realli the drive forc in asia  it is export demand   so in a macroeconom sens  the asian countri are vulner to develop in china and in the unit state
further question for   or     if not  who would like to start our committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the pickup in the seventh district economi has becom more broad base   moreov  our contact seem much less nervous than they were in march   mani report increas book  grow backlog  and low inventori  suggest that momentum will continu   household spend has been robust for some  e  and now we are hear widespread report of increas in busi spend   with regard to the latter  demand is strong for machin tool and for heavi equip such as agricultur and construct machineri  report from all of our ship contact have been strong  from truck to wareh to cardboard box   as for air travel  both unit and boe emphas that traffic is final abov septemb           level and that load factor are high   boe public announc increas in product schedul last week and told us privat that they hope to be abl to rais plan even further   a publish execut told us that advertis is pick up  so the magazin busi may final be emerg from what he describ as a    pageless    recoveri    laughter   increas in demand are show through to labor market   both of the nation temporari help firm we speak with have seen stronger growth in billabl hour in recent week   perman placement and forward look order have increas  and these firm also are start to get big order from larg compani   we   ve heard a lot of comment about rise price   first  more firm appear to be pass on input cost increas to their custom   airlin have now success ad fuel surcharg to their ticket price  someth they were unabl to do a month or two ago   tool and dye maker and heavi equip manufactur are ad surcharg to cover higher steel cost  and these price increas are stick   second  we   re hear that strong demand and low inventori are boost price power even outsid of steel   for exampl  one fiberboard contain manufactur told us that the industri   s inventori are at the lowest level sinc at least       allow him to rais price some   percent from a year earlier   third  in retail  one contact indic that his foreign supplier were no longer will to absorb the impact of the lower dollar and have begun to rais price   in mani case  howev  retail have been abl to offset those cost increas by rais their own price   in the auto industri  a strike featur is the high level of inventori   not all manufactur are uncomfort with these level  in part becaus some of the inventori will help cover plan product shutdown   the industri   s forecast for light vehicl sale for the year are run at or just below    million  similar to the  book project  turn to the nation outlook  the data on real econom activ sinc our last meet have been encourag   household spend and busi spend have been robust  and firm appear to have gain enough confid in the sustain of the expans to begin hire in earnest   so  although we   d like to see anoth month or two of strong number befor declar victori  we think we   ve turn the corner on employ growth   look ahead  spend and product seem to be evolv pretti much as anticip  even with the lower than expect number for first quarter gdp   so we   re still look for      growth to be well abov potenti  the latest read on inflat were surpris   we continu to believ that there   s a sizabl output gap and that some temporari factor are primarili respons for the recent number   but we can   t dismiss the possibl that the output gap is smaller than we   ve been think   we all know how difficult it is to quantifi precis the size of the output gap   the  book indic that the under inflat rate is somewhat higher than forecast at our last meet   we agre with that assess  and we believ that the risk on inflat have definit move at least into balanc   we all will be look at the data in come week to see if inflat is much more of a concern than we now believ   depend on the data  we may want to move quick and more aggress in tighten than the path laid out in the  book  where we start to rais rate in the fourth quarter of this year
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to depart a littl from my usual practic here and go direct to the nation economi and the overal forecast   frank  recent develop in our district don   t deviat much from what appear to be happen at the nation level  so i don   t think i would add a whole lot of valu this morn by go through specif about the region pictur  with respect to the nation economi  i don   t recal mani  e over the year   and certain not recent   when the incom statist data over an intermeet period have chang my view of the near term outlook and the balanc of risk quit as mark as in this most recent period   the flow of data that   review  from the releas of the march job report through the first quarter gdp report  final provid some fair compel evid that the economi may now be move toward a balanc growth path and reason full employ   the growth in aggreg demand seem to be broad base  and product growth has now slow to a point where further increas in demand will s ul addit job growth   moreov  the core  inflat data over the last few month suggest that the disinfl risk that has worri me and a lot of other peopl around the tabl recent may now be behind us  at the same  e  along the line of some of the cautionari remark you made     the employ gap and the output gap are still sizabl   unit labor cost are still behav reason well  so i   m not yet alarm about inflat pressur  especi sinc i think our credibl for low inflat is still high   so it look like a balanc and  at this point at least  still noninflationari expans may final be take root   but as we all know  in this polici busi when we begin to get comfort that thing look good  that   s when we have to be care   so i thought i would use my remain  e   build on some of the comment that have alreadi been made   to talk about how recent develop in the foreign sector  especi in china  could creat some risk for the u s  economi go forward   i should mention that my comment will reflect convers i   ve had with marvin goodfriend  who just return from an imf mission to the peopl bank of china  we   ve had some veri interest discuss  and i   d like to share some of our thought with you   it appear that the recent firm in core u s  inflat reflect import the end of deflat in durabl good price  when one disaggreg the data   and some of our staff member have done that   this revers in turn appear to be relat at least in part to the strong global demand for manufactur good  especi in china   china   s overal trade balanc has appar now move into deficit   clear  china   s boom is outstrip it capac to produc manufactur good  and the effect of that are now spill over to the economi of it trade partner  includ to some extent this one  i think   we see effect  for exampl  on textil produc   especi of industri fabric   in the  ina   i   m talk not onli about busi go to china but busi come from china to their compani   the problem  of cours  is that by all account the boom in china is unsustain   money and credit has been grow at an annual rate of around    percent for a coupl of year   that   s about twice as fast as product growth there  as i understand it  so it   s not surpris that the deflat of a coupl of year ago in china is now give way to inflat  which i think is current about   percent   i   m comfort by     s suggest that inflat in china may now begin to back down  but look back to their last boom  which i guess was in the mid     s  inflat reach about    percent in that period   the chines economi now is a lot larger than it was then and therefor has signific greater potenti to affect the u s  economi   moreov  invest is a much larger part of chines gdp than it is in the unit state   and invest  of cours  is the most cyclic activ gdp compon  unfortun  as i think we all know  china still   not have institut in place that can easili deal with this situat and  in particular  that can easili meet the monetari polici challeng they are alreadi face   they don   t have a strong independ central bank   they don   t have a healthi commerci bank system   they don   t have fulli flexibl interest rate   they don   t have a float exchang rate   the author basic have had to use control to deal with these kind of issu in the past  and they haven   t work veri well   with the economi now much larger and at least in the process of transit to a market economi  those control may be even less effect  so  while we may be get some slow in inflat in china at this point  the boom could continu for some  e and ul  creat a veri high rate of inflat there   on the other hand  the author could interven more rapid and aggress than they have in some past cycl and precipit an earli recess   we just don   t know yet   but it seem to me that the upsid risk in the situat is probabl the greater risk   bottom line  against this background it seem to me that the committe should make a special effort to determin as best we can the degre to which instabl in the chines macroeconomi could affect the u s  economi and potenti u s  monetari polici go forward  i   m sure   and her staff are alreadi work on this   but if the potenti effect is found to be larg either current or not too far down the road  i think the committe may well want to includ in it review of global develop an assess of stabil polici in china   at least from  e to  e  and if the situat look serious enough  perhap on a regular basi   i won   t be around to hear it  but i think it would be a good idea for the committe to do that   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman  the contact that i usual call have a general upbeat view on the state of the economi   my fedex contact emphas particular that his compani is review it capit expenditur plan  the fiscal year for fedex begin on june    and they are expect capit expenditur in fiscal       over       to be up about    to    percent  and all of that growth is for capac expans   he also emphas the import of the fuel situat  fedex is concern not onli about fuel price but fuel avail   they   ve been look close at whether they need to put in place some storag for jet fuel particular  but so far they don   t see ani signific avail issu   the firm   s contact with it custom suggest that the latter have a posit outlook and that inventori are go to be rebuilt   mani even expect some scrambl to meet demand given the lean inventori situat  my up contact gave me some data on air cargo from the air transport associ  domest air freight in the twelv month end februari      was up     percent  and air freight for the first two month of this year over the first two month of last year was up   percent   intern busi was up    percent februari over februari  and the expect is that the march data will be veri strong   my contact said that check traffic out of china into the unit state is grow at an except pace   up    percent in the first quarter of this year over the first quarter of last year   up is not plan to add to it capit expenditur plan at this point  the main point that i get from my contact at j b  hunt is that there   s a lot of upward pressur on price for truck shipment   hunt has been abl to increas truck ship rate for thirteen straight quarter  those rate are up    percent in the last three year and   percent over the last four quarter   driver suppli is extrem tight  even tighter than in the period prior to the recess  and the rate for driver are go up   at the begin of this year  driver    rate were increas from    cent to    cent per mile  my wal mart contact emphas that the march   april sale data are alway difficult to interpret becaus the date on which ea  fall vari from year to year   but cut through that ambigu  sale appear to be on a growth track of about   percent   he continu to believ that those at the lower end of the incom distribut are stress financi  as underscor by the paycheck cycl and other inform the compani look at  but he think those with higher incom are do quit well   wal mart has been grow about   percent per year in squar footag  and it new store have been do veri well  i want to make just a brief comment regard the nation economi and the inflat outlook   i ask one of my staff member to make a differ kind of calcul than we normal do base on the pce data   usual the core inflat measur exclud chang in energi and food price  but i want to look at the ex energi part becaus energi has been the dynam compon in term of what has been go on recent  what i ask my staff member to do was to take total pce and substitut long term energi futur   crude oil futur price   for current energi price  and run that calcul   it seem to me that pce ex energi   or more precis ex the energi curv   might be a use way to look at the inflat data   that calcul result in an inflat rate that is about   percentag point higher at an annual rate  averag over the last four quarter  so i think inflat was not realli as low last year as we thought it was becaus  by concentr on the core inflat measur and take energi out all togeth  we were not pick up the fact that long term energi futur had gone up quit a bit  in my view  the inflat risk are skew to the upsid at this point   i interpret the staff forecast  which i think is fine as a point es   as a median or mode of the probabl distribut   and it seem to me that the probabl of  say  a    percentag point inflat miss on the upsid is higher than the probabl of a compar miss on the downsid  i   d say the same for a   percentag point inflat miss   i note that money growth is rise again after fall in the second half of last year   a coupl of peopl  includ the staff  have made comment about inflat and the gap along the line that the gap may not be as larg or the natur rate of unemploy as low as we might have thought   a way perhap of es  the natur rate is to look at what happen to inflat   but that   s not realli help in term of tri to understand where the inflat rate is go becaus the essenc of this problem is to tri to predict the inflat rate   the gap may be input to that  but it   s not go to be construct to turn this equat the other way around   that   s not go to help us to understand inflat   so i just want to offer that comment   it   seem to me that the inflat risk are rise   certain there is a lot of commentari in the marketplac to that effect   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  at breakfast this morn  i was challeng to tri to describ the current economi in a haiku   by coincid  that   s the way the brief for this  meet start out in dalla a few day ago   and the haiku is     the stori today is about return growth and rise price      and i do think that fit pretti much both the district economi and the nation economi   sinc texa unemploy turn the corner last septemb  job growth has been moder and steadi   there has been a notabl improv along the border  help along by recoveri in mexican maquiladora  and border employ rate are back down to pre recess level   retail sale growth for the border area has fulli recov as well  high energi price may be a negat to the countri as a whole  but they remain a plus for texa   a smaller plus than they onc were  to be sure  but a plus nevertheless   as the chairman discuss in a recent speech  natur gas price have been elev and are expect to remain so for an extend period   in respons  we   ve seen a gradual expans of drill activ in the district over the past two year   the petrochem industri  which has seen hard  e for quit a while becaus of high energi input price and weak demand  is get some relief now  that industri is benefit from strong demand from china and southern asia  leav the district in a pretti strong posit for a chang  the high tech sector has been a notabl laggard but  after over three year of uninterrupt month to month job loss  in march we saw a return of net employ gain in high tech manufactur   the brighter job pictur reflect rise order and product   contact in the semiconductor industri expect top line sale to grow    percent this year  bring sale back to pre recess level   gain are spread across consum sector  communic  and comput sale   equip manufactur are experienc sale growth  too  and see sign that the corpor upgrad cycl is shift into higher gear  on the inflat front  cost pressur are now evid across the board  and more and more produc are pass on higher cost to their consum   competit from oversea has slacken  becaus of the lower dollar and rise demand in china   build materi  fabric metal  petrochem  and oil field equip have all seen price increas at the consum end  increas order for packag from retail have driven paper price higher   steel and galvan metal are in short suppli  and railroad are oper at or near capac   there   s a major road project in dalla that was a year ahead of schedul  but it has been held up now for sever month becaus of the inabl to get a certain kind of steel   among the hand of industri that have not enjoy increas price power are airlin and homebuild   in the labor market  we still have a larg pool of unskil worker seek employ  and there   s veri littl upward pressur on wage   howev  rapid health care cost increas have discourag firm from hire new perman full  e employe  on the nation economi  the latest cpi  pce  and gdp statist suggest that the price pressur that eleventh district contact had been report earlier this year have becom fair widespread   i   m hope that the uptick in inflat is a one  e adjust that mark the end of disinfl rather than the begin of ani signific upward threat   nevertheless  i think we need to be wari becaus the recent inflat rise cannot easili be dismiss as be due to special factor   core and median inflat measur are higher  too   and we need to be wari becaus es  of capac util and the output gap are subject to larg after the fact revis   the same is true of our measur of profit margin   while recent data suggest a strong invers relationship between profit margin and inflat pressur  the markup of price over unit labor cost has littl or no predict power for inflat in real  e  and final  we need to be wari becaus of the veri larg amount of polici accommod current in place   signific  the latest senior loan offic opinion survey show a big swing toward easier c i lend standard and term over the past two  quarter   the net percentag of bank report increas c i loan demand is strong posit and rise  too   the balanc of risk has clear shift  and in my view it   s  e we clear the deck by remov languag from our press releas that might delay action should action becom appropri
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   thing continu to improv in new england  in particular  comment from manufactur were more upbeat than we   ve seen in a long  e  though busi confid in massachusett is slight off previous high  recent survey indic particular posit assess of nation busi condit   consum confid is well abov it level a year ago   a bit bounci but well abov   retail contact report improv sale  and residenti real estat market remain strong  you may have notic that i have not ad the caveat about job growth that has becom standard in discuss of the recoveri in new england   labor market have in fact improv    not wild  to be sure  but they are begin to look up   this mark a real chang even from our last meet   data for the region indic that nonfarm employ rose in march  onli the fifth month increas in the last three year   the increas was small and the year over year trend remain negat  but anecdot suggest that it   s not a fluke   similar  the unemploy rate for the region move down slight and now is below   percent   beig book contact are more like to say that they   re hire  particular in manufactur and relat servic   one of the bank   s tenant  a larg intellectu properti law firm  report a jump in patent work in the biotech and comput servic area as well as an increas in legal work relat to patent litig   they   ve taken more space in our build and are ad to staff   small busi report increas activ even in firm associ with commerci real estat   and after the extrem cold winter  contact  in tourism and hospit report expand busi and some new hire   thus  econom activ clear seem to be on the uptick  price are on the uptick as well   almost all beig book contact report concern about rise cost for metal  wood  plastic  rubber  fuel and other petroleum product as well as rise health care and other insur cost   concern about price power remain  but some firm do seem to believ that cost increas can be pass on   plan salari increas are moder  at   percent or so  and capit spend is increas but also at a moder pace  one thing i found realli surpris   and i read through all the note from our call with individu contact   was the number of  e that the upcom presidenti elect was mention as a concern regard the econom futur   a lot of peopl out there seem to believ that the economi is be pump up to be prime for octob but then will slide after the elect  i   m sure that   s not the intent of ani of us  but i think it probabl   reflect some concern relat to the sustain of the recoveri  in that regard the nation data receiv sinc our last meet have been particular encourag   while one month   s report on employ is not a complet panacea to the labor market soft  the number are clear move in the right direct   to be sure unemploy insur claim are move sideway  and hour work still have a way to go  but all the survey that dave talk about in his present suggest that firm expect to pick up their hire rate  combin this with rise person incom and expenditur  rise retail sale  a strong hous market  and solid consum confid  and continu strength in consumpt seem assur  at least over the near to medium term   busi strength is evid as well   strong profit growth and reason accommod financi market have led to rise capit good order and doubl digit growth in invest spend   despit the increas valu of the dollar  trade seem to have  been onli a small drag on econom activ in the first quarter  reflect stronger growth in mani countri around the world    all of this good news answer the question about how sustain the recoveri will be  especi after the dose of fiscal s ulus dure the first half of this year wear off   in that regard  our forecast in boston is a bit less op ist than the  book   s for the second half of        but the basic trajectori of the data   solid growth  stronger labor market  a slowli declin output gap  and flatten price increas   is the same   our bet as well as the  book   s is that the economi will generat enough steam on it own to realiz  after what has happen over the past three year  a veri favor trend  so if we think the recoveri is sustain  the next question is what the stanc of polici should be   i realiz that there are a coupl of way to look at this question   look at employ and inflat trend against what might be accomplish in this high perform economi  the  book  boston  and other analyst see an output gap that last into        that suggest that caution is warrant befor move rate up  though i agre with a lot of the comment around the tabl that we have to be realli humbl about our abil to know either the size of the current output gap or how fast it might close  given the strength that we see go into the rest of this year  there is anoth gap as well  the gap between a fund rate at   percent and even our lowest guess of a neutral fund rate   i think that gap is someth like     basi point   again  it   s hard to know how to measur    neutral     and we have to be humbl about our abil to do that   but even with a great deal of humil we know we   re pretti far away from neutral now   market risk take in an environ of veri accommod polici  combin with what like is a bottom out   or probabl a turn up at least in the near term   of the path for inflat  seem to me to argu that we ought to start close the interest rate gap fair soon   we might need an addit coupl  of data point to be sure the recoveri is sustain  and we sure need to take a look at the languag in our press statement this  e around   but my view is that we ought to be think about move sooner rather than later
thank you  mr  chairman   continu a pattern that was alreadi evid at the  e of our last meet  econom develop in our southeast region are upbeat   there   s evid from sever front that i would point to that demonstr the grow breadth of our region expans   florida is the strongest state in our area by most measur  and a substanti share of that strength is come from tourism   occup rate are continu to rise  and a grow number of foreign tourist are come to the unit state   convent book in atlanta are now up    percent over last year  and busi travel report has increas further  our manufactur sector is experienc a pickup as well  and that is reflect in new order and product   more good are be move and that   s show up in increas demand for truck  rail  and air shipment   some of this improv in manufactur can be trace to stronger export activ   and while nonresidenti construct has yet to show ani measur pickup in most of our market  activ in the import residenti construct sector continu to be vigor   certain there are sector that still have more repair work to do   in our area  those includ a major airlin and telecommun firm   in some case  the slow recoveri is now not so much a matter of econom climat but rather the need for new busi model   of cours  we have some firm and some communiti high depend on industri like apparel and textil that are still hurt from the structur adjust take place in their busi  anoth posit develop sinc our last meet is that our banker are now report signific improv in c i lend  mirror report that al broaddus  mark olson  and  other made last  e   perhap an e mail i receiv from ms  paula lovel  the recent past chairman of our board of director  captur the kind of upbeat report that have now becom preval  paula run her own public relat firm in nashvill  and she wrote me a note last week  which she describ as    unsolicit    becaus  her have serv ten year on our board  her view on the busi outlook had inde been solicit   at ani rate  she said     jack  hope you and the fed crowd are do well   i know this is unsolicit  but the flood gate have open here with our busi   i had at least twenti compani call dure the first quarter of      to hire us or to call an urgent meet to   get start      everywher i look there   s money flow   i think thing are realli strong     like other  we   re continu to get anecdot report of rise price and comment that more of the increas in commod import price are be pass through to intermedi and final good   exampl includ steel  energi  food  chemic  plastic  metal  wood build materi  fertil  tire  ice cream  and agricultur product like soy  coffe  and meat   while not an atlanta region tidbit  the cab driver who brought me from the airport to the hotel here in washington last night proud announc that  effect ye day  there was a    percent increas in fare for cab come into the district   and he was complain becaus his colleagu in a coupl of other citi had gotten    to    percent increas for similar trip   the reason be given for the now more widespread price increas vari but includ low inventori  lack of capac  increas demand  higher opec price  and regul  on the nation front  i think we have to be pleas with the way thing are unfold  while the initi gdp number for the first quarter were a bit below mani es   they continu a pattern of three quarter of strong growth that is arguabl abov long term trend   and i   m comfort with consensus forecast that have robust growth continu through this year and next   perhap most encourag is the better balanc we   re see across sector  with busi spend now make a nice contribut to growth and expect to continu to do so   while there is still consider uncertainti as to the futur path of employ growth  the most recent data and anecdot report are encourag there as well  it   s my sens that we   re now at a point where we need to spend more  e tri to understand price pressur and price prospect and their implic for polici   while we certain do not yet have ani alarm run up in inflat  i do not think we should dismiss the signal we may be get from both the data and anecdot report   reli heavili on an output gap model make me uncomfort  most becaus the gap is not a direct observ measur and becaus  as other have alreadi discuss this morn  forecast es  of the current gap are veri differ depend on whether one accept the board staff   s judgment es   the frb us model es   cbo   s es   or some other es    i   m also less comfort than some about inflat expect be well anchor   i think recent data and survey can be interpret as say that we have alreadi had some deterior  i believ we   re at a point where we can begin to take back some of the extraordinari polici accommod that   s in place without great risk of serious unintend consequ   we can talk about this more in the polici go around  but if we believ that a further unwant fall in inflat is no longer a signific risk   a view that sever have public express recent   and that risk was the reason we gave for our last    basi point of eas  then a credibl case can be made at this meet or at least at the next one for remov that accommod as a first step   i also hope that we will talk care about ani new languag we introduc into the statement as we come closer to the  e when we can contempl a polici shift   in our earlier discuss i think mani of us express uneasi about make pre commit as to the  e or the path of polici  chang   those kind of commit could eventu mislead market or tie our own hand   it   s nice to have come to a point where we can have these kind of discuss   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district continu to increas  although there   s still littl evid of job growth   in addit  the philadelphia staff   s lead index of econom activ

spring   auto dealer in our region report rise sale in march compar with februari  but the level have not match those of a year ago  they expect sale to remain at about the current pace for the rest of the year  acknowledg that it will be difficult to achiev the high level of the past sever year  residenti construct activ remain high  although it has eas in recent month  permit in the tri state

march  the index has been in posit territori for the last eleven month   the more forward look index on new order and shipment improv in april and are at level we haven   t seen sinc the earli     s   there was also a notic increas in the inventori index in april  as it move to it highest read in sixteen month   the employ index from our manufactur survey improv again in april and has been in posit territori for seven month   more compani in our region indic that they intend to increas hire  and help want ad are up   still  the bls data show that manufactur employ in our three state continu to declin in the first quarter and total payrol employ was flat   in fact  job growth in our region has been essenti flat sinc the second quarter of last year  we   ve been receiv report from some of our director about the difficulti of find skill labor   we continu to explor the labor suppli issu in a special question in our april bos   as i report last  e  our march survey show that  of the three quarter of respond firm that had open  two third of them had difficulti fill posit main becaus of a lack of qualifi applic   our april survey indic that a major of firm are have troubl find applic skill in the use of product machin or with special plant and system oper skill   more disturb is the fact that a larg number      percent to be exact   also said  that applic lack the basic    three rs    of read  write  and arithmet   for the most part  this cannot be attribut to foreign applic with poor english skill  as onli    percent of the respond cite the languag issu as a problem   over half of our firm report that the gap between requir skill and avail skill had widen in the last five year   most of the current weak in our labor market is like cyclic   firm have been extract as much as they can from current employe  which is typic at this point in the expans   still  our survey result suggest that at least some of the weak may be structur in natur   the implic is that it might take longer for displac worker to becom re employ  which mean that we may be overst the degre of slack in the labor market   these theme  as you can tell  are be repeat around the tabl  although employ has remain subdu  wage in the philadelphia region appear to be increas at a slight fa  rate than in the nation   the same is true for good price   industri price pressur have increas in recent month  and there is some evid that firm are begin to pass on some of the higher cost to their custom  anoth theme that came up around this tabl  the price receiv index in our survey is at near a nine year high   a distributor of offic furnitur in our district report that manufactur are pass on some of the increas in steel price to their custom   our survey index of futur price paid  which reflect manufactur    expect of price they will have to pay for input in six month  has increas over the past year   i don   t want to make too much of this or overst the case   by the same token  we   re hear a lot of this type of news around the tabl today as well as in our district   it bear watch  to be sure   have said all that  dure april i typic travel around the district  hold a seri of meet with banker and busi leader  most report see sign of improv  and they are quit op ist   turn to the nation  in my view econom condit have improv sinc our last meet  and i believ the recoveri may have reach the point of be self sustain   activ continu to expand at a good pace  even though first quarter gdp came in a bit lower than expect   note though  as has alreadi been mention  that the weaker than expect inventori growth is to a larg extent respons for that shortfal   consum spend continu to expand at a moder pace  and consum balanc sheet remain healthi  hous price appreci has been strong  and it appear to have been fuel not onli by low interest rate but also by a more sustain upward shift in the demand for hous   moreov  rough    percent of outstand mortgag are at fix rate  and most arm are hybrid with some rate protect   but other type of consum lend tend to be at more variabl rate than mortgag  suggest that household may be fulli extend and somewhat more vulner to rate increas   this potenti negat effect will be mute so long as labor market condit continu to improv  when we last met i said that the miss piec was employ growth but that  given the pace of gdp growth  i expect to see employ begin to pick up modest   the most recent inform on the labor market was welcom news   the latest evid show that the recoveri continu to move more toward a structur balanc  which put it on a more sustain foot   i see the risk to econom growth as be balanc   at the same  e  we   re get an inkl of renew but still modest price power on the part of mani busi  with various measur of inflat firm  given the current state of the economi and the outlook  i believ we are get close to the  e when we will need to adjust polici  bear in mind that we   re not consid when to start a tighten regim but rather when to start eas up on the s ulus   recent speech by the  chairman and other member of the fomc have begun to set the stage  as other have indic   i think we should take advantag of this   today   s goal should be to increas our flexibl regard futur action so that we can begin take back some accommod whenev condit warrant without surpris the market   if we determin that we need to chang rate sooner rather than later  i do not want us to feel constrain by our polici statement  to this end  i think we should acknowledg that there has been some improv in the labor market   i think we need to chang our risk assess regard inflat   at least to my mind  the risk of an increas in inflat is at least as larg as a risk of a decreas in inflat   it   s also  e to remov our statement about    patienc      we ad that when we need an unusu procedur for unusu  e   keep it in the statement now or replac it with someth els that constitut an intertempor commit would reduc our flexibl go forward   and frank  i don   t think we know the speed at which we will have to respond   that will depend on the inform we receiv on econom condit and on our assess of the outlook

thank you  mr  chairman   i   m pleas to note that i can summar my comment by say that i agre with al broaddus   and i   m sorri that i won   t have the opportun to say that again at these meet  al   i agre with him with regard to both the nation economi and the brittl of the china situat   i think the likelihood of the chines author succeed in slow down their boom in a smooth way is less than         we   re go to need to monitor that situat   mani of us  myself includ  have been say that the  e of polici tighten will depend import on the evolut of the output gap  especi as reflect in labor market  and of inflat prospect   i will review where i think we are with regard to each of these and my sens of the implic for polici  on the output gap  accumul inform on labor market  especi the march employ report  has made it more like that the strengthen we all expect is final come to pass and that slack is be taken up   in effect  the data have reduc one downsid risk   name  that product would remain so strong that even the forecast robust demand would be insuffici to absorb the substanti margin of excess labor and other resourc   product growth   look as if it has slow in the fourth and first quarter to an averag of mere   percent  from the   to   percent rang of the previous coupl of year   but i think we still need to be somewhat cautious in extrapol these data  on payrol  let me make just a coupl of remark   we basic have one month of data in which growth has been more than margin abov the number need just to tread water in labor market   and for the first quarter as a whole  the evid suggest that the output gap did shrink  but not by much   capac util in manufactur rose   the unemploy rate fell     percentag point on a quarter averag basi  but part of that declin was account for by anoth fall in particip rate  and the unemploy rate itself in march was abov it first quarter averag   with actual growth exceed es  potenti by a few tenth at an annual rate  the staff   s output gap measur fell onli     percentag point in the quarter  to   percent  the staff has potenti growth this year and next at around     percent  in which case we   ll need to see demand growth well north of   percent to make ani real progress on absorb slack   in fact  growth of around   percent is the rate project in the  book  at least for the remaind of this year  and strong growth in come quarter seem reason to me   grow busi confid and continu household willing to spend appear more than suffici to overcom ani drag from higher energi price  greater geopolit risk  and a potenti sharp slowdown in china   still  we haven   t seen growth appreci abov   percent in this expans  except in the third quarter of last year  when spend was boost by child credit check and the cash from the surg in mortgag refinanc   and product still could surpris us on the upsid  as it has so often befor   in sum  i agre that the economi appear final to be on a path toward full employ  but some of the evid is tentat and preliminari   the trajectori so far has been veri gentl   and even if we realiz the more robust growth project relat to product  slack is like to erod gradual over come quarter   on inflat  the incom data on price and compens certain have laid to rest my linger concern that inflat would continu to fall   the question is whether we are see a more persist strengthen of inflat pressur  which would be reflect in rise inflat itself if we don   t act quick and forc   on balanc  i don   t think so   i see a number of reason to believ that inflat will remain low and stabl  albeit at a higher level than i thought a few month ago  first  some part of the recent uptick in core inflat is plausibl attribut to the pass through of a seri of one off price increas   in effect  advers suppli shock in energi  commod price  and import price   mani commod have come off the boil of late  as   point out  petroleum price have level out  and the dollar has strengthen   suggest that these influenc are not like to be repeat  at least on their recent scale  second  slack  continu product increas  and the current elev level of profit margin should work to contain ani tendenc for inflat to rise   depend on the measur one use  core consum inflat fell between     and     percentag point from      to        even allow for some understat of inflat last year owe to special factor  this degre of deceler of price is evid that consider slack has exist in labor and product market  unlik presid pool  i do think we can invert the equat and infer what the slack was by look at what happen to inflat   with resourc util current around or onli a littl abov the level that prevail dure much of this period  the odd seem high to me that substanti effect excess capit and labor capac persist and will exert competit pressur on price increas  in addit  even with it recent slowdown  product growth remain elev  which will help to contain increas in unit labor cost   the staff see trend unit labor cost about in line  with price increas this year and next  but even if unit labor cost  actual or trend  increas signific more rapid than anticip  inflat need not rise given the elev level of price markup   as dave note  markup at the end of      were at level compar to the veri high level prevail today   in             and       unit labor cost rose substanti fa  than price without exert much upward pressur on rate of inflat  final  long term inflat expect do appear to be stabl to me  judg from the longer end of the tip deriv yield curv as well the michigan and philadelphia survey   under prevail circumst  i have troubl write down the model that put inflat on a rise trend  but i have to admit i am less certain of this than i was a few month ago   recogn that there is much about the inflat process that we don   t understand  we will need to monitor incom data on inflat and inflat expect care  as for polici implic  intermeet inform has made a   percent fund rate less comfort than it was at the last meet   inflat is higher   less close to an unaccept low level and less like to fall   chang the risk manag calculus   higher inflat and the rise in short term inflat expect do impli a lower short term real interest rate at a  e when demand alreadi seem to be quit strong   although long term real interest rate have risen in a stabil respons to incom inform  that increas is base on market expect that we will tighten begin this summer  given my forecast that we are not at the earli stage of rise inflat even at these fund rate level  i still believ we should await confirm that the output gap realli is on a trajectori toward close befor we tighten   that said  with inflat higher  risk shift  and labor market begin to firm  we clear are closer to tighten than we were befor if that confirm come in over the next few month   so i agre with my colleagu that we need the ad  flexibl in our statement   but also  given my expect that slack will diminish slowli while inflat remain low  the path of tighten consist with meet our object is like to be gradual   more gradual than in mani past polici firm episod   i think it will be import that one way or anoth market come to understand this as we prepar to tighten   after onli one month of strong employ growth  i would be concern that  if market build in a rapid and sizabl increas in rate  the result substanti tighten of financi condit could slow the expans unnecessarili   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   much of what i plan to say is go to sound familiar by now   i will start by observ that the trend that have been appar in the ninth district for some  e have acceler and we have a rapid expans ongo   recent we   ve had meet with our advisori council on small busi and labor as well as with leader of a varieti of twin citi    financi servic firm and our board of director  and almost all of the anecdot have been distinct posit   let me run through some of those quick  the manufactur sector is expand substanti   employ is grow in that area  export are up  invest in equip and softwar is grow  and firm in general are see top line growth and are quit pleas with that  needless to say   labor is general avail in the district  but hire has pick up  and there is some discuss of the skill mismatch issu that dave   and other allud to   hous remain quit strong  and a number of larg project have been start recent  so at least on the construct side  peopl are still op ist  construct of offic space remain weak  but absorpt has begun to pick up  and if that continu  it will probabl lead to some renew activ in that arena   consum spend has been and continu to be strong   the realli signific chang is the one that other have alreadi identifi  and that   s on the price side   the anecdot are almost univers along the line that compani are find the abil to rais price now and that those price increas are stick   it   s happen across a wide rang of good and servic  and i think that has done someth posit for busi attitud and confid   but it is quit widespread  and i must say it give me a bit of paus  as far as the nation economi is concern  i have onli two or three comment   first of all  from my perspect the situat and the outlook that we   re confront haven   t chang veri much   i   ve thought for a long  e that the outlook is posit  and the recent data have serv to confirm that   as dave said  the economi   appear to be fire on virtual all cylind now  on the inflat side  i   m not predict a signific acceler of inflat from here  but base on the data and the anecdot inform  there   s clear more action on that front than i would have expect as recent as two or three month ago   someth is go on   it may turn out not to persist  but i do think the likelihood of further declin in inflat   or even a level off at the recent pace   has probabl diminish   and final  i can   t resist the temptat to add that i question the valu of tri to go from the output gap  howev measur  to result inflat   i just don   t think it is in the data

thank you  mr  chairman   busi condit continu to improv in the fourth district   the pace of improv appear to have acceler in recent week  and the improv is rather broad base across industri sector   i   d like to make four general observ about busi condit in the fourth district   first  busi appear to be acceler their capit spend plan for this year and next   second  they continu to identifi opportun to increas product   third  firm remain veri disciplin about their hire plan  and fourth  the broad base run up in raw materi price that we   ve been see  combin with healthi order book  appear to be afford some compani the opportun not onli to pass along these price increas but also to final get some addit price leverag   i want to expand a bit on these four general observ with a littl more detail inform from a few compani that i follow close  one compani produc custom rubber part that are use in a larg number of product in a varieti of industri   less than six month ago  the ceo of this compani was veri concern about his busi   his order book was spotti  and his custom kept pressur him for price reduct   he was worri about lose busi to asian produc   in fact  he was so worri that he final found an asian supplier himself rather than produc onli from his domest facil   today  his order book is full  he has a backlog  and he has been abl to pass along raw materi price increas and expand his margin a bit on top of that   the domest toolmak that he buy from sudden have huge backlog as well   he is invest in new and sophist manufactur equip to continu to improv his product and is cautious ad to his workforc   a second compani that i follow stamp and fabric sheet metal  the ceo of this compani report that his order have pick up sharpli in the past month and that he  too  is buy new capit equip   he is go to establish an oper in china to suppli his u s  custom who are produc there for the asian market   a move that he said is actual strengthen his relationship with custom in domest market as well   this compani also is now abl to pass along price increas due to the increas cost of steel and is abl to widen it profit margin in the process   final  in the cours of our beig book call  a number of specialti retail and depart store contact indic that they were  for the first  e  have some success with scale back the price discount that they   ve been give  i believ these compani and their stori repres a grow number of firm in my district and they reflect the strengthen in busi condit that is take place   i have littl doubt that the busi cycl is swing decis into a new phase   i expect that  as this new phase take hold  we will see mani more market  includ labor market  firm up becaus of the increas in demand   a natur element of this busi cycl process should also includ  in due cours  a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest  i see an appar inconsist between es  of resourc slack and stori of reviv price power and the higher than expect inflat report   among the peopl that i talk with in the district and in some of the financi press  stori about the return of price power have replac stori about the jobless recoveri   i believ that the risk on inflat are balanc   as  presid   note earlier  inflat expect are relat stabl part becaus of our credibl   so indic that we will begin to unwind our polici accommod will be necessari to anchor inflat expect   and if the data continu to indic strong econom perform and inflat that is higher than expect  i would like us to have the flexibl to react appropri   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet  i express some wari about reli too much on anecdot for assess the econom situat  particular the inflat situat   well  as somebodi onc said  the plural of anecdot is data   the data sinc the last meet do suggest that inflat has stabil and that the recoveri is begin to take hold   i concur  therefor  that this committe should begin prepar the ground for a normal of the feder fund rate   base on current inform  howev  my sens is that this normal can proceed at a deliber pace for three reason  first  it   s a mistak to equat the stanc of monetari polici with the level of the current feder fund rate  as some seem to do   in part becaus of our communic strategi  which has link futur rate chang to the level of inflat and resourc util  monetari and financi condit relev to the economi have tighten consider sinc our last meet   for exampl  sinc the day befor the march fomc meet  both the ten year treasuri rate and the high grade corpor bond rate have risen about    basi point  and the thirti year fix rate mortgag has risen about    basi point   judg by the small increas in the tip spread  these increas are larg real increas   in addit  the dollar has appreci about   percent sinc march and more than   percent sinc the begin of the year   commod price appear to be deceler   stock price have been flat despit strong earn news   in short  monetari  condit broad constru have alreadi begun the process of normal  and the impetus be appli to the economi has been correspond reduc   of cours  absent major new develop  we need to follow through with the tighten the market now expect  but we should not be over worri about have fallen behind the curv   the monetari tighten process has begun without us  so to speak  and it will continu to evolv endogen with incom news  a second reason to plan to be deliber in our tighten is that downsid as well as upsid risk to the economi do remain  in my view   we have seen onli one month of strong job number  and although an unwelcom disinfl now appear quit unlik  the labor market remain in an earli stage of recoveri  with essenti no increas in the employ to popul ratio over the past three quarter despit robust output growth   with product growth still strong  a high rate of output growth as well as a convict on the part of employ that rapid growth will be sustain is need to support new job creation   from a risk manag perspect  as we begin to rais rate we should weigh the risk of signific imped the labor market recoveri against the risk of have to scrambl to adjust to unexpect advers inflat develop  third  it is true that recent inflat has been abov the desir level   i hear what peopl are say around the tabl  absolut  i hear the concern be express   the question befor us is whether the situat involv a one  e adjust or whether the pattern will persist   the data notwithstand  the case for believ that core inflat will remain comfort in the   to   percent rang over the next year still seem strong to me   the argument for forecast stabl inflat go well beyond the level of the output gap  which i recogn is imposs to measur with precis   besid labor market slack  the argument for stabl inflat also includ the impact of continu product growth on unit labor cost  the unusu high level of price   cost  markup  the intens of domest   intern competit  the like deceler of commod price  and the recent endogen tighten of monetari and financi condit  which i   ve alreadi note  perhap the princip area of risk on the inflat front is the possibl that inflat expect may ratchet upward   given our struggl to improv communic and in honor of al broaddus   s last meet  i cannot resist the temptat to point out how help a quantit medium term inflat object would be at this junctur    laughter   clarifi our inflat object would increas the coher of our policymak   it would also help to anchor privat sector expect of inflat and perhap reduc the signific inflat risk premium now embed in long term interest rate   most import  if we provid quantit guidanc about our inflat object  we would now be abl to make a firm  high visibl  and ul  verifi commit to maintain price stabil at this crucial moment in the expans  final  return to realiti   laughter  i endors the bluebook   s propos to replac    patienc    with the phrase    can like be remov at a measur pace      the propos new phrase impli no commit whatsoev on our part   the word    like    clear convey that the new word is intend to be a probabilist forecast of the evolut of polici condit on the current avail inform   no further chang in languag would be necessari befor tighten   or even after the tighten process begin   in particular  with this word we can certain rais the fund rate in june if the incom data so dictat   the major benefit of this languag is that it will calm fear that the fed is current plan to repeat the         pattern of pre emptiv strike   in communic that that is not our present intent  the new word will serv the veri use function of reduc the chanc of an overreact in the bond market that would damag both the market and the economi   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   just after our last meet  greg ip wrote a column describ three altern strategi for the fed to follow in get rate back to normal  we could be earli and gradualist  wait and make sure  or follow what he call the late and leisur strategi in which we would actual aim for a rise in inflat  take them in revers order  i   m not impress by the late and leisur strategi   i did give a speech six month ago that argu for a target band for the core pce of   to     percent   while i argu for a band and not a point target  one could infer that my desir target would be about     percent   rough what inflat has been over the past decad and slight abov what it is forecast to be now   from that  one might infer that i   d have some sympathi for the late and leisur strategi  but i realli don   t   permit inflat to rise some befor we extinguish it remind me too much of a control burn in the forest fire busi  there are mani anecdot of control burn get out of control   in a fine tune sens  inflat might be forecast to be slight below where we desir to see it in the long run  but i would be veri reluct to base polici on a control rise in inflat becaus i don   t think we could control the rise  the second strategi   wait until we are sure that the expans is on track and that there is a risk of higher inflat befor chang polici   strike me as riski as well   in the forecast game  we will never be that sure of anyth  if for no other reason than that the data get revis so much after the fact   wait until we think we are sure strike me as an invit to wait too long  in the case at hand  output has been grow at healthi rate for near a year now   the expans seem to be quit balanc and stabl  and it is easi to envis output gap gradual close   i   m alreadi pretti sure that there is at least a risk of higher inflat   exact how much of a risk is not clear   the  book argu persuas that much of the recent uptick in inflat is just that   an  uptick   even the scenario label    higher inflat    has inflat bump up and then stabil  one can worri about pass through effect  but there is an argument that commod price are stabil  that the dollar has stop drop  and that energi price will declin  it   s hard to question these argument on logic ground though one can have fear   first off  the wide uncertainti rang in the  book chart indic that the staff is pretti uncertain about all of this   the commod price assumpt involv some guesswork about the chines economi  the dollar assumpt involv some guesswork about asian central bank behavior  and the oil assumpt involv some guesswork about polit instabl in the near east   i myself wouldn   t feel huge confid about ani of these guess  though i don   t question the main assumpt   further  we might dismiss the slight rise in inflat expect as reflect the bode of basic uninform consum who can   t distinguish price shock from continu inflat   we could question the slight rise in tip spread as attribut to technic problem in that market  henc  while none of these indic is a definit sign that inflat is on the rise  all of them togeth do give me paus   and i might say that the anecdot i   ve heard around the tabl today do as well  and in some way these anecdot may be more fine grain than some of the formal data we   re get   but to be honest  my biggest fear reflect a haunt similar with the      s and      s  when those in the econom profess were rather firm in insist that inflat would not heat up becaus output gap were larg   output gap turn out to be not as larg as we thought  and inflat got pretti high   given all these concern  the wait and make sure strategi strike me as anoth invit for us to get behind the curv  there are too mani uncertainti to be resolv and too mani haunt memori   have reject the first two strategi  it shouldn   t come as a huge shock that i favor gradual   as a theoret matter  gradual involv take smaller step but start earlier  the disadvantag is that policymak know a slight bit less when they start the tighten process  the advantag is that  other thing be equal  particular rate move are smaller and less disrupt  after each small step  we can make assess and either proceed or not proceed   if one want a medic analog  the doctor gradual remov the s ul when the patient appear to be reviv  monitor all the while   sinc this strategi reduc the chanc of fall behind the curv  in general i think it should be prefer   i haven   t been readi to start the tighten process until recent  but now i   m reassess   we know that the inflat process has a lot of momentum  that   seem to be the one thing we can take from all of these experi   and to me it make an enorm differ whether inflat is possibl point down  as i thought last year  or possibl point up  as i fear this year  i recogn what ben just said  but let me focus on the follow through part of the issu that he rais  which is how far monetari polici is out of equilibrium   accord to the bluebook  the forti year averag real fund rate has been     percent   ad     point for normal inflat and anoth small bit for the effect of product on real rate  we are at least     basi point away from equilibrium   that   s a lot of small chang  and those of us who are gradualist had better start think about chang fair soon   i recogn that we could do a lot with our rhetor and we could alway make larger chang later in the process  but that   s exact the cours i   m argu that we should tri to avoid if at all possibl   i also think it is  e to chang our rhetor   in the gradualist strategi  we can be veri patient in carri out our rate increas  but i hesit to use that word becaus i think it has becom a code for the polici strategi that i don   t favor   if i could  paraphras roger and hammerstein  i   d like to chang our rhetor so that we are in a posit in june to declar the  e of   percent rate all over and start bust out    laughter

thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to discuss two data point   one a survey of banker and the other an updat on fiscal polici   i survey a larg money center bank  a larg region bank  and a smaller midwe n region bank   i was surpris to find that they all were less op ist than both of our lender survey and less op ist than i had anticip base on what i was hear from other lender onli recent  start at the money center bank  a point that i probabl don   t need to repeat is that asset qualiti across the board is bulletproof   bank are in excel shape  and loan qualiti is in excel shape   the money center bank are report that  while ipo issuanc and bond issuanc are strong  suppli may exceed demand given that loan demand remain light   as a matter of fact  the focus this year has not been on the provis for loan loss  which is backward look  but on capit requir to support futur lend  take into consider loan demand  credit insur  credit default swap  and ani other hedg for other part of their portfolio   they are scale back the credit alloc that they had anticip need in the futur   also  in their equiti fund they are see an outflow in the high yield fund  indic what they believ is an emerg picki among the investor  which i think reflect to an extent the oversuppli  anoth comment my contact made was that in his judgment the aggreg portfolio risk was the lowest he had seen in sever month   he attribut that to the fact that there is still not a great deal of confid in the resurg economi   as a matter of fact  he said that  if we were to measur the differ in the approach to the economi of their economist and their trader  we would find that the economist are more op ist than the trader   although that gap is  narrow  as has been the case for some  e   but it   s a differ that we   ve seen befor between peopl whose view stem from look at the data and those who assess the outlook base on their feel of the activ in the marketplac  one point to be ad is that the bank are not see growth in loan activ by the larg corpor borrow  for all the reason we   ve talk about befor   the improv cash flow  which can increas the debt servic capabl  the intern financ of fix invest  and the restructur of the balanc sheet   but there   s go to be one veri larg borrow come to the market probabl in this quarter  and the credit will be fulli fund  which will make it appear as if there is actual signific loan growth   a lot of financ in technolog  such as equip purchas  is done by leas  which may or may not be reflect in bank lend activ  and there   s still a lot of activ in the commerci lend sector   but  on balanc  i was quit surpris that the tone i detect among my contact was not near as op ist as that in the lender    survey   nonetheless  their comment did reflect the data that we saw in the  book  especi the flow of fund data  which were consist with onli isol area of improv activ  fiscal polici is not a pretti pictur  but it   s consist with a presidenti elect year scenario   we are probabl not go to get ani appropri bill pass other than for defens  we   re not go to get a budget bill pass  and we   re almost certain go to be look at a lame duck session follow the elect this fall   the good news is that  with the absenc of a new appropri bill  spend will be limit to the appropri level from the previous bill  more troubl  howev  are the lack of a coher republican strategi in the major across the hous and the senat and the lack of a coher democrat strategi across the hous and the senat   so the debat on fiscal polici effect focus on whether or not the congress will produc a transport bill that  as you all know  is load with pork and whether or not  if it is  pass  the presid will veto it  a veto that almost certain will not be sustain   so the news is not good in either of the area i   ve examin  particular on the lender    side   if we   re look for support for an improv economi  it isn   t clear when one look at the number
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious  as has alreadi been talk about  sever piec of incom data put the question of rise inflationari pressur squar on the tabl befor us at this meet   we   ve heard anecdot inform from almost everyon who has spoken   the march cpi number obvious has been on the tabl   monday   s ism price paid index rose   point  to     which i think was the highest for that index sinc        so there are a number of piec of inform that give us reason to be activ discuss upward pressur on inflat at this meet  against that backdrop  i think there clear are two import question   one relat to where we are start   is the level of inflat that we   re start with as low as we origin thought   the second is  what is the outlook for inflat   the first question basic come down to whether we overes  the falloff in inflat over the last sever quarter   i think the staff here and at the atlanta fed   and mani other   would say that a number of transitori factor affect the inflat pictur in      and led us to believ that under inflat was lower than it actual was   that may well be true  but i think the basic contour of the pictur realli haven   t chang dramat   if one look at the varieti of measur of slack in the economi   at what happen to unit labor cost  measur product  unemploy  labor market inflat  et cetera   they all suggest that there was a signific amount of slack last year in the economi and that under inflat did  in fact  come off some   that is  we didn   t get the pictur total wrong  though we might have overes  the degre of the falloff in inflat somewhat   that is  obvious comfort becaus it   mean that we are start at a relat low level of inflat  we are not close to reach the kind of inflat that  under ani reason view  would be consid inconsist with price stabil  the second and more import question is whether the pickup in inflat that we   ve seen recent  as we   ve heard in this room from anecdot inform and other sourc  is such that it would like requir a relat rapid polici respons start in the veri near futur in order to maintain a rate of inflat that   s consist with price stabil   here i would come down  though somewhat uneasili  to the general view that the  book probabl has it about right   that inflat has clear stabil and may pick up somewhat but not to the point that we should fear fall behind the curv  let me first talk about the easi part of that assess   i think the march surpris in the cpi is like to be adjust somewhat in the forthcom data   all of us are well awar that some of what we saw in march reflect transitori effect on the upsid  offset some relat noisi data in compon such as apparel and lodg away from home   i   m not tri to underplay the march surpris  but i think we should be cautious about put too much weight on that sinc it may be adjust go forward   more fundament  though  the question is whether or not the outlook for inflat has deterior so much that we need to signal a dramat chang in our view   i would admit that that is a tough call   there are a number of differ model of inflat  but by and larg i come down again be general comfort with the rang of outlook describ in the  book  if one think about these various theori of inflat  one must say that some would perhap lead to some upsid concern  the issu of the pass through of commod price increas could again surpris us on the upsid   it is true that market expect commod price to come off a bit  as  the chairman and   were discuss earlier  but we have been surpris on that score   it is also histor true that the commod price pass through has not been an import part of inflat dynam   but again  one should be cautious  in my view  more worrisom than this issu about commod price   where by and larg i think the standard wisdom is like to hold   is the question of inflat expect and inflat dynam   some of us are concern that a consist seri of upsid surpris on inflat might start to becom embed in inflat behavior and inflationari expect  that is someth certain to be awar of   ned talk about mistak that this institut made in the      s and      s   i think mani of those mistak can be trace back to some misunderstand about the dynam of the economi but also to a willing of the committe at that point to buy into special stori to explain almost everi upsid surpris   so we should be veri care not to quick reject this whole negat scenario with respect to inflat and the inflat dynam that come from upsid surpris  while put some weight on those thing  my general view is that the greater probabl is that inflat will pick up onli relat slowli from this point   i would still say that i tend to focus more on the more tradit view of what drive inflat   i think there continu to be a great deal of evid of some slack in the u s  economi  though it may be less than we thought it was at the previous meet or the previous sever meet   labor market clear have not complet recov   it is true that we   ve had one good data report  but we have to be care in interpret that  we   ve had a few head fake in that regard in the past   i would say that the rate of hire still is show onli some earli sign of pick up   the eci seem relat well contain  but we probabl want to exclud some one  e effect   trend unit labor cost also  it seem to me  most  like will be increas at onli a gradual rate   final  i would say that the structur product stori is still in place  while obvious the cyclic compon of that will clear wane a bit  so  at this stage i come down   admit somewhat uneasili   agre with the general sens of the  book that inflat is like to pick up onli gradual go forward   this suggest to me that  when we get to the second round of our discuss today  there may be two or three idea that i would hope we could all agre on   one is a clear recognit that the risk obvious have becom balanc with respect to inflat and that we   d lose credibl if we weren   t readi to say that   but i don   t think that they necessarili have move to the upsid   second  i think we should continu the process of clear impedi to rais rate to more neutral level   we have move from    consider period    to    patienc      like governor bernank  i endors the propos new languag in the bluebook  and i   d suggest that we continu to move on that path   and third  i think it is veri import that we signal as we move forward that a moder pace of move rate back to neutral is most like   by definit  we   re go to be driven by the incom data   but given the rang of uncertainti we face now  i think it would be a mistak to lock ourselv into ani particular path of rate go forward  implicit or explicit  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i will take the opportun for the last  e  i guess  to say that i agre with presid broaddus   as i prepar for this meet  i too found that the chang sinc our last fomc meet were signific   as i look at the differ indic i track  i saw more chang than i had for quit a long  e   i want to talk about three aspect of the data that i end up focus on   inventori  employ  and the various inflat indic   let me start with inventori growth   i think we all were surpris about how littl inventori grew in the last few month  below even the  book es    if one look at the histor trend in both inventori   sale and inventori   consumpt ratio  what is remark is that the downward trend of these ratio that began in the      s has continu   except for a slight flatten in wholesal manufactur inventori dure the recess   in fact  even the  book forecast of inventori accumul this year  base on the recent chang in the gdp number  suggest a level of inventori in      that will be less than that held by compani in       despit doubl digit sale growth in the interven four year   so  what is happen with compani    inventori manag practic  recent i had an opportun to be with some financi offic of sever differ type of busi  and one of the thing i found was that the anecdot commentari was mix  particular among manufactur industri  there is still a lot of caution out there   these tend to be firm that had suffer a lot in industri where there is real pressur on profit   perhap like the compani presid pianalto talk about  they   ve been worri about build their book of sale and have been tri to get their inventori down even further   on the other hand  folk in the retail industri told me stori about how they continu to be on a path of substanti chang the way they integr inform system across their compani  go from the prospect book of their sale forc to order book and to inventori manag   while a lot has been accomplish in that regard  mani of these financi offic felt there were still signific way that they could continu to improv their manag of inventori   manufactur firm also are do this  but again they start more on the cautious side than the retail  who were talk more about improv their inventori manag process   in term of employ  i was glad to see that in march we had for the first  e some growth in payrol   i   m still a littl pessimist becaus it has been so long sinc we   ve seen real job growth   but it clear is one of the indic that i   m sure we all hope will be show sustain growth go forward   payrol incom has not move a lot in the last coupl of year  and i person am concern that  after the tax refund have play out this year and we see a slow in the pace of equiti extract from hous due to rise mortgag rate  we will need to have signific payrol growth in order to sustain a strong level of final consumpt  and final on the inflat number  it was amaz that after our march meet everi indic of inflat that came out sudden show a revers in the trend that we saw in        in       everi month   and even on a twelv month rollov measur   rate of inflat continu to fall   but that has realli chang  and the anecdot that mani of you mention at previous meet have come to bear   as i look at the various piec of the inflat pictur  i focus on the question that some of you have alreadi ask   is someth fundament happen  or is this attribut to unusu event   clear  we have issu with some commod where we   re see worldwid demand driven price chang   but overal what is amaz is that price on the good side general have stop their declin   a declin that obvious help to lower the overal inflat rate for the last coupl of year   and this is true for everyth from use car to apparel  it   s not just raw materi or commod price   the other side  though  is that the rate of inflat for servic   which had been relat high in the last coupl of year   has continu to come down   if one take out medic servic in particular  it is clear that the rate of inflat for other servic is continu to moder   and sinc servic are such a big part of our economi  if that trend continu i believ it will help to offset some of the lack of price declin on the good side as we go forward   put all that togeth  my posit is that i do believ that the inflat risk are final balanc   i would also echo the comment that were made earlier about chang our statement in order to allow us as much flexibl as possibl so we can respond to whatev the data show in the next coupl of month and can take the appropri step when need
thank you   i think we have cover everybodi   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that   low distribut to you dure the coffe break   market interest rate stage a remark runup over the intermeet period  spur on by data releas that surpris investor by their strength and by comment of the chairman dure congression tes oni   as shown in the top panel of your first exhibit  the fund rate expect to prevail one year ahead advanc    basi point   the red line in the middl left panel indic that market particip current believ that you are on a path to rais the fund rate   percentag point over the next two year   and that you   ll embark on that journey some  soon   inde  a full   point tighten is first price in by the august meet  and as shown by the bar at the right  signific weight is place on the fund rate be at least as high as    percent by octob   nonetheless  no weight is place on action at this meet  although survey suggest that you   ll seek to carv out addit elbow room for futur action by drop or modifi the    patienc    languag   the revis over the intermeet period to the outlook for polici prompt a    to    basi point rise in nomin treasuri yield  which was record predomin in their real compon   despit some narrow of corpor risk spread  an averag of real corpor yield  weight by capit spend and plot at the bottom left  gain    basi point sinc your march meet   ad in the appreci of the dollar and the small net chang in equiti price  it would appear that financi condit tighten appreci over the intermeet period   a point governor bernank has made   an import element in your decis today is whether you view this tighten as commensur with the revis to the econom outlook   to help frame those deliber  three altern were present in the bluebook  which are repeat at the top of exhibit     the word of altern a was design to address the worri that market particip may have built in excess prompt and aggress polici tighten and that the associ firm in financi condit could threaten econom outcom in        altern b might be favor if you believ that market particip have peg about correct your assess of the odd of polici action over the next few meet but you also desir to emphas that polici    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix      firm will be gradual to limit the chanc of an overreact in market when tighten commenc   in contrast  altern c includ a   point hike in the fund rate  which might seem appropri if you interpret the tighten of financi condit as the initi sign of build pressur on inflat or increas in equilibrium real interest rate   take these altern in turn  the case for a  which make onli minor chang to the word of the statement and retain the commit that you   ll be patient  like rest at least in part on dissatisfact with the slow progress in work down resourc slack in most forecast and perhap  too  on concern about downsid risk to such forecast   in the staff outlook  as shown in the middl left panel  substanti resourc go unus over the next one and three quarter year  with the output gap linger at   percentag point in the final quarter of       while core pce inflat still run at just    percent   although read on payrol gain and cpi increas might indic that busi have becom less hesit to hire and that some price power has return  the two histogram deriv from data sinc the earli     s at the middl right serv as a remind that those month read are veri volatil   a    percentil rang of the month chang in payrol employ span          the compar figur for cpi inflat is     percentag point at a month rate  moreov  given the outsiz increas in the core cpi last month and the evid of some tendenc toward revers  you might think that the risk around the next cpi releas are skew to the downsid   the committe might be inclin to go slowli if recent develop seem reminisc of the fals econom dawn of two year ago   back in march       as sketch out in the bottom left panel  market particip were also firm of the view that tighten was immin and price in    percentag point of fund rate increas over the balanc of that year   both econom data and the moral fiber of some of the leader of corpor america subsequ prove shaki  and those expect unwound  just as  in the bottom right panel  the consensus expect of the year end unemploy rate rose   this  e around may realli be differ   the discuss of altern b in your next exhibit begin by note that member might find the staff forecast both plausibl and accept in it outlook for durabl econom expans and mute pressur on inflat   a notabl aspect of the econom releas over the past six week was the consist with which they surpris on the upsid   but econom forecast are alway uncertain   some sens of that can be gotten from the middl panel  which plot the distribut of three quarter ahead  book forecast error for the unemploy rate and four quarter cpi inflat  center around the current forecast for      q    those distribut   deriv from the past twenti five year   are notabl spread out   over the last year or two  we   ve point to the lower tail of the distribut at the right  in conjunct with the zero bound to nomin interest rate  as a rational for maintain ani unusu easi stanc of polici  now  with the risk of deflat substanti diminish  you may wish to shift your focus more to the upper tail of the distribut   the possibl of signific upsid  surpris unfold in short order may make you uncomfort with the commit that    the committe believ that it can be patient in remov it polici accommod      but    patienc    was meant to convey two notion   that the committe believ it could wait awhil befor act and that  onc polici firm commenc  it could be gradual in return the real fund rate to it neutral set  it is the former  not the latter  that at the moment may seem to be confin   in the bluebook  we offer modifi languag that the    committe believ that polici accommod can like be remov at a measur pace    to emphas that you see yourselv enter a tighten phase but one that like will not be as aggress as in prior episod   that emphasi seem import becaus  as in the tabl at the bottom left  market particip current anticip about     basi point of firm in the next year   that is probabl influenc by the experi of the three prior tighten phase  in which the fund rate move an averag of     percentag point higher within the first year   but with inflat lower now than in those prior episod  you may see less need at this junctur for such firm  perhap view as more like someth on the order of the     basi point increas assum by the staff   in the  book  the gradual realiz by investor that you will not need to tighten as sharpli as they now believ impart an accommod offset to your polici firm   without that offset  you may be concern that the swing of both monetari and fiscal polici toward more restraint may slow the growth of spend next year even more than is built into the  book   there are potenti cost associ with delay tighten and convey a sens of gradual   the recent increas in short run inflat expect   say  as measur by inflat compens in the treasuri market as in the bottom right panel   may repres a cautionari flag in that regard   but inflat compens between five and ten year from now seem much better anchor  perhap encourag you to believ that a statement along the line of altern b would not caus market particip to question your inflat fight resolv   if you think that the odd are higher that inact might prompt build of inflat concern  you might opt for altern c  which is discuss in exhibit     in particular  a   point firm might be favor if you are of the view that inflat has more than bottom   that busi have regain a consider measur of their price power and intend to use it rather than absorb higher cost by cut into their fat profit margin   in that environ  persist monetari polici accommod may spell troubl down the road   and as shown in the middl left panel  monetari polici has probabl becom more accommod of late  as higher inflat by some measur has sent the real feder fund rate further into negat territori and the brighter outlook for the economi has been associ with an increas in the equilibrium fund rate   such concern would be heighten if you suspect that the natur rate of unemploy was higher than the staff current assum   as an altern simul in the  book indic  a natur rate of    percent  instead of less than   percent as assum by the staff  would add more than     percentag point to the inflat forecast for next year  as shown in the middl right panel    one consider regard the  e of such a move is that  as in       it could spark signific financi market turbul   inde  as shown at the bottom left  in both episod the committe kept rate low for a protract period   this  e  howev  market particip seem better prepar  in that the expect path of the feder fund rate  the dash red line  point decid higher than was the case in       the dash blue line    moreov  the larg upward revis to expect over the cours of      should not necessarili be taken as evid of the primari role of a self feed dynam in which polici tighten prompt investor to expect more tighten   rather  a portion was due to the respons to incom data that suggest a more rapid improv in the labor market  seen as the downward drift in a consensus forecast of the unemploy rate at the end of the year  shown at the bottom right    that said  you should be prepar for a sharp revis to expect and heighten volatil should you surpris market by firm today  especi act so close in advanc to key read on employ and inflat  that in itself may be suffici to dissuad you from such an action befor make your intent more clear   in the last exhibit  i provid an updat version of the tabl from the bluebook that give the statement word for the three altern that i have discuss   of particular note across the column is the character of inflat risk as now balanc   which was driven by recent data   and the promis that polici tighten would be measur under b and c   base on feedback i got sinc the bluebook was distribut  i offer three chang to the suggest word  one in the rational paragraph and two in the risk assess portion  with all three highlight in bold  first  some member were troubl by the character that inflat was well anchor  so that has been soften to    contain      second  it seem appropri to stress that the outlook has chang by note that    the risk to the goal of price stabil have move into balanc      last  to be sure that the qualifi    like    obvious appli onli to the pace that you intend to remov polici accommod rather than when you   d start the process  i redraft the last portion of the last sentenc to read    polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur      that conclud my prepar remark
question for     presid
thank you  mr  chairman      i just had a question about the word    measur      i guess there are three option here   we have been use the word    patient     and that give a certain messag to the financi market   so as you   ve outlin in the bluebook  we could retain the word    patient     substitut the word    measur    for it  or we could take it out complet   as i read the bluebook  it said that if we put in the word    measur     interest rate would still go up   if we take out the word    patient    and put noth in it stead  interest rate would go up further  i was wonder if you could give us some idea of the magnitud of those differ    laughter
to what signific digit
whatev you decid
i think we can agre on the sign   the experi of take out the promis of remain accommod for a    consider period    and substitut what seem to be a similar concept of    patienc    was that it prompt a good size market reaction   similar     patienc    has now becom a load word  and the first thing trader will do at      this afternoon is to look to see if that word is in our statement today   if there is noth there at all  then i think you should expect a movement up in forward rate on the order of    to    basi point   leav the sentenc there but chang the languag and use the term    measur    will send them to their dictionari where they will find that the second mean in most common dictionari is    connot a gradual      in my view  that will prompt a reaction on the order of  say    to    basi point  i   m look to dino to see if he agre or disagre
my dictionari align perfect with     s
but   your market sens align with his
make a veri good point about the initi reaction in januari  when    patienc    replac    consider period      and i think he   s right that market particip will look to see if    patienc    is in today   s statement   if it is not  there will be a knee jerk reaction push yield higher
the other point i   d like to make  presid    is that in the total scheme of thing  ani reaction to the word today is go to be dwarf in signific relat to what happen at      friday morn after the employ report come out
right   but basic you   re talk about a small number of basi point from the differ in the word
yes  but it will also influenc how market particip subsequ react to the data   that is  their view of the employ report or the cpi is go to be filter through the len of what they think the committe is go to be do   in that sens    measur    is a speed bump to them as well  in term of overreact to the data   so it   s not just a matter of what happen this afternoon  it   s what happen over the next six to eight week
thank you  mr  chairman   i was go to rais a question that goe right to the point that   was just make   the critic issu is not how the market will respond this afternoon but how best we can creat languag that will align our reaction to the data and the market   s reaction to the data   as roger   mention befor  obvious we   re go to be respond to the incom inform   i think he said it goe without say
but i had to say it nevertheless    laughter
so i think it might help to give some sens of that   to modifi this languag and say someth like    with inflat low and resourc slack and given the econom outlook       to emphas the point that  if the econom outlook chang as a consequ of the incom data  then of cours it make sens for us to reconsid the pace at which we would remov the accommod   i   d put it in those term   between now and our next meet  we   ll have two employ report  and i guess we   ll have two cpi report   if  each of those suggest a revis to  the outlook such that the outlook for activ is one standard deviat higher and inflat the same way  that would be quit a major chang   and i think it would requir us to react a littl less gradual than we might otherwis   i agre that gradual make a lot of sens if the world come out accord to the staff forecast   but if it  sn   t come out that way  we don   t want to lock ourselv into a market assumpt that we   re go to be move gradual  it seem to me  thank you
i   d like to go to this point of what the market   s reaction will be  obvious the market reaction is go to be depend upon what we do relat to what market particip expect us to do   their expect are the relev issu here   but i don   t know how we measur market reaction when we don   t have a way of go out there and ask market particip     what would you think if we said   measur         the market is expect an adjust  i would argu   an elimin of the word    patienc      but i don   t know how to split that hair and say that  if we elimin    patienc     which is what the market expect  but don   t put in a word that is somewher between patienc and an immin move   a word such as    measur    whose second definit is    slow movement      we   re go to get a    basi point increas in rate  more to the point  we   re then go to have to sit around here next  e and worri about whether it is  e to be less measur  and that troubl me as well  i thought that the combin of the speech and the market   s expect as to the data would allow us the opportun to do what the market expect by take out    patienc      i just wonder whether we   re generat anoth problem by ad    measur      i don   t know what the reaction to that is go to be   whatev the reaction is  we   re go to have to pay for it later when we no longer want to character our prospect polici action as measur   i don   t know if that   s  a question   laughter   you answer the question of what you expect the market to do  though i don   t know how one could even begin to answer that question   i think market particip are go to scrambl to their dictionari and ask     what     measur    mean      and then they   ll tri to figur out our intent and how to react
haven   t you done survey on the market   s expect regard the languag   i think you have
in the survey by the desk  the question we ask market particip was whether they expect us to drop or modifi the word    patienc
if they expect us to drop it or modifi it  i read that as an opportun to drop it   if we realli want to know more  i guess we should have ask  but i   m not sure how to do that   there are lot of word in the english languag
it   s hard to know how to interact with market particip about potenti word   obvious i am make a guess here  but it   seem  on the basi of read various newslett  that the preponder of economist who write about the issu expect the committe to modifi rather than to drop the word    patienc      but that is a guess   i onc ask a nobel laureat what he thought was the best way of find out how market particip would react to word in the statement   he suggest that we do what those in the survey industri do   have focus group and realli experi with trader   my reaction was that the onli  e i   ve ever thought about experi with trader it involv cattl prod    laughter   it   s just hard to
trader react to what they think other trader are go to do who react to the way they think still other trader are go to react   to tri to anticip how they will react is a futil activ in my experi   presid hoenig
this may be more of a statement than a question also   but in my experi on this committe we   ve never act in other than a measur way   and i can   t see our do otherwis as we go forward  depend on the data we get   in my view the onli thing we accomplish with this word specif is to put a collar on ourselv and to tell the market that we   re put a collar on ourselv go forward   i think that   s what we   ve done in the past  with the result that  any  we want to make a chang  we have to wait at least one more meet to prepar the market for the chang   use the statement as the vehicl   that is the point toni was make earlier   we have an opportun here to drop this languag  and i think we should
may i just interrupt   i   ll anticip what i   m go to say in my comment to you in a few moment   this languag enabl us to move the next  e   but the word is veri interest   the word    measur    is refer sole to the rate of increas  not to when the increas will begin   we have no way of know what the data are go to show over the next sever week   as   point out  whatev we decid here and whatev the respons  the reaction is like to be a small fraction of what the market will do on friday   if  for exampl  we were to go veri far and tri to move more than the market expect and we end up with a        payrol number and     on the core cpi  we will have move awkward   i   m not sure what the reaction would be to that   but i don   t think this propos languag restrict us in the slightest   as you say  tom  we alway move in a measur way   so the use of the term    measur     if i take you liter  should have zero effect becaus that   s the way we alway move   mere stipul that  sn   t chang anyth
part my concern is what will happen if the payrol number come out better than         again and we have more inflat   then what are we go to do next  e
do you mean what will we say or what will we do
what are we go to do   we   ve alreadi told the market if we say    measur    today  what we   re go to do next  e
what we will do is that we will move the fund rate up
and the first move we make will be a big deal  especi if it   s in june and not in august as everyon expect   unless you want to move either today or in the intermeet period  which i would not recommend
i understand what you   re tri to do in term of prepar for the next meet   my onli concern is that  onc we put this languag in there  when the next meet come and we have our polici discuss we   ll have to worri about the word    measur      which i think was presid santomero   s point
anyth we do  whether it   s    basi point or     basi point is by definit measur    laughter
that make me feel a whole lot less well
you had a measur rise in your temperatur    laughter
we   re beat to death the issu that i want to rais here  so it   s probabl not help for me to rais it again   we are debat the term    measur      if we take the phrase that includ    measur    out of sentenc    we   re left with a statement that say we think the polici accommod can be remov   that rais the question   well  if that   s what you think  whi didn   t you do it   so we   d have to take out the whole sentenc if we want to get rid of    patienc    and    measur    altogeth   but i   m not sure what the market reaction would be to someth like altern b without sentenc     without ani statement whatsoev that reflect  as we   ve been  do all along  some sens of bias in our polici intent   as much as i am in agreement with the view that put yet anoth phrase into our quiver will perhap rais all kind of con n about what we mean by it  i think we   re left with a hard choic here   so given that hard choic  i think mayb    measur    has to stay
may i ask just one other question   do you see a  e when we would take this word out
i think you would take this word out if you envis circumst compar to the latter part of      where you   d be move  say     or    basi point   in other word  if it were februari      and we were use this framework  we probabl would have sent you a bluebook that said    polici accommod can be remov at a measur pace      most like that would have stay in the bluebook until juli or august when you felt you were behind the curv and had to do larger increas
so while we have a seri of    basi point increas it would stay in
in some circumst it might be help to keep in the    measur    phrase even in the act of tighten so market particip don   t extrapol that tighten more than you think appropri
i have a question of process   do you want to continu this discuss   i can hold my comment and wait  but i want to weigh in on this issu as well   it   s a question of whether we   re go to come back to it or not
oh  of cours we can come back to it
i   ll hold my comment until later then
mr  chairman  at this point i think it would be help if you would give your view and your polici recommend  and then we could all say what we think about this   laughter   that may avoid our be surpris  just as we don   t want to be surpris by the upcom unemploy report
okay  let me talk in a measur manner    laughter   first of all  i think there   s no question now that this recoveri is broad  deep  and evolv into a sustain expans   inde  i have the suspicion that a veri unusu factor in this recoveri allow us to project it further than is usual the case   corpor manag is veri conserv and not prone to anticip a recoveri and  henc  to move ahead of it   move ahead of the recoveri usual mean put in plant facil more quick  expand the compani   s labor forc well befor the addit worker are need  and make all the other expenditur that corpor have made in past recoveri  with the result that capit invest plus inventori accumul has invari exceed intern cash flow  in       for the first  e sinc       cash flow exceed capit invest  which suggest that there is a veri consider hurdl   in term of spend decis   to which the busi communiti is still respond  and i suspect that it relat to the corpor scandal and other corpor concern that have emerg in the last coupl of year and are still linger   we are see veri consider gain in corpor profit  and margin are up veri signific   cash flow in the first quarter was quit strong  and analyst are continu to rais their es  for the second quarter   in short  busi manag are be pull along by the data rather than be anticipatori   this is not unusu becaus we   ve had a veri shallow recess and we   re not get the usual rebound in ani respect  with the except of the veri strong growth in profit   all of this lead me to conclud   and i think this view is held pretti much univers as well as within this committe   that we have complet our period of accommod  which was an endeavor to address the rather substanti contractionari forc that becam evid in mid       in retrospect our polici accommod appear to have work   whether we will look back upon this period two year from today and say that our polici was the right polici is go to depend on how we come out of this period of accommod  with regard to the outlook for inflat  we have a number of indic that we look at   for one  as mani of you have mention  we have the    gap      i am uncomfort with the gap analysi basic for two reason   one is that it requir that we view the inflat project from the perspect of regress analysi  and that kind of analysi alway has a larg element of potenti error in it   if the project inflat rate is abov the current rate  we   re never quit sure whether there has been a fundament chang in the structur of the economi  which isn   t captur by the regress  or whether the actual inflat rate is eventu go to move up   as a consequ  unless our project are right on the money all the  e  which they almost invari are not  there are alway serious question about whether our gap regress analys are realli tell us someth that we need to know  second  there is the question of whether a singl figur describ the process   a number of you have mention the skill labor shortag   the veri soft rise in wage and salari in the product worker data is suggest of the develop that we   re all awar of   name  that the skill differenti has been rise fair dramat   as a result  we have a shortag of skill worker and a correspond surplus of lesser skill worker   and as i   ve argu in certain speech recent  what we are fail to do in this countri is to rais the degre of skill in the workforc as a whole suffici quick to creat a more balanc skill suppli   demand situat  and in the process to remov the surplus of the lesser skill so that we end up with an overal balanc   we don   t have that at this stage   i   m wonder whether or not the differenti pressur of stronger wage growth in skill area and weaker wage growth in lesser skill area creat problem in do this type of evalu   in my view that is at least open to question  as a consequ  i think that it is import to look at the structur of under cost  becaus profit margin tend to be constrain  within limit  the issu we ought to be look at when we are tri to evalu the behavior of inflat is not the core pce or the core cpi but under unit cost in the economi  as best we can judg them   one way of analyz this is to look at a set of data compos of nonfinanci  non energi corpor that account for mayb    percent of the gdp but obvious a signific higher proport of the growth of the busi sector   if we look at those data  we see that the acceler in cost has been veri limit   inde  over the last four quarter this sector has regist an averag price rise in the neighborhood of   percent   and it turn out that two third of that rise is reflect in higher unit profit and that actual under unit cost are rise veri modest  the result of a combin of declin unit labor cost and declin unit interest cost  offset in part by rise cost of energi  indirect busi tax  and busi transfer  i understand the issu of whether we mis evalu the data on price last year and  henc  have been oper under a presumpt that inflat had gotten lower than it actual did   but i think that the more import question here is what unit cost are do   consequ  tri to get a long term project of where inflat is go may requir that we start from a higher base than the one we   ve been assum is current the base   as i think     mention  we have now reach the point where chang in unit labor cost have becom posit   we have to assum that there has been some upward movement in unit energi cost and probabl in unit interest cost   but one has to rememb that  whenev we are talk about unit cost  if the denomin is rise at a fair rapid pace  it hold down unit cost  all els be equal   so it is not clear to me that unit interest cost are in the process of go up   nevertheless  i think the point here is that we are not yet in a posit where we are see under cost structur move signific   to be sure  they have pick up in the last sever month   in fact  my recollect of the data is that product growth from decemb through march  as distinct from the first quarter over the fourth quarter  is in the area of just under   percent   in fact  if i sort all the piec of paper in front of me  i may actual come up with a number    paus   voila   the staff es  of output growth per hour between decemb and march is     percent at an annual rate   compens per hour  interest enough  is up at a   percent rate for the same period  reflect a     percent increas in wage and salari and signific increas in other labor incom   the latter increas  as you saw in the eci  is to a larg extent pension cost and medic insur cost  so we are begin to see a process of increas cost   but the product number are still suffici strong to suppress the overal rise   rememb  the major differ between      and today is product growth   in      we didn   t have ani product growth to speak of  and we had to move veri fast to contain inflationari pressur   the reason we have been abl to be patient in this recent period is that we knew unit labor cost were fall fair abrupt  and whatev the price data show was frank irrelev in that respect  i think we have a set of data here that  as far as i can judg  seem to be consist with a gradual build up of inflationari forc   but i fulli recogn that we can   t measur that by look at differ simul as we tri to do in certain respect in the  book   i   m uncomfort with the veri narrow rang that the  book   s altern simul show  that   s becaus  if we look back over the last sever year or mayb the last decad or so and ask if  we were wrong at  e becaus we misforecast the exogen variabl  i   d say    onli part     most  the reason we were off was that the model structur was chang   the coeffici insid the model were move  and that creat a wholli differ environ from the one we had expect   we alter the exogen variabl in our simul  but we do not chang the structur of the model   of necess the simul are base on the assumpt of a fix model structur  and at this stage  i am a littl concern that that may be give us some fals sens of complac  if that is inde what we have  still  the chang in unit labor cost in march  if we   re go to take the staff   s figur  is zero  and with profit margin appar continu to rise  that is suggest of a unit cost chang that on a month pattern is not exhibit ani acceler   in that respect  i think we can state that the pace at which we   re like to remov our polici accommod is go to be    measur      the data could run away from us  and obvious that would creat a problem  in ani event i would say that we have to posit ourselv for the possibl of move at some meet  unless we want to take the veri unusu step of make a move between meet  that  i will tell you  would creat some extraordinari impact in the marketplac larg becaus we are perceiv as high credibl   so  if we elimin that option  we either move today  or we wait until june   we are not go to move today in part becaus we are await  and will soon get  a coupl of major statist report that could caus us some difficulti  to say the least  if they differ radic from what we expect   and the point of wait until june is to be sure that we are posit to move at the june meet if we desir to do so then  when i say    move     i mean by    basi point   i mention that part becaus of the experi of februari        those of you who were here then may rememb that there was a groundswel opinion within the committe in favor of move rate up not     but    basi point   and i went berserk for the first  e and  i hope  the last  e at an fomc meet  on the ground that  whatev we did  the market were go to respond fair except  which in fact they did   so  on the basi of that particular histori  i would say that we should not move more than    basi point in june   we may move    basi point in august   i don   t know what we will decid then   but the point at issu is that  if we   re not go to move more than    basi point in june  then the type of statement propos in the bluebook   which was more recent revis by    and i   ll read the specif reword   strike me as an appropri respons to the data we now have  the sentenc as it now read is     at this junctur  with inflat low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur     frank  i think that posit us appropri  consid our lack of knowledg   i know that presid pool has rais the question of put in someth about the econom outlook   i have no object to that particular   i   m not sure it add anyth  frank   it   add word  and i think the fewer word that we put in these statement  the better off we are   you will have observ that we are spend more  e on this statement than we have on previous statement  which is fine   inde  sinc we   re limit ourselv to veri few issu  in my judgment that say that this process is turn out to be the right way to do this   in ani event  to repeat myself  my recommend is that we stay where we are and make the few chang in the statement that   suggest   i would be curious to hear your reaction and get the convers go again  who would like to start   governor
first of all  i support your recommend  mr  chairman   as i said in my earlier statement  i   d prefer to be gradual  and i   d prefer to start earli and stay ahead of the curv  understand that we can chang our mind depend on the way the data come in   to be  posit ourselv for a move of    basi point in june is fine and would satisfi my roger and hammerstein test  on the languag  i actual think the sentenc in altern b is brilliant   in my view it   not put a collar on us   second  we have not alway move in a measur way   our polici move weren   t measur over the cours of        and they weren   t measur in         so to say that we prefer to be measur i think   add to the dialogu   the word probabl   not make our action as conting on the data as bill would like  but it   say that our stanc is condit on inflat be low and resourc use be slack  so it   tie into the data at least to some extent   and to me the phrase    like to be measur    realli is the gradualist mantra   so how could i object to that   i think it   s just perfect  frank
mr  chairman  i wish we were in a posit to move today  but obvious we   re not   i   m among those who have a strong prefer not to introduc anoth word such as    measur    into our statement   again  we   re all tri to play english major  i think   but i agre with your comment that we cannot know with ani certainti how the data will come in   inde  they may run away from us a bit  and we may want to be in a posit  if not in june then some  in the summer  to make more than a    basi point move      in his respons to a question  indic that he think    measur    will  in fact  be interpret to mean    basi point move  and i just don   t think we need to say that   in my view  we have enough credibl that we   re go to oper in a reason and measur way   i believ we would be do ourselv and the financi market a disservic by impli a pre commit to a particular path for polici   a commit that we may later wish we had not made   i think we can oper just fine by drop the word    patienc    and leav well enough alon   thank you
i support your propos   i am a littl uneasi about the word    measur    for the reason i indic   if i may  i   d like to ask you just one question concern your thought process   you indic that at the next meet we may inde be in a posit of respond with a    basi point move   to the extent that the incom data are satisfactori   and that if the economi get stronger  then we will go
i don   t know what the next move will be
i   m teas  of cours  just give an exampl
rememb  though  that we haven   t made an intermeet move in quit a long while  and one of the reason is that we haven   t been in the process of make chang in our polici   if we go back and look at the histori  we have often move between meet
i agre with you   the question i want to ask is this   if we got posit surpris between now and the june meet and we felt we need to rais the fund rate target by    basi point  would we also conclud that we need to take out    measur
therefor  the next move could be more on the order of      basi point   that is to say two step  involv both a    basi point increas and the remov of    measur
look  unless someth veri unusu happen between now and june  i think if our first move were    basi point that could creat some real market disrupt   but if our presumpt is that we have to acceler the pace  then i think    measur    should be drop in june
if we move and the economi sudden improv in a manner that is consist with move further  it may be more disrupt to have put the word    measur    in the statement than to have left it out
it may   the tradeoff here is that a disrupt will occur now if we don   t say someth like    measur      and we are at an earlier stage of the econom recoveri than presum we will be later  in which case it   s quit conceiv that we might do inadvert collater damag   if the market is like to respond to this statement by tighten  which we suspect it will  it   s go to tighten more if we don   t use    measur    or some similar word   and subsequ we might find that we   re run into a period where there   s more slack in this economi than we now anticip   i don   t think it   s a high probabl  but the cost of a mistak here today may be much larger than the cost of a mistak later
with that said  i support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support your recommend   we are obvious deep into the question of how we communic with market  and we have a general view  i think  that this is not the  e to actual move up the fund rate   so let me focus on the way i think about our communic with market   my sens of it is that we want to reinforc market expect if we believ they are about right and we want to chang market expect if we think they   re wrong   and we use communic to do that  as i look at exhibit    it is hard for me to say at this stage that market expect are fundament wrong compar with the judgment i heard express in this room   name  that inflat is relat low but it might be pick up  though we aren   t realli sure and so we have to give ourselv a littl more  e   i believ that this propos languag is help in say to the  market that we wouldn   t want to work hard to disabus them of the expect that have been built in at this stage for a modest tighten probabl start some  in august   that  sn   t mean that that assess can   t chang   it may chang as the data chang  and we may move more aggress than we anticip   i   m not sure   but i would definit say that the word    measur    will help us to avoid trigger ani real snapback in expect in the context of what i continu to view as an economi that is still work hard to get rid of slack   so i   m veri support of this languag  my second point relat to tom   s question and other about what we can do here   as i read this languag   put on my english major hat   it say basic    at this junctur      so as of today  conting on the condit that ned point out   low inflat and slack in resourc use   our belief is that the pace at which we will remov polici accommod is like to be measur  i sens that to be an accur reflect of where we are at this stage   if over  e  base on a number of data releas that come in  it turn out at some futur junctur that this assess is no longer relev  i don   t think our hand are tie   in my view we can move if we have to move in june   i actual think the market probabl understand that   or at least that seem more like than not   so i think this languag is   i know ned use the word    brilliant     but i thought we had move away recent from declar our statement to be brilliant   certain extrem good    laughter
you are inde measur
i was go to give a less ring endors by character the propos as better than the known altern    laughter   essenti what we   re debat is whether a statement with this end is too soft  too reassur about the futur  path of the fed fund rate   i believ that   s the right question to debat   but i think it   s import to recogn that this word give us the flexibl to move in june  if necessari   although our risk assess is balanc  this statement has an overt asymmetr bias  whichev way one look at it  as roger just said  the last sentenc is qualifi in at least four differ way   it say    at this junctur     it is condit on certain fundament  it say    like     and the word    measur    itself must have a rang of possibl interpret   now  it   s difficult to defend the statement both as not constrain and help as a signal  but mayb that   s it virtu   laughter   so i   m comfort with it  and i support the recommend
presid  n
i  too  support the recommend   i think the languag   give us adequ flexibl at least for the next two or three month  as best i can read the situat   and i   m hard press to suggest ani better altern   so i support your propos
mr  chairman  i also support your recommend   i have to admit that  when i first read the    measur pace    languag in the bluebook  i was concern that it would be interpret by market as indic that we had a predetermin path for move rate up and that we would be do it base on a  e schedul rather than react to inform about the economi   and as i said earlier  i was lean toward want the flexibl to react more quick if the data continu to come in stronger  especi the inflat number   i think the new languag that   propos     is like to be measur       give us the ad flexibl   so i support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend and all aspect of it   like presid    i   d be concern that  if we just drop the last sentenc  the market would overreact if not immedi then over the intermeet period   as data come in  they   d start to build in a      type tighten  which is what i think they   re look for and what a lot of the discuss is about in the market   my person view   or at least my best guess   is that we won   t need to tighten like that   inflat is lower  and i think the output gap is disappear but is disappear slowli   so not signal the market that expect of a      type tighten would be the wrong   and  allow those wrong expect to get built into the market   would give us  i think  more troubl than deal with this word    measur      so i believ that we need some way of indic that our best guess is that the firm  when it come  will be gradual  i thought the reaction to your tes oni  mr  chairman  was perfect becaus you drop    patienc     everybodi notic it  and rate react a littl but not a lot   and you balanc that by provid a somewhat more detail outlook   you said that you didn   t expect inflat to rise and you talk about the downsid risk that you discuss earlier   well  we   re not do that here  we   re not give a detail outlook in our statement   so i think the suggest of a moder and measur pace of tighten is a way of substitut for a detail forecast in an effort to moder the market   s reaction to our statement   thank you
i support your recommend   i think we may need to move sooner than the market now expect   but that is go to depend larg on the strength of the incom data  even in the next week   so i look forward to see what is in store for us  i veri much agre with what don just said   i think if we left out sentenc    we would be send the wrong messag   we actual could be send the wrong messag in anoth way   we  could be interpret as say that everyth is hunki dori and that we don   t have plan to remov the polici accommod   that could be read as the messag in the statement that the risk to the outlook are balanc  wherea sentenc     say posit that  all other thing be equal  we   re go to take the polici accommod away   we plan to do it in a measur way  but we   re go to do it   i think that   s an import follow up to your tes oni as well   whatev way we look at it  i think we   re stuck with sentenc     we   re probabl go to take grief from some quarter for this new languag  but i think we   re stuck with do this   so i agre with your recommend
mr  chairman  i   m veri comfort with your recommend   i feel veri strong that we should use the    measur    languag for all of the reason you have list   i also agre with roger   s and don   s point   and cathi   s as well   fundament there   s still a consider amount of slack in the economi  as i see it   also  and this is a point i would emphas  i believ that we still have credibl for low inflat   this is not late      or earli       when we did not have credibl   i know there is some survey evid of rise inflat expect  and there are a lot of anecdot report as well  but i don   t see ani realli dramat recent chang in inflat compens or in spread for index bond in financi market  especi in the longer term five year to ten year area   basic  i believ that we need to think differ about the potenti benefit of a preemptiv tighten of polici   or what might be perceiv as a preemptiv tighten of polici   in a situat where we have price stabil as distinct from a situat where we were at the last stage of end a twenti five year war against inflat   in my view  the languag indic that we can remov polici accommod at a measur pace would be consist with these consider   earlier  mr  chairman  you told me that i could have about thirti addit second to talk today   if i may have about five second here  i   d like to quick share a littl anecdot that you may enjoy   some of you may recal that at the last meet i was pretti much at one end of the spectrum   even beyond the kohn camp   laughter   i paid for that at the hand of my colleagu  jack guynn  a few day ago   jack  of cours  is the presid of the atlanta fed  which is the sixth feder reserv district   but as some of you may know  he was actual born in the fifth feder reserv district  in the shenandoah valley   he has a nice younger brother name doug  who is a veri promin attorney there   i had to make a speech in that area a coupl of week ago  and doug veri kind invit me to stay with him   jack happen to be there as well   doug has a wonder hous overlook the mountain  and he gave me a beauti room to stay in  and for the first  e in my career  there was a bouquet of flower in my room   but doug kept ask me to look care at the flower   i couldn   t understand whi until  eventu  i saw that in the flower arrang there was a carv wooden dove sent by his brother  jack    laughter   jack  that realli hurt   i hope you take some comfort that i   m a bit closer to the center of graviti today
it was fun
well done   governor olson
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support the recommend  and i   ve been look care at both sentenc    which cathi talk about  and the march fomc statement shown in altern b   if i compar them word by word or even phrase by phrase  i can see onli minor differ   primarili the remov of the word    patient    and the addit of    is like to be measur      but as i read the two  i think that altern b come across much more strong  and i think it   s the posit of the word    remov      we   re not talk about when at some point in the futur the polici accommod will be remov   we   re describ the circumst  or the manner in which it will be remov   consequ  i would not be surpris   though i   ve never been good at judg what the market respons to our statement will be   if there   s a stronger reaction than what mani around the tabl have been suggest   have said that  i think the statement is exact accur   and recogn that we review these general within a six week  e frame  it seem to me that this is the appropri way to describ where we are as of today
thank you  mr  chairman   i wasn   t here in februari       but i   m certain go to go back and read the transcript to see when you went berserk    laughter
my    berserked    was partial edit out    laughter
as for your propos  i agre with your recommend on the rate   on the languag  i find it hard to disagre with languag that peopl i respect call    brilliant    or    extrem good     but i must say that i   d prefer a differ path   i would prefer to drop the word    patienc    and not substitut the word    measur      i just don   t like put anoth word into the lexicon now   i think it is go to pose problem for us down the road whenev we tri to take it out   i realiz that this word is go to be approv  but i   d like to make a coupl of comment so that the next  e this issu come up my view will at least be in the record  first of all  on the point that we condit it four  e  i rememb that at the jackson hole confer there was a lot of discuss about whether the market can understand central bank    condit statement  and the clear consensus was    no      the view was that the condit in a statement by a central bank  sn   t mean anyth to the market   they just read it as uncondit  second  on cathi   s and don   s point about line    the part of the sentenc that i think is import   name     with inflat low and resourc use slack     which i agre should be  somewher in the statement   could be move up to line   and incorpor in the rational section  i think that would describ the situat as it is now without have to provid a forward look element   in other word  without ad    measur      so  on balanc  i would prefer to take that word out
mr  chairman  have express my opinion somewhat earlier and have listen to all of this commentari  at this junctur i want to give you my measur respons to the convers so far and that is that we have the direct right   i know where we stand in that we need to be look at the next meet for some action   and i think that   s the most import thing we   ve decid here today  so i support you in that   i think we would be better serv not to have this last sentenc  line    in the statement   we could convey this messag in speech  as you alreadi have in some way  over the come period   the data come out will decid a lot of this for us and move us toward a june  e frame anyway   but i think the more import element of today   s decis is that we cannot move now and we should be think about june   in that sens  i support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  am still in the camp that would prefer not have a commit in the statement   but i like the idea that mani of us have been express in speech   that the polici accommod has to be remov   what i struggl with   and i was interest in listen to what was said about it around the tabl   was the word    measur      if i were an outsid tri to read the messag in that word  i   m not sure that i would know what it mean   are we tri to signal a slower pace than in         a gradual and moder but not pre emptiv pace   i guess we   ve come up with a word that i don   t know the mean of   if the idea is  that it say we   re go to determin the pace as the fact come in   and we   ll determin the level at that  e  too   then i think we have the perfect word   i don   t necessarili think it mean that we wouldn   t be as aggress as we were  say  in         i don   t know how it relat to the averag number that   provid here becaus i don   t know what magnitud we   re talk about with    measur      my onli concern is what we realli want to signal   are we just go to determin our move as the fact come in  or do we realli want to signal a gradual pace
the answer to that is that the fact are go to determin polici and i should hope that the market are acut awar of that   if that were not the case  they wouldn   t have been move the feder fund futur around as the data came in   at the end of the day  if we wish to be stubborn  we could keep the feder fund futur at   percent indefinit  it would have certain odd implic for the economi  but we could do that   we could just basic creat enough reserv to make that possibl
i guess i   m ask  whi don   t we just say that the pace at which the polici accommod will be remov will be determin as econom event unfold   i   d prefer to say someth like that rather than use a code word such as    measur
i thought that   s what you interpret that word to mean
well  i   m hear a lot of differ interpret of it  even around this tabl
all of which suggest that when we have nineteen peopl around a tabl tri to write a statement  as we   ve indic on innumer occas  there are difficulti in the process
yes  there are
i also would prefer just to drop    patienc    without substitut anyth els  but i   ll conced that the argument is over   just so al can go out as the lonesom dove  though   laughter  i would like to point out that i don   t think ani of us   well  mayb one or two of us   realli believ that the risk to our goal of price stabil have move into balanc   to me  our comment indic that we realli believ there   s a risk of rise inflat  and i think we feel that the risk of unwant disinfl or deflat is behind us   so  while we may not want to move that risk assess two whole notch in one meet  if we were total honest about it  i think we would
we had that discuss about our statement earlier  as you may recal   a coupl of meet ago   we said that  if we had retain our old terminolog     asymmetr to the downsid    was realli how we view the outlook on inflat   but our judgment was that we   d creat more problem by chang the word in our statement than not  and i think a two step move
i understand the practic problem of go two step  but i think we ought to at least recogn that      like a fish    i think is the term we use in high school
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to make a coupl of point   first of all  with regard to long term inflat expect  i   m go to use an analog with the feder fund futur market   take the read for septemb in the futur market   we interpret that not as provid us with ani evid about the state of the economi other than the market   s expect of what this committe is go to do   i think that   s the onli inform we can extract from that observ   by the same token  i think the long term inflat expect that we extract from the inflat index bond is realli a statement about the market   s expect on what this committe is go to do over a period of year   we can   t extract ani real inform relev to  understand under inflationari pressur   it   s realli a statement about what this committe is like to do   and onc the index bond start to move  the inform  just like the septemb futur read  will repres the market   s chang view about how the committe is go to react in the futur   onc it start to move   if it move to the upsid   i think it will mean that we are begin to lose credibl   that   s the way i would interpret it  second  i agre with bob   regard the inflat risk   the problem we have is that it   s not veri transpar to use languag that is ostens is about the state of the world and our forecast as a hint about our probabl futur polici stanc   that to me is unfortun   i don   t think there   s anyth we can do about it right now becaus i understand that the two step move would send that signal   howev  i think it   s unfortun that we have mix up languag here that in principl ought to be about the state of the economi or our assess of it but it is interpret as an indic of what our polici stanc is go to be  i share the view that go cold turkey in take out    patienc    is probabl counterproduct  given the histori of    a consider period        patienc     and now    measur      i think the market is go to read    measur    as a nuanc on    patienc      i   m concern about that  and i think we need to tri to find a way to extract ourselv from this kind of languag   i would like to see languag along the follow line substitut at some point      the committe expect that it futur polici stanc will depend on the futur pace of econom growth and develop regard inflat risk      that   s just a statement that our polici is go to depend on the incom data and  of cours  the implic of the data for our assess of the risk go forward  have a veri plain statement along those line is to me a good substitut for the current languag  i don   t think we can just elimin this languag cold turkey  that   s go to caus all sort of question and misunderstand   we have to substitut someth eventu   and i would tri to  substitut someth that get us out from under the    consider period        patienc        measur    progress   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i think the debat go around the tabl has less to do with our differ in outlook than that there continu to be some fundament confus about how we   re communic to the market and what our mechan ought to be   i just rais the point that we realli ought to revisit these issu at some  e in the near futur   given where we are today  though  i think that the languag be propos is both use guidanc to the market and protect against the risk of an overreact in interest rate that would be counterproduct both to the market and to the economi   our statement is a forecast  it is not a commit   and i don   t think that it constrain us unduli  even if it becom necessari to make larger move
the secretari will read the resolut for us
as far as the direct is concern  the word can be found on page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent     with regard to the word also be vote on  take     s revis draft  sentenc number    of cours  is unchang from last  e   it read     the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal      and then we have the revis word under altern b for sentenc   and       similar  the risk to the goal of price stabil have move into balanc   at this junctur  with  inflat low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur
