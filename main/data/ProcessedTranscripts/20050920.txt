good morn  everyon   we   ll start with mr  kos
good morn  mr  chairman   thank you   i   ll be refer to the chart that are in front of you   dure this intermeet period  market particip were princip occupi with the econom impact of hurrican katrina and altern their judgment as to whether the growth or inflat effect would domin  the top panel of page   graph the   month deposit rate in black and the same rate   month and   month forward in red   in the two week after your last meet  the   month forward rate edg down a bit  as market particip began to specul that the tighten cycl was push the fed fund rate into territori that was within hail distanc of the so call neutral rate   forward rate then fell sharpli in the day after august      suggest reason for the fall includ the possibl that the committe might paus at this meet or that the negat growth impact of the hurrican would dampen output and abbrevi the cumul amount of tighten  even if the committe were to move today   howev  forward rate began to rise as market particip shrug off initi worri about lower growth and began to worri somewhat more about potenti inflationari effect   those concern were reinforc by higher price paid data in some of the manufactur survey and also by friday   s inflat expect compon of the michigan consum survey   longer term yield  in the middl panel  told a similar stori  with the    year treasuri yield head toward     percent in the aftermath

period and the breakeven curv higher  the effect has been to lower and steepen the real yield curv  as shown on the top panel of page     given the arithmet relationship between nomin and breakeven yield  this graph mere take the inform of the last two chart and show it anoth way   nevertheless  the reduct of real yield is pronounc and may suggest   at least for the next few year   that investor

includ mexico and brazil   turn to page    i want to return to a topic that presid   ask about at the last meet  name  the dynam relat to settlement of the treasuri futur contract   to provid some background and context  the top panel depict in the light blue bar the peak open interest in the    year treasuri futur contract   the dark blue bar repres the issu size of the cheapest to deliv treasuri secur  also call the ctd   start in       the volum and open interest in the futur contract began to rise sharpli   but with issu size remain in the     billion rang  the ratio of open interest to size of the ctd increas sharpli   the growth of peak open interest did not rais eyebrow initi sinc most futur contract are use for specul  hedg  or arbitrag purpos   most contract are close out or roll over into the next contract befor matur  and the volum of secur actual deliv was de minimi   for exampl  the middl left panel graph for the march      contract the open interest in blue   with    day of trade left  open interest was about     billion equival on the    year futur contract   over the next few day there was a slow decay of open interest  as trader close out posit or roll them into the next contract   onli a tini amount was actual settl   and those with short posit had no troubl borrow the august      secur  which was the ctd into this contract  this was the normal state of affair   howev  as the market have grown  some larg market particip have begun to view take deliveri of secur as a viabl option compar to the altern of slowli build a posit in the cash market   other trader   perhap more opportunist   have note the dispar between the peak open interest and the relat small issu size and may have conclud that there was an increas possibl that the short might have to deliv secur other than the ctd    the center middl panel graph the situat in june   open interest decay veri slowli as those with long posit in the futur market did not find it profit to roll their posit   instead they took deliveri   as the short realiz they would be forc to deliv  there was a scrambl to find the februari      secur   in the event  the short were abl to find enough of the ctd   about     billion   to fulli    satisfi deliveri oblig  but the experi fo  conspiraci theori and the press articl that follow about a possibl squeez    the septemb contract  which has two day of trade left  is prove equal challeng   as shown in the middl right panel  the open interest with    day of trade left was an elev     billion or so  and the decay has been slow  suggest that the long would trigger a multi issu deliveri   in the past few day  the open interest has decreas  but the possibl for a multi issu deliveri remain   the ctd in this settlement cycl is the august of      secur   as one would expect  this issu is hard to find and trade veri special in the repo market   the bottom left panel show in blue the overnight repo rate for that secur  which has decreas from about   percent to zero as it becam appar that there would be a sizabl deliveri into the contract   as the secur was    box     it has all but stop trade in the repo market  and fail in the issu jump to more than     billion and ye day they were more than      billion   from previous experi  those fail should clear up veri quick after the contract settl   so  has this flurri of activ affect the cash market or the shape of the yield curv   all indic are that the answer is no   the bottom right panel graph note in the    to    year sector as of late last week   the red dot is the august of      secur   it is trade slight rich to the curv but not disproportion so  and it  sn   t seem to be affect neighbor secur   the chicago board of trade has institut posit limit for individu particip dure the last    day of trade  begin with the decemb contract  whether that will allevi the problem or will shift the pressur elsewher remain to be seen   mr  chairman  onc again there were no foreign oper in the period   in that regard  i want to note that this come thursday will mark five year sinc our last intervent   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
there is obvious some perceiv advantag in take deliveri of the secur rather than just go into the market and purchas them   the sort of non conspiratori view is that a lot of peopl think someth is go on and  therefor  they might as well sit and accept deliveri even though that was not their intent when they bought the futur   what do you know is go on   we certain know who the particip are   or at least the exchang know   what have you learn
well  i   ll let bob elsass fill in some textur here   certain  larger  investor are more activ in the futur market and are use those contract in more way than they had  say     or    year ago   so the prospect of a
is this fanni and freddi disproportion by ani chanc   obvious  they do use the secur
yes  but i   m not specif refer to them   so  as these larger entiti have becom more activ in the futur  for them the prospect of buy a multibillion dollar posit through the futur market is not daunt   it   s someth that they   re easili capabl of do  wherea probabl    or    year ago take on a veri larg posit and financ it might have been a task   so i think that   s part of the stori  second  go into the cash market and build a multibillion dollar posit might take a veri long  e  you might move the price against you  wherea in the futur market there   s a lot of liquid and in some way it could be done more easili   now  that   s someth about the trade dynam   but as you point out  if peopl think someth is happen   if one trader think that somebodi els is go to be take deliveri   then they might get on the bandwagon  they might add to their own posit in the hope of get some of those cheaper secur
instead of a schedul close out
yes   now  there were some other dynam this summer that i don   t want to get into have to do with posit limit that the board of trade institut  which affect the situat at one point   but on the whole  yes  if you had intend to close out a posit  you might be more inclin to take deliveri if you observ the larg open interest
anoth point i would make  mr  chairman  is that the contract allow you to make deliveri of ani secur matur between     and    year   the chicago board of trade has a set of adjust factor that are appropri when the yield are at   percent   and if the yield curv were flat at   percent  ani of those secur matur between     and    year would be perfect substitut   so ani small movement in the cash market would immedi mean that you could bring in anoth secur to make deliveri   but yield in that sector are well differ than   percent now  so the cheapest to deliv secur is more distinct  and you can get more movement in the cash market without it spill over to the next secur or the secur after that   so in that sens  the natur arbitrag that the basket of deliver secur is suppos to provid is not work as well  becaus the adjust factor by which   the settlement price is multipli are out of kilter with the prevail level of yield
yes   i   m rather fascin by the open interest be higher  as you get close to the end of the contract  than the total stock of the issu   that   s the counterpart of what use to be the old corn squeez   the same guy are do it
right   and they use to trade may main potato futur when there were no potato in main in may    laughter
they did that all the  e    laughter
is this what the treasuri is look at   or is it someth els that the treasuri has it task forc studi
well  the treasuri did issu a larg posit report request last week for this particular secur   so  those with larg posit will have to report that by a particular date     it   s some  this week
so they are look at this situat
i know that they   re concern about the situat  and there was certain a signal effect perceiv by the market when the treasuri issu that request for larg posit report   we saw some decay acceler right after that request  so perhap some of the long took that as a signal that they should reduc their posit
further question   if not  would someon like to move the ratif of the transact by the desk
without object  they are approv   we now move on to the econom situat      son and
thank you  mr  chairman   spot price for crude oil were especi volatil over the intermeet period  as uncertainti about the consequ of possibl hurrican damag  along with other risk  drove up price befor katrina hit the gulf shore and as evolv expect of the near  and medium term implic of the storm damag induc fluctuat in the week follow katrina   in the last few day  concern about tropic storm rita have been ad to the mix   as has been our practic  we again reli on the futur market to sort through the uncertainti about crude oil suppli and demand over the forecast period  and our project of wti  west texa intermedi  price through the end of      is drawn from the futur curv as of septemb      the complex of katrina= effect on energi price are such  howev  that specifi the wti price still left unansw a number of question about relat price and quantiti  both for the global outlook and for the u s  economi   with normal u s  refin capac onli account for rough    percent of u s  demand  and with four refineri in the region still close  we have project a partial substitut of refin product for crude in u s  oil import in the near term   in addit  with global refineri oper alreadi about at capac  at least in term of refineri capabl of produc product that meet u s  specif  there is no scope for u s  demand to draw upon global suppli without have an impact on price   as a consequ  price for refin product abroad  particular for gasolin  have risen   we have assum that all of the refineri will be oper by the begin of           u s  crude oil product in the gulf remain at about    percent of the level befor hurrican katrina  with some of this reduct offset by releas from the strateg petroleum reserv   we expect that repair to the damag facil will occur over  e and have incorpor into the forecast a gradual recoveri that is complet earli next year   consequ  we have bump up our project for crude oil import in the first quarter to account for the transitori shortfal   the net effect of these develop is that we have rais our project price for spot wti oil by       per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and by       per barrel next year   howev  in the near term we have rais our project for the u s  oil import price by more        per barrel in the fourth quarter and just below    per barrel in the follow quarter  to reflect the chang in mix toward import of refin product and the rise in product price as well as crude price   the net result is a forecast for the oil import bill that is notabl higher in the near term  but is less so by the end of next year   other element of the extern forecast that were affect by hurrican katrina includ the shipment of non oil good into and out of the unit state through the region= port facil   the immedi percentag impact on export is judg to be a bit larger than that on non oil import  as import have greater flexibl to be divert to other port   the port facil are reopen quick  and these effect  particular on a net basi  should be small   in addit  the current account balanc will be posit chang by receipt by u s  insur firm of payment owe to reinsur abroad and  to a lesser extent  by aid contribut from other countri to the u s  economi   these item will appear as transfer receipt in the nontrad portion of the current account   on balanc  this rang of impact from katrina is  expect to be transitori and of limit magnitud   the outlook for foreign growth and inflat is  of cours  also influenc by the chang in our forecast for global energi price and by the chang project for the u s  economi   in the near term  these two factor work in the same direct to lessen foreign growth   over a longer horizon  with u s  growth project to rebound next year  they are part offset   upward pressur on inflat from energi price is a grow concern of central bank and offici abroad   the event of hurrican katrina reinforc the trend toward elev oil price that has been unfold over the past few year   in some foreign countri  particular emerg market economi  offici have control domest energi price to blunt the effect of higher global price   as elev oil price have continu  foreign offici have start to remov or lessen these subsidi  with consequ effect on inflat pressur     will continu our present
in adjust our forecast of the u s  economi to incorpor the consequ of hurrican katrina  we were forc to reli more on econom judgment and assumpt than our model   perhap that is just as well  given what i heard last month in jackson hole   at various turn  the staff was critic for    build model that bear no resembl to econom realiti and prais   or at least i think it was prais   for then have the good sens to essenti ignor those model through the wise use of add factor   that mix messag remind me of a stori told by nobel laureat ken arrow   dure world war ii  arrow was assign to a team of statistician to produc long rang weather forecast   after a  e  arrow and his team determin that their forecast were not much better than pull predict out of a hat   they wrote their superior  ask to be reliev of the duti   they receiv the follow repli  and i quot    the command general is well awar that the forecast are no good  howev  he need them for plan purpos       laughter   i   ll have to admit that we face more than the usual challeng in the period ahead   over the next few month  i suspect that we will encount consider difficulti extract the macroeconom signal from econom data that could be profound  affect by the consequ of this disast   but as we set ourselv to that task  it will be import not to lose sight of the fact that the larger influenc of monetari and fiscal polici  financi condit  and global energi develop  rather than the hurrican  are like to domin the macroeconom outcom a year henc    in that regard  while it might seem like ancient histori and a world away  most of  the macro data that we receiv sinc the august  book provid a window on how these forc were shape econom develop prior to katrina   in brief  we saw the balanc of the incom inform as broad consist with our view that the economi had been grow at a brisk pace earli in the second half   in particular  the household sector seem especi buoyant   sale of motor  vehicl were receiv a consider boost from the employe discount program  and last week   s retail sale report for august suggest consum spend exclud motor vehicl had been well maintain   meanwhil  hous activ remain strong  with both start and sale hold near histor high   i should mention that this morn   s releas show hous start in august remain abov   million unit at an annual rate   close to our expect   even the extern sector  appear pois to make a contribut to current quarter growth  rather than be the drag we had earlier anticip    but there were some disappoint as well  most focus in the busi  sector   growth of factori output has slow notic  with manufactur ip  industri product  have averag increas of     percent in recent month    half the pace seen late last year   we have interpret that deceler as reflect effort by firm to bring inventori into better align with sale  and we expect some pickup in activ as this process play out   but as yet  we have few hard data to suggest a mark improv is close at hand       the incom inform on new order and shipment for nondefens capit good also has been on the soft side of our expect   spend on comput look to be on track for a    percent increas in the current quarter  a relat modest gain for this compon and well below our previous project   and outlay for capit good outsid of the tech area have been about flat sinc the turn of the year   as you may recal  equip invest was surpris strong in the second half of last year  and we may now be experienc some payback for the earlier strength   it is also possibl  howev  that higher oil price could be damp busi confid  rais uncertainti about the outlook and make firm more reluct to invest   and  of cours  we can   t rule out the possibl that the recent weak in equip spend reflect a dearth of profit invest opportun  which would rais question about the under thrust of aggreg demand go forward   for now  we think it is too earli to reach that conclus  but the recent soft here certain rais that risk   put these pluse and minus togeth  we thought the economi was on track  for growth in the vicin of   percent in the second half of this year   we were encourag in that interpret by the ongo improv in labor market  gain in privat payrol had averag about         in recent month  and with the read on initi claim remain in the low        s  a continu of those increas seem like   look a littl further down the road  there had been the usual crosscurr in  the key factor influenc the contour of our forecast   oil price continu to rise  siphon off even more purchas power from household   but  we were surpris yet again by the strength in hous price  with the ofheo  offic of feder    hous enterpris oversight  repeat transact index up about    percent in the    year end the second quarter   the associ upward revis to hous wealth more than offset a slight weaker stock market to boost overal household net worth over the project period   all in all  it seem like that  absent the hurrican  we would have been present to you a forecast that was veri similar to that in the august  book   it is  of cours  an understat to say that katrina creat complic for  our forecast   some that we have confront in the past and some that are uniqu to this episod   there has been a sizabl destruct of the capit stock  we have assum that loss to be about     billion  but at this point ani es  must be consid a guess subject to substanti revis   there has been an unpreced displac of peopl and activ from the gulf coast region   import link in the nation   s transport network have been disrupt   and of perhap greatest concern from a macroeconom perspect  the economi has been subject to a further energi price shock at a  e when household and busi alreadi were have to cope with the effect of near two year of steadili climb price       as we note in the  book  our assess is that  with a few wrinkl  the influenc of katrina on econom activ will trace out a pattern similar to that we have seen after previous disast   output will be depress in the near term by the disrupt to product in the region and elsewher   as those disrupt eas  activ begin to recov   and then onc rebuild effort realli get under way  output receiv a consider boost   in realiti  aspect of all three of these phase oper simultan   but with differ intens as  e pass   in that regard  one can   t fail to be impress with how rapid some aspect of the  recoveri process alreadi are occur   in mani case  fa  than was initi expect   some evacue are find employ elsewher  mani firm are either temporarili or perman reloc offic and employe  and workaround are be found for some of the transport bottleneck that have develop   still  there is no deni that the disrupt remain substanti   about    percent  of total u s  oil product and   percent of u s  natur gas output remain shut in at facil locat in the gulf   as   note  four refineri are still off line and full recoveri may not occur for sever more month   activ in the chemic  shipbuild  and food process industri   to name just a few   remain serious impair   more broad  busi has been disrupt throughout the region   and while mani busi have been effect in develop workaround  these adjust are often less effici and more expens than befor   in our forecast  we have assum that these disrupt pull down the level of  activ in the third and fourth quarter  lop more than    percentag point off the annual growth of real gdp in the second half of this year   accompani this hit to growth  payrol employ is expect to drop         in septemb   a shortfal of about         relat to trend   employ is then expect to stage a gradual recoveri in subsequ month   although rebuild activ are alreadi under way  those activ don   t realli show through with ani macroeconom forc until earli next year   in that regard  the drain and environment cleanup of new orlean will slow the rebuild phase compar with past hurrican recoveri    the dynam of the recoveri process will be influenc import by the  respons of the feder govern   we have assum an     billion fiscal packag  about     billion of which is spent over the next two year   this spend is project to provid a power counterbal to the depress effect of katrina and is a chief reason whi activ is project to approach the pre hurrican baselin  by the middl of next year   our assum feder spend packag might seem small compar with the       billion figur that has gain such attent in recent day   howev  we think our    packag is appropri scale to our es  of the extent of the damag that has occur and the dimens of the econom disrupt   even with that scale  i should note that we have the feder govern foot the bill for a vast larger share of the loss than is typic   near dollar for dollar in our forecast relat to the    percent reimburs rate that is more the norm    one obvious risk that you confront is that the hurrican  view from a  macroeconom perspect  could prove less disrupt to activ and that a massiv dose of fiscal s ulus is about to be layer on top of an economi that was alreadi near it product limit   in those circumst  there is the potenti for some  overshoot in output with accompani upward pressur on inflat   but katrina has amplifi some of the downsid risk to the outlook as well   prior to the storm  we were alreadi concern about the cumul effect of the rise in energi price over the past two year   as we note in our brief ye day  there is at least some evid that sharp jump in the price of oil have at  e in the past been associ with outsiz effect on consumpt   with the retail price of gasolin have risen abov       per gallon in much of the countri  there is certain caus to be concern   as a macro guy  i hope that those of you involv in supervis haven   t been too hard on home equiti lend  becaus pretti soon peopl are go to need a loan to fill up their suv    laughter   moreov  the price of gasolin is not the onli drain on consum budget   household will face anoth hurdl this winter when the bill for heat oil and natur gas come due   so this sourc of downsid risk seem like to be with us for some  e   for now  there simpli isn   t much hard evid to suggest ani nonlinear respons  is gain traction   as i note earlier  consum spend has continu to surpris us to the upsid   although last friday   s report on sen ent show a substanti deterior  that drop close match our expect   the forecast is predic on a gradual recoveri in sen ent by the end of the year   if that were not to occur  we would becom more concern about a greater retrench in consum spend   of cours  the cumul effect of higher energi price also pose some   nonlinear risk to the inflat outlook   three channel  not entir independ of each other  would seem to be of greatest concern  a broad base breakout to the upsid in inflat expect  an intensifi push on the part of worker to restor real wage for the ground lost to higher energi price  and an effort by busi to more aggress repair damag that may have occur to profit margin from  rise energi cost    if one were inclin to worri about the potenti for a more pronounc  deterior in inflat expect  last friday   s preliminari read from the michigan survey for septemb might be unsettl   median year ahead inflat    expect move up to     percent  the highest level sinc       while expect for the next   to    year edg up to     percent  just abov the narrow rang in which they have held over the past sever year   howev  we suspect that the enorm increas in gasolin price that took place over the first half of the month was a contributor to this develop  and we would counsel wait for a few more read befor conclud that there has been a consequenti deterior in inflat expect   that view receiv some support from tip  treasuri inflat protect secur  base measur of inflat compens  which have also increas  but by much less than the survey read    we also don   t see much evid that we are on the verg of a substanti  acceler in labor compens motiv by effort of worker to restor real wage   abstract from the surg late last year that we believ was relat  in part  to stock option exercis and bonus  the growth of hour labor compens has been reason stabl over the past few year   and while the labor market has tighten up  we don   t hear much from our busi contact to suggest that the competit environ has chang in a way that would have alter their abil or  inclin to grant substanti larger pay increas in the period ahead    final  there is a concern that the steep rise in energi cost has place the  margin of some busi under pressur and that effort to restor margin could result in more upward price pressur than is current anticip in the forecast   to be sure  there is consider heterogen across industri   howev  as best we can judg  in the aggreg  the margin of nonfinanci non energi produc corpor have reach high level over the past coupl of year despit pressur from energi cost   henc  busi either have been reason success in pass through higher energi cost or have implement other offset effici   look forward  we think that we have made adequ allow for further pass through of higher energi price  but we acknowledg that there are consider uncertainti about the magnitud of that effect    much like the data on real activ  the incom inform on the price side provid littl evid of an emerg nonlinear respons to higher energi price  inde  the recent figur on core inflat have been both well behav and to the low side of our expect   on the basi of last week   s cpi  we es  that core pce price were up     percent in august and are on track for an increas of around    to     percent at an annual rate in the third quarter   moreov  price of core intermedi materi have actual been fall over the past four month after the steep run up experienc last year   we are anticip some acceler in core consum price and in core intermedi price in the month immedi ahead  owe to the end of the auto incent program and the pass through of higher energi price   but we have built these effect into the forecast use our usual linear model as guid  rather than incorpor ani outsiz effect         while we do not believ that we have yet experienc nonlinear effect on either output or inflat  ani further upward movement in energi price would certain intensifi the risk of such outcom   with anoth storm move toward the gulf  we will be watch the weather channel close in the next few day    befor close  i would like to draw your attent to some substanti chang in both the content and format of the  book   s   sheet that we implement this round   as far as we can determin  this is the most signific chang in the forecast present in a few decad   we recogn that we may have impos some transit cost on those of you who were use to the previous format   but our object was to make the present more user friend and to make the forecast and how it has chang between round more transpar to you and your staff  obvious  we are open to suggest for further improv and  if past is prologu  we should be abl to work them into the  book at some point in the  next few decad    laughter       and i will be happi to take your question
question   presid
yes   i want to ask you about the effect of hurrican katrina on output and potenti output   you read off a list of effect   obvious  there has been some destruct of capit stock   worker have been displac  there has been a break in relationship between them and their employ  and obvious there will be some sort of search process to reconnect them with the labor market   and then there are the transport disrupt   those all seem to me like factor that affect product capac  and i would have expect them to appear as chang in potenti output   so i   m curious as to whi output chang by more than potenti
the part that we actual incorpor into our es  of potenti output was the destruct of the capit stock   the     billion drop there   that is just such a tini fraction compar to the overal size of the capit stock that  in fact  it round to a tenth on the capit intens contribut but round to not even a tenth on overal potenti gdp   so  we built that part in      now  it is true that what we are go to be experienc in the next few month will have combin of demand and suppli effect  and we didn   t build the temporari disrupt in the suppli chain into our es  of potenti gdp   we could have   you   re right  in some  sens that is a temporari reduct in suppli   so we wouldn   t necessarili tell you to take the output gap es  in the second half serious in term of the notion that a lot more slack has open up in the economi   on the labor market side  we actual did think hard about whether or not this event would be signific enough to rais structur unemploy   again  our best guess is that while a littl of that may be go on  it isn   t larg enough to round to even a tenth on overal structur unemploy   if all those peopl we think have been displac becam structur unemploy  that would be an increas of a coupl of tenth in structur unemploy   but  in fact  we expect that by earli next year that will not be a signific factor push up the natur rate of unemploy   so i think we   ve tri to contend with those issu   as a matter of present  we did build some of the thing you rais   for exampl  the transport bottleneck   into our es  of potenti output
well  the reason i ask has to do with high frequenc movement   you use the word    structur    there  which tend to be associ with slowli move trend    variabl with bar over them or that kind of thing   and in an instanc like this  i think a key factor is the extent to which some high frequenc or rapid chang in product capac may have taken place   so  i question sort of let it all be in the output gap and then say     well  in two quarter the output gap will be back to where it was      given the way the output gap appear in theoret model that we use to teach peopl how to think about polici  this would    invit them to think about polici in the current period differ than if the empir es  had potenti chang fair sharpli along with output in the current period   that   s the reason i ask
obvious  in term of the transmiss of that output gap in think about inflat  our phillip curv in essenc is so flat and that slight higher output gap is so briefli encapsul in the forecast that it  sn   t realli have ani notic effect   but we did think about how we should communic the consequ of the suppli disrupt in potenti output   and again  we just decid on reflect that we would incorpor the part that was the capit stock destruct but not necessarili other suppli disrupt that are admit go to be occur in the next few month
i want to ask you a question about inflat expect  which is a key part of the forecast  as you describ   in the  book  you say that you assum    surg energi cost and other factor have caus inflat expect to drift up sinc           and then you have the altern scenario in which inflat expect deterior more sharpli  than in the baselin forecast   could you just elabor on this a bit   what are the other factor  and what   s the  e horizon you   re talk about for these expect to play out   also  how    this work it way into the wage and price dynam in the economi
in term of how the price forecast has evolv over the last coupl of year  the singl biggest factor is the higher energi price   but we   ve also had to contend with an acceler   of modest dimens  but an acceler   in import price and an increas in other materi price   so  in term of decompos the sourc of revis to our core consum    price inflat number  those are the main contributor   beyond that  we haven   t realli seen ani other innov on the cost structur on the side of busi that we think have lift core price    but in our view  the persist of higher headlin and core inflat over the last few year will caus   and we do think there has been a littl bit of evid   some small  deterior in inflat expect  and we have built that into our forecast   the way that show up  as i think you were hint  come through some prospect acceler in nomin hour labor compens   we haven   t seen it yet to ani signific degre   but in our forecast we think there will be some indirect effect work through higher labor cost go forward  as for the  e dimens over which that will occur  we think that process is probabl under way   there may be some evid of it in the tip base measur that dino cite  and the survey evid suggest that the process may now be begin   we   re start to see a  small but gradual eros in inflat expect  and that persist through our forecast horizon  now  look farther out  with energi price project to start declin and headlin inflat come down from the   plus percent area to more like   percent go forward  we would expect that process to revers a bit in the period beyond the current forecast horizon   so those  inflat pressur probabl will diminish a littl at that point
so you have core inflat actual go up next year  in       and then it come down a bit in
core pce goe up to    percent next year and then come back down to   percent  as the indirect effect of lower energi price begin to work through   and    then we   d probabl see some benefici effect in allevi inflat concern   this would be beyond the forecast period   which would help push inflat down a bit further
i know we use the various measur of inflat expect as a critic variabl  which presuppos that the market has a superior capabl of anticip chang than normal forecast procedur   the mechan  as you point out  through which we think inflat expect larg reflect themselv in higher price is the wage bargain process   have we done much work in the area of use various measur of  inflat expect direct as a forecast indic of inflat by just creat a reduc form evalu   what is the record on that  if we in fact have look at that
surpris  or at least surpris to me  the michigan survey has had a reason decent record over mani year   better than you might think
do you mean on their long term inflat forecast
well  on the year ahead inflat forecast   the longer term forecast actual has not been around long enough to develop a lot of observ on that   the evid is mix when you more or less throw all of the determin of inflat into an equat   in fact  it   s a matter of some controversi among the research on the staff as to whether or not the michigan survey has ani addit explanatori valu   but i recogn that you were just refer to the straightforward inflat
no   i wasn   t refer to onli the michigan survey  but to  all of the various measur we have of inflat expect  includ basic just the level of interest rate as such   what i   m tri to get at is that we make presumpt about the insight    of market into the futur that none of us person has   i   m rais the question  is there realli inform there   in other word  can we take the level of inflat expect  howev defin  as of today and read into it with some degre of accuraci what the actual inflat outlook is like to be
our index secur market have not been around long enough to develop a realli signific track record   i think the evid on the index secur from  other countri is that there is inform content in those expect  but i don   t know what their general track record has been
yes   they have been around the longest in the unit kingdom and in the earli year index secur were veri clear held in respons to the tax incent   so there was a certain disconnect  there wasn   t a notion that peopl who view those expect as differ from their own would trade and the market would settl into reflect their expect on the margin  i   m not awar that peopl general view that as a solid predictor  but i would say that we probabl should look into that more   we haven   t done our own independ work on that
there are two aspect of the tip market that make it hard to do such comparison use those secur   the first is that we think there were signific liquid effect  as in the unit kingdom  earli on   our es  of the liquid premium have come down a lot   that is  tip were a real bargain in the first two or three year of trade  and it is onli now that they probabl more close reflect the macro environ   the second thing is that what we measur is inflat compens  and inflat  compens is inflat expect plus an inflat risk premium   and the inflat risk    premium could vari over  e   inde  our model would think that part of the reduct in long term rate has been a reduct in the inflat risk premium   so that   s anoth reason whi it would be hard to read those as predictor of futur inflat
sever year ago i recal that we ran a correl with the gold price against level of inflat   we actual came out with some forecast capabl  has that been rerun in recent year
not by us  mr      not by me   i think we did that at your request    laughter   and we were not so convinc by the evid that we   ve maintain that particular seri for  forecast
i think you actual altern your request   ask each one of us in turn   and we haven   t updat that in a long  e
the problem is that it kept come out  for reason i can   t understand  with some inform capabl   the reason i rais it  as you know  is that we have a big  fat spike here  and i don   t know what to make of it
yes  a    year high   i volunt to run the gold price    laughter
provid that you don   t tell anybodi you   re do it
two point   a comment and a question   i   m actual somewhat surpris at the answer you got on your last question  mr  chairman  becaus staff member from both r s  research and statist  and monetari affair did a seri of memo for me on    just this question  and i talk about the result at the last meet   we found  in term of root mean squar predict error  that the staff forecast seem to be the best forecast of one year   ahead inflat   but in the last four or five year  tri to control as best our staff could for some of the liquid effect and risk premium effect that   talk about  our find was that tip compens turn out to be a somewhat better predictor even than the staff model  the other forecast turn out to be much wors than either of the two i just talk about   so i think we don   t know a lot  but we know a littl bit   mayb we could get that materi circul  again  my question  though  is not on that point   dave  you threw me off a bit on the question of where we now stand on compens becaus in the  book you said that the downward revis in the p c  product and cost  measur of compens per hour was smaller than expect and     we now view more of the surg in      fourth quarter compens as have been perman and less as a reflect of transitori factor such as stock option      i thought what i heard you say in your oral present was that the pendulum had swung back a littl
inde  we did not get as much downward revis as we were  expect and  in essenc  we built into this forecast more persist to the level of compens   but the growth rate of compens as we move into this year still look like a big spike  and the growth rate go forward hasn   t been that much higher   so  i would say that  obvious we were not as op ist as we were last  e around   we had to give that some weight  but we didn   t necessarili see those data alon as signal an ongo acceler in labor compens   the two other piec of evid we bring to bear on that are the eci  employ cost index   which has shown no acceler  and averag hour earn  which    also have not shown ani addit pickup   so that suggest to us that we   re probabl on the right track with regard to the sourc of the surg late last year   speak more broad about overal labor cost pressur  we   re still not interpret the current situat as one of ongo sharp acceler but rather just a reflect of a higher level last year
great   thank you
i think the eci is a veri interest issu   each march  as i recal  we get data on actual dollar amount of compens of the various type that are in the eci   and i believ we use to take the march data year on year and tri to determin what part of the eci was a mix chang  in view of the quit extraordinari diverg of the eci and the compens per hour data  have we look at those march data recent to see whether the aggreg dollar compens per hour number that they pick up for the month of march  which is conceptu consist with the eci  move with aggreg compens per hour that we pick up from the p c measur or other
i don   t recal whether the eci data  when we look at it this spring  actual resolv the tension between the various measur       indic that it did not   okay   so we have look at that  but
it is conceiv  for exampl  that the march compens data in this seri actual show the same pattern as the total  which would impli a veri signific intern shift chang   and that would be a fulli comprehens explan becaus in the past they have not been all that close
well  when we look at it  that didn   t in fact resolv the tension between them
so we didn   t learn anyth from there   presid
mr  chairman  i have two question   one is to   with regard to the energi futur market   have we seen ani chang in the dynam of those market dure the trade activ   higher number of contract or size chang   from what we saw pre katrina
i have not look at that enough in the last few day to give you an answer to your question   there have been  obvious  over the past year or more  period of  e in which the natur of trade in the energi futur market seem to be evolv   inde  energi futur came to be thought of as an asset class for which hedg fund and invest bank would open up depart and would trade aggress   it was a profit center  so whi not   i don   t know that that has end  but some of the other instanc about which peopl were most concern die down and i think the number of contract that were thought to be noncommerci would ebb and flow as  e went by   the fact that the price came back down help becaus there was a  e when it look somewhat like the japanes stock market in the late     s   it was just about a sure bet that if you could buy some of the stuff  you would make money   and that went away as the price develop some two way fluctuat and so forth  but to be honest  i don   t have the inform to give you about whether post katrina we have seen a real chang   it was certain startl how quick the price move ye day when it becam clear that rita was go to cross into the gulf   that volatil may reflect more trader of differ background act more quick   i wouldn   t interpret that as indic that    somehow those movement are superfici   i think there is a genuin increas in the extent to which peopl believ the global suppli of energi is vulner to random event and has veri littl buffer capac in it   those thing  i think  are real  whether on a given piec of news the trade is most done by hedg fund or is most done by peopl who have a genuin need to hedg in the commerci sens  i don   t think we know   but there is a chang in tone   peopl feel that the suppli capabl both at the refineri level and at the extract level is not there to meet the project demand and that we   re go to be on a bit of a knife   s edg   and they believ that develop on the polit side in russia or in venezuela could easili tip the balanc   i think that is for real
the reason i   m curious about this is becaus i think we have been struggl with tri to determin what the specul element is in those market   clear  those who did specul for whatev reason on an event  such as the one you just mention  have been reward   but some  the complexion of those peopl who then enter the market chang  the smart one get out when they   ve been reward and they   re replac by what we use to call the mullet who swim in smaller contract   i   d just be curious to see what the chang  in the dynam is  if inde a chang is take place at all   the other question   excus me
we do know someth   we know that subsequ to katrina the noncommerci interest are net long and the commerci interest have turn net short
that in a sens give you some specul suppress becaus they   re alreadi out   and the question is the big surg which  as you know quit well     occur when somebodi is short and they cover it and they go long   current they   re alreadi long   so it may be that part of the pressur is out of this market  although the market behavior ye day had a tone of    we   ve been burn onc  we   re not go to be burn twice      it   s correct in part today  but i   ve never seen a respons that quick on someth that could be quit specul   there   s a reason good chanc that rita won   t turn into a categori   hurrican  or if it   that it will end up in northern mexico   it   s realli quit surpris the way that market function
again  as we talk about a coupl of week ago  the point is the volatil   not so much the direct   and ye day reinforc that concern   i   m just tri to get a sens of these dynam
today the gasolin price i last saw on the spot market  after be up over    cent ye day  was down    cent   today it   s fair stabl
my other question is about the     billion fiscal s ulus assumpt   is that base on ration expect of  say  the women and men who sit around this tabl   or is it base on some sound of the politician on capitol hill   what is the sourc of the     billion figur
i think it was a littl bit of both   as i indic  the scale of that  packag we thought would be suffici in some sens  given our es  of the amount of damag that has occur  to provid both the wherewith to fund substanti amount of the rebuild and to provid signific offset for incom loss that were associ with the disrupt     the      million figur which  as i mention in my brief  has gotten so much attent recent actual came into play after we close the  book   but even if that had come up befor  i don   t think we necessarili would have alter our project signific  our read of that is that if the figur come in that high  it   s more like to be becaus it includ the fund of some veri long rang and expens construct project around new orlean   for exampl  the signific strengthen of the leve to a categori   level of  protect   that spend would occur outsid the window of the current forecast project  but obvious there are risk  and if i had to be honest  i   d say the risk are probabl more to the upsid of the figur that we have built into this forecast than the downsid  given the current polit climat in which the general attitud seem to be    we   ll spend whatev it take to make this happen      we illustr a littl bit of that in an altern simul that we show in the  book in which the disrupt effect are relat small and you get a much bigger fiscal s ulus   the result associ with that are a drop in the unemploy rate to  below what we would think of as the natur rate and a bit higher inflat pressur
thank you  mr  chairman
do we know anyth about the remain capac   or perhap i should say  the will and capac   of those other countri that have substanti stock of refin product to releas them to us if we had anoth signific suppli shock that affect refin product capac
well  i can   t specul on how the domest polit of this would play out in some of those countri   the iea  intern energi agenc  author the sale of       million barrel from the strateg reserv of it member      million from us and    million from the other   most of what we were go to releas from the strateg petroleum reserv was crude  that   s all we store   and in the bid that took place for that oil  as of two or three day ago     was the number of bid that were accept  not      so there   s some question in the mind of our staff expert on this about whether that mean a second round and a third round will be done to eventu work up to the    million   or is the think that mayb they don   t need to do all    million   of the    million that is to be done from non u s  stock  much of that will be product rather than crude oil  and much of it will simpli be sold into the market   the global market for gasolin just need more suppli   it   s not a question of their target it necessarili toward us  so  i think what we   re see is that they have the oil and they have the product   they could do more than what they   ve done  but what they   ve done so far has not stabil the price  and there is polit resist in europ   now  i think that   s a bit naiv in a sens   if they don   t releas more  presum the price would go even higher  right   the market is never go to be fragment  and they   re alway go to feel the effect of our attempt to buy more gasolin   but there   s the interplay of domest use versus sell it into the market and there   s pressur  particular in europ  regard their gasolin tax   and this is where i think the essenc of the fight is be wage right now   most peopl who are argu about the long run interest of ration energi polici in the eu  european union  commiss and anybodi who is a bit abov the polit is say     whatev you do  don   t cut the gasolin tax      but some of the actual govern who face the elector a bit more direct have cave alreadi   other of them are go to postpon plan increas   some of them are waver     if they go the rout of tri to protect their domest popul by temporarili lower tax and so forth  my guess is that they won   t be put the gasolin into a distribut that would appear to be bail out the american at the expens of the french farmer   that isn   t go to happen   they will tri to protect their stock and they will tri to segment the market   so i wouldn   t count on that as a big sourc of transitori relief on price pressur   more than we have alreadi seen   becaus i think the polit of it is get veri complic
i want to talk a littl bit about how the board   s model incorpor higher oil price on output produc elsewher and import into the unit state  is it just through import price alon  the reason i ask is that we   ve spent a lot of  e talk about the fact that higher energi cost haven   t realli impact us as much as other countri   we   ve given two reason for it  one is that we   re more energi effici   the second is that the output we produc is less energi intens   presum  our actual consumpt hasn   t shift as much as our product  which mean that more of the energi intens output is be produc extern and ship into the unit state   now  that would presum mean that energi intens good would have  higher price becaus of the global price of oil  and import price would go up to a greater extent than befor becaus of the shift in mix   yet the forecast has import price fall   how   that all work it way through   what   s that dynam
well  regrett it   s not     s problem   it   s mine    laughter
mayb we   ll get two answer
let me take it in two halv   i   ll talk a littl about global energi use  and then we   ll come to the import price part   we model energi demand  energi consumpt  energi product  and the impli chang in inventori on a global basi   and we do it use all of the inform we can mu   but it is understood by the peopl in that world that there is a lack of good inform   there has been an outcri for more transpar about energi product and energi capac than now  exist   some of the volatil that presid   was speak to deriv from the fact that when the iea make an announc of a chang in their es  of what demand was last year it will move the market   so  the qualiti of the inform that is avail for the global market is certain far from ideal   and some of the countri involv  of cours  are in rather troubl polit area where be transpar about anyth is not in their interest  so they don   t provid data   so that add to the complex  but we have an oil model and we use a lot of judgment   the add factor that   was talk about   and we attempt to account for total oil product in essenc by countri   it   s not that we think ani individu number in that mix is go to be right in ani sens  but we tri to be  consist through the stori   so we start with the futur curv for wti  and we make some judgment about the spread on thing like dubai and other oil that loom larg in the global market  and we use the model to infer what the balanc of suppli and demand would have to be  and given that we have reli on the futur market   basic for want of a view that we could do better than the futur market   suppli becom the residu   so we have forecast of global demand of gdp   and we have differ weight that appli to those that are the oil use  weight as oppos to the trade weight or the gdp weight that we might use other place     now  part of your question was how often we chang those weight and how sensit we are to the shift in product that are take place in the world   i can   t speak to that specif  but in general we revis our weight everi year   it   s not as if we have weight from      and we just keep crank away use those weight   we   ve gone to this variabl weight approach as in the gdp and everyth els   so  we specif do at least attempt to take account of how differ countri use energi versus how other thing happen   we have a set of energi use weight that we appli to world gdp  and that give us  in essenc  a differ aggreg for world growth than if we were do it for some other purpos  which we do  so we   ve got a price and we   ve got demand  and we back out suppli  suppli becom the residu   for exampl  two year ago when price seem to us to be rather high  we were infer a need for suppli to pull back in order to sustain those price   and opec has play that role   saudi arabia  in particular   go back and read  book from two to three year ago  and we had a stori about expect suppli to contract in certain place in order for futur curv price to be realiz  as oil supplier target price  and so forth  that has not been so true late   inde  we   ve been tap capac increas over the last two year   and the notion that global suppli was more than enough to explain the price we were see has flip to becom a question of where we are go to get the extra suppli  for a  e russia and the fsu  former soviet union  were a big sourc of extra non opec suppli   that seem to have chang more recent   so  there is a suppli stori that tri to take these thing into account that match demand and the futur curv to give a crude oil pictur  and it has to account for enough barrel to make that true   if we were to run into a real    contradict there  we would have to go back and say someth to ourselv about our assess of demand  we take that pictur  and for the unit state   particular this  e more so than most   we have to ask question about domest capac to suppli the residu part   would that have to be import   and what would be the mix of those import   so we tri to make all of that fit   that leav us then with an oil import price which can move differ than global crude price becaus of the mix factor   and the oil import price is what feed into the domest economi and then drive the element of pass through and domest product and so forth  now  in our forecast of import price the oil price portion is distinct from the non oil  portion  and it is non oil import price that in the project come down   those price have been kick around huge by natur gas and by non oil primari commod   we have now intern  but we don   t put it in the  book  import price less natur gas as a check on whether we are fulli incorpor what we think is happen to natur gas   but we don   t have a compar setup for the suppli and demand balanc of natur gas that we have for oil  and the natur gas that would be relev  obvious  is for north america as an almost isol market   there is liquefi natur gas on the margin   there are some import on the margin  but we are think that we might have to do someth about the quantiti of natur gas becaus it   s a hidden uncertainti in the overal non oil import price  and it   s uncomfort that we haven   t been abl to have a better control over that  even so  the non oil  non energi primari commod have been the big stori in import price  they caus the import price to move up   and the fact that those futur market are tell us that those price have peak or are even come down is what lie behind our forecast    that import price are deceler yet again   and to veri low level in      and into        that outlook is realli a combin of what we think the non energi futur market are tell us about commod price and the maintain assumpt we make about the dollar   either of those thing could chang  and the forecast is complet condit on them  with the ad wrinkl of this role of natur gas that is embed in non oil import price  but which probabl should be separ out   now  at least in term of the work we do  we tri to do that partial but mayb we should do it more explicit
other question   if not  who would like to start  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   overal  the fundament in the seventh district continu to improv  although we are still underperform the nation economi   prior to katrina  most of our contact thought that their busi were expand at rate consist with the long run trend in their industri   one except was the motor vehicl sector   the size of the drop in sale in august was a disappoint to automak  but not a surpris   they also complain about the effect of gasolin price on demand  particular the shift in sale away from big suv toward more fuel effici but less profit model  when we ask our contact about the impact of hurrican katrina  they report sever differ kind of effect   some note increas activ in respons to the storm   a number of firm in our district receiv order for item such as rvs  construct materi  heavi equip  and applianc   and ford said that they were look at increas their fourth quarter product schedul to replac vehicl destroy by the hurrican   but we also heard some concern that katrina was depress demand   for instanc  two of our nation retail    contact note some declin in activ  which they attribut to higher energi price  uncertainti  and a cnn effect   high  and low end store were report to be do okay  but specialti retail were take a hit  katrina also has led to some cost increas in our district   grain elev are pay more to work through transport disrupt and to dri crop in storag   we also heard concern that the divers of resourc to the gulf coast will drive up the cost of construct materi and skill tradesmen throughout the countri   and sever contact note increas in cost for fuel  fertil  and ship   of cours  not all of the cost increas we have been hear about are relat to katrina   inde  a major retail and one of our temporari help contact comment that wage pressur had increas notabl at the nation level  turn to the nation outlook  the data we had in hand prior to hurrican katrina  point to a solid expans in activ   we all know how devast katrina was in term of the miseri it caus the peopl of the gulf coast   nonetheless  although the uncertainti is great  the hurrican   s effect on the nation economi like will be short live   even in the near term  the  book baselin project  sn   t have katrina reduc gdp growth below trend  and certain by earli next year the hurrican should have a net posit effect for growth  given the larg feder spend come on line  with regard to inflat  the juli and august read on core price were good  but even so the  book forecast for core pce inflat next year has been rais to    percent   last  e mani of us were concern that core inflat was run at the upper end of the rang consist with price stabil  and now the outlook has deterior   as discuss in the     book  and as we were talk about earlier  one major reason for this increas in the inflat forecast is the expect pass through of higher energi and distribut cost   anoth import risk is fa  compens growth   both compens per hour and the eci are project to increas signific next year  and this seem consist with the anecdot i note earlier about wage pressur   these pressur are of particular concern at this stage of the cycl becaus we can   t expect continu outsiz gain in product to hold down unit labor cost   some cost increas may be absorb by lower profit margin  but there is a risk that they may show up in higher price as well  with the outlook for inflat alreadi higher  and with so much liquid in the financi system  the cost of excess polici accommod could be signific   so at this point  we should continu to increas rate until they are safe in the neutral zone
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious  our atlanta bank   s attent these past three week has been rivet on hurrican katrina and it aftermath  becaus of both our oper respons in the area affect by the storm and our concern about the welfar of our new orlean staff   in addit  we have been tri to contribut to our collect understand of the polici implic of the storm and it aftermath  let me first take this opportun to thank our colleagu here in washington and at all of the reserv bank for the extraordinari support you have given us over the past three week and for the contribut some of you and mani of your staff member have sent for our new orlean staff relief fund to help some of our most desper employe   also  it   s my understand that we have borrow employe from at least seven other reserv bank to help    us with the process of new orlean check in atlanta   and our si  bank in dalla and st  loui and the cash product offic in san francisco have gone to extraordinari length to help us meet the cash need of the hurrican affect area   fortun  we have account for all but one of our     new orlean staff   our staff member now  amaz  are spread across    state  live with friend and relat and tri to restart their live   it   s not clear at this point when we   ll be abl to restart oper out of the  new orlean offic   we have sort through the various dimens of the impact of the storm and could cite much in the form of detail statist and anecdot evid   that descript  inform has alreadi been share with the board staff and other around the system  so let me use my  e to focus on our view of the most import polici implic of what has happen  in the end  we believ   if past experi is ani guid   that while there will be a hit to output  the natur inclin of peopl to rebuild resid and busi will begin to kick in more quick than one might expect   and this will be support by the inflow of insur payment and the substanti feder aid that the presid has promis  as we have alreadi talk about   we do believ that this will begin sooner in mississippi  which   not have to  contend with the flood that will delay progress in new orlean   in fact  our director from mississippi indic that as earli as last week deal were be done and aggress cleanup and  even some major repair work had alreadi start   from this perspect then  we believ the lost  output  as is the case in the forecast in the  book  will be made up reason quick  my greater concern is on the implic for price from the damag of the area   s infrastructur  which includ oil and gas platform  rail line  intermod transport  bridg     refineri  pipelin  and natur gas process facil   these facil are critic to the product and distribut of energi and energi relat product for the nation as a whole   the damag has alreadi been seen  as oil and natur gas price have spike  and we believ there will be import impact on both headlin and core inflat measur   these will result from  the rippl effect stem main from the suppli shock to the price of oil and gas  refin product  transport  and build materi   in addit  the promis feder spend will help to fuel demand for labor in the area and for construct materi as well as other good and servic that are alreadi in short suppli and will be need for the rebuild   as someon els has alreadi indic  this increas demand will clear add to short term price pressur that will extend beyond the south   how  signific and how long last these price effect will be is still veri uncertain  for exampl  we don   t know how long the suppli problem  particular for natur gas  will last   despit what has been report elsewher  our on the ground sourc state that a larg part of the pipelin system that move oil and gas from the well to process facil has yet to be inspect for damag  so we just can   t yet know how long it will be until normal oper resum   and as   note  this uncertainti may be exacerb by hurrican rita  which is now on a project path that would take it through some of the offshor gas and oil field that were not sever hit by katrina   our own sens is that the implic of the natur gas disrupt and it associ price run up have not been given suffici attent   while natur gas reserv are report to have been in the normal season rang prior to katrina  there is littl  or no capac to make up for the near term shortfal  as could be done with oil     the chairman of my board of director  who head the hold compani of the major electr power compani serv the southeast  told me just ye day that if natur gas price remain as high as futur market suggest  the consum is in for a huge hit in come month  he suggest that not onli will homeown be shock at their bill for natur gas this winter  particular if we have a cold winter  but that electr util rate are in for a big jump  as state regulatori agenc eventu approv the pass through increas in generat cost attribut to high natur gas price   we know that virtual all of the new electr generat facil built in the last coupl of decad were design with natur gas as the prefer fuel   just as higher gasolin price seem to have final hit home with consum  these come jolt from natur gas and electr bill could well show through to inflat expect  in our view  while some of these suppli and price shock will like be transitori  and energi suppli problem should eas a bit as pump capac in refineri come back on line  they will still last for sever month befor revert to level that we think are like to be a bit higher than pre katrina level   these increas energi price will show through mark  most mark in the broad headlin inflat measur   but we also think we will see some signific feed through effect to core price   larg industri user of natur gas  like the build materi compani georgia pacif  whose presid is on our atlanta board  are alreadi feel the huge cost pressur from high natur gas price and have becom more determin than ever to pass on some of those cost   anoth of our director with worldwid respons for dow chemic indic that price for petrochem feeder stock from oil and gas are alreadi up    to    percent and will soon be felt across a wide array of plastic product and industri chemic   anoth director    who run a major truck firm indic that her cost are go through the roof  and fuel surcharg are now the norm   the anecdot inform is that custom are more readili accept these increas cost  which are now be pass on more readili rather than be limit by competit pressur   for these reason  we are not near as sanguin about either the short term or long term implic for price as the  book  put all of this togeth  we believ  as the  book clear lay out  that the economi went into katrina with consider momentum   and look past the next six month or so  we think the hit to near term aggreg growth will be more than offset by the s ulus associ with deploy of privat and public fund to rebuild  the matur of the expans pre katrina was underscor by a report from one of our regular temporari employ agenc contact who report that they are now see shortag in sever market in a number of skill and unskil job   in fact  they have rais wage by       an hour in sever categori   while i think one might make the case today for a paus from our polici path  it is the case that signific monetari accommod is alreadi in place    and we have more fiscal polici support to come in target feder spend for hurrican relief  i am most concern about the pressur on price   while some of this will be short live  i don   t think those higher inflat number will go unnot by either busi or individu   and i think this could begin to caus some deterior in inflat expect  which remain reason well contain until recent   at the same  e  i don   t want us to appear to be overreact to the short term suppli shock to price  that may make it seem that we think we   ve gotten behind the curv   i believ the best way to ensur that expect don   t becom unravel is to continu on our present polici path for a bit longer   i think this mean       as hard as it is for me  come from our area  to say   that we should increas our fed fund target rate by anoth    basi point today and be veri care about the communic that we craft to go with that announc   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the third district economi continu to expand at a moder pace   consum spend for general merchandis has edg up  retail report that back to school shop got off to a slow start in august  but attribut it to except warm weather  which hinder the sale of fall merchandis   auto sale have been brisk  with dealer in the region report continu high rate of sale in august  except for larg suv   employ is rise steadili in the region  albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation   while the region unemploy rate tick up in juli from it second quarter  level  it remain lower than the nation rate  hous market remain strong in the district  with sale continu at a high rate  price appreci continu at a steadi pace  but sever of our contact note that higher price home appear to be take longer to sell now than earlier this year   the nonresidenti market continu to improv  with construct contract up and offic leas activ   the demand for commerci space continu to expand at a slow but steadi pace in philadelphia   although vacanc rate remain high  we have seen posit net absorpt of offic space for seven consecut quarter   rental rate remain steadi  recent manufactur activ in the district has been softer than we saw earlier this year   the index of general activ in the manufactur survey rebound in august but fell again in septemb to a posit      indic virtual flat manufactur activ in the    district this month   the downward trend in our index sinc the begin of the year is echo by a number of the region manufactur index as well as the nation purchas manag    index   there was also a signific drop in the respond    expect about futur activ  there were still more firm expect an increas in activ over the next six month than expect a declin  but the percentag of respond expect a declin doubl in septemb  i should point out  howev  that the survey was taken in the day earli after the katrina event  and that like had someth to do with the larg drop   we   ll have to look forward to the next coupl of month  perhap the most notabl and troubl inform from our latest survey is the signific increas in price index   the price paid index show it strongest increas sinc      and is at it highest level sinc januari   the index for price receiv also move higher  expect about futur price were also consider higher this month  concern about inflat are not limit to our manufactur   while the econom impact of the hurrican has been slight in our district   and our busi contact expect further improv in our region economi   the loss of petroleum product and product in the facil in the gulf of mexico has prompt a sharp rise in inflat concern in mani of our  firm  turn to the nation outlook  as the  book note  incom data on the nation economi pre katrina indic that the expans was continu on a solid foot  with gdp growth slight higher than potenti   labor market continu to improv  with littl or no slack remain   consum continu to spend at a good pace despit elev oil and gasolin    price   while there was some soften in the most recent order and shipment data  this reflect the usual month to month volatil  and busi spend remain healthi  higher energi price were show through to headlin inflat  but so far had littl impact on core inflat   if katrina hadn   t happen  it is my view that a decis to continu our strategi to remov monetari polici accommod would have been relat easi   but katrina did happen   the hurrican is a human tragedi  as was note  and it has chang the near term outlook for the economi   i commend the  book staff for the care discuss and analysi of the potenti effect on both growth and inflat   i acknowledg that there is a wider band of uncertainti around the forecast than there had been   howev  as a baselin forecast  i think the  book has it larg right   certain  katrina will have a substanti impact on the gulf of mexico   s region economi for mani month to come   it also has a potenti wider nation scope than other natur disast   becaus of the disrupt in the energi and ship sector  it will have ramif for the rest of the economi   the destruct of the physic wealth and oil infrastructur and the disrupt in econom activ will temporarili reduc the growth of the nation economi and add to inflat over the near term   month data over the next coupl of month are go to be weaker than we   d like to see  and our headlin inflat number are go to be higher than we would like   but these effect are like temporari   the cleanup has alreadi begun  as was note  and rebuild effort fund by public and privat spend will add to baselin growth in the fourth quarter and into next year      as the energi infrastructur is rebuilt and the energi market stabil  much of the run up of inflat should revers as well   of cours  a longer run negat impact is not out of the realm of possibl  but i think we will see a revers of the sharp run up in oil and gasolin price after the hurrican season   that  along with the good econom prospect  the good progress go forward to get the oil and refineri capac back on line  and the improv in government respons after a troublesom begin will all help mitig these longer run impact   the relev polici option for us to consid at this point are whether to continu remov polici accommod or to take a paus   i would argu that the prudent cours of action today is to remain on our previous path  i e   to continu to move rate up gradual   there are ampl fundament reason for such a polici action      we are at a whisker from potenti output     to quot a recent comment by presid     i like that comment      a  whisker       laughter   and i continu to be concern about inflationari pressur   the higher energi price we saw even befor katrina add to the concern   and we now have a signific increas in the amount of fiscal s ulus in the pipelin  as was discuss  which has the potenti to keep pressur on inflat elev for some  e  even after energi price increas subsid   i would also note the appar increas in near term inflat expect   the recent releas univers of michigan survey  discuss earlier and in our brief document  show a fair hefti increas in both short  and medium term expect of inflat   a fact worthi of our attent     final  i believ that continu to reduc polici accommod would be the best way to underscor to both the market and the public our belief that katrina will not chang the under econom fundament and that the negat impact on growth will be temporari  market general expect a rate increas today  so i believ that move would not be disrupt  by contrast  paus today will do littl to improv the temporari effect on growth of  katrina  which is larg a suppli shock   and if we do paus today on the ground that katrina has made the short run econom outlook uncertain  i think it will be veri difficult for us to resum rais rate in the short term   econom data come in over the next coupl of month on product  employ  and consum spend are like to be weak becaus of hurrican effect   tri to craft a statement to explain whi we are rais rate in the midst of weak data  after paus now  would be a daunt task   so if we paus today  i think we have to consid that we will be on hold for a while  perhap even as long as to the begin of next year   in my mind  this pose an unaccept risk that we will find ourselv behind the curv   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the texa economi is fare better than the nation economi   pre katrina we saw veri strong evid of that in all nine of what we call our super sector in the economi   includ  by the way  the inform and telecom sector  which suffer serious setback in the burst of the dot com bubbl and the revers  come out of the recess in       post katrina data are like to be stronger still   despit or perhap becaus of the uniqu posit that we   re in geograph          peopl from the area affect by katrina have    evacu to the state of texa   we expect about        of them to stay  and that   s abov and  beyond jack   s employe to whom we   ve tri veri hard to be help   the way our economi will improv in the aftermath of the hurrican is by increas the convent busi  for exampl  that has been displac into dalla   and the port of houston will have increas activ   we   ll see what happen with this storm that   s brew present  our offic and busi reloc effort are run full bore  and throughout the state we   re  get commit alreadi from peopl who have been displac along the gulf coast   our data show greater busi op  than is seen nationwid   our banker are veri friski    laughter   as one of them  the ceo of the largest bank in our district  put it the other day     loan demand is stronger than horseradish      and it just continu onward   one concern i would note is that econom condit in mexico are wors than we expect  and   a point to make about the  book   we   re less op ist than the board staff about the second half of the year   there seem to have been an implos in domest demand in mexico   we   re also concern about some develop in the build materi sector for cement  wood  and steel   we   re see signific evid of the hoard of lumber  for exampl   and how that might affect construct activ in our state   we are  at least in northern texa  second to atlanta in term of hous start  although fortun not subject to signific upward price  pressur   on the nation anecdot side  this has been an aggress period for us in that we talk to as mani ceo   mani with firm headquart in our district   and other busi contact as we could   we spoke with a total of    ceo for this round  one coo in retail   everybodi know who that is   sever cfos  and mani director from bank and other board of differ    size and dimens of convent compani   so i   d like to summar veri quick what we heard   the retail  from the conveni store oper who is headquart in our district to the largest retail  emphas two point   first        per gallon gasolin seem to be the tip point in term of have an impact on consumpt   whether katrina is direct relat to that or not  the point is that one get from these retail evid of a fall off of demand and  veri import  a bifurc of demand   by the latter i mean that the higher end retail like nieman marcus continu to do well while the lower  and middl end retail suffer  second  there has been a chang in product choic  with a move from brand product to unbrand product   my favorit exampl provid to me in this call around was the substitut of gold coast cigarett for marlboro   there   s a       per pack differ  and retail  particular   eleven  are see signific higher sale of the lower price brand  the price pressur that are come in retail are in area one would expect   plastic  packag  transport   and there is evid of price pressur begin to build   i  understand that wal mart execut have call in the ceo of all their supplier and told them that wal mart will not accept further cost through put   but the compani indic that they will work togeth with their supplier to achiev effici   whether that experi will  succeed or not is anoth question  on energi  we have what we call a swot team   we replac the a with an o  which is for oil   that includ the largest integr compani down to some smaller gas produc   i   ve been send around some note to my co presid on what we have learn from these sourc  for whatev they   re worth   the bottom line there realli come down to natur gas and    gasolin price   there are    ship at sea present bring in product  mean gasolin   and the expect is not so much a direct price movement base on katrina but increas volatil  as we talk about earlier  depend on whether or not the winter turn out to be a cold one  that   s what the produc are look at in term of the real side of the busi as oppos to the specul side of the busi   the effect are work their way through chemic  and these are effect that don   t come to mind readili   you can onli take a natur gas molecul and divid it in so mani way  our chemic peopl are tell us  for exampl  that they don   t yet have the leeway to pass through price on thing like nitrogen and hydrogen and other chemic that we ordinarili don   t think about but that are import to the chemic product process   but as one said     we are go to look for everi way we can to pass on price there     regard the ship and rail  the largest barg compani in the countri gave us this statist      to     barg out of        to        were affect by develop in the  mississippi relat to katrina   but it was    no big deal except for an impact at the margin      we receiv a similar report from the ceo of one of the larger of the five railroad compani   one thing that everybodi in the transport busi talk about that they applaud polit is the waiv of the jone act   the es  is that it will cut intercoast transport cost by ship by half  which is obvious not insignific  as far as express deliveri is concern  the key factor there in term of ground transport is whether or not the u s  mail will move up it price  the expect is for a     percent increas in januari   on the auto side  as presid   report  ford is probabl feel more friski   just to use that term again   and gm is as well   it   s interest to look at    the use auto auction for manheim and adessa  the two largest wholesal use car auction  there was a big spike in price post katrina   if you do the math  whether         car or even more were lost from hurrican damag  this should be of assist to the auto compani   as far as technolog is concern  ti report the abil to pass on some price increas in their broad semiconductor busi   but again  all the tech folk  whether it   s dell or ed  report continu pressur to lower price and to outsourc and new sourc their employe base   on hous  i have report on the hoard of lumber   there is anoth interest develop  which is the disappear of contractor and subcontractor from our state   and appar from florida  jack   becaus they are rush to new orlean to cash in on the money that is go to be spent there   in summari  the comment from our busi contact on katrina  while acknowledg the human tragedi and the tremend displac of peopl and properti  rang from    no impact    to    short term shiver    to    sporad impact      and as cold heart as it may seem  this come down to the issu of where we are today   the way i have thought about it is that i believ there will be less of an incom statement impact but more of a balanc sheet impact  which is someth i worri about   what i mean by that is that perhap we will see a temporari setback in term of growth  a shift in the complexion of that growth  and  to be sure  addit volatil  and potenti price increas   but what i worri about most  mr  chairman  is what i have come to refer to as the fiscal incontin of the govern   that is  i worri about money be thrown at a problem and whether or not that will undermin the confid that we depend on to financ our econom growth     i   m remind of a stori that georg shultz told me about his  e work under presid reagan  who was veri frustrat about spend   georg pick up the phone and call i think it was sam cohen and said     tell me  sam  is there realli ani differ between republican and democrat when it come to spend      and cohen said     i want to think about it  do some research  and give you a serious answer      he call back the next morn and said     yes  georg  there is   democrat enjoy it more      laughter      but otherwis there  sn   t appear to be ani differ     i want to vote for a    basi point increas in the fund rate   i agre with presid santomero   s point about confid   i worri about the price pressur that are build  but i also think it   s veri  veri import that regardless of the amount of addit fiscal s ulus    whether it   s     billion or more   that we not be view as be tempt in ani way  shape  or form  to monet that fiscal spend  whether it   s incontin or profligaci  i would suggest also  mr  chairman   and this may seem odd   the possibl of look at the languag in our statement  which i think jack mention obliqu  and whether or not we  want to continu with the term    measur pace      has it run it cours   has it becom synonym with a    basi point increas or not   and might we not use katrina as an opportun to decoupl that link in order to provid us greater flexibl go forward   but  in summari  i am in favor of continu to remov polici accommod   thank you veri much
thank you  mr  chairman    it goe without say that the devast caus by hurrican katrina has elicit a deep sens of empathi in our district   in term of the    econom effect  we   re pay special attent to energi and intern trade   so far  at least  the effect on the twelfth district economi appear to have been mute  sinc the end of august  retail gasolin price are up about    cent per gallon on the west coast  less than elsewher in the nation   there was some earli concern that gulf port cargo would be divert to the west coast  creat bottleneck or signific increas ship cost  but these concern have larg dissip  our contact remain fair op ist about the prospect for the region economi but are veri concern about the futur path of energi price  especi sinc hurrican katrina  even befor the hurrican  they were worri that higher gasolin price and impend increas in home heat expens would curb consum demand   inde  pg e  the public util for northern california  just announc that rise natur gas price could drive home heat cost in the area up by as much as    percent this winter   discount retail in the district expect these increas to put a dent in holiday spend   in addit  higher fuel price alreadi have t l into price for build materi  and contact expect post hurrican rebuild effort to boost those price further and lengthen queue on some order  turn to the nation economi  i share the  book   s assess of the near term impact of hurrican katrina on econom growth   pre katrina  the outlook was for veri strong growth in the second half of        it now seem like that second half growth will be substanti reduc due to the disrupt to product in the gulf region and the negat impact of the run up in energi price on consum spend   of cours  over this  e frame there   s littl that monetari polici can do to affect actual outcom      while the propos polici statement associ with altern b acknowledg increas uncertainti about econom perform in the near term  i believ that the uncertainti associ with the medium term outlook have also risen substanti  and risk  now exist that in my view pose a clear and persist threat   on the upsid  rebuild  commit are escal by the day   the recoveri and bounceback fuel by massiv fiscal s ulus could more than make up for the slowdown this winter  propel the economi on an unsustain upward trajectori similar to the op ist scenario laid out in the  book  but downsid risk to growth also loom   rebuild schedul could easili slip  moreov  the pace of restart close oil and natur gas platform and rig in the gulf of mexico has level off  and the prognosi for restart the remain close facil as well as  refineri and natur gas treatment plant remain in question   if disrupt persist or further shock to suppli occur  the economi could develop more along the line of the pessimist scenario in the  book   moreov  we may not yet have seen the full brunt on spend of the pre katrina energi price increas   it   s sober to note that in the postwar period  the u s  economi has rare escap such sever run up in oil price without suffer a signific downturn   turn to inflat  i was quit concern at our august meet by the elev rate of core pce inflat  which was skirt the top of my comfort zone   sinc that meet  i   ve becom more confid that core inflat remain well contain   recent data on core price inflat have been encourag   core pce price have risen at a     percent rate over the six month through juli  right in the middl of my prefer rang  and core cpi inflat has also been well behav   i   m also encourag by read on wage growth from the employ cost    index and from the household survey  a seri that our research staff has recent start compil and track   these remain remark subdu   the elev rate of growth in compens per hour from the product and cost report over the past year far exceed the read provid by these other seri and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor market and wage pressur   while my comfort level with respect to core inflat has improv sinc august  the board   s staff has rais the  book forecast of core pce price inflat in      by     of a percentag point to     percent due to the run up in energi price sinc the august meet   i must say that i actual found the low inflat altern simul in the  book more compel   this scenario assum that inflat expect remain well anchor  and it show core inflat fall over the next two year  reach     percent in         on that point  the relat stabil of longer term break even inflat rate deriv from the tip market this year  even as oil price surg  provid evid that the public remain confid in the committe   s commit to price stabil   of cours  the jump in inflat expect seen in this month   s preliminari michigan survey was worrisom  but we must be cautious not to read too much into that report sinc it was taken so soon after katrina   to assess the like pass through of energi into core consum inflat  our staff has es  phillip curv type forecast model akin to those employ at the board   an import find emerg   chang in real oil price did have an econom and statist signific effect on core inflat  but onli up to the earli     s   import for the current situat  they find no evid of such a relationship in the data sinc the earli      s   the critic differ between the pre  and post     s experi probabl relat to the public   s    inflat expect   dure the     s  they becam unmoor from price stabil but now appear to be well anchor  as in the  book   s low inflat scenario   with respect to polici  i support a    basi point rate increas rather than a paus today  a paus at this meet justifi by a need to further assess katrina   s impact would be sensibl if we actual expect to know a lot more about the medium term outlook by novemb  but that   s unlik to be the case   a paus could counterproduct mislead market particip about the like futur path of polici or creat the misimpress that the fed is unduli pessimist about the outlook   so i consid it wiser to stick with our    measur pace    approach  for now   i think it   s well justifi by the  book forecast  uncertain as it is  and consist with market expect   but go forward  we obvious need to be flexibl and adjust our  view about where we   re ul  head on the basi of new data and forecast
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   for the past coupl of meet i   ve been report a lull in econom activ in new england  with littl employ growth and mute read on confid   perhap it was the weather or the impact of the pentagon   s base realign and closur  brac  propos on fragil labor market such as those in main but  whatev it was  the region appear to pull out of it in late juli and make some further progress in august   the weather turn bright and sunni  tourist fill the beach  and hope for fall tourism rose   employ surg by more than        job over the two month   that   s big in new england   with most broad industri categori show gain   consum confid rose  as did busi confid   and the brac commiss decid not to follow the pentagon   s recommend to close two major base in the region      with the except of commerci real estat  which remain in the doldrum in boston  the outlook turn posit overal  with most contact expect continu growth for the remaind of      and into        but  of cours  this was pre katrina   sinc that devast disast  we   ve tri hard to understand the impact on the region and the nation   our small busi advisori group met as schedul the week after the hurrican hit  as did our board of director   at that point thing  inde  seem gloomi   but as the recoveri effort got on a better foot  the under resili of the u s  economi began to show through  to captur a sens of this chang scene  we made call late last week to larg nation retail and manufactur headquart in the first district   overal there were sever common theme   first  most contact believ the pace of under growth had been solid and  was like to stay that way  with some negat hurrican effect this quarter and next but some posit impact thereaft   inde  one of our director whose compani is a larg manufactur of semiconductor chip report worldwid expans on the heel of a major inventori drawdown dure the first half of the year   he report semiconductor plant everywher work at an    to    percent capac most recent  with strong demand for pcs and hand set drive chip product   a major region bank with offic throughout new england and the ea n midwest and down to philadelphia report that given the yield curv  the bank busi had been a bit tough  but most bank custom seem to be do great   this bank and other employ report increas problem in find skill labor  even peopl to fill teller  posit   second  while katrina   s devast was terribl  our contact were especi concern about the effect of high oil  gasolin  and natur gas price on their input cost for oil base    materi and on consum pocketbook   consum price in the boston area were on the rise prior to katrina  with the region   s headlin rate of inflat at   percent and core at   percent  the biggest area of price growth even then was for fuel and util  which rose almost twice as fast as nationwid over the    month from juli       to juli         given the region   s lack of homegrown energi suppli  it relianc on oil for home heat purpos  and the fact that over half of it electr generat are now fire by natur gas brought in from outsid the region  it seem clear that boston price growth  driven by energi cost  will continu to outstrip the nation at least through the winter month   moreov  a pre katrina feder energi regulatori commiss report  which i think i   ve talk about befor  see the region   s power suppli at risk of widespread brownout this winter if veri cold weather put stress on generat work at capac   more broad  contact also report that katrina   s impact on energi cost may give  them cover for price increas that prior to katrina they   ve lack the power to make stick   the third common theme relat to the possibl upsid potenti for reconstruct  relat demand in        manufactur of capit good and consum durabl anticip a hurrican relat uptick next year   compani with store and manufactur or major distribut point in the hurrican area will have some loss  though most expect them to be cover by insur   and one larg retail report that while   to    out of it     store in the region appear to be total loss  busi was extrem strong at store just outsid the devast area  such as in baton roug   that compani has been move employe in the affect area to store in area where busi is boom   a supplier of capit good to the defens industri was concern that the spend on recoveri from katrina could squeez out    other defens spend but they  on balanc  thought the probabl was that sale to the govern and other major contractor might be delay but not cancel   final  there was a theme of outreach and support to employe in the affect area and of help with disast recoveri   almost all contact were do whatev they could    suppli generat and give out free medicin and other suppli at evacu locat   in fact  one drugstor report that on a daili basi they were hand out about          worth of free drug   suppli water purif equip and technolog to restor communic was also note  most compani have continu to pay their personnel and have made effort to locat them all   sever have made grant to those who lost everyth   they expect insur to cover some of this and perhap some govern reimburs  but the general attitud seem to be to do as much as they could and to worri about how to cover the cost later   just as within the reserv bank  the report generos of employe in area beyond the hurrican was amaz  with one major compani alon rais at least     million in donat to katrina vic  in the reconstruct effort   so it   s not just govern money that   s go into the area   there   s a lot of money from everywher   in sum  the new england economi seem on a stronger foot than it was earlier in the summer  though the dark cloud of rise energi cost are almost certain to take a bite out of region pocketbook  especi if the winter is a cold one as is predict   this like would  have been the case without katrina  but the relat energi suppli shock has made the short term outlook a bit wors   asid from energi  the econom effect of katrina seem like to be small  certain by comparison with the human effect   by       if energi cost moder as predict     the outlook could well be posit for the larger retail and capit good manufactur in the region   turn to the  book  there is more than the usual amount of uncertainti cloud the veri near term outlook   we in boston  probabl like everybodi els around the tabl and elsewher  have tri our hand at es  the impact of katrina   but i can   t imagin that we   re ani better at it than the board staff is   in fact  despit the up and down in the quarter to   quarter project  the q  over q  gdp growth rate we see for both this year and next differ from the  book onli margin   our forecast for the unemploy rate is the same as the  book   s and  given that we see a bit more excess labor capac  we   re a littl less pessimist about increas in core inflat next year  so despit the near term uncertainti  the medium term outlook seem less in question  while it seem imposs a coupl of week ago  as we were all rivet to the horrifi scene on nation tv  katrina   s effect on the economi is like to be veri short term   a slower pace now and a somewhat fa  pace later as reconstruct take place  the real issu is what was happen pre katrina and how that play out go forward   and we have a somewhat greater sens of certainti about that pictur   or  i should say  the same level of certainti we have about ani forecast   prior to katrina most everyth in the economi seem to be run on all four  though not without some caus for concern   shipment data for juli suggest some soft in p e spend  and inventori rebuild at the wholesal level was less than expect  but labor market had shown solid progress   financi market had  been and continu to be support of growth  if a bit too complac about risk for my tast     extern growth was show sign of life   a slowli close output gap and higher energi cost rais concern both about inflat down the road and possibl negat effect on spend  assum the instant effect of katrina on energi price moder  the broad econom pictur seem about the same as it was befor the hurrican   that is  the best guess is growth at around potenti for the next year or so  lower unemploy as labor market continu to tighten  and more rather than less pressur on price   addit fiscal s ulus from katrina recoveri effort could be a bit of a wild card here  as there seem to be a grow tendenc to   throw money at the problem   money we can ill afford  given medium term deficit expect  don   t get me wrong   i think the feder govern should help in the rebuild process  but it  has to be done in the context of overal fiscal disciplin  which at this point seem a bit lack  there are sure risk to the forecast   on the downsid  the higher energi price that prevail befor katrina might have a bigger impact on consum spend and overal growth  particular if the suppli shock of the hurrican  sn   t eas off as expect   pre katrina shipment and order data may foretel a flatten rather than a rebound of capit spend   on the other hand  greater fiscal eas will certain be an addit s ul  and the hurrican could provid addit cover for more widespread price power  product growth has slow  and we hear report of labor be hard to find  combin these report with the slowli fall unemploy rate  and a surg in wage and salari growth as measur by the eci  which we haven   t seen yet  may not be far off the mark  as a matter of risk manag  it seem to me for now that appear to be complac about simultan energi demand and suppli shock and diminish excess capac might well be more cost in term of expect and central bank credibl than deal with    greater downsid effect if they were to emerg   those effect could be address in a  e way by paus  but at this point i don   t see a need to take that step  thus  i   m in favor of continu our process of remov polici accommod at this meet   incom econom data could well convinc us of the need to stay put some  e soon  or we might find it necessari to continu our upward trek longer or at a fa  pace than we now are expect   but at this point  continu to remov polici accommod at the     measur pace    we   ve been do seem about right
okay   shall we break for coffe   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   fifth district econom activ appear to   have expand at a quicker pace from mid august through mid septemb   for the most part  product and sale in our area were not substanti affect by hurrican katrina   shipment from district factori acceler from august   s modest upturn  and new order grew for the first  e sinc may   servic firm report fa  growth in their revenu  and they maintain the moder pace of hire seen in earli august   retail told us that overal sale grew modest   labor market condit remain solid  with district job growth maintain the moder pace of recent month    hurrican katrina had relat few real effect in our area  as i said  caus onli some scatter and short live outag of gasolin and interrupt raw materi shipment to a small number of manufactur firm   in addit  higher gasolin price  combin with fear of avail  seem to curtail tourist activ over the labor day weekend   anoth hurrican     ophelia  batter the  ina coast last week  but preliminari assess suggest it was not ani more damag than the typic  run of the mill hurrican   while sever of our contact tell us that higher fuel cost will squeez profit margin  the major tell us that they are pass on cost increas to their custom   mani firm report that custom are more recept to price hike in the current environ   with about half the respons in as of ye day morn  preliminari result from our septemb busi survey  are show that both price paid and price receiv are rise at a quicker pace than in august  and expect price trend have general ratchet up as well   turn to the nation pictur  the  book   s forecast for output and it compon appear broad consist with privat forecast and with what we were hear from our fifth district contact   prior to katrina  the economi was grow at a reason strong pace but  with some sign of inflat pressur rise from elev oil price   and the real effect of the hurrican that are project in the  book forecast appear quit plausibl  given the  difficulti of assess the tempor extent of the disrupt to econom activ  but on the inflat side  the  book forecast paint a pictur that i find somewhat distress   the staff   s inflat forecast has been steadili drift up over  e   as shown  for exampl  in the fine new tabl on page       laughter   and it was revis up mark for this meet   core pce inflat is near     percent throughout      and   not fall below   percent until        inflat expect move upward as well  which caus growth in compens and unit labor cost to step up signific at the begin of next year   this would put inflat appreci beyond a rang i view as consist with price stabil      while the real  quantit effect of the hurrican are uncertain at this  e and may prove more moder than first fear  the qualit implic for short term real rate seem  quit clear to me   a real interest rate is  of cours  the price of current resourc relat to forgon futur resourc  and for a number of reason katrina has caus a temporari scarciti of current resourc   a portion of the capit stock in the affect region has been destroy or damag  and worker have been separ from employ   it will inevit take  e and resourc to rebuild the capit stock and reestablish product labor market match  the good news is that these effect are like to be relat short live   within a year or so  we are like to be back to more or less where we would have been in the aggreg   but this mean that  if anyth  katrina should caus real interest rate to rise to encourag adjust to the temporari scarciti of current resourc   the fiscal respons to the disast point in the same direct regard real rate   the sustain of feder deficit was question prior to hurrican katrina  and the spend amount be propos for hurrican recoveri effort just strengthen the case for tighter polici   i think we have to be care about reason on the basi of the gap between current  output and es  of potenti output   some es  appear to identifi the declin in potenti primarili with a small es  effect of lost capit   such approach see the suppli side effect of katrina as minim and  therefor  interpret most of the declin in output as a shock to aggreg demand   this make it tempt to a naiv policymak to consid counteract the macroeconom effect with easier polici   but all of the real resourc effect of katrina of    which i   m awar amount to reduct in our current capac to produc good and servic  lower real interest rate can do littl to counteract these reduct   i think we should be care about the wide cite analog in the public press to the     s when oil suppli shock were subsequ follow by recess   i say this recogn that sever particip around the tabl were somewhat closer to monetari polici than i was then   but in the     s  inflat expect were unteth  and peopl came to expect us to allow energi price shock to feed through to overal inflat   we often confirm that expect by keep real interest rate from rise   in fact  at  e  we kept nomin rate from rise as fast as inflat and  thus  real rate fell   we were then forc to rais rate dramat to bring inflat back down and  in the process  exacerb the real effect of the oil price shock   so  to interpret the effect of katrina as signal an immin shortfal of aggreg demand is to draw the wrong lesson from the     s  in my view   the right lesson for us today is  the import of keep inflat expect anchor in the face of this shock   at our last meet  we note the relat stabil of longer term inflat expect as measur by the tip inflat compens number  even in the face of sustain oil price increas   but the behavior of the fed fund futur price and the tip curv sinc hurrican katrina suggest to  me that our credibl is serious incomplet  in the sens that mani market particip appear to think that we might be will to toler elev inflat for some  e in an attempt to eas the real effect of the hurrican   our action and statement today should provid the public with greater certainti about our near term intent   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with a few pertin fact about the district economi  both pre  and post katrina   overal  the district economi remain healthi  employ is continu to advanc modest  and in at least a few geograph area  it seem like that employ gain are be constrain by a lack of avail labor   construct activ  both residenti and nonresidenti  is strong and or improv   and one of the larg credit card issuer in our district has report   and i think this is reflect of nation condit   that repay on credit card debt are up and charg off are at a    year low   higher fuel price so far have not led to product cutback or plant close in the district   where possibl  firm are switch to less expens sourc of energi  and surcharg are  of cours  common   higher energi price do  though  seem to be particular advers for local govern and for farmer  who are also advers affect by the infrastructur  destruct and disrupt in the gulf area   as for the effect of katrina on the nation economi  at the qualit level i think we actual have consider experi in analyz these kind of shock  and in my view the  book at that level has it essenti right   it seem to me  as other have comment  that in the short term we will get a disrupt to growth follow by a rebound and presum ul  a resumpt of trend growth   and  as far as inflat is concern  i think we will get an acceler ul  follow by a return to trend  assum that polici adher more or less to the path that it would have follow   at the quantit level  though  it seem to me difficult to say anyth precis with a lot of confid   but i would ventur that in these circumst   becaus of the concentr of the popul  the number of peopl affect by the disast  and the affect area   s locat    relat to the energi and transport infrastructur   the amplitud of the swing  both in term of growth and inflat  and perhap the durat of the adjust  would be extend  there   s a temptat  i suppos  to exagger this   after all  a relat small part of the economi is affect   but it seem to me that  in ani event  uncertainti has increas   and if this overal descript is rough appropri  then i find think about monetari polici more complic than it was former   moreov  i don   t think the situat is go to get clarifi in the near term  becaus the incom data  of cours  will be difficult to read  given that they will be affect in one way or anoth by both the disrupt and the recoveri effort as they  proceed   in these circumst  i feel most comfort fall back on fundament   name  the flexibl and strength of the under economi  which i don   t think are affect by this  so i come out with a view that it   s appropri to continu on our path of remov polici accommod  and i would favor a   point increas in the fed fund rate   have said that  i think we are get to the point where we   ve remov a lot of accommod   and one of these day we need to consid that and also think about how that ought to affect the languag in the statement
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been a lot of discuss on the nation economi and katrina  and i don   t think i   ll repeat that   but i would say that i am in agreement with the scenario the  book has outlin here  we do expect a temporari slowdown in the economi this year and then a pickup next year and beyond   and i think the evid from our region is consist with that outlook      econom growth in the district remain strong  although busi have express some concern over the impact of katrina on the region economi   at the end of august  though  employ was still grow solid   retail report further growth in sale  tourist activ continu to show littl effect from higher gasolin price at that  e  and manufactur activ had grown pretti solid over the summer   in a special survey that we conduct follow katrina  a wide rang of contact said that the disast would have some negat effect on their busi in term of cost and the avail of suppli   and a small percentag actual expect some posit effect from it  more specif  a contact at a major railroad come out of our district from kansa citi told me that they were abl to get their oper along the gulf coast back in order within just a few day of katrina and were back move materi across that area at almost normal level  so  there has been a fair strong reaction in term of bring thing back on line after katrina    while the impact of katrina remain uncertain  i would say that analyst in the farm sector are more op ist than they were just a week ago  for exampl   the impact on the transport system  as i just mention  appear to be less than initi fear   termin facil are now report limit damag to physic infrastructur  and the unload of barg and load of ocean go vessel appear to be start again   as a result  the hurrican   s impact on agricultur will be primarili through higher fuel price   higher diesel and natur gas price have a larg impact on crop product cost  as they boost the cost of oper machineri  dri grain  fertil  and so forth   so overal i think activ in our district will continu strong   katrina will have some impact on the region but not a major or long last one for the most part      turn to the inflat outlook  my concern there have not chang sinc our last meet   core inflat is higher than i would prefer  although it still is in the   percent plus rang   core cpi inflat  for exampl  is up     percent in august from a year ago  and other measur of under cpi inflat are  in fact  higher and move slowli up   in addit  i believ the upsid risk to inflat have increas  and i think we need to be awar of that and sensit to it  in my view  a paus now would in fact be more than a paus  becaus as other said   in particular presid santomero   in this environ the data are go to come in weaker than  we would otherwis expect   so a paus now would be hard to revers until some  next year  the other point  which other also have note  is that fundament monetari polici remain accommod for now   we have been remov accommod but polici is still accommod  and i think we need to keep that in mind   therefor  i think we should continu on that path as we move forward from this point   i would agre  though  sinc we have been remov accommod for a while  that at some point here in the next few meet we should be talk about chang the languag and about how close we are to neutral on the fund rate   i think that will be an import and interest discuss for us   howev  for the  e be  i think we should stay on our cours and remov accommod at the pace we have been do in recent month   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to focus on a coupl of anecdot report on the weak side of the project go forward   but i don   t want this to be misunderstood  the general tenor of report i   ve heard is clear on the posit side     i do want to say also that we seem to have merg the first and second go round  so i   ll just take note of that    laughter   i   m not go to break that pattern either   accord to my contact at wal mart  the compani es  that everi     per barrel increas in crude oil cost them about     basi point of same store growth   in fact  wal mart is cut back purchas for the holiday season   wal mart supplier are also concern about the strength of holiday sale  and wal mart is in the process of negoti price concess in anticip of weak sale   i think that more or less fit the messag from my colleagu to the right   wal mart is anticip a signific effect on corpor profit from the hurrican  both becaus of the damag and also becaus of the voluntari contribut that mani compani have made   i have a contact in a larg softwar compani who said that they are veri concern about weak in the larg enterpris sector of that busi on a global basi   they don   t understand exact what   s happen there  but they believ larg enterpris may be make a genuin effort by to cut back on spend  perhap becaus of the cycl that compani went through  they had delay purchas and a lot of them have come back   but now they have fill their need and are slow down   my up contact said that they   re look at an unexplain shortfal in the last two month in volum and revenu project come out of asia   they don   t know whi that is happen   one other thing that   s go on with up and fedex both is that they   re in the midst of labor negoti that are begin to becom nasti  with pilot disrupt servic   an exampl cite was this  a pilot land a plane  know that someth need to be fix  but forget to notifi anyon until short befor the plane is schedul to take off   that then caus    a delay   so there are some so call job action by some veri strong will pilot   i think this is true for both up and fedex  and it could lead to some disrupt dure the peak season   as i hear peopl around the tabl   and i think we   ll hear the same from those who have not yet spoken   we   re all veri adam that the fundament cours of polici go forward not depart from control inflat   so  look out over the next year  katrina will have an effect primarili through the energi sector  becaus the direct disrupt is a pretti small part of the total economi  what we have is a suppli disturb in energi overlaid on a fundament strong demand pictur that has been drive up energi price worldwid  and i don   t think we know exact how big that disrupt is go to be from the suppli side   and it   s not just gasolin  i think heat cost for fuel oil and natur gas will be a bigger bind for consum   onc we start pay winter heat bill  the discuss about sale be hurt by high gasolin price  are go to be displac substanti by discuss about the cost of heat   i would like to state my own view in favor of a paus   at least i think we ought to get that case on the tabl   i want to reemphas that we need to retain our longer run concern about inflat   i think we can be complet clear about that in our statement   the statement would say someth along the line that as the uncertainti are resolv  we would then anticip  resum the    measur pace    of rate increas   but i would also like to address the polici question by focus on how best to deal with a number of possibl outcom   to some extent we tend to focus on the forecast in term of a point es   and i think the  book   a good job with that   but there are substanti uncertainti about the forecast   probabl even greater uncertainti in the near term than    look out a year becaus it   s a question of how fast the reconstruct take place   huge feder involv may actual slow thing down in the near term  becaus peopl will be wait to see the money and may delay spend to rebuild and replac   i don   t realli know  but i   d like to focus attent on the follow   suppos  on the one hand  we have a good news scenario where thing fall into place better than we might have anticip and  on the other hand  a bad news scenario where thing are wors than we might have anticip   how would today   s polici decis posit us best for deal with those various possibl   clear  if we rais rate today  it would fit nice with the good news scenario   and we would continu remov polici accommod with howev mani more move are need in the futur   if we have a bad news scenario and we paus today  that also would fit well   on the other hand  if we rais the fund rate today and have a bad news scenario  we might find ourselv in a posit where we would feel compel to paus later   then we would be in a situat where peopl would question whi we didn   t paus right after the hurrican when all the uncertainti were in place   if we paus now  we would have made the correct call  if you will  and as the uncertainti are resolv  we would then go back to rais rate   so  it   s that kind of calcul that lead me to come out in favor of a paus   i think with the proper word of our statement we will be abl to resum our rate increas in a  e fashion   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the contour of the econom effect of hurrican katrina that are laid out in the  book baselin look about right to me   but in the aftermath of the hurrican  and with the fragil in the energi market  i found myself focus more on the altern scenario in the  book   in the convers that i   ve had with my    busi contact  they appear to have more anxieti about futur prospect than about the present circumst   my busi contact who have retail store  warehous  and product facil in the gulf region all seem to have a good handl on the direct impact of the storm   and for the most part they say that their loss are manag   but they emphas that the indirect effect of the storm  driven primarili by increas in cost of energi and build materi price  will be difficult to discern for mani month   of particular concern to mani of my director is the reaction of consum to the expens of fill their gas tank and heat their home dure the winter   my director report that they are alreadi wit some retrench in consum spend  and they don   t know how much of this is just a temporari reaction or how much of it is a preview of more adjust to come    the preliminari releas of the univers of michigan   s consum sen ent survey illustr this concern  and i think the  book   s    sen ent slump    altern scenario address the polici issu that such a develop would entail  the latest spike in energi price trigger by katrina also has implic for the inflat outlook   on the posit side  most report that i have been get still have the flavor of busi unabl to pass on higher cost to their custom   nevertheless  the headlin and core inflat report are like to look scari for the next sever month   fortun  as sever  of my contact have explain  more than the usual number of price increas are take the form of surcharg that are expect to be remov when energi and other raw materi price reced   to the extent that this practic lie behind some of the near term bad news that we are see on the inflat front  there is still reason to think that the  book baselin project will prove to be accur   but at the same  e  the    deterior inflat expect       scenario highlight a risk to the outlook that also troubl me a great deal   i   m veri pleas that we   ve enjoy the public   s confid regard our commit to contain long term  inflat expect for as long as we have dure the success energi price increas that we   ve been hit with  but i   m not anxious to test the limit of that confid   even if the odd of the sen ent slump and the deterior inflat expect scenario are similar  the polici implic are not   the  book project a gdp differ in those two scenario that is veri small  but the differ in the project inflat outcom is too sizabl for me to ignor   consequ  i think the more prudent cours of action today is for us to continu to remov our polici accommod   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the balanc of evid sinc our last meet still support  in our view  a reason posit outlook for output and inflat   if we look through  as we should  the transitori effect of katrina and the reconstruct  and if we factor in what the futur market tell us about the expect magnitud and durat of the rise in energi price  we still see an economi grow slight abov trend with core inflat follow a path somewhat  but not substanti  abov our prefer rang    the fundament still seem favor to continu expans with solid product growth  strong corpor balanc sheet  reason growth in household incom  and favor financi condit   and on the strength of this view  with real interest rate still quit low  we believ that we need to continu to tighten monetari polici at this meet and beyond   at the nation level  katrina seem more consequenti polit than econom      now  of cours  the degre and balanc of uncertainti has chang   we face a higher degre of overal uncertainti   it will be harder to assess over the next few quarter the under pace of demand growth   the rise of energi price pre katrina   some of which remain even as the initi effect of the hurrican on expect have wash out of energi  market  except for natur gas   creat some risk of a larger shock to confid and behavior than seem to have been evid over the last two year   damag from futur hurrican to energi and product output may prove harder to bridg through the releas of intern product reserv   our capac to discern the under rate of inflat is also somewhat diminish  perhap less becaus of the effect of energi price than the difficulti of sort out what is actual happen to product growth and unit labor cost   apart from reduc overal confid around the forecast  the balanc of risk has probabl shift  too   shift toward a somewhat higher probabl of slower growth relat to the path of potenti output and toward a greater risk of a larger and more persist rise in core inflat   if the former risk materi  the latter might be mitig   these are risk across the spectrum of scenario  rather than the most probabl combin   but to acknowledg the chang in uncertainti is not to suggest that it would be appropri for us to stop or to push down the expect path of the nomin fed fund rate until we can better assess what we do not know now   the net effect of the chang to the outlook  on balanc  probabl   not alter the desir path of the nomin fed fund rate relat to what we thought in mid august   with the real rate still rather low  my inclin would be to continu to weight the upsid risk to inflat as greater than the prospect risk of a signific slowdown in output relat to potenti   as best we can tell today  that latter risk of weaker    growth is still onli prospect   this impli that the slope of the expect fed fund rate should remain materi posit  even if we move today   and i think we would be better off after this meet if the market rais the expect path a bit than if the path were to fall from it pre meet trajectori   i think we probabl know a littl less today than we did in august about how far we are go to have to move  even if the economi appear to be follow the path of our forecast   if we move today  all we know is that we   re    basi point higher than we were   the fact that we are that much closer to some point we can   t measur is a less valuabl observ   we may  even know less today about where equilibrium lie and whether that rang has move   and  of cours  we still face some probabl that we   ll have to move past it  or past what in retrospect  we thought was equilibrium   most of the hard question we face look pretti much like they did at the last meet   how strong and durabl can we expect the expans to be in the face of less op  about futur hous price gain or other factor that could caus household save to rise and consumpt to grow more slowli   will this dramat rise in energi price over the past two year caus more substanti damag to busi and consum confid   will the world   s privat saver continu to be will to acquir claim on the unit state at the higher rate impli by our current account forecast  and to do so on such favor term   will busi margin start to erod in a way that will portend slower invest and employ growth  will the u s  polit system be abl to make a credibl effort in the near term to improv our medium term fiscal posit and sustain our relat open trade polici   and  if not  do we risk a reduct in expect potenti growth in the futur     these are all factor that could hurt futur growth  but that  sn   t mean that monetari polici should be more accommod than would otherwis make sens in anticip of those negat effect or should tri to preempt them   rather  these familiar imbal and concern make the cost of ani eros in our credibl greater   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   like presid   and mani other of you  i do view this as one of those rare situat in which we can truli say the outlook is more uncertain than usual    laughter   but that should not deter us from proceed with our     measur pace    of rate increas  the pre katrina data themselv suggest some potenti interest question about the outlook  which could have implic for polici go forward   i was especi struck by the weak in capit spend  despit high and rise profit and strength in other aspect of the so call fundament   it   s possibl that busi caution has increas again  perhap out of concern about the effect of the rapid run up in energi price on demand sinc last spring  but at the same  e  hous price on the ofheo index continu to rise at a veri rapid pace through the second quarter  support household spend and further increas in resourc util   the expans was continu but had becom even more unbalanc   more reliant on declin household save rate induc by rise hous price   core inflat was come in lower than expect again   but the potenti for futur price increas  absent a further tighten of polici  was suggest by upsid surpris on one measur of labor cost  rise resourc util  and the threat that increas in energi cost could feed through to under  inflat     i agre with the staff   s assess that the most like outcom from katrina is that the  economi will not be materi deflect from the path it was on   after the initi disrupt  fiscal s ulus  rise hous price  and still favor financi condit  along with the economi   s natur resili  should overcom ani drag from higher energi price and should keep activ increas at a good clip in an economi that is alreadi produc at a high level of resourc util  under these circumst  inflat pressur will not abat   and judg from the tendenc for the output gap to continu to shrink this year  we   ll probabl need at least a coupl  of round of rate increas to keep the economi near it potenti and to prevent inflat from trend higher   katrina has great ad to uncertainti  and not just about the extent of the near term disrupt or the effect on energi market   the more difficult uncertainti relat to how peopl may react to what has happen  how the govern will decid to respond  and how busi and household will react to these government action and to whatev the path of energi price turn out to be   how these uncertainti are resolv will affect the economi   s medium term prospect  but at this point  that ad uncertainti  sn   t look particular asymmetr in it implic for the path of polici   the risk are still two side   growth could be stronger than anticip  for exampl  owe to greater govern spend and new tax incent  with implic for inflat   but on the other side  the rise in energi price may have less of a persist effect on core inflat than the staff has predict  the feed through of energi price to core inflat has declin appreci over  e  and market particip who have actual mark down longer term nomin interest rate sinc    august may have it right that higher energi price will have more of a negat influenc on demand than a posit effect on long term inflat   the skew in the probabl for the most like outcom were highlight by the michigan survey on friday  point to extra weight on the possibl of weaker growth from increas energi price that affect consum psycholog and spend but also point to potenti higher inflat if expect do becom  unanchor   and these skew themselv have offset implic for polici  moreov  uncertainti isn   t go to be reduc by paus or slow the pace of tighten   this uncertainti isn   t about the respons of the economi to past or futur monetari polici action   rais the fund rate  as expect  isn   t like to undermin sen ent or spend   inde  paus  slow down  or be more ambigu about our expect for polici go forward could confus the public about our view of the situat  in sum  this is a situat in which we should make our best guess as to the like outcom  howev bad those guess may be  and act on them  continu the    measur pace    of tighten for now   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   beyond the tragic and sober consequ of katrina that we saw  the effect of katrina with respect to monetari polici i think has been to creat greater uncertainti  not just about the near term but also the intermedi  term   katrina clear has becom more polici relev than the previous natur disast that we   ve seen  becaus it hit energi produc region of the countri at a  e of high and potenti rise energi price driven by global suppli and demand factor   it also came at a  e when resourc util was clear tighten and the output gap was close becaus the    economi   support by a particular strong hous market and accommod monetari polici   appear to be grow abov potenti  addit  core measur of inflat  while not deterior recent  had been run a bit high for my tast   near term inflat expect were also rise  and longer term expect  while still be describ as contain  were somewhat less contain than they had been at the last meet  as dino   s chart show   i think the staff has done an outstand job of calibr the effect of katrina and the subsequ rebuild on the economi  includ a care assess of the loss of and need to rebuild the capit stock   i accept the baselin forecast as the basi for discuss today and note that it contour are similar to those of privat sector forecast as well   howev  the rang of uncertainti around the baselin forecast is larg   the plung of consum sen ent remind us of that fact  as do the rise in inflat expect in the most recent survey data and the ongo jitter in spot and futur energi market  face with such uncertainti  we might be guid by our histori in deal with other period of shock to the econom system   dure previous episod of shock and uncertainti  we have often lower rate or at least temporarili refrain from rais rate to wait for the rang of uncertainti to narrow   therefor  befor decid to rais rate today  we have a burden of examin whi we are not follow the same reaction function we have in the past   i see at least four reason whi  unlik in the past    year or so  the uncertainti that we face now should not be a precursor to a paus   first  the relat impact of a natur disast on growth and inflat is ambigu and not easili compar to the shock that we have experienc in the last two decad   import  those shock         the stock market break of          and even y k   were clear  or at least primarili  demand shock  work through confid effect and unsettl financi condit  either actual or potenti   now  as other have said or impli  we are face a shock to both the demand and the suppli side of the economi   this is obvious an import distinct   katrina is like to elong the period of high and rise energi price that we were alreadi confront befor the hurrican struck   in the longer run  theori tell us that a persist high energi cost  exacerb by occasion shock  reduc both labor product and potenti output over  e  as the amount of energi use per worker declin   this effect is onli partial offset by the instal of energi save devic   if household and firm recogn the impact of high energi price on potenti suppli  all els equal  they should lower equiti price and also damp aggreg demand through expect effect   the possibl reduct in aggreg demand   not  howev  ipso facto match fulli the reduct in potenti suppli   presid   suggest that a naiv policymak might put greater weight on the demand effect  but i also think that a reason policymak would certain recogn the need to set polici to help maintain a balanc between aggreg suppli and aggreg demand   and that   not inher impli reduc our target fund rate   second  as alreadi indic  befor katrina we were see condit of gradual  rise inflat pressur   staff es  that seem reason to me indic that the persist energi price increas have contribut and will contribut   to   percentag point annual to core inflat between      and        import  the staff forecast for inflat has been gradual rise from  book to  book as well   if we were to paus today  in my  judgment we clear would risk allow the pass through from headlin inflat to core    inflat to becom embed in inflat expect  make it difficult to regain control over the inflat process and lose some of our hard won credibl   third  the effort to rebuild part of the unit state will undoubt requir massiv feder expenditur in addit to transfer from insur to household and busi   as the staff forecast show  this will be high s ul to the economi next year   i won   t elabor on that  as a number of other have alreadi discuss it   and i think the final reason for not follow a paus strategi here  as a few other have said  is that it won   t be clear when we can restart again   it is not clear to me at all that the data over the next few quarter will be free from the disrupt of katrina  but it is pretti clear to me that inflat pressur will continu to build   so  therefor  the staff forecast strike me as a reason approach   that forecast manag to allow these various effect on growth   actual and potenti   and inflat to end with a stabl inflat outlook  in part by assum that this committe rais rate from the current accommod level   this assumpt seem warrant to me   in my judgment  we have suffici reason not to follow our histor respons of paus   the one counterargu to all of this is that there are also clear a number of drag on the u s  economi   these drag includ drag from the export sector and relat slow growth of busi fix invest   these show through  in my judgment  in the form of a lower equilibrium real interest rate  which impli that at some point we certain should discuss when we want to stop rais the fund rate or at least be clear that we   ve move past the neutral level  that may be  as i think tom hoenig suggest  in the not too distant futur   be that as it may  i   d say for today that we should continu to tighten   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   dave     s introduct today suggest that this  book analysi was a combin of the use of judgment and model   and as i review the input  i note it reflect that combin  to wit  the  book said that katrina will restrain econom activ for the remaind of the year   inform is scant and fractur   we are in unchart territori  with devast of an entir citi   katrina is expect to depress real gdp by about   percentag point in the third quarter  half of the effect due to reduc energi sector output   in the fourth quarter  a small  posit real gdp growth is expect  but consumpt will remain depress   by the end of       the level of gdp is expect to be back where it would have been prior to the hurrican  not includ in the  book  but a judgment that seem obvious at this point  is that there is an immeasur but hard to ignor fact that the economi is onli now recov from a corpor wari toward expans  suggest that the psycholog impact of katrina is potenti problemat  turn to the inflat outlook  consum energi price are expect to increas consider in the third and fourth quarter and then fall back in subsequ year   our current project for the pass through effect contribut     to core pce price in       with littl effect in        the fiscal s ulus expect to follow katrina will impact the economi primarili in the year      and        i would say that  as  e pass  hope the need for an appropri congression respons to katrina will be balanc by the need for fiscal disciplin  as suggest by sever of you     with respect to the monetari polici path  the septemb  book was unchang from  the august  book  the expect is for a   percent fed fund target by year end and a    percent rate by mid        in one of the altern scenario in the  book   character by deterior inflat expect creat larg by surg energi cost   core pce will not stabil at   percent by      but instead rise to     percent in that year   a taylor rule construct of monetari polici respons would bring the fed fund target at that point to     percent  in summari  the economi has taken a bodi blow as a result of katrina   the solid growth that we had been experienc has been interrupt  but the economi is expect to get back on track dure        the speed of the recoveri is unknow at this point  as the devast to new orlean has put us in unchart territori  as we said earlier   it is import  as mani of you have point out  to note that the pass through effect of higher energi cost requir that we maintain and perhap increas our sensit to inflationari pressur   the effect of katrina and the concern about the potenti for hurrican rita  as amplifi by ye day   s movement in the wti spot price  suggest that we not take this week   s measur of inflationari expect or headlin inflat as an indic of how core inflat may be impact in futur month  ten consecut   point increas have brought the target fed fund rate into a rang  where it can reach both the expect level for year end as well as that for the middl of next year without a need to continu our unbroken pace of rate increas   and a paus would accommod the altern scenario of deterior inflationari expect   as it will be week  perhap month  befor we can fulli assess the econom implic of the devast    caus by katrina  i think it may be appropri to paus or defer remov accommod at this meet
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have alreadi remark  prepar for this meet was a lot more challeng than prepar for other recent meet  the economi was pois for strong growth in the third and fourth quarter befor hurrican katrina   and the forecast that the staff has develop in the  book i think is reason  given what we know at this  e   that forecast suggest that while we may see some short run soft  with growth below the rate we had anticip  the rebuild effort clear will add s ulus over the next year   i am also comfort that the under economi was strong   so while we are go to see a slight downtick due to the impact of the hurrican  the  book forecast of real gdp growth in the mid   percent rang over the next year indic that we have sound econom expans ahead   so while uncertainti about econom growth has increas  i still believ there are much more serious cloud on the inflat horizon   the rapid rise in energi price in the last coupl of month has push the level of price high enough that more firm are like to find that they cannot absorb the increas cost and must rais price to protect their profit margin   this will becom more so the longer that energi price remain high   i am still hear mix expect about the avail of natur gas this winter  while the impact of katrina may not be as sever as first fear  the limit abil to expand natur gas suppli  as we saw in the last two year  on top of slower fill due to hurrican damag  may creat shortag this winter  especi if the economi remain as strong as we expect      as the  book note  busi spend on equip and softwar has onli modest forward momentum   this is despit solid econom growth  healthi profit  and favor financi condit   so whi is busi invest so limit   i   m go to answer this by refer to the most recent quarter survey of cfos conduct by duke univers with cfo magazin   and i would note that this survey was conclud on august     the day befor  katrina hit  i want to read to you the lead on their press releas for this survey   it say     corpor op  plummet in respons to hous and fuel concern      for the first  e in the four year histori of this survey  more cfos are pessimist than op ist about the u s  economi  their number one concern is high fuel cost  rank abov health care cost for the first  e  interest  the survey also note a jump in what they call their terror index  with one third of the firm respond that cost to improv secur and busi recoveri respons has negat impact their bottom line   i think after katrina there will be more firm look at their busi recoveri plan   as some execut have told me  with the rise cost of benefit  energi  and financ  they are close manag discretionari item  includ capit spend   over the next    month  the cfos who particip in the survey are plan slower growth of invest  they now expect to increas capit spend by onli     percent   the survey indic that cfos are also worri about the hous market   they believ the market is overh and that a necessari and expect declin in hous price will negat affect their firm   this echo comment i   ve heard from other that a revers in the hous market might have negat spillov effect due to consum    reaction to a fall in the valu of their hous wealth   so i    find the survey result consist with other comment i   ve been hear that the busi pessim we   re see is due in larg part to grow concern about rise price on sever front   while recent inflat number are veri well behav  the  book   reflect a rise in the core inflat forecast over the next year   the volatil we saw ye day in the energi futur market  clear due to rita and other concern  indic how much the market is focus on the unknown path for inflat that compani are face   while the impact on inflat may be unclear   and we know the damag to platform out in the gulf and the effect on refineri capac are still be assess   the nervous about cost is a factor that is affect busi behavior  and it is someth that we can   t ignor   the fiscal s ulus of katrina and the rebuild that will result is onli go to add to inflat   and that   s on top of a transport bill that has a lot of spend on infrastructur that some of us think should have less prioriti than rebuild around the gulf coast   the chart on page      and i also love these new chart   help us keep thing in  perspect  in term of the histor trend in inflat as we   ve been tighten up from meet to meet   and we have to keep that in mind as we look to the futur   we know that there is still ampl liquid in financi market  so the risk of higher inflat to me right now are much greater than the risk to econom growth  i think it   s import that at today   s meet we give the market assur that we will continu to focus on and be dilig in deal with inflat  becaus rise cost appear to be at the heart of compani    concern   to me that   s veri import  and i want to support an increas  in interest rate at this meet

thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that   low is now pass around   and out of defer to governor bernank  i   m go to start read befor everybodi has a copi of the materi   as dave

investor believ that the anticip path of monetari polici  togeth with fiscal polici s ulus  will be suffici to cushion the advers effect of hurrican katrina on aggreg incom and product  albeit with you accept a littl more inflat   the staff   s assess  summar in exhibit    differ somewhat   in light of the effect of the hurrican and other news over the intermeet period  the staff trim it

the outlook will clarifi materi in the next six week  in part becaus econom data are like to be contamin by hurrican effect for month to come   and as for those two upper panel  the real rate may have risen consider  but our model suggest that it is still like below it equilibrium level   a constant     percent nomin fund rate may now be consist with most polici rule but it will not be for long  as the   envelop of rate recommend move upward over the next year   the case for altern b might have been strengthen by anoth element of the michigan survey releas on friday   as plot in the middl right panel  one year ahead inflat expect  the solid line  spike higher and even the much less volatil longer term expect move north of   percent   in particular  this might have serv as an unpleas remind of the    deterior inflat expect    scenario in the  book  in which  as at the bottom right  core inflat remain abov     percent through the end of next year   whatev your choic of polici rate  market particip believ  as i alreadi mention  that the rest of the statement will follow the path laid out in the    prior one   in exhibit    i provid draft statement should you want to deviat from that rout  presum becaus you view the uncertain econom outlook as render    forward look portion of the current statement no longer appropri   the upper panel accompani the polici choic of altern b with a risk assess explicit condit on maintain the current stanc of polici for the next sever quarter  should the macro fundament play out as in the  book  output growth is more like to exceed that of it potenti than fall short of it and inflat more like to increas than decreas at an unchang fund rate   given that the output gap is alreadi quit thin  neither outcom would seem to be accept to the committe  therebi send the signal that the fund rate is more like to rise abov    percent than fall bellow it   this formula follow the convent sinc may      of describ the uncertainti about both of the committe   s goal   such a formula lack the nuanc possibl from  write the statement afresh each  e   but experi suggest that the fresh date of the statement pass by veri quick given the committe   s reluct to chang word that market particip seem to obsess over   this simpl  albeit coars  formula also might solv the govern issu of how    peopl can agre on the key attribut of a statement in a limit  e   the bottom panel is silent about the possibl path of the fund rate by drop the risk assess and the descript of polici as be accommod   this version satisfi the test of simplic  but someth may be lost in it economi  these probabl are consider for anoth day   i bring them up now  howev  to remind you that as the real feder fund rate move higher into the region where reason peopl can disagre about whether polici remain accommod  the  e when you will have to deal with the statement   s structur come closer    the last exhibit provid the latest draft of tabl   from the bluebook   this version of the tabl incorpor a few chang from what you saw in the bluebook   the first is stylist in that  on re read  the last sentenc in the paragraph address the effect of hurrican katrina on energi price seem repetit   and i think that has been fix   the other two chang are more substanti  at least from  the perspect of the geolog  e over which the statement evolv   for one  the character of polici accommod as    remain    in the last sentenc  as propos in the bluebook  was not in the august statement and has been struck   for anoth  longer term expect are    contain     not    well contain    as describ in the august statement   both chang were made in light of the run up in inflat compens and higher read on inflat expect   that conclud my prepar remark
question for     if not  i   ll start  i think the interest question we have to answer is this   if katrina had done the destruct that it did without affect energi price  how would we view it   we   ve had over    the post world war ii period innumer suppli side shock   i rememb the veri prolong steel strike of       which had a profound debilit effect on the economi overal  and that affect busi confid   when the strike was over  the economi came back with a surg  theoret  one can argu that the declin in econom activ as a consequ of a suppli side shock lower wage  lower compens  and henc lower expenditur   and one could  theoriz that a suppli side shock could bring on a recess  i have never seen that happen   and i suspect the reason is that the under psycholog associ with the replenish that invari follow a suppli side shock lead to expect for the futur that creat forward momentum   i think this current situat is exact that   a veri larg suppli side shock which  ex the energi price effect  in my judgment would have gone the way of all such scenario  there would be a signific short term retrench in activ  perhap for a number of quarter   we would have the impact on the oil structur and on product and refin   but i submit to you that the price effect would not have been veri high in earlier period in our histori when the crude price was     a barrel and when the excess suppli in opec was sever million barrel   in other word  we would have had the cutback in product at refineri and presum in crude oil product  but the price effect would have been sever mute  what is differ today is someth that has been mention sever  e around the tabl  name  that the surplus has been deplet and  therefor  ani littl variat in suppli hit the price   it   s not the crude price that is caus a problem  in my judgment   it   s the gasolin price   the higher price for gasolin    of cours  contract purchas power   but more import  it has a veri visual impact in that gasolin is one of the veri few commod       milk may be anoth one   consum look at for which they have continu price comparison  so this particular surg has been veri evid as we   ve watch consum attitud and consum expenditur over the cours of the gasolin price run up and especi in the acceler that occur after august      one fascin thing about this is that we use to talk about the crude price as though it were a substitut for the gasolin price  and that is dramat differ this  e   what we have found is that the best way of view the markup from crude price to gasolin price is to weight wti    percent and the heavier crude  maya     percent   this trace the gasolin price reason well  with a relat stabl markup from the weight crude price through the refin margin  through the market margin  and into the retail price  what has happen sinc the big surg and the presum shortfal in product is that the price for regular unlead gasolin has gone up  as you know  to over    a gallon and the weight crude price has gone up to       a gallon  which is the equival of about a     per barrel averag weight price   after account for tax  this is a       spread per gallon   the fair narrow  normal spread is    cent   so we have a    cent surg here  and it   s show up part in refineri margin  but in truli spectacular market margin   and it   s clear that this is utter unsustain becaus if there is an industri in this countri that is high competit  it is the neighborhood servic station   the peopl run those station are look at their competitor across the street and down the block  and they are continu adjust their  price  so the question here is  what has happen   well  what has happen is obvious refineri breakdown in two form   one  we   ve clear squeez out ani excess capac in the    unit state   and two  in the process  we   ve had veri consider difficulti as well in refin the heavier crude oil   that give us a worldwid mismatch between the type of crude oil we produc  which are more sour and heavier  and the grow need for petroleum product that are increas for transport  which of cours includ gasolin  diesel  and a lot of the lighter product   and essenti the product of those lighter product requir a veri substanti transform of the heavier crude  while we   re in better shape than europ with respect to the balanc of catalyt crack and coke oper  we don   t have enough   as a consequ  we   re run into veri sever pressur where the price margin are open up consider  especi for those refin who have the capac to refin heavier and heavili discount crude  by the end of the year we   ll have the capac back on line that  as   mention  is current off line   it will gradual creep up   there is at this particular stage a veri signific number of tanker move in our direct that are load with motor gasolin produc in europ  which under epa regul would not be abl to be sold here   we import a littl over a million barrel a day of gasolin  and a lot of it is reformul basic into a form which meet epa requir but just bare   have drop the epa requir has open up a substanti amount of the less styliz gasolin for the unit state  and those product are go to hit our shore in a matter of week   in fact  that should start relat soon  so we should have those product short unless rita turn out to be a realli serious problem  and it may   but if you take a look at the probabl distribut on the path of rita  a good chunk of it is in northern mexico and even east of new orlean   they don   t need that  of cours   it   s not as if they   ve miss the chao and they need more of it   it will be a real mess     but the point here is that the worst on the gasolin price is close to be over unless there is signific further damag to the refineri in the houston area and below  which at this stage is conjectur   first of all  we   re make the assumpt that the water of the gulf of mexico are somewhat warmer and that  therefor  that can turn just a plain storm into a hurrican   right now they   re talk a categori       or possibl   hurrican  but they   re guess   they don   t realli know  and the reason they   re guess is that it   s not possibl to know becaus there are too mani variabl   it remind me a littl of the kenneth arrow anecdot  it   s not quit the same but there   s a lot of that involv  the market are veri sensit   have seen what happen with katrina  they   re tri to discount   probabl well over discount   the possibl associ with rita   as you know  price have come down today  the last  e i look  the crude price was down over a dollar and gasolin was down   to    cent a gallon after a big run up ye day  at some point reason soon we   re go to see gasolin price move down   ex rita  they will go from over       a gallon at the pump down to probabl         that is a veri big move  and that will take out a signific amount of the consum confid eros and conceiv the busi confid eros   which i can see out there  and i think sever of you have mention it   which  in turn  is a consequ of the eros in consum confid  so i think that  short of the caveat of rita  the scenario is not all that uncertain   there is no histor preced to suggest that we can keep margin at the refin and market level anywher near where they are   we know whi they are there  there was a suppli side shutdown  but the suppli will be come back  and inde  import from europ are go to be quit  substanti     if that occur  then clear what we will have is a situat where the outlook is still veri signific restrain   consum outlay will be constrain becaus gasolin at       per gallon is not someth that will galvan a great deal of consumpt   so  over the next number of month the economi will be fair weak  but it   s go to be difficult to differenti what part is the suppli side and what part is not   as a consequ  there   s go to be consider confus and much  much less certainti than has been exhibit in financi market over the last year or so  so we   re go into a period where the one thing we can say for certain is that the level of uncertainti is go to be rise  and it   s go to be rise on two side   it   s go to be rise presum on the output side   and we   re go to be uncertain whether it   s relat to suppli or demand   and almost assur on the price side   the reason i say that is becaus we   ve been see a gradual upward creep in financi expect  and none of us has experienc anyth like this in    year   i guess i rememb more of the pre      period than most anyon around this tabl  and this has that veri peculiar feel to it   it start veri slowli   it   s ambigu   it   s disput and unforecast  but it grow and grow and grow   if you just look at the pattern  the chang is usual too small in ani short term period to jolt you until you look back and say     this has been grow for quit a while      and then it start to acceler  larg becaus inflat expect begin to erod   that   s what the histori is   it   s veri tough to forecast  but we have been through an except long period of disinfl  which has brought actual inflat expect down and term premium down   everyth is at it bottom   there is nowher for them to go except up     and one of the characterist of these type of market is that when thing are go down there is an expect variabl that say they are go to go down further   in other word  the first differ matter   but when they get down as low as they are  the first differ goe to zero no matter what one can say about it becaus they can   t go ani lower  and that start to chang the pattern  i don   t know what the probabl of this are   anybodi who make a confid forecast of a turn like i   ve just been discuss is realli reach  and i am reach   all i   m basic reach to say is that i think the possibl out there are a lot wider than we   re envisag in the  book   the fiscal situat in this countri has gotten to be scari   there is nobodi who want to forgo a free lunch   there are big discuss about whether we ought to cut tax or rais spend   there are veri few who think in term of whether we should worri about the deficit   inde  all one has to do is go out there and suggest  as i rather foolish do on occas  how congress could curtail expenditur in a veri reason way   do you think everyon  applaud   not exact  we   ve lost our moor   these budget are out of control   the reason i say that is becaus ever sinc the surplus   which did more damag to fiscal disciplin than i could conceiv have believ   nobodi find ani polit purpos in show restraint   that mean inflat premium are go to build into long term interest rate at some point   i don   t know when  but it   s out there somewher  in ani event  one of the thing that we know with some reason certainti is that  unlik in previous period  this sharp rise in price is run into a degre of short term elast  especi for gasolin  that i don   t think we were anticip   season adjust     week domest demand for gasolin is off veri sharpli in recent week   now  that   s not to say gasolin consumpt necessarili is go down   it onli mean that primari shipment includ import are down         to         barrel a day   what may be happen is that gasolin station are essenti run down their inventori   which incident are not small   and the tank in motor vehicl that consum gasolin are be run down   the primari publish data on gasolin inventori   that would mean at primari termin   is     million barrel now   that has come down signific  on averag  gasolin servic station inventori are about    million barrel   take the averag capac of fuel tank and figur the probabl level of gasolin in those tank  that   s anoth    million   it   s conceiv that those number went down a great deal and henc the actual consumpt of gasolin has not gone down anywher near as much as the domest demand   that strike me as high unlik becaus if one is deal with shortag  there is a tendenc  if anyth  for servic station to get more rather than less gasolin   it   s onli in area where there has been some form of ration   even though they call it someth els   that some station have run out of gasolin  but  in general  there   s veri littl question in my mind that we   ve run into someth differ   name  a signific drop in gasolin consumpt   that mean that peopl are drive less  sinc the stock of car hasn   t chang   inde  if you look at the overal unit use of energi  includ oil  in the nonfinanci  non energi corpor sector   as   mention    the actual per unit weight amount of fuel per dollar of gross nonfinanci  non energi corpor product has been go down fair quick   and i might add that a big chunk of it is in natur gas  which is natur gas demand destruct  not just conserv   so  the impli    effici number are not as great as they have been   but one of the reason whi the profit margin have held up and the energi cost have not been push through just yet is that there is a signific amount of product go on  which mean that oil has less of an effect than it use to  so we   re not see great damag as yet to margin   inde  on a month basi we find that margin of nonfinanci  non energi corpor   do data calcul obvious quit rough   flatten out from march to june   now  it   s hard to know what was go on in juli and august   there has to be some compress   i don   t see how it could be otherwis  but we don   t have ani data on that  basic  i come down to the obvious question  which is of a twofold natur   if we choos to paus today  one obvious thing that is go to happen is that the feder fund futur curv  which now still gradual goe up even though it eventu flatten out  is go to flatten sharpli   then there   s the point that presid santomero made about the fact that the economi is go to be show poor data over the next number of month   so  the statement that we are go to resum rais rate at some point soon is just not credibl   the market won   t believ it  and for veri good reason   becaus the data  at least in the short run  are not go to give a rational for rais rate larg becaus it   s not go to be clear what is the suppli side effect  and what is the demand side effect   that confus is go to stay with us for a while  so i agre that if we want to restor the path of further interest rate increas  it   s go to be next year  but it   s go to be next year in the face of what in my judgment is go to be a set of heighten inflationari forc   and if that is the case  we will be way behind the curv becaus what we are look at for sure is less econom output and more inflat  though the    precis combin is not easi to determin   but if you have a measur of stagflat about which we could say we had virtual none of it a year ago  we   re begin to get some of it  we   re trade off increas nomin gdp for real gdp   and this sort of process is go to continu for a while  i think that paus at this stage is high riski  but not so much becaus of the issu of  our technic capabl to come back to our path and explain whi we   re rais rate   we could do it   we   re an independ agenc   if we saw veri poor data but saw inflationari forc  we could rais rate   i think we   d run into veri serious explanatori problem  and i think at the end of the day we wouldn   t do it   i fear that we wouldn   t  even though we probabl should  the question  therefor  get down not so much to the notion of percept and our abil to move  but to what is the right thing to do   and the right thing to do in my judgment is to recogn  as sever of you have mention  that the real risk imbal is on the inflat side  if it turn out that we rais the fund rate today   i don   t know what we   re go to do thereaft   and the economi actual show a weaken beyond the suppli side or gasolin   price induc weak  we have the capac to move the rate back down sharpli   for exampl  after       we open up the faucet   on octob           we just open everyth up  nobodi is go to complain if we sudden revers and start to pump money into the system  becaus the reason for our do that will be self evid   if  howev  we paus here and the outcom i fear materi  we could run into problem   i want to emphas that i   m not pretend i know what the probabl of that are  all i   m stipul is that  on the basi of my experi  i sens that they are larger than we   re  project  main becaus our project are base on the experi of the last    year   and    the period of the last    year has been the most extraordinari period of benefic in econom polici that i can imagin  help a good deal by global and the excess of intend save over intend invest  this period is go to end at some point   i think it   s just too riski to tri to guess when that is go to be   and we ought to have a suffici buffer out there when we start to run into some troubl becaus we don   t seem to be abl in this countri to have buffer on anyth   for exampl  we allow our excess electr capac to run down in california  as it did a few year ago   we   ve allow our oil refineri capac to run down   i can name a number of other exampl in non energi relat area   but what we definit need at this stage is a buffer in the monetari polici area to be sure we   re well posit if it turn out that we   re run into the earli stage of stagflat   if it turn out that is not the case  all to the better   we may have put in more insur than was necessari  but that insur  in my judgment  is veri well worth the cost   so i would opt for a    basi point increas in the fund rate with the languag in the statement essenti that of altern b in it most recent revis form   comment   presid
i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   and have listen to your comment  i would like to invok the central banker   s prayer from jackson hole this year  it say     lord  if there be shock  let them be vari and prefer moder one so that we can stress test our system       laughter
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i agre with you on the indeterminaci of the suppli and demand consider   and i think your analysi of the      s and our understand or lack of understand of product growth at the  e is import  i   ll close with one other thing  the central banker   s anxieti  which is     good  e are bad becaus they could turn out to be bad   bad  e are bad for obvious reason       laughter   i think you   ve given us a lesson in whi these extrem good  e are unlik to be good for us in the long run
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i   m not sure we   re build a buffer here   i think this is a question of what we need to do   and to keep go  at least until we get some more clarif  i believ is the right thing to do
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i agre with governor kohn that it is the right thing to do in spite of the great increas uncertainti
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   and have live through the      s and play some part in econom polici in those day  i just rememb that it was not pretti
mr  chairman  i continu to support altern a   i would emphas  howev  in ani descript of it that it is a vote for leav the fund rate unchang as oppos to a paus   inde  that is what the word would say   that we defer further polici firm    in light of the uncertainti surround hurrican katrina   i recogn that that   s veri much a minor view
mr  chairman  i support the increas of   point today   i remain main concern about the inflationari risk  and i think we need to continu on our path
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i have the same uneasi i had at the last meet   perhap elev this  e   about one part of the statement   i   m not sure that the word about the inflat situat and the risk in the inflat outlook truli captur the tone of the discuss i heard in the last four hour   i think the concern about pressur on both core and headlin inflat are greater than this statement suggest   and i don   t think the statement languag realli captur your notion that the real risk is on the inflat side   i don   t expect to chang the languag today  but i would hope that by the next meet we will think some more about whether we  re be true to the discuss that we had in the meet
well  it will be reflect in the minut  which are now  come out three week after the meet
and that will help
i support your recommend both in term of the rate movement and the statement
thank you   presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman   i have some  sympathi with your warn about the     s and the way thing gradual kind of got away from us   have said that  i   d like to think that we   ll succeed in conduct polici in a more effect way this  e around
i certain hope so    laughter
mr  chairman  i retain my prefer for no chang but i note that the market has price in almost a     percent probabl of a    basi point increas today  howev  it has reduc the fed fund trajectori in the futur and  unless the statement and the minut chang the market   s view  i think it   s import that we make clear that that   s not necessarili the path we   re on   by just increas the fund rate    basi point now  if it   not chang market expect about the futur  i think we will not be do the full job   in ani event  as i say  i retain my prefer for no chang but with a veri clear statement of concern about inflat and the high like need for more restraint in the futur
i support your recommend for tighten   i still wish we would consid elimin the word    measur pace      i like the last sentenc in the first altern that   put forward as a substitut to that   i   d prefer ad that to altern b without guidanc   but if push come to shove  i support you entir  not onli becaus it is the right thing to do but also becaus it give us a buffer
i support your recommend   i think it   s the best way to manag the risk that we current face   i agre with you that if in the futur the downsid risk predomin  there are way to deal with that   now  though  i think the risk to our credibl and to inflat expect   in light of the various inflat scenario we face   are suffici that keep on our path of continu to remov polici accommod is the best way to go  i also wish i had watch a littl bit more of c span and spent a few minut less on the    box matrix on our polici announc    laughter   i   m happi to go with your  recommend
i support your recommend
would you read the appropri languag
