i alway thought that you prepar them for him    laughter     copi of the chart are append to this transcript    appendix
on the first page the familiar forward rate agreement depict in red the declin of u s  interest rate over the last few month   after the committe   s januari meet  both cash and forward rate were stabl at first but began to decreas as the equiti market fell under pressur  with announc of earn shortfal in the corpor sector  and as specul regard an intermeet move increas   that specul was fuel by the comment of a former fed offici  who in fact start give precis probabl of an intermeet eas   current  with the three month cash rate  the solid red line  alreadi below   percent  the market is anticip further eas beyond ani action that may or may not come from this meet   and the chatter about a    basi point cut at this meet has coincid with the spillov of weak from the nasdaq to the broader stock indic   as of earli this week  most of the primari dealer were expect a    basi point eas move at this meet  though a minor     out of the     were forecast      anoth measur of expect  the april fed fund futur  is at about      right now  though it   s difficult to disentangl the degre to which that reflect expect of a    basi point eas at this meet or a    basi point move today follow by an intermeet move   move to the euro area  the blue line  both cash and forward rate have been larg stabl sinc the begin of the year   the european central bank  ecb  has been symmetr in it rhetor  tri to prevent the market from anticip an earli eas and take what it is call a wait and see approach   but i would note that forward rate began to trade below cash rate around earli novemb  or rough two month after the same dynam was observ in the unit state   european offici have dismiss suggest that the market is snif out a euro area slowdown and have explain their forward market as be pull by movement in the u s  market   mayb yes  mayb no   but both forward rate and anecdot survey suggest that the market is anticip    basi point of eas from the ecb this spring and a total of    basi point by the fall   in japan  the set of   line  we can see that rate basic have made a round trip sinc last june   the bank of japan  boj  initi rais rate in august and then pull back in the last few week with two cut in the discount rate and a cut in the overnight call rate   then ye day the boj announc a chang in it oper procedur  it indic that it will target current account balanc on it balanc sheet  possibl increas it acquisit of japanes govern bond  jgbs  rather than target the call rate per se   japanes market were close today  so we   ll have to          wait for reaction tomorrow in their market   the call rate is expect to trade near zero   turn to page two  this set of chart is an updat version of one introduc last  e as a measur of financi condit  take the differ between two year rate and the polici rate of some of the major central bank   the polici rate of the various central bank involv slight differ matur  some use an overnight target and some use a target of as much as two week  the top panel is the two year govern yield less the central bank   s short term polici rate and the bottom panel is the two year swap rate less the polici rate   in the top panel we show the german two year note versus the ecb   s refinanc rate   in the bottom panel we use the euro swap rate versus that same ecb rate   whether measur against the two year note where the invers occur first or against the swap rate where the invers follow a few month later  it seem that financi condit  if one accept this as a good measur of them  were rather tight by earli this year   now  sinc the januari fomc meet  the central bank of canada  the unit kingdom  and japan also have eas polici   onli the ecb did not move   but the degre of invers was broad similar  as was observ at the  e of the last committe meet   turn to page three  i have shown some of the develop in japanes financi market over the last few month   the top panel has dollar yen graph on an invert scale  and you can see that the yen has been depreci sinc decemb and is now in the     to         region   the market general view the polici in tokyo as desir a weaker yen  but japanes offici have been tri not to appear to be encourag that weaken   but with the ministri of financ  mof  have taken a laissez fair approach  the market is convinc that it is in accord with their wish  nevertheless  the mof is tri to walk that fine line  not want to antagon interest on this side of the pacif   the middl panel show the declin of jgb yield   that has involv an interest move from abov      to about      percent  especi sinc the financ minist was quot as say that the fiscal situat in japan was on the verg of be    catastroph      we have seen downgrad of japanes bank  but at least in the bond market that seem to have been outweigh by expect that interest rate would fall   perhap the market was anticip ye day   s announc by the boj   and regardless of what we may think of it  the jgb market has been the asset of          choic dure period of stress in japan   even at yield of near l percent  the carri  with a near zero financ cost  is still fair profit   but there   s a sizabl risk for the bank and the insur that have load up on these bond  if confid in this market should falter   the bottom panel show the topix and the nikkei indic  they are both down between    and    percent  perhap not surpris given what has happen in the economi  which i   m sure   will discuss later   and with a declin of that magnitud  the topic of bank capit adequaci has come back to the fore  especi with mark to market account soon to be introduc   but interest  the bank sub index actual has perform in line with the broader averag   a wide held presumpt is that the govern will pump more money into the bank as need to help with bad debt cleanup   on page four  the top panel has the euro dollar exchang rate sinc the begin of the year  from the  e when this committe first decreas rate in earli januari   the interest point here is the weak of the euro  which has surpris trader and analyst  given the reduc gdp forecast for this countri  the equiti price pressur we   ve seen  and the reduct in u s  interest rate versus steadi rate in europ   the middl panel show the degre of interest rate converg over the period sinc januari    which is especi notabl at the short end   the   line show the three month spread in libor between dollar and euro  e deposit  which has move from about     basi point to near    basi point   the blue line is the two year swap differenti  and that has come down from around     basi point to about    basi point   the red line  the    year swap spread  has been more stabl   the less pronounc shift in that measur may suggest that the market perceiv the reduc return on dollar asset to be a short run phenomenon   the bottom panel chart the valu of the u s  dollar on a year to date basi against a rang of currenc   as you can see  the dollar has appreci rough   percent  give or take  against most currenc   that appreci has occur despit some of the negat that i mention befor   and market particip are puzzl about what might explain it   among the explan is that the market may just be get it wrong  that a mis price is go on   anoth is that a v shape recoveri is be factor in and that the market is look beyond the valley   a less benign interpret is that the market is price in slowdown in other          countri that are not yet embed in econom forecast   and perhap  though i   m not persuad  there   s a safe haven effect go on   the reason i question that is becaus we have not seen other indicia of a true safe haven situat  such as a widen of bid ask spread or other sign of stress in the market   whatev the caus  survey suggest that portfolio manag may be overweight in euro relat to their benchmark   so  from a pure technic perspect  the risk for the euro in the near term is that if portfolio manag move toward neutral  the euro might be in for a rough  e at least on a short term basi   turn to the next page  the top panel reflect the lower yield that we have seen in the coupon portion of our fix incom market  the recent steepen of the yield curv is evid  the curv is now the steepest it has been sinc late        part of the reason for the short end outperform the long end is the expect that polici will continu to eas  to some extent becaus of a realloc of fund from equiti to bond  though that s a hard point to get a handl on   but the underperform at the long end might also be at least in part a reflect of comment made by the secretari of the treasuri   those comment rais question in the mind of some peopl about the administr   s commit to the buy back program  which would affect the long end primarili  sinc that   s where most of the purchas have been focus   i mention the safe haven or flight to qualiti factor   again  there  sn   t seem to be much evid yet of a true safe haven effect  although one area to keep an eye on is the emerg market  the spread in the emerg market bond index  embi  has increas by about     basi point in the last month and a half  and as you can see from the red line for turkey and the   line for argentina  those are sub compon of j p  morgan   s embi  the spread have widen as the polit situat in those countri has deterior   the news overnight that the argentin financ minist has resign may or may not help  we   ll see   the market reaction so far  at least in earli trade  has involv littl chang in that spread  but i think the messag is    stay tune      page six provid an updat on the commerci paper market in a chart format you   ve seen befor   the top two panel compar the year end      spread  in red  versus the spread in the previous five year for     and    day commerci paper   the bottom panel depict the yield so far this year   the california power situat and some downgrad of promin compani like daimler and lucent rais anxieti earli in the year  but the amount of outstand commerci paper has actual declin in the last four          month   the reduct in a  p  paper outstand was sizabl  about one quarter of the total   the good news is that this short term debt has been refinanc with longer term matur and  in fact  issuanc of both invest grade and high yield paper has been run at a fair strong pace year to date   but it   s noteworthi that the a  p  spread has remain at a veri high level relat to a  p   even as interest rate have fallen   so it   creat a bit of a conundrum in that the market is will to lend to some of these lower qualiti rate compani on a long term basi but is unwil to do so on a short term basi   final  on page seven  a point or two on reserv as we head into tax season   in the top panel the blue bar indic the actual level of major tax receipt dure the march to may period in             and        the red     and orang bar indic the project of the new york  treasuri  and board staff for those same month in        in the bottom panel the blue line repres the new york staff   s project level of the treasuri   s general balanc for the period from march   th to may   st   we are forecast elev level of the treasuri   s balanc at the fed in late april earli may  to between     billion and     billion   for perspect  this compar to a peak of about     billion last year and an histor peak of     billion dure the      tax season   the under reserv over the period  assum that     billion of long term rps is roll over and make a zero assumpt for soma purpos  are rough     billion on averag   we expect at the desk to use a mix of term rps to deal with reserv need in this period   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper dure the intermeet interv  we will need a vote for the domest oper   and i   d be happi to answer ani question
the differ in the march  april  and may project of the new york bank and the board staff is realli quit substanti   there   s a lot of money in that   percentag point differ   have you endeavor to find out which guess is more like to be the appropri one
you better say new york    laughter
i   m sure new york has the right answer   i have not endeavor to find out what the differ is in the model   i can onli guess that there might be differ in capit gain project   is that the case  don
i don   t know
that might account for some of the differ
it  sn   t matter   it   s just that new york is right and we   re wrong    laughter   i got the messag  in argentina  mr  cavallo is replac mr  murphi  as i hear   i also gather that they   ve abandon their au  program as a consequ
i   m go to cover some of these develop in my brief  so we might want to wait to discuss that   actual though  i think there is some uncertainti about both of those report
they   re negoti
oh  mr  murphi is definit out and mr  cavallo is in  origin  mr  cavallo had been name cabinet secretari or chief   now it appear that the current cabinet secretari might stay and that mr  cavallo will take the economi ministri post   but my guess is  whatev way it end up  that he will have broad power inde
question for dino   if not
i move approv of the domest oper  mr  chairman
without object   all right  let   s go to our chart show  so to speak   it use to be call that
thank you  mr  chairman   if you simpli pick up the march  book and perus the forecast sheet  i could understand how you might conclud that the staff must have been on an extend vacat  either liter or figur  over the past two month   how could all of the event and turmoil of recent week have left so few mark on the econom project  the forecast may leav the impress that we   ve done noth dure the intermeet period   well  let me assur you that it took endless meet  hour of debat  and ream of comput output to do noth  an outcom that might support the view of some about product in the govern sector   but in fact  i would like to make the case this morn that  despit mani surpris in the econom and financi data  there were some good reason for end up fair close to where we start out   let me begin with the near term develop  where we have had a consider quantiti of data to digest   on net  those data have paint a stronger pictur of the economi in earli      than we had anticip at the  e of the januari meet  and we have revis up our forecast of first quarter real gdp growth from a small negat to a small posit   among the surpris  hire averag near         in januari and februari  in contrast to our expect that privat payrol would be about flat over the first two month of the year   sale of new car and truck were run at an annual rate of about    million unit over that same period  and report from the automak suggest that the pace slacken onli a bit this month   as a result  light motor vehicl sale for the quarter are like to exceed our earlier forecast by about one million unit   likewis  start and sale of singl famili home have been run at higher level than we expect   and  outsid of the residenti sector  construct activ is es  to have soar in januari   even new order for capit good  where the anecdot news has been so bad  rose sharpli in januari to a level well abov what we had been look for   final  the level of inventori invest in the fourth quarter of last year came in about     billion below our earlier forecast  result in a downward revis to our es  of gdp growth that quarter  but also point to less of a drag from inventori invest in the current quarter   on the basi of the reason upbeat read from the labor market and the firm of some of the spend indic  a case could be made that we are continu to underes  the current strength of the economi   we includ such a scenario in the  book  not for purpos of aesthet symmetri  but becaus we see some credibl upsid risk to our forecast            in the end  howev  we were not persuad that the incom inform has paint a fundament stronger pictur of the under economi   we still view the data  taken togeth  as suggest that we are experienc a sharp slow in final demand and that the implic of that slow for product are be amplifi by effort to correct inventori overhang   as a consequ  we anticip that manufactur output outsid of motor vehicl will fall near       percent at an annual rate this quarter and fall at a   percent pace in the second quarter   the size of these declin in factori output point to an offset downsid risk to our near term outlook   inventori dynam are like to play a signific role in shape the contour of activ in come month   in the motor vehicl sector  which has figur so promin to date in the weak we have seen in manufactur  some real headway has been made   through a combin of product cut  sweeten incent  and fleet sale  stock of light motor vehicl have been work down over the past few month   of cours  fleet sale and  to a lesser extent  the use of increas incent may just be delay the full extent of the necessari adjust   in that regard  we continu to view the automak    product schedul as too op ist  and we expect some shortfal from current plan   but  there is no doubt that the inventori situat in this industri is in better shape than a coupl of month ago   elsewher  inventori sale ratio remain high in a number of industri  most notabl machineri  semiconductor  lumber  metal  chemic  and textil   as in our last project  we see the ongo effort to achiev a better align of stock to sale as weigh heavili on activ through the middl of this year  knock     percentag point off of gdp growth this quarter and     percentag point off the second quarter   if the recent spend indic are inde signal greater strength in final demand  that adjust could proceed more quick than we are current forecast   but i   d have to say that we are not op ist on that score   as i note earlier  there are reason for think that some part of the recent strength in motor vehicl sale is transitori  and with consum confid and household balanc sheet have deterior so mark in recent month  we think consum spend is like to be veri sluggish in the period ahead   and while new book for capit equip jump in januari  those data are noisi  subject to substanti revis  and appear to contradict widespread report of weak equip demand   moreov  the near term weak in the           economi is like have effect on current incom  earn  and sale that should feed back into slower growth of household and busi spend into the second half of the year   all told  we are project the economi to limp along at a   percent annual rate through the second quarter  a pace that by the summer will have prevail for three quarter of a year and will like have been accompani by a notic rise in the unemploy rate   we then project a gradual reacceler of activ that is veri similar to that trace out in the januari  book   as in our last forecast  the cessat of the inventori correct result in somewhat stronger growth of product   moreov  we continu to expect fiscal polici to provid a modest boost to demand  and on our assumpt that a small portion of the project tax cut will be made retroact this year  that boost come a bit earlier than we had previous assum   as befor  declin energi price also are expect to help bol  real incom growth and corpor balanc sheet   as you know  we have made consider larger adjust to our assum path for the feder fund rate   the baselin path in the march forecast is    basi point below that in our previous project   despit this substanti chang  the growth of real gdp  the unemploy rate  and inflat are not much differ than in the januari forecast   in our view  a number of power forc have been work to offset the s ul effect of lower short term interest rate and  in essenc  to lower the equilibrium real feder fund rate   to be sure  long rate have come down consider  and we have seen some of the effect of those lower rate on spend  especi in the construct sector   but other aspect of the financi environ have turn more restrict   the largest singl factor has been the stock market  which has fallen to near    percent below our previous project   i won   t pretend to know where the stock market is head but  take our forecast for structur product growth as a given  the implicit equiti premium in this forecast move up into the vicin of histor norm   on currenc market  the dollar has move up even as the fund rate has fallen  and it trajectori is project to be higher than in our previous forecast   combin with our downward revis to foreign activ  these chang in our extern outlook also have act to attenu the effect of polici action   factor in all of these develop  the project level of real gdp in      is just a touch below our januari forecast             we also saw littl reason to chang our inflat forecast   the incom data have general been on the high side of our expect  especi for core cpi and pce   both of these measur are now show about     percentag point acceler from the same period a year ago   we gave onli a small weight to the recent upsid surpris in consum price  basic leav our      price forecast unchang at this earli point in the year   with notic slack develop in labor and product market  pressur on wage and price should begin to diminish later this year   and  with the indirect effect of declin energi price also reliev inflat pressur  we are expect core inflat to tail off in        it is obvious a signific understat to say that the economi face some veri larg risk in the period ahead  some of which are highlight by the strong crosscurr in the data   the declin in consum confid  for exampl  appear at odd with the still strong level of auto and home sale   in our forecast  we have taken the middl ground between these indic   but we highlight in the  book the consequ for the economi of a sharp rise in the person save rate  such as might result from an increas in precautionari save accompani a drop in confid  all els equal  a   percentag point rise in the save rate could add about   percentag point to the unemploy rate by the end of        we also are uncertain about the extent of ani capit stock overhang that may have develop in the busi sector   differ model and differ period of comparison tell quit differ stori   our forecast is consist with some overhang have develop that will depress equip invest  especi high tech invest  below the level suggest by the fundament as summar by our model   but our forecast   not assum that the overhang is larg  and growth of invest spend get back on track by earli next year   again  we tri to give a sens of the magnitud of these risk with a coupl of altern simul in which high tech invest weaken to an extent onli seen dure recess   of cours  tech invest could weaken even more than this  some  the unpreced   happen  but this seem like a reason start point   taken by itself  a high tech recess caus the economi to grow more slowli than in the alreadi weak baselin   but if that high tech retrench were to be combin with a wide recogn slow in the pace of technic progress  the accompani drop in the stock market and           slump in invest spend would be suffici to creat an outright recess   i think these simul are use in gaug the dimens of the econom consequ of various shock   but i will readili admit that they also have some serious shortcom   as i review this set of simul again over the weekend  i had a nag feel that this analysi fail to captur the full rang of the risk that confront you   borrow a lesson from the risk manag literatur  i would note that in consid the uncertainti in the econom outlook  it   s like that the unforeseen covari will creat the problem   the interplay between confid  the stock market  invest  and polici could well be more power than the sum of ani of these influenc taken in isol   in the past coupl of week  we have seen the interrelationship of risk begin to extend beyond the domest economi and encompass more notic econom and financi develop abroad   on that observ  i   ll turn the floor over to   who  by virtu of her respons for follow the rest of the world   s economi  probabl know a thing or two about the complic of covari
develop in the global economi are move quick and not alway in a welcom direct   this morn i will comment briefli on develop that have emerg sinc we prepar the  book   they includ the latest news from the bank of japan  the further upward drift in the exchang valu of the dollar  the januari trade data that were releas this morn  and develop in potenti crisi countri   on monday  the bank of japan announc a set of measur that effect reinstat the zero interest rate polici and that chang it oper procedur   this move is in respons to a grow percept that the japanes economi is in danger of slide into recess and that the problem within the japanes financi sector have becom critic   market were expect the return to zero interest rate  but were surpris by the scope of the chang announc by the bank   the bank will now implement polici by target the outstand balanc that privat financi institut hold with it rather than aim for a particular overnight interest rate   the propos increas in those balanc from the current   trillion yen level to   trillion yen should lower the overnight interest rate to zero   in an effort to convinc market that short rate will remain there  and thus to induc lower rate farther           out the matur spectrum as well  the bank pledg to keep these balanc elev until year on year cpi inflat stabil at zero or abov   moreov  the bank also announc it willing to purchas addit jgbs  if necessari   with japanes market close today for a holiday  we have few direct read on market reaction to the announc   long term interest rate  which had move down to      percent through friday  have edg down further in london trade sinc the announc   the move toward addit monetari eas is part of a broad set of initi announc by various japanes offici in recent week   these announc have includ plan to achiev a more complet resolut of non perform loan in the bank system  to put in place mechan to provid support for equiti price  and to chang tax and regulatori provis so as to increas liquid and trade in the real estat market   in the  book forecast  we had anticip that the return by the bank of japan to zero overnight interest rate would come soon  howev  we remain somewhat skeptic about the commit to effect reform by the japanes govern  given contradictori statement by various offici and the lack of strong polit leadership  with prime minist mori appar on the verg of step down and no other politician come forward to lead the reform effort   as a consequ  we revis down our  book forecast for real output growth in japan this year to minus     percent   the bank of japan   s announc make us slight more op ist   but much depend on how market expect chang and whether other element of the need reform proceed  especi those for the financi sector   overal  we now see the situat as better balanc  with some upsid risk as well as substanti downsid risk to our baselin forecast   the seri of disappoint data releas and yet more polici announc were accompani by further depreci of the yen  over the intermeet period  the yen move down more than   percent in term of the dollar  with much of that occur last week and earli this week   the dollar gain as well against the canadian dollar and the euro   on balanc  the staff   s index of the dollar in term of the currenc of other major countri has risen more than   percent over the intermeet period   this greater strength of the dollar at a  e of signific slow in the rate of growth of u s  output and further downward adjust in u s  equiti price is somewhat puzzl   one possibl explan is that market particip share our view that the slow in the u s  economi will prove to be short live and that the perceiv rate of return on           u s  asset over the longer run remain relat attract  inde  the market may be reflect expect that ecb offici will be reluct to eas as their economi slow  further impair the attract of european asset   there may also be  as dino mention  some safe haven incent contribut to flow into dollar asset  as asset market global have becom more volatil   januari trade data were releas this morn   the nomin deficit on good and servic was       billion  littl differ from our  book project and about in line with market expect   in januari  both export and import move up slight from decemb but remain below their fourth quarter averag   on balanc  these data for trade  in conjunct with the balanc of payment data for the fourth quarter that we receiv late last week  would not chang our forecast signific from that in the  book   final  some emerg market countri continu to attract our attent and the attent of market as well   on monday  turkey and the imf announc the framework of a new imf program of financi support  follow float of the lira on februari      the fund signal that it has no immedi plan to offer new money  for this program to succeed  difficult polici measur will be requir of the turkish author   without serious effort by them and the mainten of confid on the part of privat creditor  there is a risk of failur   current  market seem to be await more inform about the specif of the program   in addit  argentina is again experienc polit stress relat to it econom polici agenda   last friday  economi minist lopez murphi announc a set of fiscal measur that impli serious fiscal restraint in order to come close to the perform criteria establish in argentina   s imf program   this announc trigger the resign of sever member of the cabinet who repres the left wing of the coalit   sinc then  former economi minist domingo cavallo has agre to join the govern  while last night lopez murphi resign after onli two week in offic   the implic of these move for the cours of polici remain uncertain  although it may be that the fiscal restraint will be lessen   on monday  s p put the rate of argentin borrow on credit watch with negat outlook  and asset market react advers   both the polit risk and the econom risk in argentina remain high   we   d be happi to answer ani question
question for our colleagu   presid parri
i   d like to ask two question about japan   the first is    the chang announc by japan indic that in term of polici they   re embrac some form of inflat target   second  about a month ago there was some discuss  in the press at least  indic that if japan revert to it previous polici of zero interest rate  hayami would be forc to resign   i haven   t heard anyth about that in the last few day   i wonder if you could comment on both of those element
i think they came as close to inflat target as they could comfort  given what they had said public not too long ago about it be inappropri at this  e   i see the announc in some sens as a grand compromis  an attempt to be a littl someth for everybodi   the peopl who have been advoc inflat target or other kind of expect adjust step got a statement that reserv will remain at this elev level until deflat had ceas  until it is at zero or slight posit   so that is implicit  i think  an inflat target of zero or a small posit number
had they announc a higher number  i think it would not have been credibl   so in my view they made a reason compromis on that score  those peopl who have been argu for some kind of liquid base  unconvent step got a switch to reserv target instead of the current polici of interest rate target   they got promis that the govern might inde buy more jgbs  not a commit  but at least an open door to that idea   so the peopl who have been push           in that direct got a signal that the govern is prepar to do that and will in fact be do that to some extent  so the answer to your question is yes  but not exclus   they have shown flexibl to all of these option that have been in the air now for so long   but as they point out themselv  and as i think is understood by most of the peopl in japan  these step are not in and of themselv go to move the japanes economi into recoveri  they will facilit the success of other measur  but they are not suffici by themselv to bring about a real turnaround  in that vein  the talk of hayami have to resign if japan move back to a polici of zero interest rate seem to have evapor about a month ago   i have not heard ani suggest that his resign is immin   in fact  the talk that they were reluct to make that move becaus it would lead to his resign is now all in the background   that may be becaus of the increas urgenc we   ve seen in these various announc in the past month or so and the heighten percept of the troubl they   re in
i have a coupl of question      one is a follow up on presid parri   s   i   ve wonder for some  e in the case of both argentina and japan how one can know when  from the percept of the best policymak in those countri  the situat has gotten bad enough to trigger action   in look at this  my thought was that it   s not bad enough yet becaus they think they have a lot of option avail to           them   i heard you as still express skeptic that in their eye it is bad enough yet to fix
it   s a skeptic about their abil to accomplish it  not about their percept that it   s necessari   i think the biggest problem face japan right now is polit   they are simpli polit veri weak   the ldp  sn   t seem to know what to do   there are a few person in the past six month or so who have articul some strong view but they do not seem to have been abl to build a suffici polit base to carri the day   the fact is that prime minist mori is still in offic   there is talk about move up the day on which somebodi els will take over the ldp but then deni that that   s a resign   the issu of the upper hous elect in juli is a kind of hurdl for the parti   if they had a strong person  they would have dump mori and put that person in   there   s a vacuum of polit leadership  not a lack of awar of what the problem are   the ldp is not in a good posit in the sens that the problem that need fix are basic in the area of the privat sector where they have gotten their greatest support over the year   let me add a footnot to what i just said   i think the leader of japan understand   i don   t think they believ the peopl they reli on  the businessmen and the local offici  understand   the leader believ that if they take the step necessari  those peopl will not support them  mayb out of pure self interest or mayb from a lack of awar   so they are caught becaus they can   t turn on their own support until everybodi understand that that is the onli altern  and they aren   t quit there yet   at the level of public offici  the problem is more a lack of polit will than anyth els   our give them a care reason argument isn   t go to chang anyth   that is not the problem
well  that   s what i mean by    is it bad enough to fix yet      i think somebodi onc said that if you have no option you have no problem   they appar still think they have a lot of option  as far as deal with their peopl and get the peopl to buy into a solut
i have been in tokyo veri seldom and i don   t pretend to have close contact  but it   s certain my impress that the popul in japan   not act as if the countri is in crisi   they do not act  after    year in which these problem have plagu the economi  as if they are prepar to do anyth in an effort to solv them   they get up and go to work   they seem resign to the present situat and not terribl unhappi with it   so in that sens i think your point is valid   but i read into the event of the past two month a heighten awar of the bigger pictur on the part of the peopl who are in a posit to do someth   they understand that the financi sector was put at such huge risk by the declin in the stock market   they understand that there is a serious probabl that the economi will slip into an outright recess again  which would put further pressur on asset price and could caus a real financi crisi   i think that awar is not general appreci   both the insur compani and the financi intermediari have veri serious problem   a further downward movement in stock price is onli go to aggrav those problem   there is an urgenc here   but you are quit right that the man in the street   not seem to feel that sens of urgenc
okay  that   s help   the other question has to do with exchang rate becaus you suggest a hypothesi to me that i thought was veri interest   what i heard you say is that expect that the feder reserv either           has or will eas enough to s ul a stronger recoveri  combin with expect that the ecb has not and will not eas suffici  caus the dollar to be stronger and the euro to be weaker
but onli mayb
okay  but i know that  sn   t show up in ani textbook
there is no interest rate arbitrag condit that is go to give you that one
so i   m wonder whether that reflect some serious rethink about the factor that determin exchang rate over  e
yes  i suppos   we   ve actual done some research on that  we   ve taken a sort of kitchen sink approach and put everyth we can think of on the right hand side of the equat and sort through the most recent data   it did not yield ani real breakthrough   it didn   t give relat growth rate quit as much of a major role as one might have thought  although the usual thing appear in that equat   our research did not suggest that we have to throw out all we think we know  but the data didn   t fit veri well either  frank
have you tri a coin    laughter
i   m a bit reluct to get entir on this relat growth bandwagon  even though i think market particip see the ecb   s constant statement that they are somehow not veri vulner to the rest of the global economi  that they   re go to do just fine and therefor don   t need to eas  as worrisom   i believ that   s weigh on the euro  and that   s whi i put that sentenc in my remark   but you know  up until a year ago we all thought a primari factor was relat stock market   the talk           was that somehow onc the u s  stock market began to go down  that was go to be a major event for the dollar and  in fact  that was perhap the biggest reason to worri about the stock market   never mind the economi  never mind the wealth effect  a declin in our stock market was go to caus this enorm disrupt in exchang market   we all believ that until it didn   t happen   so it make me a littl leeri of get too enthusiast about this notion that relat growth is realli the stori   there is a kind of market confid  in a long term perspect  with respect to invest in the unit state as a busi opportun that domin other busi opportun   japan certain  sn   t offer that opportun and appar europ  sn   t offer it   and in this game of there be onli three major currenc  that notion seem to prevail despit cyclic event
is it possibl that the chang toward the unit state and the dollar occur much more slowli than the under product acceler impli   could there just be a lag effect here in the sens that a lot of the capit invest come into the unit state  specif direct invest  is realli a stock adjust catch up   it may reflect where the rest of the world  specif europ  would like to have been relat to the unit state   sinc there is somewhat of a physic limit on how much money one can move at ani particular point in  e  is it at all credibl that what we   re look at here is what we would find in a stock adjust model   perhap that capit inflow is reflect the fact that the desir level of invest is still abov the actual level   in other word  even though the desir level is now fall  it may still be abov the actual level
that certain could be   the fact is  even though the volum is reduc  that we still have a plate of merger and acquisit announc and so forth on the tabl   in that vein  we receiv one unexpect bit of inform from the fourth quarter balanc of payment data   mani of the element of the data are alreadi known befor the actual tabl are produc  but we don   t know anyth relat to direct invest   and one surpris out of the fourth quarter data was a big reduct in the flow of direct invest payment abroad   that is  peopl hold direct invest in the unit state took a real beat in the fourth quarter and got much less incom than they might have expect from their invest   that   s no doubt reflect of where the u s  economi was in the fourth quarter and  hope  it will bounc back   but if that   s a big part of the pictur and earn that peopl make on their foreign direct invest in the unit state disappoint again  that could produc some chang
you mean if the earn fall  the capabl to repatri into anoth currenc goe down and the dollar is therefor under less upward pressur
well  i   m just think that in retrospect some peopl  the japanes no doubt  didn t realli think some of the invest they made in this countri in the     s were such a good idea   and it   s possibl some of the european will come to that view about the     s
i have a coupl of question for you     and i   d like you to look out a littl beyond the forecast horizon   you comment on the altern           scenario with a more aggress reduct of the fund rate   i know you have project the inflat rate out to      under that scenario and i   d just like to get your impress of what it might impli for       my second question has to do with the effect of such a polici on construct activ  given the comment in the  book and in your statement about that sector  bank in our region are begin to lend more aggress on real estat   if we were to pursu that more aggress polici eas  would that perhap have the effect of push the yield curv down   if that lower the capit rate on real estat  we could see a fair dramat shift of fund into that sector as peopl look to deploy their asset  which might caus some  for lack of a better word  overbuild in the real estat area  if construct take off as impli or real capit rate fall  what effect do you think that might have down the road
on your first question about the easier monetari polici scenario in the  book  as you know  even in that scenario the unemploy rate still rise to near       percent by year end and to just a littl below       percent by the end of        we don   t see much disinfl benefit from that rise in the unemploy rate becaus accord to the model  which as we   ve alreadi discuss is a littl weak in this particular area  the depreci of the exchang rate that accompani the more aggress eas of monetari polici offset the disinfl benefit somewhat   but beyond the      period  unemploy would still be a bit abov our es  of the sustain rate  and we   d probabl see some veri mild downward pressur on inflat in         in our forecast  we have a slight upward tilt to our natur rate assumpt becaus without ani further acceler of product there   s a           tendenc for the natur rate to rise   so we wouldn   t get a lot of disinfl beyond that project but we wouldn   t see inflat pressur either  now  in term of the more aggress eas scenario and it potenti to creat some overbuild in the real estat sector  that certain is a possibl   it   s veri difficult for me to forecast the error that bank might make  but they certain have tradit made those kind of error in previous long period of econom strength  moreov  real estat price have been quit firm and construct activ has remain veri strong despit the weaken we   ve seen in the stock market and the slow we   ve had in output growth   so  with further eas  i think there would certain be risk on the real estat side
mr  chairman  i   d just like to make a comment on some work we   ve been do in new york on the my i of the exchang rate   rather than go to the textbook to tri to figur out whi the exchang rate were behav as they have been  we attempt to look at what had actual happen for an explan   if we go back to       say  and look at the fundament  the purchas power pariti tend to lumber along on it predict path   but there are two period of multi year trend that don   t seem to have an immedi explan  the weak of the dollar in the     s and the strength of the dollar in the latter part of the     s   and what seem to fit veri well for those period are the differenti in product   forget the yen for a moment and just look at the synthet euro in the      s and the real euro in recent year  the differenti was veri much in favor of europ  as product in our           countri began to collaps in       to a       percent annual rate   in the latter part of the     s the differenti in product  as we well know  has been veri much in our favor  that factor seem to provid a veri good explan of whi the trend line in the dollar was down  especi in the mid  to late     s  and up sinc        i think the market came to realiz the import of product rather late   in         we were think that someth differ was happen and it look as if it was product  but we weren   t out make speech say that there   s a product revolut go on in the unit state   it has been onli sinc that  e that the market at least has becom comfort with the notion that the product chang is veri import   we  the feder reserv  are deem to be quit expert in this area and becaus a number of us  includ you  mr  chairman  have been say that we believ the higher product trend is still in place  i think that give some under strength to the dollar  the other factor that seem to fit reason well in explain shorter trend in currenc seem to be market expect of growth rate differenti in the next six month   i don   t mean what actual happen  but what peopl say they expect will happen over the next six month  that seem to give us a fair good fit for shorter term move in the exchang valu of a currenc   so  we believ the product differenti has given the dollar a veri strong lift against the euro sinc          and the expect of stronger growth in this countri have help until recent   now the question is  whi do peopl current think that the growth rate in the unit state is like to be firmer fair soon and sooner than in europ   i think there are a coupl of reason   even though financi market particip are express much gloom  as dino point out  they are behav as if a v shape recoveri or a u shape recoveri with a veri short           bottom is what they are anticip   in europ  peopl seem to feel more and more that the leader of the ecb are live in a bit of a dream world   peopl see the economi weaken but  with ecb offici make statement that everyth is all right  the percept is that the ecb is not in touch with realiti   that may or may not be true  but i think that   s a grow market percept  anoth relev factor in the fair recent past is the import of the agricultur sector in those european countri   as a share of gdp  agricultur realli isn   t veri import  but in the psych of the societi it   s immens import   if you had live in pari as i onc did or in london as i onc did  you would have thought you were in the middl of a farm economi   agricultur   s effect on the way peopl think  and on their confid and sens of well be  is extraordinarili larg  much larger than seem warrant by it share of gdp   and i think the malais about the foot and mouth diseas  spread as rapid as it is  has pull down busi and consum confid to a remark degre and that  too  is be reflect in the exchang rate differenti
how   that explan squar with  let   s say  the peak in the valu of the dollar in februari       after a big run up  and the subsequ big run down
it  sn   t   that look like an aberr that  sn   t have an explan on the basi either of the fundament or of either of the two factor i   ve cite   we can   t find anyth to explain that except an enorm market overshoot
and the product differenti  of cours  is actual a real rate of return differenti
which is sort of a standard   inde  that   s essenti what   was argu is go on at this particular stage
i want to follow up briefli on       s respons to tom hoenig   s question   one of the altern simul you typic includ in the  book last year was a lower nairu   i   m not a big fan of the nairu as a way of find out what the inflat rate is go to be  but if you continu to provid that altern simul with easier monetari polici  what would that say about inflat
there would be a signific disinfl built into the system   even with that easier monetari polici  you would have to eas even more aggress   we took that simul out this  e  not becaus we thought it was ani less import than it has been in the past but becaus we were concern about present too mani simul here   but that scenario basic suggest that at least anoth     basi point of eas would be necessari just to get the economi on the right track   that simul would still show inflat run a littl abov   percent on our baselin fund rate assumpt by the end of
ani further question for our colleagu   yes  presid pool
i have a question about the save rate   i   m sure that some of this intern debat you spoke of had to do with the save rate   perhap it   s a littl below zero  but let   s just assum it is zero for the moment   it   s a lot easier to           imagin it go to plus   than to minus    there   s a sort of asymmetri built into that situat   if the stock market return to more histor norm of behavior  whi shouldn   t we expect the person save rate to go back toward histor norm
well  it depend on what you mean by histor norm   if product growth were to return  let   s say  to the   to       percent rate that we experienc for a signific period of  e  that would be associ with a veri substanti declin in the stock market and a more substanti rise in the save rate   the save rate could perhap move closer to histor norm than we   re assum in our forecast   when i said in my brief that we had the equiti premium in this forecast move back toward histor norm  i said    given our assumpt for structur product growth     or word to that effect  which is signific abov the norm of the last    year
but product growth from  say       to      or      was not all that differ from what we   re look at today  yet the save rate back in that era was much  much higher
yes  but we   ve seen chang in the longer term trend in some compon of incom   for exampl  transfer incom  which involv a much higher propens to consum  is a larger share of incom now than it was in the     s   it can explain some of that longer term declin in the save rate   it   s clear that the save rate could still have a fair way to go on the up side   one other point i would make is to caution you not necessarili to take serious the current publish level of the save rate   that often is revis by a signific amount at  e of annual revis   we revis down the level of the save rate in this forecast in larg measur becaus we           think bea is use number for tax this year that ul  are like to be revis down   they   re more op ist about
it   s reconcil to the flow of fund number  which obvious are not fulli independ but still show pretti much the same trend
yes  inde   we   re talk about     billion or so here
well  there   s anoth possibl explan of this problem  which we   re in the process of tri to evalu at this point   if we look at the signific declin in the save rate on the nation incom and product account definit by use flow of fund data  rememb this exclud capit gain  what we find is not that net asset go down   in fact  they   re pretti much stabl   what   s caus the save rate to go down in an account sens is the veri dramat rise in debt  and that   s virtual all mortgag debt   what is differ about the earlier period versus the current period is the number of financi vehicl that enabl the extract of equiti out of home  such as home equiti loan and cash out refinanc   and by far not the least sourc of equiti extract is fund that becom avail as a consequ of the turnov of exist home   the use of all of those vehicl is signific higher in this recent period  enabl the normal unreal capit gain to be either realiz or convert to cash through the mortgag market   the problem with this explan  and it could explain the whole issu  is that it is not necessarili consist with a declin in the save rate base on equiti wealth   but it is consist if one argu  which we can  that the extract of equiti from home is a function of the unreal capit gain in the stock market   now  that   s a credibl sort of portfolio balanc argument  but it   s a bit of a stretch  if i may put it that way   so  until we can understand the actual           relationship between the equiti extract out of the mortgag market and it effect on the save rate and reconcil that to the capit gain in the equiti market  we   re not go to be abl to answer the question you rais   and i think it is a realli import question
that might be the mechan  but that  sn   t tell us whether it   s realli sustain in the long run to have such a veri low save rate
i   ve been worri about the save rate  too   dave  you said someth that at a minimum may caus me to revis a comment i was about to make in the go around   the person save rate is now negat     and by the end of the simul period it goe up to plus      a     percentag point turnaround   is ani of that a chang in the data or is that all behavior
the chang is behavior
the chang is all behavior
yes  it   s behavior   also  we don   t have the wealth incom ratio go back to the level where it had been earlier   so  even within the simpl framework that we use  there would be reason for the save rate to remain below it histor norm   that is just anoth factor   the save rate has fallen more in recent year than can be explain by the factor that we think drive it   so there is still a potenti  which i assum is your point  for some upsid risk associ with the save rate and the level that we   re project if whatev caus that save rate to declin revers itself go forward
further question   if not  who would like to start the roundtabl   presid parri

increas their save  pay down debt  and reduc big purchas more than seem to be the case right now   perhap a larger retrench will occur  but the continu strong pictur for employ and incom growth suggest that it might happen later rather than sooner  in that regard  i recent attend a meet of the polici board of the kennedi school  harvard univers joint center on hous studi   the group includ promin nation residenti builder and major supplier of build materi   in the go around  the larg nation builder note some region weak  but for the most part indic that they expect      to continu along the line of       which had been one of their best year ever   these builder had a suffici backlog of order to be relat confid about       though       of cours  remain a question   build materi supplier  in contrast  face excess suppli condit  consolid within their industri  and fall price  reflect stronger current consumpt data we  like the  book  have revis our gdp forecast upward slight for q   but our project for      remain about the same as earlier and quit close to that of the  book   this similar in outcom hide a number of differ in the number under the forecast  but onli one is signific   we remain less persuad than the board   s staff that   percent is a good es  for long term potenti growth   thus  our es  of the rise in the unemploy rate over the year      is about half the     plus basi point project in           the  book and we see measur of inflat flatten out in       not declin  inde  some on my staff find it hard to believ that unemploy could rise as much as in the  book forecast      basi point or so from it current level over a coupl of year  without a much bigger impact on demand  confid  and a host of other thing  and those develop  in turn  would necessit much more polici eas  clear  there are reason to believ that the risk either to the  book forecast or our own slight differ project remain on the down side   the stock market deterior  the foreign outlook  low read on busi and consum confid  high level of consum debt  the slowdown in manufactur  and the seem endless suppli of bad news in the high tech world all feed into these risk  but i think it   s also import to rememb that we are experienc a veri rapid slowdown from an extend period of extrem rapid econom growth   in part the gloom and doom  earn warn  layoff announc  and delay new plant invest  reflect an adjust from that period of robust growth   that could get out of hand  it   s true   but for now  labor market and spend indic suggest that gloom and doom should not complet rule the day
thank you  mr  chairman   some  it   s hard to know whether an anecdot report was intend to be good news or bad news   one of our director recent report that he had gone to a boat show and was told that they had sold onli nine person watercraft or jet ski this year compar to over a hundr last year   i said    that   s great      then he told me that he had bought one of the nine   laughter   but that report  togeth with a wall street journal stori about how well the           travel and boat show in columbus had gone  prompt us to call around the countri to find out how strong sale had been at travel and boat show in januari and februari  and they were surpris strong   in cleveland the attend was higher than last year and better than they had expect   larg boat sale were about the same as last year and small boat sale were stronger  which surpris the dealer   in chicago  detroit  and st  loui  the attend also was better than last year   onli the new york show experienc a small declin in attend  and our contact said it was becaus of advers weather condit dure the week of the show  we also saw some stori on corrug paperboard produc  first in the wall street journal in februari  and subsequ in cincinnati and cleveland newspap   so we did someth the journalist probabl would consid a dirti t   we call the same compani  often reach the same individu quot in those stori  to inquir about condit in that industri   and most of them disavow the way their stori had been portray in the articl   they said the situat wasn   t near as bad as had been report  though percept about how fast condit were improv appear to differ somewhat   most note a mark increas in sale in march relat to the first two month of the year  and none of the manufactur we contact expect a declin in sale for the year  more general  the report of director and advisori council member are as mix as the data we have been observ   there are pocket of strength and pocket of weak   in the case of larg truck and steel manufactur  there is sever weak that is expect to last for a coupl of year   but interest  ltv  which is in bankruptci and start last novemb had laid off     peopl  alreadi had recal               of those worker by earli februari   they now have     former worker who have not yet been recal or are reappli for lower pay job  while the general pictur in manufactur is one of weak  except includ such firm as air curtain manufactur  which report a record backlog of order  and interest  i thought  a manufactur of hot tub and patio furnitur   the latter report a strong rebound in sale recent   specif  our contact at that firm said that in late septemb earli octob order hit a wall and simpli stop   he describ the autumn month of      as the worst period he had experienc in the busi   those horribl month were follow by a flat decemb and then in januari and februari the compani had a huge increas     percent year over year  in order for hot tub and patio furnitur   and this is a firm that has been grow    to    percent a year for the last five year  anoth compani that is headquart in the district but manufactur and sell nationwid report that while order for construct materi general had been down in recent month  order for deck and side materi were at record level in decemb and januari   they complain about energi cost  of cours  but they said demand was out there   but even the energi sector is mix   a director report that a travel in ea n and central kentucki  where they produc coal and gas  will see a lot of celebratori high five  construct in the region also is mix   public sector infrastructur spend is still veri strong  anoth record year for orang barrel is expect   the residenti construct sector is describ as good  but the commerci sector is mix   there is strong demand for warehous space  which is in short suppli  but industri construct           spend is off signific and is expect to stay depress   peopl in the health care industri report that it   s still difficult to hire worker   they are still use recruit bonus and retent bonus and they say that cost pressur are go to be pass through to health care premium in the period ahead  we look at all the leisur sector  the recreat  travel  tourism  and entertain busi  and again found a mix pictur   there were report  howev  of signific overbuild of restaur  veri low occup rate in hotel and motel  and some movi theater chain that have overbuilt and will have to retrench  as for the nation economi  it now seem reason certain to me that the economi did not continu to slow in the first quarter as it did over the fourth quarter  and i think the  book general has the direct right in it forecast of real output growth  though i won   t go along with the staff on the unemploy number   i have to figur out whi i don   t go along with that project  it just  sn   t look right to me  mayb it   s the sort of thing that cathi suggest  that some other develop would occur if that employ pattern begin to materi  some of you may have seen the februari survey of the nation feder of industri and busi that was releas last week  their index of small busi op  rose in februari   i was especi interest in note that capit spend plan had rebound strong and also that there was a declin in the percentag of firm report that they had rais or plan to rais price   the survey also indic that credit avail was not a problem   of all the thing we look at  it appear that access to credit is not a problem confront this economi            if the pace of econom activ of the last quarter and this quarter were like to persist  then the current fund rate probabl would be too high   but it   s not at all clear that the current fund rate would be inconsist with the pace of econom activ that the  book project for the second half of this year and        the steep invers of the yield curv  especi for matur under one year  with the one year bill rate now even lower than the two year rate  on the surfac   suggest some restraint   but the explos growth of the various measur of money and credit   not  on balanc  i think our nation network of director and advisori council member have serv us veri well dure this whole episod   they assur that our recognit lag was veri short in the fourth quarter   we did act prompt  i believ  and we act substanti   and now i think our attent is go to have to turn to the question of when it will be  e to paus and let the effect of our action and the inher resili of this economi start to work through   thank you  mr

thank you  mr  chairman   over the past few week i   ve had more unsolicit call from concern busi leader than ever befor in my six and one half year in this job   that   s probabl becaus the seventh district economi is undergo a somewhat more notic slowdown than the nation economi  in larg part due to our relat greater concentr of manufactur industri   report from our manufactur sector contact have indic weak for some  e now  and we   re start to hear of some spillov effect in other sector of the economi as well  nevertheless  a few anecdot suggest that we may be near the bottom in manufactur  although that assess is still quit tentat   for exampl  much of our district   s slowdown reflect the automobil industri   s effort to bring inventori into better align with expect sale   as     mention  light vehicl product was cut sharpli over the past few month  and signific increas incent coupl with a larg volum of fleet sale boost light vehicl sale in           januari and februari to level that were higher than mani expect but were clear not sustain   our big three contact indic that sale so far in march have been quit strong  but below the elev januari februari pace   as a result  the industri suppli of light vehicl was brought back down to the usual desir    day by the end of februari   thus  signific progress has been made and the auto industri is probabl close to bottom out  although there are some import reason whi addit adjust may well be need  first  the    day suppli figur for februari is base on sale of      million unit  and the industri is not expect sale to be maintain at that lofti level   second  one of the big three recent scale back it financi support to dealer in a number of area  includ a signific reduct in inventori financ assist   and third  contact continu to say that they want to cut back on the expens incent program be offer to consum   as a result  second quarter product may not be as high as publish assembl schedul suggest   still  i think it   s fair to say that most of the inventori correct is behind us  report from contact in the paper and steel industri also tentat point to a bottom in the downturn   i  like jerri jordan  had some convers with a few peopl in the paper busi   one ceo with    year of experi in the industri said he had never seen a declin like this one  which has persist for such an extend period of  e   but he did indic that declin in shipment of corrug contain seem to be level off in march    also  capac util in the steel industri has increas over the past few week  which may suggest some stabil   on the other hand            report from industri such as heavi truck  construct and agricultur equip  print  and high tech continu to be veri negat  in larg part reflect weak in manufactur  our labor market eas consider earli this year   the unemploy rate for our five state move abov   percent for the first  e sinc mid      and we   re expect that soon it will be abov the nation rate for the first  e in       year  manufactur weak and job layoff appear to be have some impact on demand   sever contact report that capit spend plan were be delay or postpon   some also note that the manufactur slowdown had affect other industri such as softwar servic  travel  particular busi air travel  hotel  and tourism   retail sale in the midwest recent have been somewhat softer than in the nation and the hous sector indic for the midwest show less of an uptrend in recent month than the nation figur  mani busi peopl i   ve spoken with recent note that it has becom more difficult to obtain credit   that   s consist with the respons from bank in our district to the special senior loan offic survey  which indic a further tighten of credit standard and a widen of spread in the midwest  turn to the nation outlook  the downsid risk clear domin   wealth effect are now substanti negat and measur of consum confid have fallen rapid   prospect for growth abroad have deterior somewhat  as we   ve discuss  and firm appear to be scale back plan for capit spend   these current and prospect cutback by household and firm are have effect in sector of the economi beyond manufactur where weak has been concentr so far   while           this is normal in a period of slower growth  we should keep in mind the risk of further spillov   on balanc  howev  the data releas sinc our last meet have been consist with what still seem the most like scenario  name weak growth in the first half of the year follow by a rebound in the second half   inde  data on employ  retail sale  and especi homebuild have been stronger than one might have expect and unlik the behavior of an economi in the earli stage of a recess   and while not yet a major concern  it   s import for us to keep in mind that inflat measur also have come in on the high side of expect   nevertheless  i think a continu of our strategi of measur polici eas seem appropri for today
at our last meet i said that the beig book was the most negat i had seen  most negat in the sens of the most rapid deterior of condit  in both the summari of nation develop and the report on the eleventh district   i understand that it reflect condit in earli januari   the current beig book  reflect late februari  depict a somewhat better pictur   the eleventh district economi is soften but labor market remain fair tight despit high profil layoff announc   sinc the start of the year  dell  motorola  nokia  and texa instrument have all announc major layoff or earli retir program in texa  overal our job growth has slow to about half of the long run averag but has remain posit so far despit the spread of contract in manufactur to servic sector such as transport and retail trade   not long ago the texa economi had three posit go for it  higher energi price  strong high tech manufactur  and a strong mexican economi support texa export   high tech manufactur is now hurt           and the mexican economi has slow signific   of the three  onli high energi price remain  which is unfortun for the countri at larg and for most of texa as well  mexican real gdp  industri product  and hour work in manufactur declin in the fourth quarter of        our lead econom index for mexico has declin sinc septemb and is signal sluggish growth this year   texa export  which are predomin to mexico  declin in the fourth quarter   the maquiladora along the border are concentr in industri like auto and high tech that are experienc sharpli lower u s  demand   press report forecast maquila layoff of   to   percent   that has negat implic for u s  border town whose unemploy rate had final fallen below    percent over the past coupl of year   on the posit side  lower mortgag rate have help to support our hous sector  and beig book contact report a modest improv in construct relat manufactur  turn to the nation economi  the dramat declin in stock price  even sinc our last meet and includ dow blue chip stock as well as nasdaq tech stock  is domin discuss and make recess seem inevit to most of the peopl with whom i talk   opinion is about even divid between those who think we are about to be in a recess and those who think we alreadi are   it seem as if januari   st was a long  e ago and talk of the fed   s aggress action in januari has turn to talk of the fed be behind the curv   fifti basi point  which seem hefti in januari  is now regard by mani comment as inadequ today and like to disappoint financi market   frank  i don t see an easi way out of the box we seem to be in   i agre that we don   t want to appear to be eas polici to support the stock market  but i do believ the stock market is lead the economi down  nor do i want to be in a           posit of have polici dictat by talk head on wall street and in the press   the problem is that i think they   re probabl right   not take a particular action becaus they seem to be dictat it is react to them just as much as take an action becaus of them   i believ the argument for front load polici eas are just as valid today as they were at the last meet   a     point cut today has been expect and price into the market for quit a while now  and even so equiti market have tank and longer term rate have fallen relat to short rate   it will take a bolder move to revers the negat psycholog  includ the widespread feel that we   re behind the curv   we need to do more rather than less  sooner rather than later

thank you  mr  chairman   sift through the varieti of anecdot report we   ve been hear on the region  it appear that our district economi has perform about in line with what the nation statist have indic for the countri  name that growth has stabil at a low rate   if we look at the district by region  condit are veri mix   the part of the district that are do well are general the metropolitan area  the more rural area that are depend on natur resourc and manufactur are struggl   if we look at the district by various sector of the economi  we see a similar mix pictur  with some sector do quit nice and some have a difficult  e   in general  one bright spot clear is construct activ  which remain healthi pretti much throughout the district   anoth bright spot is employ  with the continu of tight labor market   but those taut labor market are accompani in some locat by report of acceler upward pressur on compens            at the nation level  as i   ve alreadi indic  i have no disagr with the  book   s es  for growth in the current quarter   it appear like to me that growth will turn out to be around   percent plus or minus  veri similar to rate in the fourth quarter   that is  econom growth has stabil at a low rate   our model has the economi gradual improv from here  quit similar to the general pattern in the  book forecast   i am concern about the inventori correct process still ahead of us  but presum that is reflect in the  book number   in addit  it seem to me that signific risk stem from potenti develop abroad   the list of foreign economi that are face difficulti of some kind seem disconcert long  and it  sn   t seem like to me that we will skate through all of those potenti difficulti without some reverber  on the other hand  the u s  economi has proven quit resili in the last    to    year   i think that is an import and fundament characterist  especi when monetari polici has been provid support  which it seem like to continu to do
thank you  mr  chairman   the slower pace of econom growth in the southeast persist  but one get the sens that thing may be bottom out  this overal perspect mask some veri differ stori by sector as well as substanti differ in the economi of our largest and strongest state  florida and georgia  and the smaller and less vibrant economi of alabama  mississippi  and tennesse  manufactur in our region has continu to slide  with cutback and layoff at high tech  chemic  steel  and pulp and paper compani   aerospac is also slow and may slow more sinc the big rocket program at lockhe martin appar has suffer a           cutback   our auto industri  which is now substanti  has not complet escap the industri adjust but  with a larg proport of our auto product repres by foreign manufactur with relat newer and more effici plant  the adjust have been less sever   in fact  our director from nissan report that his compani and other are continu to make veri larg invest in new plant and equip in the south   energi and shipbuild continu to be bright spot as well  a big chang has been the situat in the public sector   signific revenu problem now exist in alabama  mississippi  and tennesse  reflect the diverg growth path i mention earlier   larg cutback in educ spend are be impos and tennesse is impos an across the board reduct   tourism remain about the strongest sector in our district  with almost no report of slow   the snowbird have been flock to florida in record number and expect are for a strong spring break as well   perhap most import  futur book still look quit favor  residenti construct in januari and februari was at about the same respect level of a year ago   inventori of unsold home appear relat balanc  although some of our contact in atlanta  and in tampa and bradenton  florida indic some overbuild in the high end of the market   commerci construct has slow but remain relat healthi   a major architect told me last week that there was notic less new work in the pipelin  especi in high end hotel  as lender are demand more and more equiti in such project   i was also told ye day morn that three major tenant in the atlanta market who had been shop activ for larg           block of new space have put those plan on hold as the chief financi offic of their compani have taken the upper hand and are work to restor margin  labor market have loosen somewhat in certain market and skill area  unskil worker have becom more avail in recent week  but critic shortag remain for health care worker and inform technolog specialist   final  at the region level i would note that a combin of weaker demand and competit continu to hold down price except for the now familiar pressur point of health care and energi cost  on the nation front  the slowdown in the real economi  as oppos to that in the equiti market  appear to be stabil at a low but probabl still posit rate of growth   i continu to find it difficult to judg exact where we are in the inventori adjust process  the breadth and depth of the high tech adjust  with all it tentacl seem problemat and like to be more drawn out   and clear  our somewhat weaker economi is more vulner to shock of one kind or anoth   my own sens is that the rebound i still expect later this year is now less like to be the sharp v shape some peopl are talk about and more like to be at least somewhat more protract and a bit more moder   my think is color by my expect for consum spend and invest spend  while consum spend seem to have been somewhat resist to the sharp deterior in consum confid  i would cite sever argument for whi we should see consider moder in consum spend in the period ahead   after the spend bing of recent year  debt level have risen measur  as highlight in the  book                                                           run a veri larg consum credit           counsel servic that see        to        debt saddl individu across a wide rang of incom each year                                                                         that it seem as if the consum hit the wall late last year   her organ was bombard veri sudden and veri unexpect with a    percent year over year increas in call for counsel session in decemb                                                               she report that the increas pace of call had continu in januari and that her colleagu in similar busi elsewher in the countri had had a compar experi   when i ask her to follow up with her counselor regard what was drive peopl to seek help  she report back that it had been the combin of higher winter heat bill  higher gasolin cost  reduct in over  pay  and the fear of job loss  underscor how quick and how complet the over  pay had been elimin in that industri   he also note that the autowork are veri explicit in say that it was the over  incom that had fuel their aggress discretionari spend   and  howev one might view the wealth effect and it downsid impact now  one has to assum that the eros of net worth will sure interrupt the consum   s recent practic of spend all  and in some case more than all  of his or her current incom   so  consum spend seem like to grow onli moder  likewis  i now think invest spend on equip will rebound more moder and less quick than i had thought earlier   buyer can and like will put off their next round of expenditur on new technolog until they repair their margin and need more capac   i   m hear that whatev spend   go toward new technolog will be direct even more at cost control and cost reduct   supplier of technolog had their own excess to work off  with a rippl effect down the suppli chain   i still           believ veri strong in the promis of technolog and the posit thing that will come with it   but i think it will take a while befor we again see the type of invest bing that help the economi achiev the high rate of growth we had in the recent past  so  i would urg some caution regard the outlook for both consum and invest spend   and i would note that the  book as well as other forecast simul suggest that reason assumpt about the impact of aggreg demand shock  such as further cutback in consum or invest spend  princip will affect the output path over the first half of        more import  these advers shock onli moder affect the forecast for the second half of      and into        to me the infer one can draw from this simul is that a substanti easier monetari polici  or mayb even outsiz eas move  would have a minim impact on real output over the near term   this mean that our polici focus should be on the last half of      and into      rather than on the earli quarter of this year  which we have littl abil to affect   i   m bother by the grow percept that monetari polici can and should cure all the economi   s ach and pain and do it almost overnight   jerri  perhap the stori behind the demand for hot tub is that they cure pain    laughter  our recent experi serv as a remind to us that even a new economi can and will develop excess and imbal that have to be work through   and we need to resist the think that we should tri to fix the problem that invari come from unrealist invest   although monetari polici can provid a cushion dure such period  it cannot and should not prevent necessari adjust from take place   use outsiz polici eas to attempt to prevent those adjust would onli take our sight           off the longer run consequ for inflat and for futur growth that might stem from a too accommod monetari polici   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  our district economi would have to be describ as soft overal but condit are still mix  as i have been report for the last sever meet   manufactur activ in our tradit old economi industri like textil and furnitur and paper continu to weaken   we hear mani report of layoff  reduc hour  and decreas output in an effort to adjust inventori   like michael    i   m get a lot of letter and unsolicit advic  especi from my contact in the manufactur sector   much of that advic  incident  is not veri gentl    it seem fair clear that most of these industri are a lot weaker now than they were recent or weaker even than they have been sinc the last recess  condit are more dispar across the high tech manufactur industri we have in northern virginia and in the research triangl area of north  ina  but overal they   re still notabl softer than they were a year ago   factori shipment and order were up a littl in februari accord to our latest month survey of district manufactur activ  and similar to cathi     s comment about new england manufactur  the tone seem a bit stronger too   i should point out  howev  that this inform was gather sever week ago befor the big drop in equiti market  and these firm might not be quit as op ist now   so  the manufactur sector  sn   t look good  but elsewher condit seem a littl brighter  as mani other peopl around the tabl also have point out            retail sale and employ in our region were down in both januari and februari but  as in other part of the countri  car sale have pick up recent and store sale across the district have improv   residenti construct is still veri strong  with a lot of homebuild here in the washington area  though strength in that sector is appar uniform across the district   nonresidenti construct also continu to be reason healthi   we   re not hear quit as mani anecdot comment as we were earlier about extrem tight labor market but they are still reason firm  unemploy rate have not move much  they remain at quit low level in all our district state   north  ina is a bit of an except   while the unemploy rate is still at a low level in that state  it has move up a littl becaus of the heavi concentr of manufactur there   in sum  we have a veri weak pictur in the factori sector but modest encourag develop elsewher in our region economi  turn to the nation economi  i believ the situat we face today is particular difficult   clear  the equiti market have just finish one of the worst week in recent memori   earn forecast continu to be written down   also  larg layoff  especi in the high tech sector  have ad to the sens of uneas that has been move across the countri and in my view acceler of late   i think one would have to say that  at best  econom condit in the countri are fragil   still  if we compar this  book to the last one     i would say that there are ground for op   most import  the project growth in privat domest final purchas for the first quarter has been revis up signific from       percent to a littl over   percent  larg on the basi of actual data   you have a lot of inform to back up that forecast   all the major compon of privat demand  includ pce  busi fix           invest  and residenti invest look better now than they did in januari   in my judgment that is probabl due  at least in part  to the s ul impact of the fair signific drop in long term rate that we   ve had  and i think we need to keep that in mind   the    year treasuri rate is now all the way down to       percent   i think the more favor outlook also reflect some under confid in the longer run prospect for the u s  economi  a point that    son made veri well in a differ context   the sens i get from most of my contact is that we   re like to have a rough period in the near term but in the longer run the situat may not be so bad  the  book    of cours  expect near term weak   the project is that growth in real gdp will be held to below   percent by the continu drag from inventori adjust and by the drag from the foreign sector   but the inventori adjust is project to be complet by the third quarter of the year  and real gdp growth is forecast to be over   percent again by the fourth quarter   if we can get that result  i   d consid it a quit favor outcom  given the situat we   re face and some of the commentari we   re hear   and i think there   s a reason good chanc that we can  of cours  as everybodi know  the main risk in the outlook is that rise unemploy and fall stock price may caus busi and consum confid to fall signific further befor the inventori adjust is complet   in that regard the fact that the univers of michigan   s preliminari report did not show a further declin in it index of consum confid was encourag   i know the index has come down quit a lot from it peak but the paus report in the most recent figur was promis  given that a drop had been wide anticip   that may have been due in part to the fact           that the unemploy rate has not risen much to this point   also  the stock market declin  while dramat  in my view can still be call order to date   and while credit market condit are tighter  i don   t hear peopl tell me that credit is not avail  in that regard  we don   t have the kind of credit situat we   ve had in past slowdown  on balanc  given what we know now  i see no compel reason to believ that the reduct in the fund rate that were price into the term structur prior to last week   s stock market declin will be insuffici to carri the economi through the current inventori correct  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi remain sluggish but some sign of stabil are begin to appear   manufactur activ continu to declin and auto sale in most of our area remain relat weak  although some recent pickup has been note   incom data on other sector have had a more posit tone   interest  like      we realli did expect to find a lot of gloom and doom with respect to the real economi and we didn   t   we found some posit element in the situat  let me turn to specif   i   ll start with the slower industri first  which includ  of cours  manufactur   our bank   s most recent manufactur survey show a declin in januari   activ was below year ago level  for the first  e in the six year we   ve conduct this survey   capit spend was also down from a year ago  and purchas manag were not near as op ist about futur activ as they were earlier   one of our director                                  indic that his firm   s busi was down about   percent from a year ago due to lower export demand and also the effect in           rural area of the declin in wealth among hobbi farmer   he has had to lay off about one third of his workforc  a notic reduct in that particular market  consum spend remain soft but also has shown some sign of a firm  auto sale were down sharpli in januari but subsequ recov somewhat   and most of the retail we contact in februari said that their sale were about level and that they were see some increas in traffic   for exampl  one of our contact  a furnitur manufactur who sell in denver  report a signific increas in traffic and greater interest in some of their big ticket item   construct activ  while down from a year ago  rose sharpli in januari follow a poor decemb   retail and homebuild in some of our market view the slowdown relat to a year ago as a paus and they remain op ist about the period ahead  labor market develop also provid some evid that the district economi may be stabil   employ continu to grow in januari  the latest month for which we have data  and we have seen a notic reduct in layoff announc   perhap most import  our director and other contact tell us that most of the worker who have been laid off are be hire by other firm  so there has not been a great struggl in find employ given the job vacanc that exist   the suppli of labor may not be as tight as it was earlier  but labor also   not appear to be in excess suppli  energi activ is strong in our area   shortag of equip and worker actual have constrain drill activ   the equip seem to be becom avail but skill worker remain in short suppli   condit in the farm economi are mix  with livestock produc make a profit while grain produc will have to reli           onc again on govern subsidi   inflationari pressur in the district have remain modest  although we   ve seen some pickup in the general trend of inflat within the region  let me turn to the nation economi   recent develop indic that some broad base weak from the fourth quarter are spill over into the first quarter  like the board   s staff  we also expect growth in the first quarter to be relat slow  below the   percent mark   while this repres a mark slowdown  we also expect the u s  economi to continu to grow modest as we go forward  a view that is not inconsist with the staff   s forecast   moreov  recent inflat develop have been relat modest  a fact we certain recogn  though the pace of econom activ has been deceler  as i said earlier recent econom statist and report from busi contact in our district  and i think more general  suggest some stabil is occur   i was surpris at the relat favor outlook paint by the mani director and busi contact we talk with  but they had to look at the hard econom data and get their focus off the stock market in order to do that  sort through all these data and impress  i expect the economi to grow modest this year and into        howev  i also recogn that there   s a great deal of uncertainti in the near term and some downsid risk as well   on the down side  manufactur is clear in a slump  problem in the high tech sector have deepen  consum confid has plummet  and the stock market   s perform has nose dive   it has been report to me that ceo are put off new project and cut back on some exist project   while recogn this  i nonetheless judg that the most           like prospect for the u s  economi is that it will move back toward it long run trend growth   sever factor support that assess  includ our solid product trend  our stabl inflationari environ  and our sound financi institut   those factor will provid a strong foundat as we move into       given where we are  i would feel comfort with a modest reduct in interest rate from where they are now   a lot of momentum has been put into the economi through our eas move earlier this year   in addit to that eas i would support a further modest move  perhap for a total of    basi point  to insur against the downsid risk that we all recogn   those downsid risk stem from the larg and grow financi imbal in the economi  especi the unsustain low person save rate  the high level of consum debt  and difficulti in the foreign sector   if these imbal were to worsen  we could see a further deceler in activ or possibl an actual slowdown in the economi  in such an environ i would not be surpris if consum tri to boost their save  rebal their portfolio  and offset their loss of net worth  nor would i be surpris if busi tri to cut back on plan capit expenditur   such reaction have the potenti to magnifi the economi   s modest slowdown and precipit a drop in aggreg demand   in my view that possibl is the key risk to an order rebound in econom activ   and that   s whi in the current situat i support a modest polici move for insur purpos   i would be veri cautious about take more than a modest step becaus i believ there is a lot of s ulus in the economi that hasn   t yet shown through   monetari polici has long and variabl lag  so i also worri about the risk that our eas action could becom procycl  with further s ulus come into           the economi as it move  in the scenario paint by the  book and other around this tabl  out of it current slowdown   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   condit around the eighth district are veri similar to those describ by other who have alreadi comment   the situat is mix  but on the whole activ is flat to okay   the mood is decid wors than the realiti  but i don   t detect a huge amount of concern and fear   the way i would put it is that there   s just a sens of uneasi  when i call my                           the first word out of his mouth were that a realli bad februari   he said that the volum in the domest express busi  that   s the air part of the busi  was actual below that of februari last year  a signific drop   the ground busi was up   percent year over year  but that was   percentag point below the pace it had been run   that slowdown primarili reflect the                            ship a lot of auto and comput part  area where a signific inventori adjust is take place                          custom believ that the inventori adjust is most complet and they anticip a return to normal ship pattern by late spring or earli summer  while my contact start out by say that the compani had a realli bad februari  he said the declin were not horrif  just a few percentag point   he also indic that the declin did not seem to be continu  there was a lot of new busi in the pipelin   he point out that the ground busi is still grow  appar reflect some substitut of ground shipment for air shipment becaus of less need for quick deliveri and  of cours  a cheaper mean of transport   he also said that           not plan ani layoff nor even reduc employ by attrit   they find no signific wage reduct in the work  but their execut bonus are go to be down quit a bit   on the whole  labor market condit are easier  but the firm continu to have problem find qualiti entri level recruit   he note  howev  that almost no it peopl have left in the last few month  which is of cours consist with the shakeout we   re observ in the dot com industri  my                      point in particular to veri weak condit in intern busi  especi in asia  which is probabl relat to the fact that a lot of comput part are ship out of asia   he said that south america is show a similar trend but that busi in europ remain quit strong                          has put a freez on promot and new hire   the compani seem to be under quit a bit of profit pressur and is reduc employ through attrit   the outlook  howev  is not terribl negat  though my contact   see signific pressur on labor cost in the airlin industri   the term of the unit airlin settlement of last year are go to spread through the industri and                                calcul  that will add    cent per packag to                     so they   re see a lot of upward pressur on their oper cost  i also call a senior offici                       to ask about recent trend in it busi   he said that he see no signific chang in the buy custom  the mix of good remain about the same   total traffic is down a littl but not a lot   he said that                          decid last june that activ was slow down quit a bit  it show up first in                         store and later in                                        howev  the compani came out of the holiday season in excel shape on inventori            there is no inventori overhang at that compani   my contact expect sale to remain relat flat  but he said that his    fallback    expect was that busi was go to get better rather than wors  he made an interest comment about the labor market   he said that expect an increas in the minimum wage and had alreadi put through some wage increas in anticip of that   of cours  the compani is not go to take those rais back even though a minimum wage increas was not enact  but anticipatori increas of that sort could explain some of the wage number we have observ  one final note  he report                                   a regular phone survey of about        of it custom  a signific sampl  and detect a lot of fear of be laid off   that seem to be the main news from that survey  i want to make three comment about our situat   a number of peopl have comment about the equiti market   my observ is that it   s veri  veri unfortun that investor in that market keep look to the fomc to bail them out   a reassess of the earn prospect in the tech busi is take place   that involv a real readjust  have to do with the natur of that busi and judgment on whether excess invest exist that need to be work off   i know that a lot of fiber optic cabl has been laid all over the countri  which may have involv some excess invest   that   s a real adjust  and the equiti market ought not to be look to us to fix that problem becaus it is not anyth we can fix  second  money growth has been veri high   the current environ is not at all typic of recess environ in the past   if we look at the number  the narrow           aggreg that i prefer  mzm  grew at annual rate of    percent in decemb     percent in januari  and    percent in februari   m  grew at an annual rate of    percent in decemb     percent in januari  and    percent in februari   so  money growth has been quit high   my sens is that credit is somewhat tighter than it was but is still readili avail  anyon with a reason bankabl proposit can find fund  third  i would like to see us come out of this meet in a postur that   not fo  widespread expect that our next polici adjust will be anoth reduct in the fund rate   in my view we ought to tri to get ourselv in the center of the rang so that the odd are more or less equal that the next polici move is go to be an increas rather than a decreas in the fund rate  also  i think the balanc of risk languag for the weight toward weak option is direct in mean   to me it impli that we expect the economi to be go down   but the consensus forecast is for continu veri slow growth in the economi  not a declin   that   s not to say that a declin will not occur  but the best guess is that real gdp will grow at a rate of about zero to   percent   that   s the consensus of privat forecast  though obvious the spread involv es  abov and below that rang   nevertheless  that   s the averag of the blue chip forecast and also what the philadelphia fed survey show  so  these observ lead me to believ that today we ought to use languag indic that the risk are balanc on either side   if this realli is an inventori adjust and if we   re almost through it  then we   re go to see a rebound   that   s the logic of an inventori adjust  that we will see a rebound in product   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   a number of you have made the point that the pictur is mix   i m remind of a statement that an old  e basebal manag  paul    onc made when his team was in the middl of a lose streak  he said     no team is as good as it look when it   s win or as bad as it look when it   s lose      there is a sens in which that statement can be appli to the economi   last year when the economi was on what i   ll call a win streak we  or mayb i should say i  took great pride in the growth of high tech invest   that growth now appear to have been somewhat excess and the so call overhang of high tech good may be lead to problem now   this year  when the economi seem to be on a lose streak  thing may not be as weak as they seem either  one get a veri differ pictur from look at differ sourc of data  there s a kind of hierarchi of op  out there   the strongest read come from the labor market where at this point the chang in unemploy and other measur of labor demand have been moder   use the unemploy number to infer gdp growth lead to an es  real growth rate in this quarter of about       percent   next in the hierarchi come final demand market where the pictur is more mix   auto spend  as you know  contract sharpli but has turn back up   there is still some real growth in high tech spend   hous construct and overal consumpt spend have held up fair well   this all lead to an es  of real growth in this quarter  i m guess  of between     and   percent   the terribl pictur  obvious  come from the stock market   and part of the difficulti involv in interpret that is to determin whether the recent declin in stock price are just a stock market phenomenon or whether they foretel a deeper real messag that we should be heed            as for the  book  the op ist side of me can actual find two way in which the baselin forecast is too negat   first  as the  book acknowledg  the monetari assumpt under that forecast is that the fed cut rate    basi point at this meet and then stand pat   if the fed fund futur market is ani guid  that is not the most like outcom   the futur market has the fund rate drop to      percent by this fall  with current long term rate presum incorpor this expect   the simul label    easier monetari polici    more close incorpor the assumpt in the futur market  and the outcom in that simul is slight more posit than the baselin  the second reason i may be slight less bearish than the staff involv the wealth effect   we ve talk about that a lot this morn   my own concern about it is that in the past few year as stock were rise we attribut the strong growth in consumpt larg to the wealth effect   i   m not question that attribut  but it strike me that the wealth effect is not work as power on the down side   stock valu are bare higher than their level of two year ago   the wealth to incom ratio has been declin for a while  yet consumpt is still veri high relat to dispos incom  with the person save rate this quarter declin further to     percent   the save rate may rise from this extraordinarili low level  but the staff has it turn around   i would say reason sharpli  to     percent by the end of the simul period  basic i am a cheerlead for high save and i don t necessarili approv of it current low level   but if all these consum who were led to consum more by earlier stock increas are now lock into a higher consumpt lifestyl  person consumpt may hold up better than the staff is forecast   call it a    habit format    consumpt           function   i don t know how much weight to put on this  but i put a littl weight on the  book simul that is label    strong demand     have made these posit point  i still favor eas monetari polici today  one reason is that we can hard take solac in low feder fund futur rate and associ long term rate if we are not prepar to take the step necessari to valid that expect   anoth reason is that there still are veri  veri serious downsid risk  and a third reason is that even in the more op ist forecast  the unemploy rate rise more than i think is necessari to control inflat   that is a point that nobodi realli has made yet   even if there is no recess  even if the economi bottom out at a slow rate of growth  i person think we should still worri about the grow output gap  and yes  cathi  i am a product op ist in say that  anoth way to view all this is to look at the fund rate in real term   the staff has done an exercis that correct the nomin fund rate by expect core pce inflat deriv from a regress model   this lead to an es  current real fund rate of about     percent  which is close to it averag for the past five year though still abov the averag for the past    year   altern  in a forward look calcul the present real rate of     percent is about equal to the tax adjust real forward rate from the tip market   whether look backward or forward  by these calcul monetari polici is rough in neutral postur right now  and i feel strong that in this environ we should be lean against the downward risk   so i agre with paul     s dictum in that the situat may not be as weak as it appear  but i do think we ought to be eas monetari polici   thank you
i think we better break for coffe or els it will get veri cold   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   the baselin in the  book attempt to paint what i would describ as a middl of the road outlook for the economi  with some sign  mayb prematur  that the bottom has been reach   inde  as i   ve heard other around the tabl say and as i look at the data myself  it s clear that one could read some of the incom inform as indic that perhap the pace of weaken in the economi has not acceler   retail sale and light vehicl sale still appear to be hold up fair well   at least one survey of consum confid suggest a turnaround  though that survey was taken befor the most recent break in the stock market   the hous market continu to show some sign of life   and final  there is some evid that the inventori adjust  while still in train  may have slacken   so there is some reason  perhap  to be cautious op ist  have said that  i have a number of concern   with respect to the baselin forecast  i agre with the point that cathi   made first and a few other pick up  it seem a bit incongru that growth is forecast to return to a rate veri close to potenti and yet the unemploy rate is project to rise to a somewhat higher number than i think is consist with noninflationari growth   so i share some of the uneas that other have felt about the baselin in term of the interact between growth  the unemploy rate  and the monetari polici assumpt in that forecast            the second point i   d like to make is that while we certain can be hope that the economi may have reach a bottom  we shouldn t let hope triumph over some sens of realiti   beyond my concern about the baselin forecast itself  i am concern  as are other  about a number of downsid risk to the baselin scenario  and i believ they eventu will demand a total polici respons greater than that envis in the baselin   one of the major risk is that the capit good overhang is greater than the  book assum and that invest  therefor  will slow more signific and for a longer period than is current anticip   the  book actual state that    in the staff project  actual and desir stock of capit are assum to be in reason close align at the present  e     impli that invest will hold up well  i think that s a rather bold assumpt  given these uncertain  e   some relat simpl work with the under model suggest that we may find that not to be the case   use some reason assumpt  the model equat indic that the invest in high tech good in the fourth quarter could have been as much as    percent higher than target level   and with the standard model paramet that could easili produc a scenario in which high tech invest might grow in low singl digit  below   percent  between now and      or            indic in his remark that there was a rang of potenti outcom   rapid downshift profit forecast  combin with less accommod financi condit from a declin stock market and bank that are tighten term and condit in the face of monetari eas  make a slower path of invest a strong possibl in my view   that may not be the most like scenario but it is not one that we can reject out of hand            of greater concern  obvious  is that if we do get the slow in high tech capit stock growth  it would undermin the increas in product that we ve experienc of late   and it could lead to an even further falloff in the gdp  a result i think the staff appropri captur in it product slowdown simul  which  in my judgment  is a terribl unattract outcom  a third risk is that the weak in equiti market might be more sever damag to consum confid  and ul  spend  than has been the case to date   mani of us have note the appar disconnect between confid measur  which are at close to recessionari level  and actual data on spend  which are reason strong   if this disconnect continu  how this tension will be resolv is as yet unknow   clear we are go to need more data befor we can assum that the worst is realli behind us   contrari to the assumpt in the baselin  i think the risk is veri real that consum confid will be undermin further by a jitteri stock market  which may or may not soon stabil  and by the specter of unemploy  which is certain go to get wors befor it get better   negat wealth effect will certain hold down consumpt growth both this year and next  make our challeng even greater   the fed of the earli     s was confront with bank that were afraid to lend  we may yet enter a period with consum who are too concern to spend  if ani of these outcom were to come to pass  the growth rate of gdp would be well below potenti for sever year  too long  in my judgment   and unemploy would rise to level that are by almost ani es  abov the level requir to restrain inflat   in this circumst it seem to me that the best respons is one that i would describ as both aggress and cautious   on the one hand  i think we have to respond           veri clear to the incom data   we should not be afraid to do what we think is right for the real economi becaus of some concern about disappoint the market and not acced to unreason market expect   on the other hand  we should not be over cautious in adjust monetari polici out of some concern that we may be perceiv to be feed the market   in my view we also will need a great deal of flexibl in the period ahead becaus  though the incom data suggest that the economi may be bottom out  the evid is still quit mix  as mani of you have assert  such a polici respons is not without it own challeng  as i m sure we will discuss   but we must recogn that we are in a riski environ regardless of what path we choos   we are deal with both an uncertain real economi and unpredict psycholog among consum and busi   we will have to tread veri care  but i think we should not be paralyz by the uncertainti that we face   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district economi is hold up rather well  with the labor market quit strong and continu strength in hous   despit much gloom on wall street  which i will discuss later  employ level in new york citi are hold up extrem well   that may relat to the fact that restaur are open in manhattan at a record pace and some of the staff look less like out of work actor and actress and more like high tech type  in the manufactur sector  purchas manag in the district report slow growth  though the automot sector  which is veri import in we n new york           becaus of the volum of part we suppli  is show sign of recoveri   the purchas manag outsid manufactur give an increas dreari review of current condit  which make me think that their spous probabl work on wall street  the gloom on wall street has reach the point of advanc silli  i think  it remind me of dicken    descript of a london fog in that it is permeat absolut everyth   the mood is self perpetu and contagi  and there   s veri littl that more op ist or more realist peopl like us can do about it except not fall prey to it ourselv  peopl in the ventur capit communiti  who tend to be rather realist  especi those in the experienc firm  are be veri cautious   they are reluct to financ even relat promis compani that are struggl current   a lot of those compani are in the high tech sector  and i think the retic of the ventur capit firm will probabl bring down some compani that deserv to surviv  ad to the sector   s problem of not be abl to provid the creativ juic that the economi need  i believ the downsid risk to our economi are consider and sinc other have discuss that subject rather thorough i won t add to it  in the last coupl of month i have been an intern sale manag for the new basel capit accord  and have been around the world liter   so  let me talk a bit about the concern i have outsid the unit state   i have alreadi talk about europ  where the qualiti of leadership   not seem to be what is need at the polit level and perhap not in the financ ministri or central bank either   their neighbor  turkey  is go through a problem  which was almost pure polit in natur  although it becam econom veri quick            given the question futur of oil price  i think we have to keep in mind the issu of polit stabil in the middl east   a return to anyth like the veri low oil price of a coupl year ago would place in real question the stabil of some oil  produc countri   of particular concern are those with age and not veri flexibl monarch and a societi that has becom quit accustom to a much higher level of spend than a low oil price can financ   that is a situat on which we have to keep a weather eye  we talk earlier about japan   the promis develop in japan is that for the first  e it leader actual are talk in a fair serious way about reform of the financi sector  which they should have done twelv year ago   the minist in charg of the area  mr  yanagisawa  is extrem sound   he s at least as knowledg about restructur a privat financi sector as anybodi i ve ever met  so there s no lack of knowledg regard what to do   if the countri   s leader are get close to the point of think that they simpli cannot plot a reason futur unless they reform the financi sector  it might just get done   it s go to be veri difficult   i don t think one would want to take even       odd on it   but they are closer to talk and to think about do the right thing than at ani  e i recal sinc the bubbl burst at the end of the     s  the asian tiger economi are at veri serious risk in my judgment   there is much talk about their depend on japan   actual  they are not depend on japan  they assum that japan will be in recess or close to it  but they are veri depend on export to the unit state and europ   virtual all the countri have accomplish essenti no structur reform sinc the asian crisi in      and  therefor  weak           export could easili result in consider difficulti in a number of countri whose success is so much tie to export  in argentina there is a littl breath of life   the news sinc our convers this morn is that mr  cavallo is appar go to be the econom minist   he is meet as we speak with the governor of the provinc  most of whom are from the peronista parti  which mean that he is probabl tri to cobbl togeth a polit coalit   you no doubt recal that he was the econom minist for presid menem  whose polit skill along with mr  cavallo   s technic econom skill were a veri favor combin for the countri   it s import that argentina emerg from this situat in good shape becaus the polit system in brazil is look rather fragil  the number of corrupt case that are get near the presid and his closest minist is increas to the point that a polit or econom contagion come from argentina might find brazil not terribl capabl of deal with it  so  i think the downsid risk come from outsid of our countri is veri consider inde  with a number of accid look as if they could happen   the likelihood of escap all of them would impress me as quit low   given that situat  i veri much sympath with what governor   just said   i think the stanc of monetari polici has to make two thing clear to all observ   one is that we will eas when we need to  includ today   the second is that in addit to today   s move  we are prepar to act if and when necessari   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   there s veri littl that i can add at this point about the economi  so i   ll be brief   but let me tri to summar the situat            it was     percent predict well in advanc of the econom slowdown that go through such a period would be pain   we are now in a slowdown and it is pain   it was almost as certain that after a period of slow a  e would come when we would welcom an upturn but would have to go through a veri disconcert stretch of uncertainti about whether an upturn or more declin was in the card   we seem to be in that stage now   in recent day we   ve all been studi the data  read analys  receiv brief  and share idea   the bottom line would seem to be this  while there are good reason to believ that the economi will soon turn up  and i believ that is the highest probabl outcom  we cannot know or be over confid that an upturn is in train   it is still possibl that the various negat forc exist today will drag us into further weak   our polici choic must be made in the face of this veri fundament uncertainti  in golf  which i play poor  club select befor a shot usual present the player with three option  an aggress choic  a central tendenc  and a conserv choic    laughter   each option usual has it own plausibl   in differ situat a player might well go with ani of the option  depend on his or her object at the  e and an assess of the risk   short i expect don kohn to tell us that in this game a conserv choic is to eas    basi point     basi point is a central tendenc  and    is aggress   of cours  the loudest voic in the galleri want us to go for it  but that  sn t mean that we should   in defer to your request that member not discuss polici posit until the next part of the meet  mr  chairman  i will withhold further comment until then    laughter
tell me whether you re use your five iron or your six iron
or is he use his driver    laughter
three high interrel develop over the intermeet period have  in my view  strengthen the case for further eas   the first relat to the more power negat wealth effect due to the slide in equiti price  the further declin in consum confid  the possibl of a more serious shakeout or retrench in high tech invest  and the prospect for weaker foreign growth   all those factor point to weaker consum and invest spend and weaker export over the forecast period for a given fund rate path   despit these concern  the incom data are mix and there is consider uncertainti about the strength of spend go forward  a second consider reinforc the case for further eas is that broader financi condit have not eas  at least not appreci  despit the declin in the fund rate to date and despit expect in the market for consider further declin in the fund rate   instead  the declin in equiti price and the strengthen of the dollar have signific offset the s ulus from lower short term interest rate  third  and perhap more specul  although     mention this in his present  recent develop may be consist with a declin in the economi   s equilibrium real interest rate   the staff  as you know  has been work on es  a  e vari measur of the equilibrium real fund rate   one of the key driver of the equilibrium real rate is the equiti premium   to the extent that the recent declin in equiti price is a reassess of fundament valu rather than a cyclic           correct  it impli a rise in the equiti premium and a declin in the equilibrium real rate   in this case  the feder fund rate might need to be lower more aggress than would be suggest by movement in the output gap or inflat   of cours  this line of analysi has some implic for the appropri respons to a decreas in the equiti premium  but that   s anoth stori  let me turn to the question of whi the economi has slow so sharpli and what the implic are for the forecast and the polici respons   one hypothesi is that we   re in the middl of an it inventori correct  one that is sharper and fa  than tradit inventori correct but with less persist   this would be consist with the so call v shape recoveri   i don t disagre that the current inventori correct may be sharper and swifter than tradit correct  but i do not think that is the most import theme in the stori nor even the most import way in which new economi develop are shape the slowdown   the deeper stori in my view is the interact of a cyclic slowdown and a correct of pre exist imbal  such a correct of imbal is quit typic of recess and  inde  often contribut to the sever of downturn   i will focus on two interrel imbal at the start of the slowdown   one is the valuat of equiti  particular of high tech firm  the second is the rate of high tech invest and or stock of high tech capit good  first  consid the consequ of the appar equiti correct   the staff es  that the wealth effect  after ad as much as       percentag point to consum spend growth in the second half of       will be subtract about   percentag point throughout the forecast period   that will result in growth of consum           spend at a rate below the growth in gdp   the tax cut assumpt in the forecast make onli a slight dent in the short run   as a result  return to trend growth over the forecast period requir a strong rebound in invest  unfortun  the second imbal may be in the level of high tech capit or at least in the rate of high tech invest   the v shape recoveri depend on a strong rebound in invest  reflect continu high structur product growth and an associ high expect rate of return on high tech invest   but we also have to put into the invest mix the legaci of excess associ with the frenzi pace of invest over the last few year   the result may be a period of shakeout or retrench in high tech invest that weigh against a quick and sharp rebound  let me turn now to a critic set of assumpt underpin the  book forecast   they happen to be veri import in assess the degre of cumul eas that might be requir   despit veri similar path for output  the  book and blue chip forecast show veri differ path for the unemploy rate   this is exact the issu that presid   remark on earlier and that a number of other also have mention today   the blue chip forecast  assum what appear to be a similar polici path to that in the  book  depict a quit benign soft land  with the unemploy rate move just abov       percent  close to the short run nairu  and growth near trend in        in contrast  with about the same output path  the  book has the unemploy rate a full percentag point higher and growth still slight below trend in        as a result  that would call for a more aggress eas over the forecast period  the first key assumpt behind this differ  as presid   note  is the under rate of product growth   the staff assum that structur product           growth is almost     percentag point higher than the assumpt implicit in the blue chip forecast   this explain a bit less than one half of the differ  the second key may be how     s law is be appli   the blue chip forecast seem consist with appli a simpl static form of     s law   the staff appear to be appli a dynam version  take into account the delay effect of the slowdown to date  most of which has not yet pass through to employ   it   s hard to argu with the  book approach in this case   but there are some consider that might support a differ dynam in the labor market respons to a slow in growth  one exampl is the reluct of firm to lay off worker  given the recent difficulti in hire them   at ani rate  these consider increas the difficulti of assess at this point just how much eas will be appropri and provid a rational for a gradual  increment strategi of eas
thank you all   mr  kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data  while mix  have indic that the economi has been grow at best at a sluggish pace   moreov  a number of sign suggest weak ahead  downward revis to sale and earn forecast of mani firm point to continu restraint on invest spend  and the associ decreas in equiti price along with lower consum confid will also be damp consumpt demand   against this background  outsid comment see you debat between a    and a    basi point reduct in the target feder fund rate at this meet   primari dealer economist are split close to       on which you will choos  and market interest rate now seem to have built in similar odd as well   i thought i would concentr my remark this morn on this choic   although the staff forecast assum a    basi point reduct in the fund rate at this meet  element of that forecast provid good support for the more aggress action  to be sure  most interest rate  both long  and short term  alreadi are a percentag point or more below their averag level in decemb  befor you start eas  but equiti price have drop    percent sinc then           and the foreign exchang valu of the dollar has risen   percent   as a consequ  the amount of financi s ulus in the pipelin to bol  a rebound in the growth of aggreg demand is much smaller than might otherwis be expect   moreov  becaus market are place some weight on a    basi point move  a further    basi point reduct in the fund rate at this meet is unlik to boost the stock market  depreci the dollar  or lower bond yield   with limit follow through in financi market from polici eas  as dave has explain  econom growth remain below the growth of potenti in the staff forecast and the unemploy rate rise rapid   although some relief of the labor market pressur of last spring may not be an entir unwelcom develop  the rise in the unemploy rate in the staff forecast may be too rapid and the level too high for you to find desir   the rate move abov the nairu built into the staff forecast  give a downward tilt to core consum inflat in      and presum thereaft  moreov  the committe may see high odd on even less inflat pressur than implicit in the staff forecast if it suspect that the nairu may be lower than the staff judg it to be and may prefer to conduct polici on that work hypothesi until evid more strong suggest otherwis   if you accept the staff   s assess of the strength of aggreg demand but do not put a prioriti at this  e on reduc inflat next year  you might consid the larger     basi point reduct in the fund rate at this meet to be appropri   the argument for such a reduct could be reinforc if the committe saw the risk around the staff   s outlook for aggreg demand to be substanti and asymmetr toward lower growth  although the staff forecast incorpor consider weak in high tech invest  the extent of the shortfal in sale of such equip and the associ earn revis and stock price declin could be indic of a larger overhang of this capit than in the staff forecast   moreov  as pessim about the earn outlook seem to spread last week beyond the high tech sector  it was accompani by a whiff of a general increas in both percept of risk and avers to take on risk   if that sen ent intensifi  credit condit could tighten substanti for mani more u s  borrow   greater risk avers  and an associ tendenc for contagion from one market to anoth  might also have a mark effect intern  rais risk premium and reduc credit avail to govern and privat borrow in countri in which the fundament outlook is alreadi be call into question   this possibl would tend to accentu the           downsid risk in the global economi  a sourc of concern that   has alreadi highlight   it has been unusu for the committe to give consider weight to the balanc of risk  rather than the most like forecast  when decid on it polici stanc   in part  that   s becaus such skew don   t usual appear larg enough to rais signific concern relat to the alreadi difficult issu present by determin the central tendenc of the econom forecast and settl on an appropri polici respons   even when the risk are larg  the committe may recogn that buy protect against potenti develop can have signific and continu cost in that such action fo  less desir outcom in term of real activ or inflat if those potenti develop never occur   final  there is anoth approach  albeit not quit as pre emptiv  that can minim some of the potenti cost when you see outsiz risk on one side   that is to be prepar to respond rapid should you get earli evid that the develop that concern you are in fact materi   in the current circumst  such an approach might argu in favor of a    basi point eas but a willing to act prompt  even befor the next meet  if necessari  should  for exampl  demand show sign of weaken further or financi market tighten substanti   in addit  a good bit of the recent evid on demand and econom activ may be read as weigh in favor of the less aggress    basi point altern   in particular  spend and employ have held up better than anticip by the staff in the januari forecast   by themselv  these data indic stronger growth than the  book es  for the first quarter  suggest the possibl that the risk may not be all on one side  that under demand may be stronger than in the staff forecast or the market   s percept and the inventori correct closer to be complet   moreov  januari data on core consum price highlight a pattern of acceler over the last year that could prove troublesom if the econom rebound were signific stronger or fa  than in the staff forecast   in financi market  your eas move may well be have more construct and support effect than is appar by just focus on chang in interest rate  exchang rate  and equiti price   credit market have accommod a larg volum of borrow  and decreas in bond and mortgag interest rate have encourag a consider lengthen in liabil structur  which will leav both busi and household less expos to short run           variat in credit avail   the fact that risk spread did not widen much  and not at all until veri late in the intermeet period  despit ongo downward revis to earn expect  may in part be a reflect of declin in long term interest rate hold down debt servic burden and henc percept of borrow risk   moreov  money growth has been quit rapid   some of this growth may be the result of greater demand for liquid in an uncertain economi   but  in contrast to the earli     s  depositori seem will to accommod this demand and provid credit to borrow  albeit at somewhat wider spread   the opposit outcom  low money growth after decreas in interest rate  would have been a worrisom sign that incom and spend were fall short of expect or that depositori were less will to carri out their intermediari function   final  the interplay of your action and market expect may also argu on the side of hold the eas action to    basi point   market particip see a    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate as an altern part becaus  by your action in januari  you rais the bar for what is consid forc action  the most import aspect of the market   s expect is the overal trajectori of polici action built into intermedi  and long term interest rate   if  for now  you are satisfi with the expect that are like to be built into the yield curv after you move    basi point  you can proceed gradual  even if you suspect that more eas may well be need at some point   at this  e  market have price in a declin in the feder fund rate to below       percent by the end of the year   eas by    instead of    basi point is like to rais this expect path some  but it is not like to chang the basic shape   if you think that a declin in the fund rate of this dimens impli low enough intermedi  and long term interest rate to promot sustain growth  the less aggress adjust should not be a problem   you do need to consid this assess in light of the drop in equiti price that like would follow a    basi point eas  depend in part on the word of your announc  it could be substanti inasmuch as equiti market particip seem to be count on you to stop the slide   but you also need to consid how success an extra    basi point is like to be in that regard  the downward movement in equiti price is primarili a consequ of disappoint earn and a better appreci of risk  especi in the high tech sector   and it is like to continu until that disappoint come to an end  whatev the discount factor use to valu earn stream   if the drop in equiti price is substanti after a    basi point move  market will prevent it           from tighten overal financi condit to it full extent  becaus they will also price in more eas later
question for don     let me follow on then  the one statist that has not been mention today  which in fact i find the most worrisom on the down side  is the persist downward revis in week forecast of s p     earn per share for the year        those forecast have been reduc for the first three quarter of this year and  as i recal  for the fourth quarter as well   the downward revis have persist through the latest week for which we have data  which was last week   if we look at the year as a whole on a chart  the expect chang in per share earn seem to be go straight down   the main problem is not so much the direct  it   s that the slope has not chang   the degre of eros seem to be continu  and it s not all account for by high tech industri   our es  is that onli about half the revis involv the high tech sector  one consequ of the bleak near term earn outlook is that we are begin to see a signific amount of capit invest plan be place on the shelf   it   s not that expect of rate of return are be materi reduc for the longer term   they are not  and in fact the discuss we had earlier with respect to the outlook for the foreign exchang rate seem correct suggest of the fact that longer term earn expect are hold up becaus the strength in product is still there  what has happen is that the current uncertainti engend by the sharp of the slow in the rate of econom growth have increas discount factor and hurdl rate of return in the market   in a sens  that has made a lot of project that were viabl in the context of the hurdl rate of a year ago no longer viabl in term of           today s hurdl rate   it  sn t mean that all these project are cancel  but it   mean that a substanti number are be delay   in term of how fast such delay can materi  one just has to visual a simpl model involv the high tech sector  where our data show an increas in capac of    percent over the past year   that affect a signific larg part of the economi  and it   s clear a rate of increas that cannot persist indefinit   i don   t know what the relationship is in the high tech area between outlay for replac and modern and outlay for capac expans  but if we assum that replac and modern expenditur do not chang as the growth in expenditur for new capac fall from    percent to  say     percent  a still veri dramat and strong increas  growth of capit invest obvious will declin by    percentag point   and when we consid the fact that such invest has been go up veri dramat  the downward spike that we are look at is veri impress  wholli independ of the question as to whether there has been a fundament chang in the longer term outlook   it   s the acceler in invest expenditur in      and      that has set up this particular pattern  and the falloff in profit expect is feed this whole process   so the possibl that we may end up with a much lower capit invest number for the year than we forecast is not to be readili dismiss   i say that without ani expect that substanti reduc growth in capit invest will continu beyond this year  becaus of the declin in expect earn and the obvious veri sharp contract in profit  we are also get some slow in expenditur from the wealth effect  not as much as one would expect  but still some   moreov  the overal slow in both capit invest and person consumpt expenditur  especi           late last year  induc a fair signific backup of inventori  actual  disproportion in the high tech area   if we look at the inventori sale ratio in various segment of the economi it   s pretti obvious  howev we calcul these ratio  that the inventori backup in the high tech sector has been complet unanticip and that high tech firm as a group have run into some difficulti   the difficulti outsid the high tech area initi occur larg in auto and a lot of intermedi materi  while the book valu data have grown fa  in nomin term  i believ  than in real term  we can get a sens of real inventori from the product data  which by definit is where all inventori come from   from those data we conclud that the declin in manufactur product through the latter month of last year end a period of increas real inventori accumul   leav asid the somewhat question januari number  februari and march clear are a period of signific inventori liquid   inde  the data that we have for motor vehicl show some quit substanti declin   but in comparison with product pattern throughout the economi  consumpt in februari and march   not seem to be chang as fast   the implic of that from the perspect of a statist model is that the rate of liquid in februari and march is realli quit stark and pronounc  the overal effect of this on econom activ is stabil at some point  if all that is involv is an inventori correct   stabil would occur reason quick becaus  judg from past experi  the current rate of inventori liquid seem to be close to a maximum   what happen when a maximum degre of liquid is reach is that the economi stabil even though the general level of confid may be veri low and inde peopl may anticip that econom condit will deterior           further   they don   t   and the reason they don   t is that the level of inventori becom a brake on the extent of the liquid  the fact that inventori cannot be negat no matter how uncertain  no matter how bearish peopl feel  is a fundament featur of the way the econom system function   accord  inventori liquid and inventori cycl are usual of the type that produc chang reason quick and can lead to a relat prompt and pronounc adjust in the economi   i suspect that we are go to see a good measur of that in the month ahead   mayb   the    mayb    relat to a phenomenon that occur on occas but one about which i am quit concern at the moment   it   s call a    fals dawn      it occur when there are a lot of indic that the economi is behav the way it ordinarili   in a recoveri  but then it surpris us  and we get a renew wave of weak   one reason i would be concern about that prospect is that the level of consum confid has come down fair dramat  even though the univers of michigan number did show some improv in the first half of march   of cours  if we focus on the observ that were collect after the stock market took a sharp swing downward  the number come down somewhat   so the level of confid is still an open question  far more import is an issu that we have discuss around this tabl  name the save rate   the save rate has a huge multipli   all one has to do is add or subtract   or   percentag point and that   extraordinari wonder to the level of gdp and   so veri quick   i don   t know whether the negat wealth effect is go to be a major problem   conceptu  one has to presum that there is a consider effect   i don t know whether we are go to learn specif how it impact is work it way           through to expenditur  but it is not do so current at the pace that we would have expect from our model  the uncertainti surround the negat wealth effect  along with the absenc of ani evid that the rate of downward adjust to expect profit may be stabil  make me nervous about the outlook   nonetheless  the march sale figur  as     mention  are not do all that bad and the liquid of inventori continu   moreov  the number for steel ingot product came out today  they are still go up  and they are go up at a pace that is veri clear consist with an inventori turnaround   so  a lot of posit econom inform is show up  inde  as i listen to the anecdot report around this tabl  i find encourag sign that in my view would be consist with stabil were it not for the profit and the save rate problem  anoth signific issu is japan   it economi  the second largest in the world  has had virtual no perceiv impact on world econom condit for a long period of  e   for a decad japan had been a cipher as far as it multipli effect on econom condit in other part of the world were concern   i feel that that is no longer the case   i think the econom situat is erod in japan  and i believ it is erod at a fa  pace than is forecast in the  book   i don   t think it   s all a polit problem   what the japanes are deal with are problem relat to a declin labor forc  unfund long term pension  veri larg deficit spend  and an almost nonfunct financi intermediari system   japan  rememb  has a bank onli financi intermediari system  and we have seen innumer exampl in a number of the smaller east asian countri of what happen when that intermediari system break           down   we have not yet seen that in japan  but i think there is a signific danger that we may   more broad  east asia  as the vice chair has mention  is clear in some difficulti  latin america is not a current problem for our economi  but there is a problem of polit instabl in those countri   we need to rememb that a number of latin american nation  such as argentina and brazil  have what might be character as american type high risk economi   such economi can function onli if they oper in the framework of long term  e prefer and a polit system that think longer term   it   s not evid that that   s the way the polit system work in latin america   as i have often comment  and bill   know this better than i  and in fact roger   probabl goe to more intern meet than i do  when we sit around these intern tabl  what we hear are peopl who think like we n economist  but they are utter unrepres of the govern offici who employ them  and we get a fals view of how those econom system work   so there is a degre of shaki about the econom outlook in mani of our import trade partner  and that make the fals dawn issu disturb  in addit  of cours  there is the stock market about which much has been said today   some market player behav like addict convinc a heighten dose would reliev their pain   it   not  and they seek a still larger dose   there is no stabil in a regimen base on fals pharmacolog   laughter  nor for stock price from ever larger dose of liquid   short term rate have onli a peripher impact on expect earn and risk premium  and they therefor have limit effect on stock price   target stock price themselv cannot be an effect polici   to restrain an upsid stock market           surg could requir the drain of liquid to an extent that that would caus a collaps of econom activ  an obvious unaccept trade off   likewis  flood a depress market with excess liquid  unless that succeed in revv up a moribund economi  cannot reviv a deflat stock market  it is import that the feder reserv not follow a flaw strategi   i fear that with a reduct of    basi point or even     basi point today  which as you know a number of peopl are suggest  stock price could still fall  lead too mani observ to conclud that monetari polici is ineffect   this is a potenti danger view in my mind especi among the broad array of those who do not particip in the equiti market   if we do    basi point and stock price fall further  as they well might today  it is the central banker who may be perceiv as intellectu inadequ  not polici itself   this is far less danger to the economi    laughter   at least it leav open up the possibl that we policymak can be educ or chang   beyond that  impli but by no mean guarante in our press releas that we may well cut rate befor our may    meet is a damocl sword over bear specul who view the next liquid fix as more import than higher hous start  ambigu is rare use in monetari polici   uncertainti usual creat risk premium  but that depend on the natur of the uncertainti   for those who believ that the provis of central bank liquid is bullish for stock  histori tell us that an overhang of uncertainti about when or whether the fed will move to lower rate creat a downsid or negat risk premium that may well have a larger sustain effect than act to remov the uncertainti   market are veri often bought on rumor and sold when the rumor prove true  or fals for that matter   this is one of the rare period when in my           judgment calcul ambigu can serv a use purpos in minim unthought activ   i would propos  therefor  that we reduc the rate by    basi point and construct languag for the press statement that leav the door wide open on an intermeet move   ani intermeet action would be govern  howev  by a judgment that the real economi is in some unforeseen difficulti beyond our current set of probabl  not by a further weaken in stock price   i do acknowledg a wealth effect  which we must take into consider   the wealth effect itself is real in that it has an impact on spend and activ  not just psycholog   if we are requir to acceler our downsid move  i prefer to shorten the interv between the move rather than increas the size of each move   i do not like where i believ relat larg move may lead us in current circumst   i believ the cost of a polici of smaller but  as need  more frequent move is realli quit limit   it   not requir us to make the ad move  but leav our option wholli open   this in my judgment is necessari in the present environ  i would like to put on the tabl for discuss  then  a    basi point reduct with a statement in our press releas that the risk are still on the down side but that also suggest that we are focus on what is go on in the economi   even though we have almost two month to the next meet  we will be prepar to act when and if necessari  but we recogn that    when and if necessari      not mere mean a declin in the stock market   thank you  vice chair
mr  chairman  i veri enthusiast support your recommend  includ all the nuanc   when i was on my most recent long airplan ride  which was last wednesday  i thought to myself that what we had to do           at this meet was to be decis and flexibl at the same  e   that would requir creat a certain amount of uncertainti among the bear in the market who are forev tri to find a new carcass to feed on  in my view  therefor  a    basi point cut in the fund rate would be veri  veri unwis   the market could interpret that as an indic that we had finish eas monetari polici   we don t know whether we will have finish eas with anoth    basi point reduct   i would note  too  that i think your use of the word    addict    was absolut right   it would be assum that the new    normal    move was    basi point  we would be feed the addict   s habit and the next  e he or she would want a move of    basi point or more   so  such an action would be extrem ill advis   and the peculiar thing is that the end result would be a reduct in our flexibl at exact the  e we need it   thus  i believ that everi part of your recommend  in particular make it rather clear that we might well move befor the next meet  is appropri  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   let me comment briefli about each of the choic along the spectrum of altern that are most plausibl here  twenti five basi point is the most conserv possibl   with inflat quiescent and quit like to stay so for some  e  i just don t see ani necess to keep such a tight hold   inde  i perceiv that it would be quit riski to do so   so that altern has littl attract for me at this  e  the most aggress choic is    basi point   while the financi market are clamor for it  the data from the real economi seem firmer than such a move might           impli   most particular  i fear that the messag a    basi point move would send would be total wrong   peopl in the real economi might perceiv us to be in panic  which we are not   stock market investor might see us as tri to save them  which would not be correct but could nevertheless creat a serious moral hazard that might be quit difficult to erad   and this move would take short term rate down toward a low level  which could begin to constrain our option should further eas becom necessari   final  there is at least some small possibl that a strong  earli upturn in the econom expans could make even this level seem too low in the not too distant futur  which would introduc an entir new set of dynam  so  i believ that    basi point is the best choic and that asymmetri toward weak is the correct tilt becaus i think the risk are still on the down side   thank you
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend  although it is not my first choic   and becaus it may prove relev for some futur meet  i   d like to explain briefli a differ view  let me call option x a    basi point cut with the balanc of risk toward weak   i   ll call option y  my prefer  a    basi point cut with a statement that the risk are balanc   i think the immedi market impact of those two option would be rough the same becaus the balanc risk statement is not foreseen by the market   i look at this as a problem of where we are like to be perhap four week from now  incident  i want to make clear that a balanc risk statement onli mean that the probabl of the next move be up or down are equal   i would not be foreclos           anoth eas move at the next meet if the data support such a move in a compel way   but let   s say the incom data are on the weak side four week out   option x  the one we are like to vote for today  leav us in the same situat as we were go into this meet  that is  with continu specul about when and how big our next move will be   option y put us ahead of where we would otherwis be   if the incom data are flat to strong  option x result in uncertainti about whether we might still be contempl anoth downward move   option y leav us    finish    for the  e be  which i would view as the correct messag   clear  option y posit us to stop eas at forthcom meet   that is my best guess of our futur polici path  given the forecast  the sen ent  the anecdot inform  and the rapid creation of liquid in the system at this point  i am quit frank oppos to give a deliber hint of an intermeet move  i think that s go to caus us difficulti not onli in come week  but well beyond becaus peopl will be wonder in the futur if an intermeet action is on our mind  so  i believ that that would be a mistak
mr  chairman  i support your propos   as i said earlier  i see enough weak and risk in the economi look forward beyond this quarter to justifi a    basi point cut   and i am reliev that we are not do more than that becaus in my view that would introduc some of the problem you note   it most definit would introduc moral hazard issu with regard to the market and what it would expect from us  which would be inappropri   so  i am comfort with your recommend            i have two question   when you spoke of an intermeet move  did you have in mind a confer call with the committe to go forward with such an action  second  in the press statement come out of this meet  would you anticip ani refer to the market or would the market not be mention   if noth els  we re go to get ourselv in this trap
in the draft languag  the onli refer to the market relat to equiti wealth effect   at this stage there is no refer to stock price
okay  thank you veri much
i agre with your proposit  mr  chairman   i think a    basi point decreas in the fed fund rate is appropri at this  e   and sinc i believ the risk are still on the down side  i favor retain the balanc of risk languag in the direct of weak  as you indic  i  too  have becom uncomfort with the possibl that observ might get the impress that the committe   s decis are driven by what the market expect and by the direct of stock price   i   d like to dissuad them of that view   therefor  i think it   s import that our press statement indic that our action was taken to counteract the real econom effect of fall stock price  as you suggest
mr  chairman  i support a    basi point cut in the fund rate and i also support a statement that the risk remain weight toward econom weak  i  too  share your concern about a    basi point cut at this  e   to me the recent data on employ and spend do not suggest that thing are as bad as the stock market  or           for that matter consum in general  seem to think   this make it like that at least part of the market   s declin repres a return to more ration stock valuat   under these condit  a    basi point cut in the fund rate now could provid a fals sens of secur to the stock market   peopl might be led to believ that the fed is attempt to valid recent histor high valuat in equiti market   thank you
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend  i m come at this larg in the way ned   describ earlier   it seem to me that the real feder fund rate should be move lower  and a    basi point cut seem appropri   i don t know if that will turn out to be suffici but i do think it will prove to be construct  i share your concern about the potenti of a fals dawn here  though obvious none of us can see the futur veri clear   but anoth possibl  and perhap a better bet at least in my mind  is that rather than a v shape recoveri we will get initi just a veri  veri modest recoveri   it may be similar to the type we had in the earli      s  when for a  e there was a lot of concern about the fragil of the economi and the sustain of it perform
thank you  mr  chairman   i can endors your recommend   i d like to speak to each of it three part  first  a cut of    basi point   seem to me to be appropri target at the real economi   ani more would appear to be target inappropri at the stock           market  and i endors your general concept of whi that is not the role of a central bank  and ani less would clear be too littl in my judgment  given the risk  on the balanc of risk statement  the languag is written in the context of our goal of price stabil and sustain growth   therefor  if we re see growth in the forese futur that is like to be below our es  of appropri trend growth  then we can legi  continu with a statement that say the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak   i believ this is an import element of interpret   if in fact the economi were grow appreci but from a veri low base and we still thought that growth was unaccept slow becaus it was below trend  then it would be legi  intellectu to say that the risk are toward econom weak  with respect to the hint of an intermeet move in the press releas  i am concern about ad some new languag whose presenc or absenc could be someth that the market is look for after everi meet in the futur   we did that in decemb   i think it work well   we did not do it at our last meet and that was okay as well   so i don t think the market has gotten into the habit of look for this kind of languag to indic futur polici move   howev  it is alway import  and in fact it   s common sens  to suggest that we are attent to the incom data   so  given the degre of risk and uncertainti  and given the amount of  e between now and the next schedul meet  i think it is probabl better  though it is not an easi judgment to make  to includ a sentenc that suggest we will be particular attent to incom data
presid              ms     thank you  mr  chairman   all i can say is    wow      your summari was a real tour de forc  especi with respect to the stock market and the undesir of fulfil ever greater market expect   i agre with the    basi point  i agre with the asymmetri  and i share your concern about a move of    basi point or someth more than that   i m in agreement larg becaus  first of all  i think an eas move is necessari and second becaus i believ take measur step is appropri   it may well be that further eas will be necessari  but i d like to do that also in limit step   and to me the best part of a measur process like that is that it could focus the    addict     as you call them  a bit on save themselv rather than look to us to do the job  i am  howev  veri worri about your recommend nuanc in the statement   in my view we alway have the option to move between meet   we   ve done so in the past  the quit recent past   that is part of everybodi s understand of how we oper   everyon know how long it is between this meet and the next meet  everyon know we   re vigil  and everyon know we   re focus on incom data   if we add nuanc to the statement this  e  i think we are go to provid the addict with even more reason to focus on us rather than themselv for a solut to their problem   and i don t think that would be good at all
mr  chairman  i come out exact where presid   did   i certain support the    basi point move   i thought the reason you gave at the end of your statement realli ice the case  although i have to confess that i           wasn t sure for awhil exact where you were go to come out   but cut the fund rate as you propos is what i think we clear need to do  i can support an asymmetr direct   on the econom merit that make sens to me   but i have veri strong reserv and would oppos ad new languag about the possibl of an intermeet move   i just don t think it would buy us a lot  and it could be danger in term of the market dynam and the expect it could creat   the word that come to my mind in think about it briefli here is    tantal     as cathi   said  everyon know that we can alway make an intermeet move  we ve done it fair recent   i don t see much to be gain by underlin that   so i would support all of your recommend except for that element of it
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend  particular the first part of it   i must confess to be even more thrown off than presid broaddus was in think that you were take us someplac veri differ than you did   i spent the first three quarter of your present make frantic note about how to disagre grace   i was think that a move to valid market expect and further confirm the moral hazard associ with not let the market adjust would be the worst possibl outcom  i must admit that i substanti share cathi   s and al   s concern about the second part of the recommend  name to hint that we would be inclin to an intermeet move   i don t view that as necessari   in fact  i believ we could make matter wors for ourselv by do that  though it   s hard to judg without see the languag you have in mind   so i would hope that either now or after we see the propos           languag we could talk a bit more about the wisdom of includ that as part of the decis today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the eas move today of    basi point  but i   m troubl by two thing   one  when we use the word    weak     we may think slower growth but other hear declin   and i think that s a troubl messag   if what is heard out there is that we expect further declin in econom activ  the question then aris     whi aren t we do even more      i don t know how we can communic this concept of slower growth   the second part of that concern is that at some point  of cours  we will reach a posit where we feel that with this move  or lack of a move  the risk are balanc   and i don t see how we say that if the economi is perceiv as grow at less than it potenti  if it   s not at full employ or not at capac or some such notion   but we re go to have to get to that point  given the lag in the effect of polici action on inflat  well befor it is perceiv by the public that what we are observ in fact repres a situat of balanc risk  final  i question put emphasi on high frequenc data report or give the public the impress that some inform is go to come out in the next six week that is go to carri so much weight with us that we may take an intermeet action   that may well be the case  we ve done it befor   but i don t see the valu of signal that we re go to be veri heavili preoccupi or focus on some report becaus that just heighten the interest of the fed watcher   the wire servic type will be say     which one of these report is the one that if it flash in the right color             whatev that color is  is go to trigger an action      at some point we need to think about how we start communic that we have a long term focus on maximum growth  which involv sustain price stabil
mr  chairman  as one of the golfer in this group  i thought the analog     gave befor was excel   to continu it  i guess i would describ your propos as hit a shot to the     i m not sure where it land but we are carri sever club with us and one of them sure is a sand wedg
on the      laughter
i meant toward the    sinc that s the way i usual play golf     laughter   but  serious  i thought your statement was excel   i do think we need to eas   i believ we should be measur in our action  as i said in my comment and as cathi   mention as well   in my view     basi point should be enough for now   i agre that we need to avoid tri to fulfil the ever more extrem market expect   we can t hope to keep up with such expect  and even if we were to cut the fund rate more than    basi point today  it s not clear that the market would be affect in anyth but the short run  as you mention   also  i support retain the asymmetr languag   even with the    basi point eas  the risk remain tilt toward weak  i am uneasi about the languag regard an intermeet move   i m not sure exact what we gain from it or how it help us in move forward   perhap we could have more discuss on that
thank you  mr  chairman   my posit is veri similar to that of presid    broaddus  and guynn  a littl stronger than presid     s  i support your recommend for a    basi point declin in the target fund rate today  along with a statement that the risk remain unbalanc toward econom weak   but i would veri strong prefer to avoid ani direct or explicit hint in our statement of an intermeet move  i haven   t heard much support for a    basi point move  so i won t argu the case for    as oppos to      a    basi point move today along with a statement of unbalanc risk as alway  as has been point out  hold open the possibl of an intermeet move   but hint more direct at such a possibl in the statement  especi if we repeat someth like the word in our decemb   th statement  in effect use a code that will be interpret as an inclin toward an intermeet move   would  in my view  be a mistak   it would leav market particip specul day in and day out about whether we were in or about to hold an emerg meet to cut the target fund rate   it could aggrav the market s respons to everi newli report indic and it would leav equiti price continu buffet by such specul   this type of uncertainti in my view has no up side  my prefer to avoid a direct hint of an intermeet move also reflect my prefer for polici decis to be taken at our regular meet   to be sure  there are circumst when an intermeet move is a valuabl part of our toolkit and  mr  chairman  you have use this tool spare and wise in the  e i ve serv on this committe   i am confid you will continu to do so   still  i do not believ it would be            wise to set polici so as to leav the impress that an intermeet move has a veri high probabl or to tell the market that we are so inclin
thank you  mr  chairman   for a while now i ve been stuck on the same question that i think the meet is stuck on   i have felt that from the basic what i d like to do at this meet is to move the fund target down    basi point and retain the bias  but if there were some way to do a littl more  i felt that was appropri   there are two way to do a littl more   one is to go down    basi point  some have talk about that  i would have gone down    and retain the bias toward weak   the other way is what you suggest  mr  chairman  to go down    with a hint of more   let me tri to do a benefit cost analysi on this  i see two advantag in your approach   one is that it is flexibl and decis  as bill   describ veri well  and in that sens more effect than go down      also  it can be more target to the real economi and not the stock market  and i think that s an advantag as well  as for the cost  you ve all been veri eloqu about the cost side of it   the cost that a number of peopl have mention is the heighten sensit to the fed and what it next polici move might be   i think everi one of us feel that there is alreadi way too much sensit out there   by hint of an intermeet move  we are not make that problem ani better  so i do see that as a cost   but i will still support the approach you recommend   among unsatisfactori altern i think it   s probabl the best
i support your recommend and i hope we will be flexibl and will to have an intermeet discuss if the data suggest the need for that   but i share the reserv of those who would rather leav the refer to that possibl out of the languag of our press statement
let me suggest that we take a look at the draft languag befor we vote  becaus the languag i   ve chosen   not in my judgment rais precedenti issu   this is a veri rare occas   if inde it got to the point where this kind of word becam a new  separ part of the decis we had to make on an ongo basi  i would vote against it   i think that would be too much   but i believ current circumst are veri unusu  and in my judgment we gain from the type of statement that is in this earli draft   in that regard the propos languag   not in my view set ani preced in that it is unlik to be use again   i think this is one of those extraordinari period in monetari polici histori where we   re at a veri import crossroad   and be sensit to it i think is use   the cost over the long run  which has been well articul here and i believ quit correct  is not someth that concern me becaus i don t think we re go to be do this again  the oper sentenc is obvious the last sentenc of paragraph three   has everyon look at it
excus me   could i ask a question of don   do you happen to have the languag of the similar sentenc in decemb   peopl are go to compar the two
this is just a littl stronger it seem to me becaus we didn t say    especi    monitor  we said monitor    close
well  i purpos didn t want to use exact the same languag for precis that reason
was ad    especi    the whole differ
yes   what was the languag
i don   t think i have the
i have the languag we use in decemb if nobodi els
whi don t you read it
the discuss will all be on what    especi    mean
would you like me to read it  mr  chairman
the compar sentenc in the press releas of decemb   th read      the committe will continu to monitor close the evolv econom situat
at the  e we put that sentenc in our press statement  i know i did not feel that it commit us to  or ani way was a formal nuanc regard  an intermeet move   but the fact is that the sentenc exist and we did take an intermeet action   so it seem to me that the pair of the two is a lot more power now   in my view we can   t take ani comfort from the reaction to our press statement in decemb  that is not a valid basi on which to judg what would happen now if we use someth close to that sentenc in these circumst
i think the key question is the one the chairman himself rais   is this precedenti     it say that we have to do someth in the futur   i think the answer to that is no   we are essenti look at what the market reaction is like to be   my view is that we need this in our statement in order to show that we are vigil becaus i share the chairman s basic view that we are at a most unusu  mayb onc in a life   moment in the cours of monetari polici formul  and that s what drive the need for us to say someth along these line
when i spoke earlier  i believ i said this is a judgment call   clear  the tone of this discuss suggest that there are judgment on either side  if we look at this languag in the context of the whole paragraph  i think it give us the right kind of flexibl without over commit us   as i said befor  i would be veri concern if we were move toward have to vote on this sort of addit languag at each meet  but we are not in that mode   you clear are not put us in that mode  mr  chairman   what you are suggest  as the languag say  is that condit are evolv veri rapid   and i think it is quit legi  for a central bank to say that in such a circumst  with econom condit evolv veri quick  the financi situat is quit fragil both domest and intern   so  guess what   we are go to be vigil and we are go to be monitor develop especi close  though it seem to me a judgment call  it is not unreason to ask the committe to communic that messag to the market   on the one hand  it is an obvious statement in that we re alway look at incom develop close   on the other hand  given the fragil that we ve seen and the interplay of various develop to            which the statement allud  i think it is realli quit intellig of the central bank of the unit state to state clear that we are watch   it   not commit us to do anyth  inde  as the data unfold  we may do noth   but it tell the market that we are inde awak   yes  there is a risk that the market will look to everi number and react to it  but we can ul  manag that   if we don t react  then the market will learn from that  so  in some sens i think this give us the right degre of flexibl   though obvious i m not downplay the risk on the other side  by and larg to me this is the better option
mr  chairman  my prefer would be to leav out that sentenc for sever reason   first of all  we are never relax   quit frank  i ve never relax and i don t think anybodi els around the tabl has ever relax about the econom situat   we follow develop veri close   if the econom situat   evolv rapid and it call for action  then i don t doubt that we will step up to the plate and do what is necessari   but my concern about this languag is that lot of routin data come in and if some measur come in a littl on the weak side  that may caus a reaction   this languag will prime the market to watch everi piec of inform that becom avail and will increas the market   s volatil   all sort of minor develop that don t call for ani action will be look at from the perspect of whether it will trigger the fed to act or not
but it is up to us to act or not act
oh  i understand that   but i m talk about my forecast of how the market will read this
i don   t disagre with you actual  and i   m not sure that i view that as a bad outcom becaus in effect what we will be tell the market is that we don   t agre with it   in other word  we   ll get a lot of those view initi and when we don   t act  thing will calm down   the other day  for exampl  i had to make a statement up on the hill to tri to shoot down the view that there was go to be an intermeet move becaus one of our former colleagu got exuber  as has been point out  and had forecast such a move   when i made that statement  everyth calm down   in other word  if peopl want to get stir up  in my judgment we should let them get stir up   but the point is that if we don   t move on that stir  it actual reinforc the view that we are not respond  and should not be respond  to the stock market or to peopl on the street whose basic view is that our role is to bail out their poor invest judgment   i don   t think that   s the role of a central bank   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  when i was listen to your comment  i thought you were go to put word in the statement that said we might move in the intermeet period   in read this draft  i   m quit reliev that you are not do that  so  i can live with this sentenc   i would take out    especi    if i had my choic  sever   yes
i can live with this sentenc becaus if i can   t live with this sentenc  i can   t live with the sentenc that preced it either   i don   t think it say that we necessarili are go to move in the intermeet period   i would take out the word    especi    so it is more parallel to our statement in decemb and not less   other than that  i   m fine with this
i agre with tom hoenig   s comment   i  too  in hear you  thought that this statement would be much starker about an intermeet move  but i   m comfort with this word   i would also agre with tom  though  on take out the word    especi
well  we have a major now in favor of the statement   let me see if i can get a vote in effect  not a formal vote  on the word    especi      whi don   t i quick go around the tabl on that point and then we can close this discuss   just indic    yes    or    no    on the word    especi      vice chair
what   a    yes    vote mean        yes    mean    especi    is in or out
if    especi    is in  the word is    yes      if it is out  the word is    no      okay   i   m sorri  the vice chair is yes   governor
governor     oh  you   re alreadi
i can   t vote    no
no   you don   t get a vote    laughter   you alreadi vote    no    on the whole sentenc
the other have alreadi express their view so the word    especi    is out   i ask the secretari to read the appropri direct and let   s vote on it
this languag is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent      and for the balanc of risk sentenc in the press statement      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
shall we vote
chairman  span  yes vice chairman   yes governor     yes   governor   yes   presid hoenig yes governor     yes governor     yes presid                               yes yes   presid   presid pool   yes
i   m glad governor   and i got to vote on this         one
well  you had alreadi said    no    on includ the sentenc   if you vote against the whole sentenc  then vote on a word is irrelev
