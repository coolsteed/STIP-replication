page    let me say a few word on japan and japanes asset  the yen  which had been exhibit weak earli in       had a dramat about face start  in mid to late februari   for most of januari and part of februari the talk in market was about the possibl of a major crisi around the end of the fiscal year   this led to a    sell japan    mental and the price of equiti  jgbs  and the valu of the yen all declin   as the talk about the crisi swell  market began to look forward to two event in late februari   the releas of the govern   s    anti deflat plan    due to come out on februari    and the bank of japan   s polici board meet on februari      in the event  the govern   s anti deflat plan was leak slowli in the day befor it releas  and it contain littl that was new or view as be truli help in fight deflat   the one concret step was a tighten of short sell rule on equiti  this was coupl with the announc   a few day befor the plan was releas   of sanction by the fsa against four foreign firm

 on februari    the bank of japan   s  polici board  under sever pressur from the govern  decid to increas the pace of it jgb acquisit from  ¥    billion to  ¥  trillion per month   jgb yield declin    basi point in the three week after that  to about      percent   with japanes asset price rise  the yen appreci sharpli in late februari  though it has depreci to a level of about      in the past day or so   turn to page    a word on domest reserv manag   the top chart show month rate of growth in currenc over the past year and our forecast for the next few month   currenc growth has been well abov trend in mani recent month  late last year  just when it look as if it was get back to normal  we experienc  unexpect rapid growth for sever month   argentina has been part of the stori  but domest demand for currenc has also been strong   the bottom panel show  by mainten period  the aggreg size of domest financi asset held by the feder reserv   the gray line repres our perman soma hold  and the red line show total hold  includ repurchas agreement  both long and short term   aggreg hold will simpli reflect the behavior of autonom factor and demand for fed balanc   the under chang in this seri over  e most reflect currenc growth   the size of our total rp hold rose quit sudden in the aftermath of septemb     as we stop our outright activ for a few mainten period while currenc growth remain robust   total rps grew to more than     billion  and the long term rp book reach about     billion in octob   in that month we began to buy outright for soma onc again  and over the past five month  soma has expand by over     billion  which in absolut term is about as aggress a pace as we have ever sustain over ani extend period   but the rapid growth in currenc has continu to surpris us over the past sever month  and the rapid pace of soma expans still has not allow us to bring down our hold of  rps  includ long term rps  below the octob level   look ahead  while currenc growth is expect to moder  we plan to maintain the recent rapid pace of soma expans  which should allow us to bring rps  includ long term rps  down modest from the current level  again  though  we are talk about forecast  and there is a lot of risk to those forecast   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the intermeet period   i do want to mention that ye day the desk made it initi purchas of french bond for soma   s foreign portfolio as part of our effort to diversifi the euro portfolio beyond german debt   i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper  and i would be happi to answer ani question   thank you  mr  chairman
how do you read the argentinean situat   it seem to be go from one state of deterior to the next  with the clue larg be some form of confisc of foreign asset   that lead me to conclud that it will be difficult to get anyon to reinvest in argentina if it leader continu to make it terribl obvious that it   s not safe to do so  how much is the exchang rate be suppress by the lack of a fulli free market there   and how is this all go to unravel or ravel   i don   t know what the appropri term is   in your judgment
i think you   re absolut right that there is a suppress of the exchang rate by the various rule and regul  both formal and inform  that are be appli   how much that is suppress the exchang rate is hard to quantifi  and i wouldn   t want to hazard a guess   but a lot of peopl in the analyt communiti think that we could see a further   and perhap even sharp   depreci if and when a more open market is allow to develop   as for how that will spill over into broader market or the societi  i think it   s veri hard to guess   but it   s difficult to be op ist about the situat
if i may interject  mr  chairman   i would note that the one year forward rate ye day was     peso per dollar
i was just about to mention that   in other word  somebodi is veri pessimist at this point   what in the world   a one year forward of  say    impli about the inflat rate   we had the brazilian experi where we were all surpris at the lack of pass through of the exchang rate effect   do we have ani evid yet as to how this is materi in the argentin situat   we do know that their inflat rate is rise  but is it rise with the impli full  moder  or veri littl pass through of the exchang rate  depreci
there   s not enough econom activ go on in argentina to know    even in domest trade much less anyth that would involv the purchas of import good and the reaction of wage or the pass through or ani of that   iron  the situat is so bad that it may be that what they realli should do is let the inflat rip becaus it would depreci the real valu of outstand debt that they can   t pay   the stress of tri to protect valu and pay those debt under mani of their polit problem   i don   t know  frank  anyth to suggest to them   if you sent me down there as the czar of argentina  i would not know how to fix the present situat
the imf task forc that was there has gone home   they were subject to immens scrutini in the argentin press   even peopl on the street knew the name of those on the imf task forc  which is someth that is veri unusu   the govern in power now continu to blame other for their problem   they blame past imf polici  they blame foreign lender  they blame the foreign bank   they blame anybodi but themselv   the public has lost confid in most institut   it   s not clear whether they   ve lost confid in the central bank   but the central bank is in a veri difficult posit becaus if they tri now to keep the inflat rate contain  then this devic of basic wipe the slate clean and start over by just let the inflat rip won   t happen   and the polit struggl to fight over the crumb that are left will continu   so in some respect  as outrag as it may sound  it might be better if the central bank just look the other way for a while
on second thought  mayb we ought to send you down there    laughter
isn   t a lot of the debt denomin in dollar
oh  it use to be   it isn   t ani more   by a stroke of the pen  they have    pesofi    virtual everyth   they cannot do that to the debt they owe to foreign becaus foreign basic will just say    no
but anyth that is circul intern has been pesofi
if i could make a comment  mr  chairman   roger   and i attend a meet of lead privat sector banker and central banker in basel a coupl of week ago   when the subject turn to argentina  it was the most fascin experi i   ve ever had in that there was absolut agreement between the public sector and the privat sector particip   all agre that the main issu was the grotesqu violat of ani concept of the rule of law by that which pass for a govern in argentina   there was no pressur whatsoev from the privat sector for a public sector rescu packag   rather  the contrari   we were be veri strong advis not to touch argentina with a help hand of ani kind becaus of a new version of the contagion effect   that is  if a countri could in ani way be reward for violat the law of contract  it would encourag irrespons govern elsewher in the world to think that they should do the same thing   so there is  i believ  a view that the present govern of argentina just has to be allow to stew in it juic until and if it figur out a way to implement a program  which would includ put back in place the rule of law   and i think the abil of the present govern to do that is question   i must say that  in my forti year of work on these type of problem and work with argentina  this is the most difficult situat i   ve ever seen   that   s becaus not just   but nobodi can figur out what to do   the argentin peopl have a view that their politician are either inept or corrupt or both  and by and larg they are right   therefor  no one can quit figur out how argentina can get out of this situat
i attend a meet a coupl of week ago at which ann krueger was present as was ricardo lopez murphi  who was the argentin defens minist and then for a coupl of week the minist of the economi   on the inflat question  sebastian edward made some back of the envelop calcul   these number to me just sound off the wall  but he said it would take about a       percent inflat in peso term to get some sort of a balanc  i don   t know how he arriv at that figur  but the number be talk about were just enorm   ricardo lopez murphi   s point was that the attitud in argentina now is more like that in the french revolut than anyth ani nation has experienc sinc then   he said that in the mind of the averag argentinean  if you have ever held polit offic in argentina  you are not qualifi to hold offic
it   s not veri encourag   incident  on the currenc issu  when we subtract out the es  chang in dollar held by foreign holder  what have  the domest currenc trend look like in the last two or three month
actual  mr  chairman  it   s a pretti easi calcul becaus foreign and domest hold seem to be grow at just about the same rate
that  sn   t make it an easi calcul   it may just be wrong    laughter
as we es  it  the growth rate were similar   look at currenc shipment in januari  oversea and domest hold were both grow at    percent  in februari it was about     percent for oversea and    percent for domest
i assum      bill would move in pretti much the same  way
that   s in part how we get the number   it   s one way of es  this number  we look at that and the data we get from currenc shipper
okay   ani further question   if not
i move approv of the domest oper  speaker      second
thank you   without object  they are approv   dino you   re still on  you   re go to talk about gnmas  ginni mae   right
yes   don and i will make some brief open comment on that topic   at this point the staff has done a fair amount of background work on how we might go about acquir for the system open market account a portfolio of gnmas and also on structur a portfolio of rps  repurchas agreement  against foreign sovereign secur   where we are now is that quit a bit more   in fact a substanti amount   of rather nitti gritti oper work need to be done both to studi and to prepar for an actual implement of either program  that then becom a resourc issu becaus a lot of the same peopl would work on both of these project   so there   s a competit for those resourc between these two project and also on the conting relat issu   and that just make it imposs for us to expedit the conting plan work and also work on gnmas and the foreign sovereign debt  therefor  we want to get some guidanc from the committe as to which one of the two option for the portfolio the committe want us to focus on   there are pros and con for each  which we tri to lay out in the paper that was sent to you   as we note in that memo  there are both tactic and strateg question that the committe may want to consid   don and i would be happi to answer ani question  but i won   t review the actual content of that paper   don  did  you want to say anyth about some of the other topic on which staff work is be done
yes  i just want to bring the committe up to date on other work under way   we have a studi be done on the auction credit facil  acf   which would be a discount window facil     lang from the philadelphia fed is head that up and is follow up on the various issu committe member rais when this subject was discuss about a year ago   there are issu deal with supervisori matter  risk manag and asset manag for the feder reserv system  and auction design   those are at least three of the main topic be studi   that work actual has been given a littl extra impetus by conting plan follow up from septemb      an acf like facil could function in an emerg as a backup for open market oper   as a consequ of governor     s and vice chairman     s work on conting plan and backup facil for the system  we have given that acf studi a littl more urgenc     and his group are to have someth done on that by june   if they can   t get a complet studi done on all aspect of the acf  they are at least go to have finish by june the work on the use of a discount auction facil as a conting backup for open market oper   but   is go to tri to move along all the track so that we can have everyth regard the acf readi for consider at that  e  a second project is the review of the soma studi that you look at a year ago   each one has been review by legal staff both here and at the new york fed  i believ   for the most part  they have also been through the econom edit process to get them readi for public  and the author themselv have review that work   i think it   s fair to say that the urgenc behind this project has tone down a bit   but we are move forward to get those studi in publish form and to get them out to the public as staff studi  not as committe document
it strike me that  if you   re press on staff resourc  the most difficult option in term of the bridg necessari to get polit and public accept is the use of foreign debt oblig   unless someon has a differ view  it seem to me that we can certain proceed with the ginni mae befor we can go forward with the foreign sovereign debt option   i don   t know whether or not that   s a consensus view
i agre fulli   and new york wouid have the staff do them both after we have finish the conting work
yes   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  if i could just make a coupl of comment here   i certain think these studi are use and worthwhil   if we get to the point that we don   t have enough treasuri secur out there to do our job  it   s go to be help to have done these studi and given some thought to these altern in advanc   so i consid it a use exercis   but i do have problem with both of the altern that are befor us this morn   i agre with what you just said about use foreign govern secur as collater for repo   i think that could be veri polit sensit and this is at a  e when we   re tri to put togeth and maintain a coalit to fight terror around the world  the ginni mae option may seem better at first glanc  even take account of the size of the market and question about liquid and whatnot   after all  they do carri the full faith and  credit of the u s  govern   but when i think about it  that may not be all that help in some sens   the loan we made a number of year ago to chrysler and to lockhe also carri the full faith and credit of the u s  govern   it worri me that we might set up a preced or convey the idea by deal in gnmas that in some sens full faith and credit is a suffici condit to hold secur or other kind of asset in our soma portfolio   if that is the messag convey  then i think there   s a possibl that in the futur  when some other chrysler like debt come down the road  we might have to say yea or nay as to whether we   re go to hold that particular asset   i can imagin that that could put us in an uncomfort posit  moreov  buy gnmas themselv would pose problem   if we   re will to buy secur that support hous  then someon is go to ask whi shouldn   t we buy secur to support some other activ that the govern think is worthi of the full faith and credit design   now  one might ask  well  if the treasuri is will to make that design  whi should we be worri about it   but to me  in this situat  percept is realiti   if we   re perceiv as be a part of some sector credit alloc process  then in my view that could be problemat for us  and i think we ought to avoid that  so i come back to someth i tri to sell a while ago and didn   t have much luck   my suggest is that we find a way   or at least discuss with the treasuri the possibl of find a way   for them to increas the suppli of treasuri secur for us to purchas if that need aris  i know this is a tough sell   but we   re do all these studi of other option  mani of which   or perhap all of which   arguabl are not all that attract   so i just wonder if we couldn   t spend a littl  e and effort to tri to talk with     or whoever is the right person at the treasuri to explor whether this concept might be feasibl   i just throw that out as a suggest  this will probabl be my last speech about this  but i realli have problem with these other option
well  i think we all have problem with them   they are not option we have chosen to implement over the year  and the reason are larg the issu that you   ve rais   these are fallback posit    in the event that      and the    that    may not emerg  judg from the most recent fiscal polici stanc   so it may be a moot question   but i think all that dino and the other need to know at this point is  given the altern of a seri of not current accept soma invest  which is the least worst
all i   m ask is that this one other option be put on the plate and given some  e and consider
can we have comment on that   i   m just curious to hear  say  dino and don   s comment on that issu
i think there are a coupl of issu involv  if i can dredg them up from my memori of our previous discuss   part of the question was what the treasuri would do with the other part of it balanc sheet   in effect  we   d be push the problem on to them   that may be where it belong  but i think it would requir a chang in their law   as for us  we have to buy our secur in the open market   so this is a question of the treasuri   s issu more secur into the open market to accommod our need and then do someth with the cash that they rais   they would need to figur out how to invest the extra cash that they   re rais in order to sell the secur in the open market or we  in addit to the treasuri  would need to go to the congress to seek a chang in the law
well  i   m sure there are challeng and issu and mechan question to deal with   but that is the case with all of these other option   all i   m say is that i hate to see this possibl get dismiss pretti much out of hand
suppos they invest the cash in common stock  would  you be appreci of that
well  that   s their busi  i guess
mr  chairman  work with al and his peopl  we can certain produc a short paper on this topic   marvin goodfriend and i had a debat about it at the cleveland fed last fall   we can convert our debat to a paper to bring to the committe in a coupl of month if that would be help
okay   presid pool
i have a question  and it   s pure a question   given that there has been some discuss about the condit of fnma  fanni mae  and fmac  freddi mac   would a visibl program to make possibl invest in gnma secur rais issu about whi we are not invest in those of fanni and freddi   would there be a possibl advers market reaction as a consequ   this is along the same line as al   s question   if we   re get involv in hous  whi not invest in fanni and freddi   i   m also think about the riski of fanni mae and freddi mac   the veri low capit ratio that those firm maintain
we take fanni and freddi in rps   this option would involv outright purchas of gnmas  so we would be treat them differ   i think we would explain the differ as a full faith and credit issu   part of the idea for move to gnma was that the committe seem not to want to increas it relianc on fanni and freddi   and one of the instruct to the staff was to look for other altern that are legal under the current feder reserv act   that   s how these altern came up   so i think the signal you   re see is an accur represent of where the committe want to go   if i could make one more point  go back to the question you ask about currenc growth  mr  chairman   currenc has been grow about   percent a year  this year it   s been run more like            percent   the deficit would have to be      billion or      billion for us not to be take an increas portion of the secur outstand   so even without the advers deficit kind of scenario that peopl see  if currenc growth  sn   t deceler soon  the fed will start to own a rise proport of the treasuri secur outstand in a market where in certain sector the liquid issu is alreadi surfac   we can obvious do a lot more studi on this   but even under the most like scenario of deficit persist at a relat low level for some  e  i think the committe is go to face a problem where it oper are imping on the liquid of the market befor too long
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   my issu was similar to bill pool   s   i   m  concern about get involv with gnmas becaus of what that may lead to with regard to the pressur to make outright purchas of  fanni and freddi  which i think would be a huge mistak   so despit all the imperfect  if i had to vote  i would vote in favor of look at the foreign rp pool first
thank you   first  al   s comment about his last speech on this subject  remind me of a stori from twenti odd year ago in the bank industri   the question from one banker would be     have you seen sandi rose   s last articl on durat      and the respons would be     i hope so       laughter   this stori   relat to gnmas becaus i was oppos to dabbl around with them even befor i read sandi and     s memo  and they thorough convinc me that it is a bad idea   in addit to prepay risk  which is adequ treat in the memo  there is also the risk of shorten durat and revalu in a rise rate environ   i also think there is the issu of how we would subsequ distinguish between them and gses   so my first option might be  other thing held asid  to tabl this whole issu  that is probabl not realist in view of the length of  e it will take to come up with a viabl altern if necessari   i do think a connect ul  need to be made between what is on the liabil side of our balanc sheet  in term of where and how it   s held  and what is on the asset side   so i would support go ahead and devot whatev resourc are avail to explor the use of repo in foreign denomin currenc   i think that   s a sensibl thing to think about for a long term perspect
i think we   re all go on memori here   first  i would say that i don   t have a particular prefer for foreign rps versus ginni mae  i could go either way  but on the ginni versus fanni freddi issu  i believ the distinct is that at one point fanni and freddi were explicit privat   they were suppos taken out of the govern and were not suppos to receiv ani public subsidi   so we are adher to that line   that privat decis  as i understand it  was not made for gnma   so i see a clear distinct there   one might argu that there are go to be pressur  and that may be so   but i think that argument could be turn around a bit to say that  if we explicit oper in ginni and not fanni and gave the reason  it might actual clarifi the distinct between what is suppos privat and what is not   the last point is on al   s idea of talk to       i   d be happi for us to have a convers with       but even though   is wonder  he   s not a magician   the onli way the treasuri could issu us more secur or put more secur out in the market for us to buy is for them to run deficit or buy asset   and i don   t find either option attract   we can have a paper on this  but what els is it go to say   so i guess  al  i do hope that this is the last convers we have about that    laughter
well  they don   t just have to buy asset   they can alway reduc tax   this  sn   t constrain fiscal polici
but that mean a deficit   that   s the deficit option   whatev you think about deficit  i believ that ought to be part of an overal fiscal strategi   and i don   t want to have the treasuri chang that strategi just so we can do someth that   s a second order improv in monetari polici   i just don   t think it   s worth that
i guess we ought to buy the washington senat
or the treasuri could buy them and issu us a secur    laughter  that i might go along with
i believ there   s no easi answer to the question that is be rais by the desk   if we look at the data on outstand  that should be obvious   onc one move away from treasuri  what   s left are corpor  agenc  mortgag base paper of various kind  and foreign secur   or at least foreign sovereign debt base asset   municip secur were never a real altern  given the limit size and depth of that market   if we eschew credit risk and we shi away from gses  we   re left with ginni and foreign sovereign debt base asset   the staff has laid out the right issu here   maintain a gnma portfolio is work that involv special skill   these skill aren   t difficult to find  nor are they difficult for the desk to acquir   the desk could  in fact  maintain a portfolio of mortgag back instrument   the industri that we regul has thousand of it member engag in that activ as we speak  and given that our interest is limit to portfolio invest rather than trade  it   s realli pretti simpl to accomplish   altern  shift to dollar rps against foreign sovereign secur would appear to be an easier option   the desk is alreadi involv in rp transact  and so allow sovereign collater seem like an easi step  from a conceptu point of view this is correct   howev  as the staff memo indic  the market for cross currenc repo is current quit small   we in essenc would need to creat a market or  as the memo state  creat a more vibrant market out of one that is inde quit small   i have great reluct to do so for two reason   first  we would have to defin countri whose sovereign debt was accept to serv as collater in transact with the feder reserv   and we   d have to maintain such a list   more to the point  we would have to be prepar to remov from our list a countri whose fundament creditworthi had chang substanti   this would be awkward at best and potenti polit difficult   second  it   s not at all clear to me that the feder reserv should be place in the role of market creator   we current worri  appropri  about disrupt market with our trade   whi should we be will to creat new market   clear  if the desk indic that it would be trade in such cross currenc instrument  the market would develop   but this would chang spread and alter the status quo in uncertain way   i   m not sure that this is an appropri role for the feder reserv to play in world capit market  in fact  i more or less come to the conclus that mayb we should slow this effort down   i hesit to say this   it took us almost a year to get to this point   but the treasuri seem to have shift it spend outlook  as we indic  and mayb not enough by the back of the  envelop calcul   but at least at the moment that has given us some breath room   and as was mention at the outset  the auction credit facil seem to have some promis if we in fact proceed with it   if we must act  i guess i   d favor the gnmas   and as a side bar  there are lot of mbas out there who would be happi to run that portfolio for us   given the weak in the labor market  there are probabl plenti avail at the moment   those are my comment
thank you  mr  chairman   i associ myself veri substanti with what presid santomero has just said   i think the gnmas are prefer to the repo with foreign sovereign debt collater for the reason that he cite   i also would like to remind us of the resourc constraint   the limit number of peopl who can work on this issu have been work flat out sinc septemb     and they were work pretti hard befor that   so i think the first order of busi realli is that they finish the work on the conting issu and relax on all of this other materi until then  which would probabl be a matter of  say  three to six month   at that point i think they should concentr their effort on gnmas   i agre that manag of gnmas would be somewhat more complic than manag what is in the portfolio now  but it is certain doabl   as presid santomero said  mani firm that we supervis do that sort of work veri extens  i also believ that we have to avoid get into the situat of say that we will decid which secur are accept if they have the full faith and credit of the govern of the unit state   if the congress and the presid decid that an instrument has the govern   s full faith and credit  it is not altogeth clear to me that  as a creatur of the congress and as an independ central bank  we should second guess that decis   it isn   t at all clear to me what would give us the author to decid   to make the high polit judgment   that pure treasuri are okay but gnmas or someth els are not   it is nice that we have been abl to deal with pure treasuri until now   as don kohn point out veri well  even if deficit continu  the trend are such that we   re go to have to make use of secur other than pure treasuri   i think what the congress and the presid decid has the full faith and credit of the unit state is clear the right place to go   and if they decid that some other kind of credit has the full faith and credit of the unit state  we may have to go there  too   thank you
well  if you wait long enough to speak  somebodi say all the good stuff   i must associ myself with the view of presid santomero and vice chairman   on this   i would also encourag us to get the work done on the conting plan sooner rather than later   it   s too easi as  e goe by to let thing slide   the further we get away from a tragedi in this case  the easier it is to forget about all the bell and whistl that need to be includ so that we can react in a  e way if  god forbid  someth els happen   let   s get that work done and then work on these other issu in the futur
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be the fourth in a row  so i   ll be even briefer than presid   and say that i agre with what toni santomero  bill    and cathi   have just said   particular sinc my name is somewhat associ with this conting plan  i don   t want anyth to stand in the way of get that done   we   d be extraordinarili embarrass if we had to implement some sort of conting arrang and discov that they weren   t readi   while these other issu are extrem import and i think we should get back to them  i realli do believ from a nation interest standpoint that get the conting plan done is of primari interest at this stage
mr  chairman  if my memori serv me right  i think the last  e we talk about this i favor as a    least worst    choic go with the ginni befor go with the foreign sovereign debt   but i have a lot of sympathi for what al said regard the downsid of the ginni   nevertheless  i still would go in that direct   the one thing that i am concern about relat to the type of problem that often aris by go ahead piecem on someth  what i   d like to do is to hold off as long as possibl and take a look at all the option again  mayb at our meet next januari   we could have this as a special topic then and look at each of these option togeth in context   by then perhap the acf will be further along and we can make some comparison   i   d rather do that than say that the least worst option now is to go with ginni and build in that direct onli to find that they may not be the best choic in the long run and then tri to back out of use them   other than that  i agre that our work on conting has to come first and that we can put this off until that is done  know what our risk are and know what our least worst choic is after that
mr  chairman  in spite of their shortcom as well as their advantag  i think that both altern  as well as the acf  are probabl go to have to be arrow in the quiver for soma at some point   so at some  e in the futur  certain after the conting  studi are complet  i think we ought to proceed   it   s not immedi obvious to me which option should be address first   i would say  though  that the experi of the last year certain indic to us that thing can chang veri dramat in term of the fiscal posit of the u s  govern as well as what we   re see with regard to currenc   i don   t know how cautious we should be   i think we ought to move with good dispatch or aggress after we   ve dealt with the conting issu
i agre with what presid santomero said   i am veri concern  and my biggest concern is creat liquid in a foreign market instrument   from a public polici  perspect  when there are liquid issu in u s  market  i think we   d have a real problem  answer the question of whi we chose to build liquid in a market for foreign secur   i do believ that the prioriti should be on the conting plan  though   we pray that noth els like septemb    happen again   but with what is go on in the middl east  i don   t think we can ignor the conting plan   in my view that should be our immedi concern  and i would feel strong about put that at the top of the list
mr  chairman  i agre with what seem to be an emerg consensus that we do the conting plan first and also with what toni santomero  bill    and other have said   i just want to reiter the point that bill   made   if the congress design certain secur as have the full faith and credit of the unit state    whether they are gnmas or secur issu in anoth chrysler type bailout   it   s not appropri for us to distinguish among those secur   even though we person may not like the idea of subsid one sector or one firm  it is not our role to make such a distinct   it realli is a congression decis   so i would favor go in that direct   i also happen to agre with the point that ned made about tri to draw a distinct between fanni and freddi on the one hand and gnma on the other   if we ever got to the point where we were purchas gnma secur but we made it veri clear that we were not purchas those of fanni and freddi  i think that might help educ the public a littl more on this issu
i think it   s import to point out that most of the credit alloc effect occur with the issuanc of the full faith and credit secur  not with their purchas   it   s not a question of whether the fed or somebodi els hold them  that is probabl worth a coupl of basi point at most   the major issu is clear the design  for whatev reason  of full faith and credit   so it   s the treasuri that is make the crucial decis   what we do with respect to which of those various asset we hold is a veri secondari question   there is an issu of principl here  and i think that is someth we have to keep in mind   but as a practic matter  i   m not sure it matter all that much   i don   t believ  for exampl  that if we had held the chrysler debentur  they would have yield a signific differ return in the market   it   s not a market issu  it   s an econom polici issu   and it rais critic issu as to who is make the polici decis   whether we do it or the treasuri   it and so forth  presid guynn
mr  chairman  just to complet the go around  let me associ myself with those who have a prefer for the gnmas as oppos to the foreign debt altern   my staff tell me that we   d be smart in the short run to concentr on repo  even with ginni  appar there are some rather difficult account issu that need to be explor as far as outright purchas are concern   so i would put myself in the same camp as other who have taken that posit
we alreadi do repo in ginni
i assum that we could do more  as the first cut   do more repo befor we do outright purchas
i would associ myself with presid santomero     and other in want to complet the conting work first and prefer gnmas over foreign debt   i doubt that we   re ever go to need to do this  but mayb we could also buy  e by lower reserv requir at some point so that the amount of secur in the portfolio will be reduc
that would get somebodi   s attent  i   m sure     anybodi els want to comment on this
just two brief point   on the question of other asset that have the full faith and credit design  there is the credit issu and then there   s the liquid issu   so  as we look at potenti asset  the desk might decid that a particular secur meet our credit screen but it might not meet our liquid screen becaus not enough of that issu is outstand   so we wouldn   t necessarili automat be in the postur of buy that asset   on presid santomero   s point with respect to the foreign sovereign debt and which countri would be includ in the collater basket  just to be up front i should note that we are in that postur now with our foreign portfolio  where we do maintain a book of euro denomin repo   at present we take secur of six countri from the euro area that meet our credit and liquid screen  so we are in that postur now  although it   s not as promin becaus it is a small portion of our portfolio
let me request that don kohn review the transcript of the discuss we   ve just had   i think it   s fair evid that the conting plan has first and immedi prioriti and that there is a mixtur of view beyond that   also  i want to emphas that this is not an issu on which those who are vote member of the fomc at this particular meet should carri the day becaus this is a much broader question   so i suggest that you look at the full committe and make judgment accord  don  and if necessari get clarif from the member   then i would ask that you report your find to dino kos so he will have some answer to his question   those answer  i trust  will be somewhat less ambigu than what i heard at the tabl this morn   i think it was a use discuss  and implicit in what has been said are some use insight as to what the next step should be   unless somebodi has  anyth further to say on this issu  i will call on     and    son
thank you   i note with some consider relief the chairman   s remark at larri     s go away dinner in januari in which he equat the make of mistak with the learn experi   while i don   t think i would classifi the revis we have made to our forecast as correct mistak  i can safe report to the committe that the staff did have sever major learn experi over the intermeet period   i thought that perhap i could review this morn what it is we think we learn and the implic of those lesson for our forecast go forward   lesson     ask the right question   you may recal that in decemb  in defens of our forecast of an upturn in activ this spring  i report ask the research staff whether there had been ani instanc of recess that had fail to end   i now realiz that i should have ask the admit somewhat more metaphys question   are there ani exampl of recess that fail to begin    laughter   in understand how thing have turn out so much better than our earlier expect  there is an import question about what kind of cycl we have experienc   one reason reliabl characterist of busi cycl downturn is that mani thing tend to go bad simultan   in the context of our model  this show through as a correl in the error across spend equat dure period of recess   mani categori of spend fall short of the fundament for a  e  it is precis this synchron of error that lead to the nonlinear we associ  with recess   as you know  we had built that featur into our forecast   to a small degre through much of last year and in a more signific manner last fall   in the event  those correl have larg been absent   to be sure  the pronounc downturn in spend and profit in the busi sector led to weaker growth of employ and incom   spend in the household sector slow in respons to these develop but no more than would have been suggest by the fundament   if anyth  there appear to have been small posit surpris in our consumpt equat over the past few month   purchas of light motor vehicl remain at elev level  even though they have retrac some of the extraordinari spike seen last year   and real pce outsid of motor vehicl advanc at a    percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  when unemploy was rise sharpli  and appear pois to increas at a pace of near     percent this quarter  similar  hous construct onli edg down last fall and has move up smart earli this year  onli in part becaus of favor weather   this surpris strength in the household sector has combin with an earlier end to declin equip invest and a taper off of inventori liquid to produc a greater pickup in activ than we had earlier anticip   we have revis up our forecast for the growth of real output in the first half of this year from a   percent pace in our januari forecast to a rate of more than     percent in the current project   lesson     when it come to forecast product  use your imagin not your model   start late last year and into earli this year  we were almost continu surpris by the strength in domest spend   but given the extraordinari weak in employ and hour work  we signific temper the effect of those stronger spend data on our forecast of gdp   with read on inventori and intern trade yet to come  we thought strong domest demand was probabl be suppli out of inventori or from rise import  rather than from increas domest product   in fact  we view our januari forecast of    percent at an annual rate for the growth in output per hour in the fourth quarter to be a bold one for a period of purport recess   obvious  we show a signific lack of imagin   product is now es  to have risen at an annual rate of about    percent in the final quarter of        and with the latest avail data evidenc a similar pattern of strong expenditur and weak hour  our current quarter project of growth in real gdp of about   percent impli a still stronger increas in product of about    percent   so what do we make of these read on product   no doubt  there is a signific amount of statist nois  as there alway is  and thus ampl reason to discount these figur   howev  there also may be some econom reason whi product has turn in such a strong perform of late   for one  we weren   t the onli one surpris by the strength of final demand over the past four month  busi respond swift and aggress to the event of septemb    by cut payrol on the expect that a slump in demand would soon follow   but  with a few except  a sharp pullback in spend never materi   in order to meet better than expect demand  firm appear simpli to have squeez more out of their exist workforc   caution on the part of busi still appear to be in evid   the pace of hire has remain subdu  and mani busi peopl continu to express concern about the outlook   if our interpret is correct  firm should begin to hire more vigor as they gain confid in the stay power and strength of the expans   we think that process will be gradual  but in the month ahead we expect busi to increas hour work more rapid by lengthen workweek and ad worker   as hire catch up over the next coupl of quarter to the improv in product  growth in labor product is project to drop back notic   we also believ  howev  that there has been some signal about under product in the recent data   we boost our es  of the growth of structur labor product     percentag point this year and     percentag point next year reflect both these recent read and the improv outlook for capit spend  given the enorm increas we have seen  there is certain some risk that we have underreact to the news about product  much as we did dure the second half of the     s   as we illustr in a  book simul  if product were to turn out stronger than in our forecast  growth of real gdp would be higher as would corpor profit  and inflat would come in lower   fa  product growth  probabl help to explain some of the strength in demand over the past year  the fundament were better than we had recogn   go forward  more rapid growth of product provid a lift to expect incom gain  with consequ for current spend  especi on durabl good and hous   thus  these favor suppli side develop provid anoth reason for revis up our forecast this round   lesson     with regard to fiscal polici  quit while you   re ahead   over the past thirti year  economist have typic caution against the use of activist fiscal polici as a countercycl tool   the princip shortcom cite is that it often come too late and end up be procycl rather than countercycl   the tax cut enact last year  howev  provid a nice counter exampl   we believ the boost to dispos incom from the rebat and the cut in margin tax rate provid import support to household spend in the second half of the year  moreov  we expect alreadi enact legisl   both the second instal of tax reduct and a further step up in spend   to provid anoth boost to activ  this year   as you no doubt recal  we had built a fiscal s ulus packag into our forecast last fall when employ was collaps and unemploy was rise steepli  two key featur of that packag were extend unemploy insur benefit and a partial expens provis for invest   we then signific scale back that packag in januari  most notabl remov the invest incent  when the economi was show more convinc sign of a rebound and polit gridlock appear to set in   well  as our luck would have it  the recent enact s ulus packag was veri similar to that which we had incorpor in our forecast last fall  given the uncertainti that still surround the durabl and strength of the upturn  reason peopl could come to differ conclus about the advis of enact a s ulus packag at this point   but view from the perspect of our baselin forecast  this packag provid a modest posit shove to an economi that would otherwis alreadi have been grow somewhat abov trend   lesson     monetari polici still work with long and variabl lag   as you know  we have argu quit strong over the past year that monetari polici has been and will be effect   by our assess  easier monetari polici was lean against substanti drag from the collaps of invest  the weaker stock market  and the stronger dollar   with real interest rate well below es  equilibrium rate  we thought monetari polici was posit to encourag a rebound in activ   that now appear to have occur sooner and with greater vigor than we had project   as a consequ  we are assum a steeper upward trajectori for the feder fund rate in this project than in our previous one   we have pencil in an increas in the fund rate to   percent by the end of            basi point abov our januari forecast   this upward adjust reflect two factor   first  stronger under demand and fa  growth of structur product have boost our es  of the equilibrium real rate   second  with a smaller output gap and a higher path for inflat  the cyclic compon of monetari polici   not need to be as accommod as in our previous forecast   under our baselin  some addit tighten would probabl be requir in      to prevent the economi from overshoot   lesson     as the educ expert often remind us  learn is a life  process   there is littl reason to expect that our learn experi are behind us   as a consequ  it is probabl use to consid where we could be go wrong   we  see signific risk on both side of this project   one immedi upsid risk concern the behavior of inventori   we have onli one month of inventori data for the first quarter  and the figur for that month were stronger than we expect   even after this morn   s trade data  which   will be discuss short  we   ll need to see much greater liquid outsid the auto sector in come month to get our forecast of   percent gdp growth   the recent upturn in commod price could be a reflect of a drop off in the pace of liquid or even some re stock   that firm in price  by lower the carri cost of inventori  could also provid some incent for a more rapid turnaround in the inventori cycl   this would  in turn  provid greater upward impetus to activ  with knock on effect on product  sale  and spend that could give the economi an even greater head of steam  at least for a  e   there are some clear downsid risk as well   we have made a larg chang to our project on the basi of just seven week of data   and busi attitud don   t seem to have improv as much as the econom statist   busi peopl appar don   t see the substanti turnaround in corpor profit expect by equiti analyst   even assum that those rosier profit come to pass  equiti valuat still look rich by ani histor standard other than that of recent year   the upturn in capit spend isn   t a sure thing yet either   the improv in comput outlay look to be on reason firm ground at this point  but spend for some other type of capit equip is just now bottom out and  in a few case  outlay are still head lower   final  if the recent strength in product is all nois and no signal  we have mark up our gdp forecast too much   all in all  the uncertainti in the outlook remain veri larg   but they now appear to be center on outcom that  for the most part  are much better than we could have hope for not all that long ago
this morn the trade data for januari have just been releas  these data show a deficit of       billion  somewhat wider than in decemb and than we had incorpor in the  book baselin   compar with the revis decemb data  export of good and servic were about flat   import rose somewhat  just about return to their novemb level   when translat into real term  these data on balanc do not suggest ani signific chang to the staff   s outlook for growth in the first quarter  as the slight lower real net export than we were expect in the  book might easili be offset by a small chang in our forecast for inventori   in line with the posit shift in the outlook for the u s  economi in the  book  our forecast for real gdp growth abroad has also been revis up  particular in the near term   inde  to a consider extent  the more favor outlook for the rest of the world reflect the more buoyant attitud toward current and prospect activ in the unit state   our op   howev  is also ground in  inform we have recent receiv about develop in the economi of some of our foreign trade partner plus our expect that signific monetari eas alreadi in place abroad will s ul those economi   a rebound in econom activ has come first and most clear to the emerg market economi of asia  this develop appear to reflect the start of a turnaround in the global semiconductor industri and the relat electron sector   product data for the fourth quarter and those indic that we have in hand for the current quarter confirm that strong gain have been made in those economi that are intens produc of high tech good   export should contribut import to sustain  moder growth in this region over the forecast period  but we look for domest demand to recov as well   strong growth of real gdp is project to continu in china  support by continu strength in domest demand and posit develop on the extern front   for the major foreign industri countri the pictur is more mix   we have alreadi been posit surpris by the strength of product in the fourth quarter in  canada   of cours  the canadian economi should benefit substanti from the project u s  recoveri  but we also expect that strong domest sector within that economi and the lag effect of     basi point of past monetari polici eas there will be import factor in an acceler of econom activ go forward  for the euro area  the fourth quarter on averag was one of contract in real gdp  although there are sign of improv confid and increas product in some  countri  we remain cautious about the speed with which recoveri will occur and so have forecast a gradual return to growth at an annual rate of about     percent in the second half of this year and near   percent next year   a more robust global expans should be good for export from the euro area  but recoveri is like to boost import growth as well   on balanc  we look for domest demand to grow slight more rapid than output dure this year and next   the japanes economi is onc again an except to the pattern of growth that we see for most of the global economi   to be sure  there have been some posit sign of late   improv prospect for the rest of the world do impli a better outlook for japanes export industri  particular those in the high tech sector   and the serious collaps of the financi system that some had fear as the end of the current fiscal year approach now seem unlik   these develop appear to lie behind the rather dramat appreci in some japanes asset price that has occur in recent week   but worrisom offset factor remain   the bank system still has not resolv it nonperform loan problem  and it true capit structur is danger weak   the inspect now be conduct by the financi servic agenc will like refocus attent on these problem onc their result are releas   total bankruptci continu to rise   domest demand and recent product indic show further contract   accord  we have again written down a forecast of further declin in gdp dure most of this year and onli weak growth thereaft   in such an environ  deflat should persist throughout the forecast period in japan   we have struggl to assess the risk now confront our latin american trade partner   our best judgment current is that financi market will continu to distinguish among those countri  particular in regard mexico as more close tie to the unit state and canada than to it latin neighbor   we expect that the project recoveri in u s  manufactur will provid s ulus to the mexican economi and that we will see a moder strong turnaround in that economi this year   we also expect posit growth to return to brazil  but the risk  there are greater and the tie to the u s  economi are weaker   for argentina  we have project further sharp declin in output this quarter and for the subsequ four quarter   but it is imposs for us to have ani confid in that outlook as argentina   s problem are as much polit as econom  and the resolut of those problem is not yet in sight   moreov  there are addit risk to polit and econom stabil in other south american countri  such as venezuela and colombia   the direct effect on the u s  economi of develop in south america are not like to be larg  but a clear downsid risk to our forecast is that these problem might result in greater turmoil on intern financi market tha   we now envisag   i should add  howev  that develop in global oil market could have substanti effect on the u s  economi  and oil price have move up notic over the intermeet period   addit instabl in venezuela could add to the forc put upward pressur on oil price   with the stronger outlook for the u s  recoveri oper as the drive forc behind greater op  about the global economi  it may seem surpris that in recent day the dollar has come off it high of late februari   in part the explan is a stronger yen  which is due to some factor that are like to prove transitori given the unresolv problem in that economi   inde  ye day we saw some retrac by the yen   but in part the move down in the dollar may also reflect some further attent by market particip to the u s  extern deficit and the controversi over trade polici and the administr   s posit with respect to the    strong dollar    polici   with the dollar at a veri high level and an expansionari cycl set to begin  dure which the unit state is wide expect to grow more rapid than our trade partner for some  e  the outlook is for widen u s  extern deficit   at some point  the rise mountain of debt creat by those deficit may lessen the appetit of global investor for dollar denomin asset   the baselin combin of stronger u s  growth and tighten by the fomc suggest some upsid risk to the dollar that is offset in our mind by the possibl reaction of investor to the return to ever widen u s  trade deficit   it is this thought that has led us to incorpor in the forecast the project of a stabl exchang valu for the dollar
first  i was just curious     in your hypothesi that the sharp rise in product is a function of compani be blindsid to an unexpect rise in output or sale  have you taken a look at data for individu industri   i ask becaus this hypothesi is somewhat testabl in the sens that one would expect the compani that experienc the sharpest increas in sale or output also to be in those industri where product sudden acceler   has anyon look at that   i realiz it   s veri difficult to do with our industri product data becaus that   s beg the question  we are assum output per hour   but do we have ani collater evid
we don   t  mr  chairman   you   re right that one natur place to look becaus we actual get  e inform on industri data would be in industri product  but sinc a signific chunk of that index take labor input and make an assumpt about labor product  that wouldn   t be a veri fruit way of go about answer your question  for the rest of the economi  we get annual inform in the gross product origin data    which would allow us to look at that   onli with a consider lag   now  one thing we have notic over the last six month or so is that product in area where we have physic product data has been a littl better than we initi es  base on assum labor product   so there   s a littl evid   we do not get those data with high frequenc  and they don   t explain the fourth and first quarter   but i think they perhap suggest that someth has been go on over the last year that has been better than we expect
the fact that initi claim seem  at least temporarili  to have stagnat at a week level around         suggest that the type of rise in payrol employ and in hour that are requir to bring the growth in output per hour down may not  be happen
i think it would be too earli to say becaus so far the initi claim have been run more in the         area than the         area
well  i thought our data had them a littl higher  but mayb you   re right
i think the mid to high    s was where our season were suggest that claim were line up reason well with the payrol employ growth   for our forecast of payrol employ  which show a gradual acceler to about         a month by midyear  we have a declin in initi claim to around         within the next few month
incident  what is the staff   s es  of the march industri product index
we have a posit    for total ip   for manufactur it   s     and that is be held down by a falloff in assembl
thank you      in japan one hear a great deal about the amount and speed with which manufactur is be move to other part of asia where cost are signific lower  particular in the high tech sector     that suggest that this outsourc of manufactur in japan will lead to a differ respons on the part of japan to growth in other part of the world   will japan perhap not experi quit as much strength as has been the  case in the past when econom activ pick up throughout the world
it   s certain true that outsourc has becom a much discuss phenomenon in japan   and mani of the foreign direct invest flow into asia aris in japan becaus japan is still run a sizabl current account surplus   it has fund that need to be invest  and that goe hand in hand with japan   s strategi to do more of the manufactur in lower cost place   so in some sens i think the answer to your question is    yes      the japanes economi for some  e has not react to it export sector the way it did  say  back in the     s  mani peopl would still argu that  given the condit of the japanes economi  a fall yen and a consequ eas of japan   s deflat pressur  on the one hand  and a boost to it export  sector  on the other  constitut the onli salvat that they can envis for the japanes economi   so i think it   s a question of degre   yes  it is perhap less than it was some  e ago  but it   s still true that the export sector and invest in the export sector are what has to happen in japan to get the rest of the economi go   therefor  i think mani peopl would anticip that we will see strengthen abroad turn into the differ between further contract versus veri slow growth   not a boom by ani mean but at least a differ of that much   in the japanes economi
it may be that the currenc would have to move more to accomplish the same amount of s ulus
true   it   s certain possibl   but for exampl  the compon that we   ve written down behind the scene so to speak   which give us a forecast of veri low growth in      rather than the contract that we   ve project for        have to do with a combin of inventori plus export work in that direct to get the japanes economi to stop contract
i have a question for   on the longer term outlook for inflat  beyond the actual forecast period   i   m look at the baselin scenario and think about where the economi will be at the end of        we will have had a year of   percent real gdp growth  the economi would be grow beyond potenti   the output gap is elimin at that point  and the unemploy rate is at     percent  which is your es  of the nairu   and you mention that we probabl would have to rais rate in      to avoid overs ul at that point   do we current have a forecast for inflat for        i   m just wonder if by rais rate in      we will be too late   later than the market expect   to avoid inflationari pressur at that point
actual  this is an issu that   will be cover short in his remark   but look out beyond the  book forecast interv   again  i caution you to take these figur with an enorm grain of salt and mayb an entir salt mine   we would expect close to anoth     basi point of tighten to be necessari in        combin with the tighten we   re now assum in       that addit tighten in      bring growth rough in line with potenti  stabil the unemploy rate at just a littl abov   percent  and hold the core pce inflat rate at rough     percent   so the design of this forecast was that it was possibl for you to achiev that particular equilibrium go out beyond the  book forecast period with the amount of tighten we built in here   obvious  there are associ strateg question about tighten earlier versus later  and   will be talk about some of those issu in his present
i had a question similar to michael   s  and mayb i should just wait for vinc to talk   basic i want to ask you what you think the market are tell us about inflat expect  which we seem to think will continu to be low at the end of        they fit my definit of low  let me put it that way   ani inflat rate that start with a   strike me as low  and inflat  sn   t seem to be go anywher   i recogn that      is still up for grab  but the fed fund market seem to be impli more tighten than we have in our forecast   certain we   ve seen a good deal of movement in the yield curv as incom data have start to be more posit   it just strike me that everybodi either realli believ that a  higher rate of return is necessari becaus of higher rate of product or that there is some inflat risk that nobodi is talk about or that we don   t see in inflat expect out there  so that was one question  and probabl vinc is go to answer that  my other question had to do with this my i of consumpt   whi   it stay so strong   grant  the level aren   t strong compar with other recoveri  but given that there is reason to believ there is no pent up demand  your  forecast for consumpt seem rather strong  when one look at it relat to dispos incom  it is pretti strong   relat to wealth perhap it isn   t all that strong  so mayb there is some room   but you mention some consider with regard to the risk in the outlook for consumpt   so i thought i   d just ask you about that
well  so far   realli up until the current quarter   our consumpt function that includ both dispos incom and wealth in them were track reason well  one of the point i was make in my remark was that we actual have been assum that there would be some shortfal in consumpt behavior relat to those fundament  given the sharp rise in unemploy and the deterior we saw at least for a  e last fall in consum sen ent   that had been a reason reliabl featur of past busi cycl downturn   again  up through the fourth quarter of last year  it look as if consumpt was move along reason close to what the fundament would suggest   it will be more difficult for us to tell that stori if consum spend continu to increas at the pace that is appar thus far in the first quarter   it seem to be move abov what the fundament would suggest   now  that could mean that we   re wrong about the fundament   that   s certain a possibl   either the product growth could be stronger  or the overal under aggreg demand in the economi could be stronger than we think   and that may be what that consumpt behavior is reflect   but it   s also possibl that we   re go to get a bit of a payback for some of this current strength go forward   in essenc  we   ve assum that in this forecast   we think consumpt is get a littl ahead of the fundament in the first quarter  and we expect a bit of retrench  which allow some upward movement in the save rate from it current level to about     percent over the cours of our project  person  i think the risk in our consumpt forecast are now fair even balanc  i could see how it could continu to come in stronger than we   re forecast  but i   m still a littl nervous that some of the strength in consumpt that we   ve seen has been temporari   it may reflect some relief that this recess isn   t go to intensifi and peopl are do a littl more spend   or the substanti price discount that we   ve seen may have encourag spend that is not like to persist   so i could see some downsid risk as well
presid   ask my question   thank you
i   d be interest in some comment about what is go on in the german and french economi at this point
germani is in the awkward posit of be the weak link in the euro area  which certain chang the natur of the debat within europ from that prevail in the final stage of the pre emu period   both of those economi are in the throe of an elect cycl  which is certain complic event this year   the german are in the midst of a wage round  which is get a littl ugli also  with threat of strike and disagr be made public and so forth   so on balanc i still see the french economi as show a bit more buoyanc and vigor than the german economi   that had tend to be the case in            odd  the french economi was look better than the german economi and show more flexibl  which is certain someth the french had not been view as possess befor  that   s still on balanc true  we just had a summit on the part of the eu that had been bill as the one in which structur reform was suppos to be the key   the tone come out at the end of that summit was a sens of disappoint   part of the explan of that was this elect cycl   schr¶der  at least base on view of colleagu that i see when i travel to europ  is thought of as have fail   and the cdu is actual rise in the poll  which present an interest notion of what might happen next in germani  so on the whole  noth terribl is happen in either countri  but they   re not succeed in solv the problem they claim to recogn that they have   on balanc  franc probabl is do a littl better than germani in term of the basic macroeconom dimens that we usual track

thank you  mr  chairman   on the region  first i must say that even our most reliabl gloomi director and other busi contact are find it harder to sustain their pessim  but they work at it    laughter   broad interpret  even those who onli grudg admit that the situat is not as bad now as it was a few month ago   or at least not as bad as they had fear   are veri quick to add that busi has a long way to go to get back to where it was  in their fond recollect  a coupl of year ago   even the technolog sector seem to be show some stir   the veri fond memori that peopl talk about regard how great thing were just a coupl of year ago remind me of a bumper sticker i often saw when i travel in texa on busi in the mid     s   it said     lord  permit me one more boom  and i promis this  e not to piss it away       laughter   i think that   s a prayer that policymak should not want to see grant  both residenti construct and public sector infrastructur construct are report to be continu at a solid pace   in fact  one compani said that it backlog is now    percent abov the level of a year ago   one veri larg construct compani that oper not onli nation but even outsid the unit state report that  as of the end of februari  it had alreadi book    percent of the new busi it was expect to book this year  ltv steel has new owner  and they hope to resum oper in may   the combin of unload retire    pension and health care cost onto taxpay  along with substanti debt write down  renegoti union contract  plus the new tariff on import steel is said to be enough to ensur a good return on invest for the new owner   and it should enabl them to take market share from otherwis still solvent and from alreadi bankrupt compani as well   the moral of the episod for the industri may be that the first into bankruptci win  airlin that serv the region continu to report improv traffic  and they are ad flight  although oper are still well below year ago level   we check with major applianc manufactur that oper in the region  think their report might tell us a littl about what is go on in inventori for at least one industri   they said that product this quarter is go to be substanti abov that in the first quarter a year ago   on the order of    percent in a coupl of case   but then they were quick to say     but rememb that the first quarter of last year was a  e of sharp reduct in product becaus of concern about rapid rise inventori      now with inventori at more accept level and final sale have remain good  they are increas product and expect to report veri good earn for the first quarter  an increas cite concern among busi leader is the sharpli higher cost of insur   in fact  one director who sit on the board of director of one of the nation   s largest insur compani   and this is an individu who spent his own career in manufactur    said that he had never seen an industri with as much price power as the insur industri enjoy today   he ad that he believ account    fee also will rise sharpli in the near futur  turn to the nation economi  if there ever was a  e to practic pedal to the metal monetari polici  it was last year  especi after the terrorist attack   we were abl not onli to inject a massiv amount of liquid dure the day follow the attack but to continu to do so for a coupl of month until econom activ did appear to be stabil   import  we were abl to do so with our currenc continu firm in foreign exchang market and the appar inflat premium in bond yield remain more or less steadi   to me that is the best evid we could hope for that the credibl of our commit to maintain the purchas power of our currenc is unalt   it took a long  e to build that credibl   and the favor outcom of our polici action last year may be due as much to the strength of our reput as to our actual decis  by the end of the year  emerg inform about the economi was such that reason peopl could differ about the desir of more insur against risk on the downsid  and in fact  the committe   s decis in decemb was not unanim   in the three month sinc our last polici move  develop in the real economi and in the financi market   which i thought dino laid out veri well in his open remark this morn   have signal that this economi is high resili and that the outlook for busi and household has turn favor   dure this  e  financi market commentari has been that monetari polici has been unchang   but the rebound in real activ and the upward movement in market determin interest rate tell us that the natur rate of interest has been rise   in that context  an unchang nomin overnight rate has becom  de facto  more expansionari   if de jure eas in decemb was less than a sure thing  then further eas in the subsequ month  even if de facto  is less compel   certain there is a potenti for event that will lead to further downsid impuls and will unmistak be read as such by everyon   bar such event  the odd favor the build of momentum  the  e for  rais the fund rate come nearer  and the magnitud of the increas becom larger in order to catch up with the alreadi rise equilibrium rate  if i were in charg of draft the risk statement   and after i wrote this i realiz that don is not at ani risk at all of lose his job   i would say     recent and prospect develop in the real economi and in financi market have tilt the balanc of risk toward the stanc of polici becom pro cyclic on the upsid  and we must remain vigil of the need to eas off the monetari acceler      thank you  mr  chairman

i won   t get into that topic   the sens i have from our director and also from some commerci real estat folk who recent attend a luncheon at the bank is that they  don   t see a strong surg in hand  but there is a tone of more op   my wal mart contact say that it   s a littl hard for the compani to figur out what is go on becaus they believ that they are take market share  particular with the k mart bankruptci and store close   nevertheless  they are alreadi in the process of revis up earn expect   in mid februari  just about a month ago  wal mart announc to analyst that it had a higher expect for earn  and they are alreadi revis the es  up from there   inventori are in excel shape   higher consumpt spend will lead to higher order  there is just no excess stock in the store   wal mart see no import region differ and is expect sale growth this march over last march to be in the   to    percent rang  as for the transport industri  my fedex contact said that at this point vigor growth in it domest busi did not seem like  but he indic that there was a notic surg in busi from asia in particular  includ japan   current asian busi is up   to   percent on a year over year basi  and he is anticip a   to    percent increas for next quarter   most custom of fedex say that inventori are now too low to meet the demand that they see   while this is not true for those in the high tech area  even there the messag is     stand by  we may need more capac for ship good      he note especi that the invest incent in the s ulus bill might have a larg impact on the high tech sector   my up contact said that their custom don   t see an immedi surg  their expect are that busi will improv in the third quarter  but they don   t see it happen quit yet   the up situat is complic by the fact that it contract with the team  is be negoti and appar the team  and up at this point are rather far apart   so  that   s a big problem for them   my hunt truck compani contact also said that his firm   not see a big surg of busi  but he note that on occas recent his firm has had to turn down custom becaus of the unavail of truck for ship   there has been a major reduct in capac becaus of all the bankruptci in the truck busi  so occasion   though not often   they have had to turn down busi  overal  it   s easi to make the case sector by sector that we can expect a moder recoveri   it   s hard to see  for exampl  how hous can have a big surg   but from a macro perspect  it   appear to me that we have a massiv amount of polici s ulus in place  monetari polici has been veri expansionari no matter how one measur it  and there are fiscal incent as well   so  it may well be that we   re go to be surpris modest sector by sector and that it   s all go to add up to a pretti good year  i want to thank the staff for look into the industri product question   i think the staff memo on that was distribut to all committe member   let me just mention the bottom  line on this   when growth is vigor  we know that there   s a somewhat pro cyclic pattern to product   the initi es  of industri product are heavili base on input measur  so in a period of vigor growth  the es  of the industri product index will tend to be underes    let me cite the histori of the initi report of month chang in ip versus the revis number for the first twelv month after a recess trough   begin with march       if you add up the first report month by month chang over the next twelv month and averag them  that give you      percent growth in ip   current  the index as we look at it say that growth was      percent in that period   that give you an idea of what happen as a consequ of the index revis   in the first twelv month after juli of       the first report show     percent growth  and it   s now report at       percent   in the first twelv month after novemb       the initi data had growth at       percent  and it was revis up to      percent   in the year after march       growth was initi report at     percent  and now it   s shown as     percent   that was a slow first twelv month after a trough  my main reason for be interest in this subject is that  given the prevail view that we   re go to have a modest recoveri  we need to be veri care that we don   t have our preconcept reinforc by the first report on industri product   we need to pay attent to the revis in subsequ month as we get the actual product data   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the report that we   re now receiv indic that the seventh district economi is most like in the earli stage of recoveri  manufactur in the district is show clear sign of a turnaround   our midwest manufactur index was up in januari  with gain in three of the four subsector we measur  so the strength is not just in the automobil industri   in addit  for the first  e in over a year all three of our region purchas manag    index   for chicago  detroit  and milwauke    indic expans in februari  with strength come from new order and product  our director and other contact report that custom are order for inventori rebuild  and there are even a few report of increas in capit spend from some applianc maker and auto part supplier   nonetheless  mani contact remain cautious   at this  e most busi are say that there is signific excess capac and they are not plan to increas spend on fix capit as quick as they had come out of previous slowdown  our advisori council that met earlier this month echo those comment about capit spend  with regard to the labor market  manufactur still appear hesit to hire perman employe  but two major temporari help firm headquart in our district are see modest increas nation in demand from manufactur   one of them even mention receiv emerg call from client who were ramp up product unexpect   januari data for our district reinforc the impress that labor market are slight firmer in our region than in the nation as a whole  and the pace of layoff also has slow   nonetheless  consum spend is not look as bright as elsewher in the nation   report from our contact in the retail  travel  tourism  and entertain industri were veri uneven   still  by and larg  even those report weak sale were not say that thing were get wors   furthermor  hous market remain strong  and if labor market continu to improv  that should bol  household sector spend go forward   automak are more bullish  most have rais their      sale forecast onc again   this  e by more than         vehicl compar with the es  they had last  e we met   howev  they express concern about increas in steel price result from the recent impos tariff even though their purchas price are fix by one  or two year contract  turn to the nation outlook  at our januari meet i was expect that real gdp would increas   percent this year   sinc then the outlook has clear improv   the household sector has continu to surpris us on the upsid   the posit develop on product should bol  household incom and busi profit  and the econom s ulus packag is a plus for invest   still  there continu to be downsid risk   inventori rebuild will boost product  but whether that increas is sustain will depend on whether the economi generat more fundament increas in final demand   even with the s ulus packag  i see invest as a major risk   our forecast build in a weaker than averag cyclic recoveri in busi fix invest   howev  i   m concern that excess capac may weigh on capit spend even more than we have assum   and negat wealth effect could weigh on the household sector more than our current outlook project   so in light of these consider  while i believ a recoveri is under way  i expect that growth in the first year will be slower than in similar period in past recoveri   overal though  i see the risk as much more balanc today than when we met in januari

thank you  mr  chairman   while the news on the district economi is still somewhat mix  i would have to say that in general it has been on the posit side  perhap surpris posit   hire has resum   activ in the manufactur sector has stabil and begun to expand   mine activ on the iron rang in northern minnesota and the upper peninsula of michigan has start to pick up  and that was true even befor the tariff on import steel were announc   and for the most part  the economi in the we n part of the district are report to be do well   residenti construct is a particular bright spot  some builder have indic that they are book out into       although cancel are alway possibl   i   m hear veri littl about inflationari pressur  though of cours one can find particular item about which peopl have some price concern   busi attitud are the one thing that continu to concern me becaus i think busi peopl are still uncertain and quit cautious about the econom environ   i suspect that is larg becaus of their concern about profit go forward   and i suspect that some at least are still adjust with some difficulti to an environ of price stabil   retail have general done well in the  district and  as bill pool mention  inventori in the retail arena are low   so if posit sale surpris continu  that will lead to substanti order and presum to increas in product  on the nation scene  i have few comment to make   for some  e  there have been reason to be op ist  and now i don   t think it   s go out on a limb to say that the recoveri is at hand   i   m impress by the size of the upward revis to the  book forecast   i  too  was earlier think that growth would be in the neighborhood of   percent this year   i   m not inclin to chang my view on that just yet  partial becaus there   s nois in the data and partial becaus i think there may be some payback effect yet to come from the consum side  but if we do get growth of someth like   percent  which is below the  book forecast  i would still consid that to be a veri satisfactori  or mayb better than satisfactori  year
mr  chairman  at the last meet i report on texa billboard  and i wish jerri jordan had alert me that he was go to rais the issu of texa bumper sticker today   one of my favorit is good advic for the fomc   it say      be alert   texa need more lert      laughter  speaker      i like that

we know that the futur keep chang  but so   the past   the bls has lop         job off the es  for texa for the end of decemb  and that revis convert what we thought was an employ gain of   percent into an employ reduct of   percent   if i   m not mistaken  it chang the dalla area from be character as one of the strongest metropolitan area in the countri in term of employ growth to one with an actual employ declin   we had thought that employ in texa had turn down about six month later than in the nation  but now it seem to have turn down at about the same  e  around april   so we are in close correl to the nation economi in that regard  in the latest beig book  the report from the dalla district was one of the most negat  if not the most negat  of the twelv district   i ask for a report at last thursday   s board meet on whether our contact had seen sign of a pickup in the few week sinc the beig book report were compil   the report were mix   a few note some sign of strength  but most comment that they were see a continu of sluggish condit   the report from the semiconductor industri was downbeat   the pickup in demand is not as robust as was thought a month ago   and there   s an expect that much of the new capac in the     millimet wafer fab will go offshor to taiwan  it may be too soon to say that the texa recess has end  but the stronger than   expect perform of the u s  economi rais the prospect of a quick turnaround   after declin for most of       on a re benchmark basi texa employ surg in januari  our lead indic have been climb for the last few month  and i   m becom increas confid that growth will begin this spring  one reason for concern has to do with the potenti downsid risk for the mexican economi   i   m hope that the  book analysi of the mexican economi  which suggest that the worst is over  is correct   howev  the strong peso is price the maquiladora out of the market  transform them from a sourc of strength to a sourc of weak   maquiladora employ fell an unpreced    percent in        and mexico   s goal of get it inflat rate to converg with that of the unit state will continu to support a strong peso  which may not bode well for a vigor turnaround in mexican manufactur as the u s  economi continu to rebound   lead indic for the mexican economi do not point to an upturn ani  e soon  and most forecast anticip growth in      that is too weak to generat growth in output per capita   if the maquiladora continu to be price out of the labor market  a u s   recoveri may not translat into job gain along the border or increas in mexican import from texa  as we might otherwis expect  i   d like to compliment dave   for his excel present and   for her earlier discuss of argentina  which i thought was veri good   turn to the nation economi  is this a great countri or what    laughter   i must say that i find the persist strength in the econom data to be veri encourag  and like everybodi els  i   ve been revis up my forecast over the last few week   the growth in product increas my op  that ani increas in inflat pressur will be delay and subdu and that growth beyond the recoveri will be more vigor than we might have expect befor  look perhap more like the later      s than the earlier      s   while we now have greater fiscal polici s ulus in the pipelin than was the case at our januari meet  the bulk of that s ulus is not like to be felt for some  e   given the consist improv econom data  the risk to the forecast seem more even balanc than they have been in quit a while   the onli thing that concern me a bit is the upward creep in oil price in recent week  that could becom a wild card go forward
thank you  mr  chairman   as i look over the incom data on the new england economi and consid the view express at various meet i   ve attend in the period sinc the fomc last met   meet of our various advisori council  our board of director  and a varieti of communiti group of which i   m a member   i   m struck by a coupl of thing   first  as compar with the situat at our last meet  not a lot has chang   the current situat remain challeng  but the economi appear to have bottom out in an increas number of area   and the six month horizon appear if not bright then consider better than the present   but second  as we look back over       what has chang sinc our last meet   along the line of what bob   just said   is our appreci of what went on dure the past year   it now appear that the region experienc a larger hit to growth than had been thought  and this is play out in most state  particular in massachusett  in the form of a fiscal crisi  employ rose in new england in januari  and unemploy fell   and while the unemploy rate remain signific below that of the nation  labor market are said to be much easier  with temp firm especi comment on the increas avail of suppli  busi is still quit weak for the staf firm  the fourth quarter was character as the worst ever by one contact   but sign of a pickup in      are emerg   softwar and it firm said demand rose in recent week  as custom began to activ dormant invest plan  discretionari it spend continu to be on hold  but some softwar nich are grow  particular in the area of secur  suppli chain manag  and bio informat   small busi and manufactur say they are invest in must do project  especi those that increas product   but in general they   re tri to make do with exist technolog   in some case  and this was particular interest  offici of small firm that are part of our new england advisori council   more than a coupl of them   report that they actual were use new technolog to bring manufactur back to the unit state from place like india  appar they   ve run into innov that have enabl them to offset the higher local salari and benefit cost  particular in new england  and to improv the profit and qualiti of their product as well  real estat market in the region seem to have surviv the worst of the downturn  with increas in commerci vacanc rate flatten out and residenti market gain a bit  though it should be note that residenti market in the region never realli soften all that much  similar  consum and busi confid has continu to pick up  though most of the increas is focus on futur expect rather than current condit   inde  at the most recent meet of our bank   s board of director  i found the sen ent to be similar to what other have mention   busi and banker repres on the board were singular more cautious   more conserv  if you will   and more concern about the current situat than the econom data might warrant  particular the econom data at the nation level  recent annual revis to region employ data help to answer a few question about the natur of the region   s downturn over the past year or so   given the concentr within the region of high tech manufactur and softwar firm  one would have expect new england to have experienc the recess earlier  more like the west coast  and to be hit harder than the rest of the countri   earlier data did not indic steeper employ loss than in the nation as a whole  but benchmark revis now suggest that this was in fact the case   such loss seem to have been concentr in massachusett and primarili in busi servic  particular in the area of comput servic   the fact that the new data draw a bit differ pictur than the old like relat to the number of small high tech busi in the region and the difficulti of accur captur the data from such firm in the ongo employ inform  the revis trajectori of employ also help to explain the sever of the state fiscal crise in new england and especi in massachusett   outsiz state revenu increas in the late      s  fuel larg by capit gain and tax on realiz stock option  had financ expand medicaid benefit and cut in state incom tax   stock market relat revenu stop grow in        inde  in massachusett overal state revenu grew at a rate of   percent or so in fiscal      and is actual contract at a rate of    percent in fiscal       given the pace of medicaid cost increas this year and the yet to be implement phase of state incom tax cut  larg gap in state financ are expect to continu well beyond fiscal       even assum that a solid recoveri in the region is in place   given the size of state raini day reserv  which grew substanti dure the      s  some amount of the gap can be fill  but fill the rest won   t be easi and will like involv sizabl cut in state spend and the collect of new revenu of one sort or anoth  turn to the nation pictur  near everi data releas sinc our last feder open market committe meet has brought with it good news about the grow strength of the economi   from the upward revis to fourth quarter gdp to the surpris growth in product  the begin of job growth in       the flatten of inventori deplet  the continu willing of consum to buy auto and hous  and the glimmer of a reenerg manufactur sector  the situat is better now than i certain expect it would be when we met in januari  look forward  the shape of our forecast is not unlik that of the  book   s   given the surpris strength of q  and now q   we see gdp growth moder a bit for the rest of the year  with growth q  over q  at about our es  of potenti      percent or so   and then fa  growth in        given the moder pace of the economi   s rebound  unemploy in our forecast trend down slowli and inflat stay about the same  no matter what measur we use   obvious then  i don   t see much to find fault with in the general paramet of the  book forecast  i would rais two question about the outlook  howev   the first involv the risk to the forecast   as i see it  the risk  along the line of dave     s comment  are becom much more balanc than they were   on the downsid  i think the veri height of the equiti market and pe ratio suggest some level of fragil and risk in that area   there is also some downsid risk in consum spend  particular given the moder person incom growth and high debt level   there is certain some uncertainti about busi spend other than that relat to inventori deplet given the high level of excess capac   clear the new depreci allow work onli if busi want and need new equip   i don   t think a   percent reduct in the cost of capit is enough to drive new spend on it own   final  i think there is some downsid risk in the state and local sector  i don   t think massachusett is alon in experienc a fiscal crisi  but unlik the situat at the last meet  there are upsid risk as well   consum spend could be more ebulli than the modest growth pattern in the forecast   inde  comparison of spend to wealth relationship suggest the possibl of some upsid risk in that regard   so  unlik dave  in term of the consum i see risk on both the downsid and the upsid   contact at thomson first call have stop their bearish comment and seem to feel that analyst    project of profit  even in technolog  are believ   except for japan  the rest of the world seem to be pull out of the downturn  and the potenti for pressur on oil and other commod price is there   so the bet are not all one way at last  this lead me to the second question   and a lot of peopl have made refer to this    and it   s a polici relat question   by ani measur  the stanc of polici right now is s ul  real interest rate are at or below zero   this is appropri for an economi in a downturn with lot of downsid risk   such risk prevail  but the strength of incom data and the exist of upsid risk as well seem to me to argu for a measur return to a more neutral stanc   that would requir a move back to a nomin rate somewher in the   percent area  at least on the basi of the bluebook analysi of equilibrium real rate  the question is how fast that move should be   the  book forecast and the market as well assum that the move will begin relat soon and will extend over        howev  that happen against the background of onli slowli fall unemploy and inflat that  if anyth  eas  clear  we need to be forward look in polici  and we need to be concern about the potenti for the economi to overshoot   but i think we also need to be ask ourselv basic question about whether or not unemploy rate in the low  s  with inflat somewher in the  s  is what we   re aim for   is that realli the target of polici   we need to be talk about those question in a more explicit fashion as we move ahead   for right now  i think there   s probabl a littl  e yet to engag in convers about our object
thank you  mr  chairman   in look at econom activ in the tenth district  we have to separ out colorado a bit from the rest of the region   exclud colorado  we are see fair good sign of a turnaround   layoff announc have subsid  consum continu to spend  and hous activ is solid   moreov  busi confid appear to be inch back up in most of the district   colorado continu to contract becaus of some real weak in the telecom sector  which continu to be plagu by excess capac and  some rather tough price competit  let me talk a littl about the manufactur sector   it is improv and  base on our survey  there are sign of greater op  about the futur   the bank   s latest manufactur survey found that product and shipment strengthen a bit in februari   in addit  op  about futur product and order continu to build   for the first  e in mani month  firm in the manufactur sector expect to be hire worker in the near futur rather than lay them off   for now  capit spend remain below year ago level  but i   m hear  a lot of convers about how manufactur are look at take advantag of the new tax law   it is extrem interest to them in term of how they look at their capit invest plan and the  e of ani futur invest   so it is on their mind at this point  commerci real estat in the district remain weak   vacanc are high in most of our market  put some downward pressur on rent   denver is clear the hardest hit  with realtor say that there may be at least a two year inventori in that citi  so they are a bit pessimist right now   consum spend and hous activ are general solid in the region  apart from a few high end store  retail say their sale have been improv and are somewhat abov year ago level   and home sale have also strengthen   starter home are do veri well  and even the high end area is start to see some activ   energi activ has stabil after declin through the second half of last year   the district   s rig count is the lowest in two year  and coal price have come down fair sharpli  make it hard even for low cost produc in wyom to be make a profit right now   labor market are slack  although there are sign suggest that employ is stabil   we continu to experi a shortag of nurs in our region and a limit avail of worker in a few skill area  but employ are still abl to find help without veri much difficulti   at our okalahoma citi board meet  a director who has a nationwid temporari help agenc said that activ at the firm had pick up signific across the countri   so there are some sign of a pickup in demand for temporari help   price pressur without question remain low across the region   and the ag sector is wait for the farm bill  let me turn to the nation econom outlook   our assess is realli quit similar to the  book   s  name that growth should be abov trend begin this quarter and continu through next year   the econom factor generat this forecast are clear  and i   ll onli mention them   first  monetari polici is clear s ul  with the real fed fund rate in the neighborhood of zero   fiscal polici has been s ul and has becom even more so recent  energi price remain relat low  although we are see some increas in that area   and the inventori adjust is contribut to growth  have cite these fact  i have a coupl of observ   or mayb i should call them concern   first  i think the likelihood that the rate of output growth will be greater than trend this year is high and increas  if i were to put a number on it  i   d say the probabl is abov    percent   while the output gap is posit  the probabl that the gap will close sooner rather than later is increas  not decreas   my second point is that the current fed fund rate  as other have said  is clear below equilibrium  and i would say perhap signific below equilibrium   at it current level  it is generat substanti amount of liquid and  therefor  set up condit that i think will give rise to futur econom imbal   moreov  take into account dave   s lesson number    it is creat condit that could generat higher inflat  say  twelv to eighteen month from now  base on the length and variabl in the lag   so  in my view these are some of the factor we should talk about in the polici round   i would offer one other thought   i think move sooner  mayb even today  may mean that we will have to move less later   and i believ that would be veri favor in the long term for the u s  economi   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   condit have definit improv in our district sinc the last meet  as seem to be the case elsewher around the countri  busi peopl in our region are more op ist than they were  but i would say that at this point their op  is still rather cautious  along the line of the attitud that gari  n and some other have describ for their district  break it down a littl  local area in our district with a signific defens presenc  such as the washington  d c   and the norfolk  virginia  area  are recov nice   we are also begin to see some improv in the district   s manufactur base in the  ina  furnitur shipment and order in particular have strengthen  presum becaus of the continu strength in hous nationwid   there has also been a glimmer of improv for the first  e in a veri long  e in the textil industri   that probabl is also relat to hous  activ  and it has been quit a while sinc i   ve been abl to say anyth posit about that industri   we also see improv condit in some other industri repres in our region  notabl plastic and chemic   so there are certain some sign that our region is particip in the appar reviv of the economi nation  other indic  though  suggest that while momentum is build  it is build at a fair moder pace in our area   for exampl  what i hear about consum spend in the region is fair posit  but i wouldn   t call it spectacular by ani mean   a number of retail tell us they still have to do a lot of discount to move particular good and servic  employ appear to have stop declin in the region  but as far as i can tell it realli hasn   t turn up sharpli yet   and we still hear a few announc of layoff from  e to  e  although not near as mani as we did last fall  the revis  book project  of cours  indic a more pronounc improv in the nation outlook than some of the anecdot comment i just summar for our region might suggest   but the project are certain plausibl  given the strength of the latest data   it may well be that the anecdot inform i   m  hear is a littl behind the curv  given the rapid of the evolut of condit general   i also  like bob    thought dave did a great job with his brief  and i think the lesson were well state and well taken   still  the revis from the last  book to this one   and i   ve been look at the  book for mani year   are about as dramat as ani i can rememb   the staff now expect real gdp to grow at a rate of   percent in the first half compar with   percent predict onli seven week ago   for me perhap the most strike chang is the   percentag point upward revis in the project for real gdp growth in the first quarter despit a fair signific downward revis in the contribut from a slower pace of inventori liquid   of cours  the differ is a big chang in the project of privat domest final purchas  which are now expect to grow at a   percent rate in the quarter as compar with the earlier project of a     percent rate of declin in the januari  book   as a lot of peopl have said  this appar dramat strengthen of final demand obvious reduc the downsid risk that mani of us  myself includ  were veri worri about last fall  moreov  the net growth in job in februari  even if some of it was due to favor weather condit  suggest to me that the labor market may be stabil   i think that   s veri  import becaus  if that is the case  it would reduc job secur as a concern among consum   and continu solid growth in job and real wage is need to support consum growth at the   to   percent rang project in the  book  final  the improv in the manufactur and industri sector of the economi at  the nation level   in addit to the region improv that i mention earlier   also reduc the downsid risk look forward becaus the weak had been concentr in those sector   it now appear that manufactur output will rise in the first quarter for the first  e  sinc the summer of        the prospect for manufactur activ will brighten further if the signific improv in busi spend for equip project in the  book actual materi  against this background  it seem clear that the key question regard the near term  outlook for the economi from the perspect of polici   and other have allud to this   is how strong the earli stage of this recoveri will be   i think the answer to that question is go to turn in larg part on the  e and the profil of the swing from inventori liquid to inventori accumul that presum the economi is now in the process of go through  the  book expect continu inventori liquid  albeit at a progress slower rate  through the middl of the year with actual restock onli begin thereaft   i think the turn actual could come sooner due to stronger expect sale growth   if it    that could have a signific impact on the behavior of the economi in the month ahead  which has implic for our polici in the near term that we need to think about when we have our go around on polici later   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  busi condit have also improv in the sixth district sinc our last meet   indic are that the pace of econom activ is increas despit the fact that condit in some industri and some region

has continu  enhanc the chanc that the recess has bottom out and that the economi is on a more upward trajectori   howev  i   m not yet prepar to be quit as op ist as either the  book or our own bank   s var model forecast about the speed or the trajectori of the recoveri   i continu to be somewhat cautious  think that  after the inventori rebound has materi  growth in final demand may be more modest than some are anticip  with less improv in profit and invest spend   one of my director last week quot someon as suggest that it   s begin to feel like a profitless prosper   in addit to other fundament that would seem like to temper the vigor of the recoveri  the recent rise in oil price  as other have mention  could have a damp effect on demand and serv as a remind of the risk that onc again may be face us  balanc against these caution i do recogn a number of factor that are consist with the more posit outlook present in the  book   first  substanti s ulus remain in the pipelin   the money suppli continu to grow at a veri strong pace   second  it   s now clear that govern deficit spend will like expand  ad to aggreg demand   and the recent pass invest tax credit  as almost everyon has suggest  should further bol  demand for equip and softwar  which alreadi appear to be pick up   in that regard  i would mention a confirm anecdot from the chief financi offic of up   he note that semiconductor shipment from asia were run about   percent higher in decemb on a year over year basi and that this trend had carri over into the first quarter of this year  addit  while pare back their purchas of  vehicl and airplan  up told us that they are push ahead with their own comput and softwar invest   and our contact at cingular wireless  headquart in atlanta  indic that they

 million pace   given that automak show few sign of pull back rebat and favor financ program  there may be littl or no payback from last quarter   s extraordinari sale   fourth  the sustain rebound in product note in the  book may portend a more posit outlook for growth   that  coupl with the fact that mani firm drastic cut their workforc  may present a more posit profit pictur  especi if firm remain cautious about hire  consist with tom hoenig   s comment just befor the break  some of our director suggest that this is the case in report that increment addit to the workforc of mani firm are occur through the hire of temporari rather than full  e employe   put this all togeth lead me to the conclus that the risk to the expans have clear becom more balanc   have said that  i would emphas that i do not believ that the downsid risk have gone away or gotten substanti smaller   and i think we have  e to judg more care the momentum of the expans befor we start revers the path of interest rate  now more than ever we need to think about the longer run  and i believ that the  book simul help us in that regard   frank  if offer the opportun to lock in ani one of the forecast in the altern simul in the short run  i would take it in a minut   at this point  my own hunch is that the slower growth scenario may be among the most like  look forward  howev  it   s clear that rate current are unsustain low   they will soon need to begin to rise   henc  i believ we must get in a posit to make that happen   suppos we ask ourselv  what should the nomin fund rate be with a real gdp forecast of   to   percent  as now reflect in the  book  and pce inflat between     and     percent   it seem clear that the answer would not be    near    percent    but someth more like      to     percent      this mean that we have a lot of work to do   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i report at our last meet at the end of januari that the foundat for recoveri was in place in the third district   i now believ that such a recoveri is under way   district econom condit have improv over the past two month   the manufactur and retail sector have strengthen  and the outlook of busi contact in the region has turn consider more posit   there are still pocket of weak   for exampl  commerci vacanc rate have increas in the last few month  nonetheless  forward look indic suggest continu improv ahead   our most recent data come from the busi outlook survey of area manufactur   the march survey result will be releas this thursday   i report last  e that the index of general activ had turn posit in januari for the first  e in fourteen month   that increas was follow by anoth increas in februari  and our march survey will show anoth posit read at    percent   while that is margin lower than februari   s    percent read  i   m not too concern about this declin for two reason   first  the swing we saw in this  index from negat to posit in januari had been larger than the typic swing at the end of  recess   second  though fewer firm report an increas in activ in march  the number of firm report increas was more wide distribut across industri   the index on shipment and new order also remain posit in march  with about   percent more firm report increas than decreas   last month the index of deliveri  e rose abov zero for the first  e in two year and it  too  remain posit this month   while firm continu to reduc inventori in march  the reduct are slow  and for the first  e dure this downturn  firm are report that they expect to increas inventori in the next six month  our survey also indic that manufactur firm continu to shed worker   they did so in march  and the workweek continu to shorten   howev  consist with the strengthen in activ  the employ outlook has also strengthen sinc januari   our march survey suggest that in general  manufactur expect to increas payrol over the next six month  in a special question in this month   s survey we ask the firm that expect to increas product how they expect to do it   over    percent said that they plan to hire addit worker  about    percent plan to increas the work hour  and about    percent expect to increas product sole through increas product of current staff work at current hour   i find this last number particular interest   it underscor the fact that product gain have becom a signific compon of busi strategi in our area   product gain and weaker demand in earlier month have help to contain price pressur in the district   in march  howev  the current price paid and receiv index in our busi outlook survey turn posit for the first  e in eight month   price expect are posit and rise  my view of the nation economi has turn signific more posit over the intermeet period  as the data have been fair consist on the high side of expect   i now believ the economi has turn   notwithstand the strong data  i continu to believ that this recoveri will be weaker than most experienc in the postwar period   as we all know  howev  weaker than usual  sn   t mean weak in the absolut   in fact  the current rang of forecast that have been made for the first quarter and for all of      would support my character of a recoveri that is weaker than the averag postwar experi   this view part reflect the strength of consumpt spend throughout this econom downturn  which has been the primari factor in the mild of this recess   in the earli stage of a recoveri  real pce growth is typic quit strong  often abov   percent  reflect recoveri in the consumpt of durabl more so than nondur and servic   but dure this downturn  auto and home sale have remain strong   with less pent up demand  consumpt growth should remain moder   i also believ that it will take  e for busi spend to reignit   on the other hand  the govern budget continu to be more s ul than anyon might have guess onli a year ago  and busi have a habit of respond quick to chang in market condit   so we may yet be surpris on the upsid  in ani case  given the revis  more posit outlook  i believ it   s  e to refocus our attent on the longer run   we now see that the recoveri is in place   that   s not to say it   s a sure thing  but econom condit have begun to improv across various sector   our expansionari monetari polici is have the desir effect   the committe now need to contempl it strategi for move the stanc of monetari polici back toward neutral   at this point  we don   t need to decid where neutral is  but we need to take the necessari step to allow us to rais rate in the not too distant futur   this mean prepar the public and the market for such a  e   thank you  mr  chairman
let me add a coupl of thought to what has been said thus far   we   ve talk a bit about the seem dispar between the attitud of busi leader and the direct of the economi   i spent a good part of the      s do strateg plan and identifi corpor goal  and one of the interest chang that took place over that decad was a telescop down of a multitud of corpor goal to a singl one of sharehold valu   i think the extent to which the busi communiti will be happi with a recoveri in the economi and the perform of their individu busi will depend in part on whether or not they think the stock market is go to recogn it   so until that happen  i suspect that we will have a somewhat pessimist or at least somewhat disappoint busi communiti   should they see the market start to perk up  i think we will see a differ in attitud  i tri to identifi some of the public polici issu that may affect the economi  and there are a few   one of them is the current absenc at the moment of terrorist insur   i think there will be a bill befor this session of the congress end that will provid a backstop for that risk  we had some discuss earlier about the effect of the lack of terrorist insur on the commerci mortgag back market   as the  book point out  the market seem to have identifi and isol the area of risk   so i think that the  book well pretti captur that particular exposur   we   ve talk about the s ulus packag   the  book also deal with the potenti explos middl east situat   and the scenario in the altern simul that call for a     per barrel increas in the price of oil  with onli a modest downward pressur on the economi  seem to me to identifi that risk exposur   a third one  the steel tariff  we also talk about a bit   an import factor will be the manner in which the rest of the world view the imposit of those tariff   a point that   discuss in an earlier meet   it will be  interest to see whether the world see that as a polit event that is a singl  isol anomali or if they see it as a drift toward protection   i think that will be determin in part on how the bush administr follow up that action and how it choos to comment on it on an ongo basi  the one reserv i have about the  book forecast relat to the feder govern budget   the staff project from      to      a   percent increas in feder receipt in spite of the tax increas and onli a   percent increas in expenditur   that will take more disciplin in an elect year than we saw in the last elect year cycl   so i think that   s a potenti downsid risk   have said that  i do not see ani exposur that were not well captur in the  book analysi and in the other materi provid
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s economi has shown further sign of improv in recent week   retail sale were report to be abov plan in februari  rebound from a lull in januari   consum confid pick up notic in metropolitan new york citi  there   s a much better feel to the communiti   labor market are show sign of bottom out across most of the region  with modest job gain in both new york citi and northern new jersey in januari   residenti market for singl famili home as well as co op and condo have continu to gain momentum sinc my last report   in fact  the onli weak in the manhattan market now is for rental offic space and rental apart   banker report some let up in consum loan demand   they are enforc tighter credit standard on their commerci borrow  and delinqu rate are hold about the same  we agre essenti with the size and shape of the forecast in the  book  and i must say that i  too  applaud today   s staff present   anyth that combin humil  self  confid  and humor is much to be applaud   we think that the risk in the outlook are in fact about balanc   consum confid could be a littl less than both our staff and the  book anticip  and the intern situat  which i think   captur veri well  probabl has more downsid than upsid risk to it  in regard to the queri about busi fix invest  i think you probabl all heard of the busi confer that was held in boca raton about three week ago   they should have been look at the same data we are  and yet the vast consensus was that we were still in a  recess and would not pull out of it until toward the end of the year   i think busi peopl clear are mesmer by their own concern about their profit pictur and probabl are draw too flat a trend line from their experi in the latter part of last year   one would have to think  if the busi recoveri is stronger than they expect  especi in light of labor product  that profit almost have to be stronger than they are anticip or that at least a pleasant surpris in their profit could take place   and that could get busi confid turn  up more than we are anticip in our forecast  inventori are also an interest situat becaus those of us who firm believ that the inventori were be handl better becaus of inform technolog actual had a pretti good stori go through the first three quarter of        but in the last quarter the steep drop in inventori was just way off the scale   so i think one has to assum that a lot of the inventori liquid was involuntari on the part of busi and was a result of consum spend come back much stronger than they thought it would   now the question is whether the secular downward trend in the inventori sale ratio will continu   which i think is essenti what all of us are assum in our forecast   or whether the present inventori sale ratio after that fourth quarter drop is lower than busi want it to be   if it   s the latter  restock could occur sooner and be more intens  which would be a veri big posit kick and an upsid risk to the forecast  so in general  we think that intellectu the balanc of risk is equal   i must say  though  that my gut is tell me that the upsid potenti is probabl greater than we have in the forecast   so it seem to me that we   re in a period of watch wait and that perhap we should be particular awar of the upsid risk potenti   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the phrase    march mad    normal refer to basketbal but  as we can tell from the staff   s introductori statement  march mad  this year describ the frustrat in the forecast communiti as they deal with the chang incom data   and i   m extrem sympathet to that   i was one of those who saw main the downsid risk at our last meet  and i must say that this  e it   appear that the risk are much more balanc  first  on the upsid  let me pick up where bill   just left off   i also look at the inventori swing as possibl creat an upsid risk   clear there are some sign that the massiv inventori liquid undertaken in the u s  economi last year is over   the pace with which rebuild occur i suspect will be driven by a number of factor  but some may have to do with this sens of uncertainti due to terrorist attack   that might lead busi to want to hold more inventori than had previous been the case   and as bill indic  the inventori sale ratio  instead of continu to come down  may stabil and inde be a littl higher than i think is implicit in the  book  the second area of upsid risk has also been touch on  and that is this question of product   i  like other  am pleas that product seem to have held up quit well dure this downturn   we saw just a few year ago that an economi that is enjoy a posit suppli shock is not immun from upsid risk or inflationari pressur   and it may well be that the surpris good news with respect to product may lead to more robust invest and consumpt than perhap is built into most peopl   s forecast  the third area of upsid risk is that the indic certain suggest that thing are turn rather quick   let me just point out a coupl of them   one is the ism  former napm  indic   manufactur activ rose in februari to the highest level in a year   more import and interest  the new order index from the ism surg in februari to it highest level sinc       which i think is perhap more posit news on the order front than other may have pick up   final and most import on this sens of upsid risk   and other have said this   both fiscal and monetari polici would have to be describ as be s ul for good reason   but those forc that are built into the system may propel the economi over the next sever quarter and lead to growth that is signific abov trend  that said  there are still four thing that i consid ongo downsid risk   one is that  while the growth rate is like to pick up  the level of gdp will still leav an output gap for the forecast period   as a result of this output gap  the unemploy rate remain stubborn high   hang up abov the staff   s es  of the short term nairu for some quarter to come   that may weigh a bit on consum behavior  a second element of downsid risk is that not onli do we have slack in labor market but signific slack in capac util appear to exist as well   that may lead to a reduct in the incent for busi to expand capac even as demand pick up   i would add to this the appar pessim of ceo in our largest busi  which i think creat a further risk for the invest pictur   and unfortun the ceo of the larger firm are not the onli one with an uncertain outlook   the most recent nfib survey result suggest that ceo in smaller busi also are quit cautious about invest  inventori  and hire plan  the third area of downsid risk   and other have said this as well   is that the pessim of ceo seem to be driven by a strong sens of a weak profit outlook   one must wonder what the ceo are pick up from their sale forc in particular that lead them to be much more pessimist than the aggreg data might suggest   at some point  i think there has to be a recalibr or a reconnect between what the ceo see and what the gdp number are report   and inde  if the profit outlook of ceo   built on their anecdot data and their order book   turn out to be correct  then obvious that   s a bit more of a downsid risk  final  mani of the forc that have undergird the economi dure the last year  includ decreas mortgag rate  declin energi price  and incent to purchas automobil  are unlik to have a similar s ul effect go forward   put all of this togeth  while sympathet to the fact that we   re face a great deal of uncertainti  i would say that the risk at this stage   in term of the issu that confront us   are relat balanc and we should be in a posit to respond appropri to incom data  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   there   s a sens in which turn point present the biggest challeng to monetari polici   when econom activ was strong as in      or weak as in       the requir direct of polici was clear   the balanc of risk was clear  and market expect were clear   when polici has to turn cours as in late      or now  thing becom much more delic  first  there can be littl doubt anymor that we are at such a turn point   throughout the past year the fundament forecast question was whether hous and consumpt could hang in there until the inventori and capit overhang got work off   this was a question until about two month ago   but at this point the string of posit data releas for both consumpt and invest seem to have settl the matter rather decis   on the consumpt side  consumpt itself has been stronger than forecast   the stock market is come back   tax cut have help   layoff were not as bad as fear   and now consum expect are begin to rise   on the invest side  the inventori overhang seem to be work off veri quick  perhap reflect the warp speed economi that a certain person here is alway talk about  there could still be an overhang in communic equip  but even new order for that categori are level   order and shipment for comput are rise again  as are other shipment   and now  like a fire truck arriv late at the scene after the fire is out and spray water all over the place  the congress has enter the fray with invest induc  possibl magnifi the next boom   reflect all this  the blue chip forecast are revis their project upward in a pell mell process   so much so that one wonder whether these forecast are realli forecast or just look out the window    laughter  this all set up a difficult issu for monetari polici   it has alway been true that onc we hit the end of an eas cycl we would have to tread delic   we would not want to rais rate too quick and risk snuf out the turnaround  nor would we want to tarri too long with rate well below equilibrium and risk inflat down the road   that dilemma is still there   but with everi day   s news i find myself worri less about the first side of the dilemma  prematur rate rise  and more about the second  tarri too long  in late      when we had the revers of this dilemma we were abl to turn polici around fair quick  go from a posit bias to an actual cut in rate in about six week   the  e pressur on us may not be as great this  e   we begin the process with high unemploy  low capac util  and relat quiescent inflationari pressur   but thing have chang quick in the past two month  and they can chang quick in the next two month   for exampl  if invest sudden came roar back or if the product spurt rais profit and stock valu  we would have to be readi to negoti a turnaround and possibl a quick one  thank you
final  governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   the inform we   ve all seen sinc the last meet indic that the recoveri is here   in fact  i question whether the word    recoveri    is appropri for the event we   ve been through and whether we realli did have a recess   it clear has been shallow and not a    v    or a    u      i think it shape has been a bit more like a saucer   i   ve been focus on some of the manufactur and trade inventori inform  and i   ve been surpris at how fast inventori liquid has occur   import  as a coupl of peopl have alreadi mention  the inventori sale level are back to where they were in the earli month of       which was the begin of this slowdown   that would impli that busi inventori posit are in good shape  and i think industri product is alreadi pick up in respons to that  in common with governor    the new fiscal s ulus packag make me wonder exact what the target is   this recess was uniqu in that it was caus by excess busi invest in select area   so to encourag more spend in the area that alreadi have excess invest seem to me a peculiar type of recoveri medicin   base on anecdot report from busi peopl i   ve talk to as i   ve been travel to some of your bank and other meet i   ve attend  i wonder if a lot of the excess capac that appear to be out there is excess capac that is perman shut down and will never come back   if that   s the case  it will have implic also for invest go forward and   perhap even more import    for product  sinc the idl capac is like to involv the least product resourc  consum spend is continu to grow  even adjust for the unusu wave that was creat between the fourth quarter and the first quarter due to automobil sale promot  consum dispos incom look good   incom tax refund are run way abov where they  were last year  reflect i think both the tax cut and over withhold as consum    incom fell dure       the product improv in the fourth quarter in mani way show that busi were surpris by the level of final demand in that quarter   as we normal see dure a recoveri  product has increas   the pessim about final demand that ceo have shown throughout this period is one of the reason that product has been so strong   ceo believ that if they couldn   t control the top line  then the onli way to meet their profit goal was to deal with the expens line   in fact  the more policymak use word like    recoveri     the more i think that will tend to make ceo and busi peopl even more pessimist  sinc obvious  none of us around the tabl believ that the recoveri from this period of slowdown will be  anyth like the recoveri from a typic recess   so ani ceo who is expect a bounceback compar to those experienc in past recess is go to be sore disappoint  final  in term of employ  if the unemploy peak is suppos to signal when we should start to chang direct  then i would say that decemb was that peak   i find it interest that we now have discuss of a high unemploy rate at     percent and a long term nairu at    percent   i would echo the comment of my esteem colleagu  the presid of the feder reserv bank of boston  who suggest that in determin the appropri polici stanc as we move forward we should look again at the nairu of    percent when our long term inflat forecast is run well below   percent
thank you veri much   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that   low distribut dure the coffe break    the resili of household spend  the sign of stir of invest  and the signific slow of the inventori run off that have becom evid in the past seven week would seem to reinforc the judgment that the committe   s eas cycl has drawn to a close   the better news has cumul to produc a   percentag point upward revis to the staff   s forecast of real gdp growth this year and has been associ with sizabl increas in market yield all along the matur structur  presum speak to similar substanti chang in investor expect   while there have been favor develop of late  for real gdp growth to persist around or a bit abov that of it potenti will requir household spend to continu  to be well maintain   despit the save rate be quit low   and invest to gather momentum  despit the fact that a recoveri in profit has not yet been establish   market particip seem confid that polici will be enter a tighten phase  but no one expect the committe to begin it today   that is probabl becaus those analyst appreci that even a quick snapback in spend will take some  e to whittl away prevail resourc slack  and as a consequ   inflat should remain low for some  e   this would give you the opportun to await convinc evid on the under support to the expans of final demand befor you need to act to preserv low inflat   these consider would seem to impli that the answer to the question     when should the committe begin remov the unusu degre of accommod put in place last year     is    not today      rather  the more pertin question would seem to be how to assess the balanc of risk if the fund rate were held at      on a surfac read of market price  it might appear that the pronounc upward slope of feder fund futur rate impli that market particip assess the risk to be so tilt toward inflat that you will need to begin tighten veri soon   i   ll offer an altern interpret that suggest that the structur of market rate may not be inconsist with hold the fund rate at it current level for a  e   i will then use that framework to consid a key strateg issu you face that  in turn  bear import on today   s polici choic   the string of surpris strong data on spend and product releas over the intermeet period prompt the    to    basi point upward revis to market expect of the feder fund rate shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit   as a result and as plot in the right panel  market price now emb an    materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     anticip that the fund rate will rise to    percent in mid        there are three notabl featur of this configur of rate that i list in the middl left panel   first  feder fund futur rate move signific abov    percent in a coupl of month  appar signal the belief that polici will begin tighten on the heel of the end of the eas episod   what is puzzl about this should be evid in the bottom panel  where i   ve split the path of the fund rate over the past two decad into the obvious eas and tighten episod   as shown in the panel at the middl right  paus sinc      after a sequenc of polici action were lengthi   second  money market futur rate climb almost continu over the next coupl of year  impli that polici tighten will be extend   but as the middl right panel also show  phase of polici tighten sinc      have usual last under one year  and third  these expect of immin firm are difficult to squar with the publish forecast of most market economist  who fail to forese the sort of pressur on resourc that would requir action soon   there is an altern explan that fit these observ on polici expect quit well and that also may help to resolv these seem anomali   in  a regim switch model  we can view market particip as expect the nomin fund rate to return to a more sustain level rapid onc the tighten process start but hedg their bet as to when that tighten will begin   the top panel of your next exhibit give a formal of this notion   in particular  i assum that market particip expect the committe either to keep the fund rate at it current level or to begin tighten   onc a tighten phase is begun  everyon expect that the fund rate will be steadili  but fair rapid  move up to some sustain level with no revers or paus   last  if the fund rate has continu to be held constant in ani given month  market particip assign a constant probabl of switch over to a tighten phase in the next month   this model can be fit each day to the expect path of the fund rate deriv from  futur market   the upper right panel show the evolut of es  from this model of the market   s assess of the probabl that the committe will begin to tighten next month   although the current read of an    percent chanc of tighten begin next month might seem small  these probabl must be cumul when make forecast sever month ahead   as plot in the middl left panel  accord to current market price there is a one in two chanc that the fund rate will be rise six month from now   the right panel suggest how aggress that rise may be expect to be   es  deriv from ye day   s close futur rate suggest that market particip believ that onc you begin to tighten  you will move the fund rate up about as fast as you move it down   within one year   or about at the norm of the prior decad   howev  presum becaus inflat has fallen in the interim  you   re view as like to return the fund rate to a level of onli    percent  lower than it level when eas start in januari        to be sure  you are decid on the appropri stanc of polici to adopt today  and what happen over  e depend on develop that are inher unpredict  so you may view this interpret as unlik in practic   nonetheless  think in term of the path of interest rate over the next sever year highlight a key strateg question you face   what inflat rate would you prefer to prevail after interest rate and output have been realign to more sustain level  to get some sens of the possibl  my colleagu in r s who maintain the frb us model ran simul  describ in the bottom panel  that extend the forecast until       preserv the key featur of the  book outlook   here is our opportun to dig deepli into the salt mine that dave mention earlier   the simul use the version of the model in which worker and investor form their expect base on past observ of import macroeconom variabl  these scenario envis the consequ of move the real fund rate to it long run equilibrium level of     percent relat smooth in one year  along the line of the regim shift model   the simul differ accord to when you are assum to start tighten   next quarter  one year  or two year later   if defer polici action for anoth year or more seem like a long  e  i   d note that the cumul probabl deriv from the regim switch model impli the expect of about a one in five chanc that you will not have start tighten by the second quarter of        that said  veri littl probabl weight appear now place in the market on the possibl that you would hold the fund rate at    percent for more than two year   these simul  shown in your last exhibit  put number on the obvious   the longer the committe wait to tighten  the more unemploy will be work down at the expens of an ul  step up of inflat   what these simul show is how sizabl those differ can be   were polici to begin move the nomin fund rate up next quarter   shown by the black line in the upper left panel   the drift higher of the unemploy rate to    percent by year end      in the middl panel would open enough slack to induc core pce inflat  the bottom  panel  to settl at around   percent   delay that process by one year  the blue line  or by two year  the red line  would forestal that rise in unemploy at the cost of about     and     percentag point of higher inflat  respect  down the road   the   percent rate of core pce inflat achiev under the immedi tighten scenario would be as close to a work definit of price stabil as the u s  economi has achiev in five decad   if  despit the associ   percentag point  temporari rise in the unemploy rate  the committe desir that outcom  it presum would communic to the public that it near term assess of risk was tilt toward inflat   after all  were your longer run inflat goal to be   percent  the prevail inflat rate of     percent would seem to pose a greater sourc of discomfort current than the margin of unus resourc   but you also might find some appeal in move toward risk tilt toward inflat if you were worri that the economi could snap back more quick than in these simul  so that hold inflat around it current level  let alon reduc it  was in doubt befor too long   that is  in the forese futur   the appar turnaround in the prospect for invest  favor news on product  and recent legisl busi tax incent repres a real shock that may warrant a real respons in short order   in that regard  i   d note that some es  of the equilibrium real rate report in the bluebook rose as much as    percentag point over the intermeet period   it is also possibl that the committe might not see much benefit in defin price stabil as the veri low outcom for measur inflat in the immedi tighten scenario   there were  e late last year when the prospect for the economi were suffici gloomi that the zero bound to nomin interest rate loom larg   keep a bit of an inflat cushion might help to reduc those anxieti in the futur in case aggreg demand weaken to the point where a negat real short term interest rate was call for   if you   re comfort with the prevail inflat rate and think the  book assess of the under forc shape econom perform is about right  then either the staff project or the scenario i dub    intermedi tighten    would offer an outlook in the near term  with perhap onli small net deviat from your dual object of maximum  sustain growth and price stabil   moreov  the odd on addit advers shock  which darken the outlook just a few month ago  might seem to be consider reduc   if so  the risk might be seen as balanc   true  with the real fund rate close to zero  the committe will ul  have to tighten   but    ul     might be beyond the horizon at which you deem the forese futur to end   the case for retain the balanc of risk toward econom weak could possibl be made base on the delay tighten scenario   were your inflat goal realli to be that much higher than recent read  you   d presum prefer to make some inroad into current resourc slack and might see the possibl of addit eas as not too unlik   but allow that much slippag in under inflat seem too much at odd with what you have said and how you have act in the past  rather  retent of the tilt toward weak would more appropri be underpin on some combin of two belief   first  these simul  as well as the  book forecast  might be view as be premis on too pessimist a view of the economi   s abil to use it resourc without engend inflat   a point governor bie and presid   have made   if that were the case  you could make those inroad into labor market slack seen in the delay tighten scenario without the worri drift up of inflat   inde  if you didn   t  inflat might get uncomfort low   second  you might be concern as to whether the expans of final demand will be well maintain  especi if market particip get ahead of  themselv in anticip tighten if anyth but the retent of risk unbalanc to weak were announc   essenti  you might have view the risk as balanc at the market price that held in  say  late februari  but the rise sinc then    and the potenti rise were you to chang the tilt   might seem to you as tip the scale toward weak

vinc  this exercis is veri interest   if you were to show me the bottom two chart of exhibit    i think i would talk a long  e  about the attract of the blue line  particular relat it to some of the studi we   ve had in previous meet about the zero bound   i   m troubl  though  that that outcom occur by tighten polici a year from now   i   m troubl in the sens that it   s hard for me to believ  and i don   t know if i can articul that concern well   could you help me understand your analysi a bit   i ask becaus i see in the forecast what i view as rather strong econom activ and  given the long lag involv  to wait anoth year seem to me to be extrem danger  although i clear see big advantag to that altern outcom
i think part of the answer  presid parri  is that it is beyond the abil of our model to differenti between the fomc   s start to tighten a quarter or a half year from now and four quarter from now   given the artifici of the exercis i   ve done  it may veri well be the case that one would expect a much differ configur of market price as each month went by and the committe did not act   so that is clear a risk here   i think the import point to get out of that true blue line is that it isn   t obvious that polici action is immin   that some element of delay is possibl  and i   ve put it in these term to help frame the balanc of risk decis
veri interest   thank you
yes  i have a similar comment and question   i   m typic a stay ahead of the curv guy  but i rather like the outcom depict by the blue line   so you   re shake my preconcept a bit   howev  i think a strategi that a number of us might be comfort with is to start tighten fair soon but to go a littl more gradual   not quit so abrupt as you have in the black line in the upper right panel   hope that might produc an end result somewher between the black and the blue outcom shown below    laughter  actual  i think that would be my choic   the bruis choic
i would point to the regim switch model  which i think speak to two thing that you   ve said   first  it isn   t necessarili the case that market particip have a sharpli delin expect of when you will start tighten   so i think it isn   t obvious   and i probabl should have includ this in my answer to presid parri   that fail to tighten after a meet or two will necessarili prompt a backlash in the market   if the market has a    percent probabl that you will act  then it has an    percent probabl that you will not act  the second part of the regim switch model is the notion that the committe can dip a toe in the water and the market will view it as pure that   i think part of the attract of a model like this can be seen in the experi of the tighten episod in        the chairman went up to the congress and told the world that interest rate would be rise   mani committe member share that assess of the econom outlook   fed fund futur slope sharpli upward   but as soon as the committe start tighten in       those futur rate move up  essenti  the way i would view it is that the probabl in the market that the committe would act were relat high but that the act itself sent them all to     the market envis you embark on a relat rapid tighten phase and re price accord   so there is a risk associ with take some action and think that the rest will be defer   in my view  the one opportun in that regard  which some market comment have note  relat to the wide recognit that at least a portion of your eas action involv in some sens take out an insur polici   cancel that insur polici isn   t necessarili a commit to  complet realign rate
my first thought when i saw this chart was    be care what you wish for    becaus i had indic in my comment that we need to talk about these issu   i   m not sure i was prepar to talk about them at this meet   in ani event  i would total want to avoid be associ with the red line becaus i do not believ that two year is the appropri wait period now   i believ that our polici stanc is s ul  and i think we have to rais rate   and i do take your point that onc we start  the market are go to assum that the trajectori will be fair rapid  even look at the blue line  the issu that i have is  have we settl in on a number below   percent on the inflat side and an unemploy rate around   percent or so as be  the ideal   or are we will   sinc event put us there in the late      s   to say that mayb some number in the  s  the high  s perhap  is a better settl point for unemploy  given chang  in product and given a whole rang of thing that are perhap differ within the economi  i don   t know the answer to that question   i just wonder about continu focus on number for inflat that start with   and whether or not that bring into play the issu of measur problem   the usual assess of the extent of the measur error is around   percentag point   so if we realli have a number that begin with    there is veri  veri littl inflat in the economi   is that our goal   again  i   m happi with the outcom in the blue line though i don   t think we should wait two year befor we tighten   i don   t think we should wait even one year   i know we have to bring the fund rate up from the current      percent   the question are when  how fast  and what our ul  goal are
i think a messag in the altern nairu simul that dave put in part   of the  book was that  if you believ the nairu is lower than the staff es   you could associ yourself with the red line in the middl panel and get an outcom like the blue line in the lower panel or better   it   s just a question of what your assess of the nairu is
may i make just one follow up comment on that   it   s import to rememb  though  that you don   t get to choos what the nairu is    laughter
we don   t know what it is  but we don   t get to choos it either  howev  by virtu of the fact that we have to write down a forecast  in some sens a nairu is embed in there   but ul   as vinc   s middl panel of exhibit   show  to stabil inflat you   re go to be driven back to whatev is the equilibrium unemploy rate
yes  i know he had to make assumpt
i have a comment and then a question   the comment is that i think the differ between now and februari      is that we have been so much more transpar  begin around that  e  when we initi the practic of announc the decis taken at each meet   so i think the likelihood of our surpris the market to the degre we did then is veri  veri low or certain much lower than it was then  turn to the model  which you explain veri well  vinc  am i right that the term    right away        in one year     or     in two year    as a polici model should realli be view more broad than that   isn   t it more along the line of    right away        wait a while but we   re not quit sure how long     or    wait a littl while longer though we   re not quit sure how long that is either      what i draw from this exercis is that essenti it   s a veri good guid on whether we have to do someth today and not a veri good guid on whether the delay should be a year or less than a year   is that right
i would say that my confid in the model is such that i contempl not put number along that axi but just send the messag that it was now  later  or even later
small  larg  and veri larg   laughter   did you want to  say someth  ned
i want to echo what dave said   to reflect the properti in this model  the long term unemploy rate has to be the nairu  which is     or     percent   and if we should be lucki enough that the nairu is below that  we could redo this exercis   we   d get the same basic pattern  but we wouldn   t end up at the same precis rate of unemploy  howev  we do have to end up at the nairu  even though there is statist uncertainti about what that is
ani further question for vinc   if not  let me get start  this has been an unusu interest meet in the sens that we are integr our polici discuss with the outlook for an economi that is undergo signific structur chang that will in turn determin where our polici should be in the futur   our problem is to figur out  where that will be   in this regard  the extent to which the market respond to what they think we think is a problem is in my view go to be an increas difficult issu for us to deal with as our presum credibl continu to rise  as a number of you have mention  we are at a turn point  howev we wish to defin it   a characterist of turn point is that  as the economi goe from negat growth to zero growth to posit growth  it is veri difficult to es  the slope of the upturn  and differ slope impli huge differ in the perform of the economi   we are observ this interest phenomenon where all the macro data that economist look at have turn decid posit   but peopl in the busi communiti  as a number of you have point out  don   t think in term of the gdp data   they look at their profit figur   gdp is a veri interest construct   it is the market valu of consolid output  and consum market and final sale market more general domin that aggreg   the averag businessman is look at his sale and his cost   typic  labor cost do not constitut a veri larg part of those cost becaus most of them stem from purchas materi  which reflect somebodi els   s labor cost  so the consolid system that we look at is not the model that the averag businessperson look at   as a result we have to reconcil  as some of you have point out  what is essenti a realli quit negat outlook on the part of the busi communiti and what we are see in the consolid system  i was at a busi roundtabl discuss not all that long ago and present a gdp outlook that was not great differ from what we   ve been discuss today   the number were smaller  but the upturn was there   my audienc look at me as though i were an alien from some peculiar planet   the difficulti obvious is that we   re not go to get the econom perform that is implicit in our macro forecast if inde the view in the busi communiti is that profit are not go to improv  that prospect rate of return on new facil are not go to be adequ  and that price power is complet gone   the reason  as we   re all acut awar  is that consum spend is go to be onli modest help at best  and the major impetus for sustain the expans after the inventori invest upsw   out will have to come from busi capit invest   so  translat all of this  the real danger here is that we could end up with an inventori invest surg  and inde that   s pretti much what we may be get at this stage  and find that the surg and the overal expans have sudden run out of steam  we have seen this pattern befor   i rememb be both fascin and disturb in the earli month of      when the economi came out of the      recess like a bull charg out of a stockad into the ring  and then all of a sudden the economi hit a wall   the swing had been veri dramat  but there was no impetus left  and the economi slow down   inde  as you may recal  it slow down enough that the carter administr came in postul the persist of a recess and propos a fiscal s ulus packag becaus that   s what they had promis dure the elect campaign   but circumst chang  and they got laugh out of the box  if i may put it that way   this is the type of situat that i think we are deal with  and it   s go to be veri difficult to pinpoint what is actual go on  in one sens we have seen a dramat acceler in the econom adjust process as inform technolog has increas affect the perform of the economi   we end up with a pattern of    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate when similar circumst in the past would have call for    basi point   someth happen veri quick to which we respond veri sensibl in my judgment   it   s a fascin issu as to whether the upsid ahead of us will involv the same pattern   at the moment we don   t see it  but i must say that we didn   t see it on the downsid either   the logic of a quick econom adjust process on the downsid presum will appli to the upsid   the argument against that is that  even though the economi has evid gone through a period of mark increas in flexibl and resili  we may be face an outlook for inflat that is much more difficult to assess   we current are see price discount  which is go to go away becaus it   s essenti not cost base   it is basic the consequ of downward pressur on profit margin and  given the outlook for under cost  that eventu is go to revers  and we are go to get some price inflat larg becaus margin have to open up   and as they open up they will eventu run into the same problem they encount previous  name that labor cost will begin to rise   but the initi impact in an environ in which there is great flexibl and great resili is that we will not get veri strong inflationari pressur  as we went through the previous downsid period involv a dramat adjust process occur veri quick in the economi  we react veri prompt   i don   t think we were  fulli awar of the possibl that we could be look at deflat in the eye   i think bob parri   s immedi reaction to the blue line in vinc   s chart on altern scenario was a respons to that risk   and when i look at those chart i had the same reaction   do i realli want pce inflat to go down to     percent or someth like that   i would  of cours  if i were sure  that   s as far down as inflat would go and that it would stay there   but with inflat at that level we would be expos to a signific probabl of deflat  and we would not have a sens that polici was in equilibrium   in other word  we are look for price stabil  and i think quit correct   and have gone through this whole period  one could argu in retrospect  that we may have move too fast on the downsid   but we were face signific risk in that period  and i think our polici move turn out just fine  my impress at this point is that we are of necess look at someth differ  this is a differ type of economi   this is a differ type of busi cycl   we now seem to be at a reason good point   we have come to that point in part by good polici judgment and  in part by just plain luck  but i think it is one from which we can work   my impress without get into much detail is that short term rate in general clear are lower than we may want them to be   if the economi begin to rebound rather quick  i think we   re go to want or like to see long term rate move up   inde if the mortgag rate goe up  we will get some restrain effect on person consumpt expenditur becaus a good part of pce has been financ by equiti extract from the appreci in hous valu   moreov  if the price of oil continu to rise  i think that is also go to constrain consum spend to some extent  so as far as i can see  the balanc of risk is no longer tilt toward weak  the risk clear are about equal in both direct   and i do think we may have a short period when do noth is the best polici altern   i would certain suggest that we do noth on the fed fund rate today   but i   m by no mean certain about whether we will feel the need to move it up in may   clear one could argu that the pattern of adjust in the economi has acceler   in this regard  i think the risk of move in    basi point step are like to be much too high   so we probabl will have to move sooner and in smaller increment  given our incomplet knowledg about the chang overal structur of the econom system with which we are deal  my thought is that at least one way to get a leg up on the possibl that we may want to move in may  without move the balanc of risk to heighten inflationari pressur at this meet  is to indic in our press statement today that we view monetari polici as accommod  without ani further elabor   that  i think  would enabl us to move in may  if we choos  without generat ani serious reaction in the market   and if we decid not to move in may  that would be accept as well   by the  e of the may meet  i think we will have learn a good deal about what is happen to inventori invest and it impact on the economi and  of cours  about trend in profit and capit invest   i   m not say that we   ll know the final answer  but we   ll sure know a lot more about the direct   so my judgment is that the call is a relat easi one for this meet  at least as i see it at this stage   but i also believ that our decis are go to becom progress more complex   the one thing we   re certain about is that the world  sn   t move as smooth as vinc has portray in his chart and it   s not go to look that way later   perhap he should have taken the number off these chart   accord  i will put on the tabl the propos that we keep the fund rate target unchang at    percent and that we move the balanc of risk statement to balanc   vice chair
thank you  mr  chairman   i concur with your recommend   and i would point out that if the next move has to be up  which i think it will be  we can certain move from a balanc balanc of risk statement   there is no reason at all in my view to inhibit us from do that
thank you  mr  chairman   first  as for the         episod  i realli don   t think that hold ani lesson that would help us this  e becaus what preced our first  action then was quit differ from today   in that earlier period we had had  as i recal  some sixteen month of no chang in the fund rate   and part of the lesson then was that ani chang at all was huge news   this  e it has been veri recent that we were take overt action   also  the last action after septemb    are veri well understood in the market as action taken that we probabl wouldn   t have taken in the absenc of the event of that day   so to some extent we can distinguish between the revers of the post septemb    reduct in the fund rate and whatev tighten we might do after that   with proper statement from us to the public  i think that first part is easier to explain and to do   beyond that  though  i think the pace at which we move rate up may be asymmetr from the pace on the downsid   we cut rate rapid becaus the risk premium rose rapid in term of invest decisionmak   and if the risk premium is onli gradual revis downward as businesspeopl gain confid  it may be appropri to be gradual in a tighten phase even after a veri acceler  aggress eas phase   have said all of that  if we hadn   t been at all constrain at this meet  by the bias toward weak in our statement at the januari meet  i probabl would be more enthusiast about an increas right now   but i do feel that constraint is real   so i think we have to have no action this  e  but at least set the stage for possibl action in the futur
i endors both part of your recommend
i also endors both part of your recommend   and i think that you   ve articul well the kind of challeng we   re like to face at the next meet   thank you
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   i had at the top of my page of note that this is probabl the easiest decis we   re go to face for quit some  e  which you point out as well   i also want to reflect just a bit on what we have ahead of us   the market is go to be ask the question   probabl after this meet in fact   how far and how fast rate will go up   we obvious don   t know the answer to that   but in tri to produc a last recoveri  it   s go to be import not to have a    disconnect    between what the market come to expect and what we think we are intend   i am attract to the idea that jerri jordan mention about tri to condit the market to the concept that we have some undo of the insur polici that we took out after septemb ll   that that level of rate is sort of a baselin to go back to   i do think that we run the risk of get behind if we move onli in    basi point step   just count that out  it   s clear that it could take quit a few meet befor we got back even to undo the eas sinc septemb
oh  we could move intermeet if necessari
well  we could   i   m not in favor of move between meet unless there is some signific reason in the incom data to do that   at ani rate  an intermeet move would give us step of    basi point  and whether they come individu in    basi point increment i think is much less import
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i   d like to make just a quick comment  follow up on what bill pool said about how we would be look at this process of tighten in the next few week and month   in my view it   s import that our  behavior as we move in this direct is symmetr with our behavior on the downsid   we eas polici veri aggress last year   i support that  and i believ it was appropri   in fact  one can argu that those action may have contain and restrain the recess   we were abl to do that becaus we had credibl  our credibl was well establish   i think we now need to move as aggress on the upsid as necessari to maintain that credibl so that we will be well posit in the futur  actual i think one could make a case for tighten polici today  but i agre with your recommend   i would say that i like veri much your suggest that we use the term    accommod    in our statement becaus i believ mani in the market will see that as someth veri close to a switch in the tilt by two notch to a tilt toward tight  which would posit us if necessari to move the rate even befor the may meet   it   s a long intermeet interv  and a lot could emerg in that period  and i think we ought to consid that possibl if we need to
mr  chairman  i agre with both part of your recommend   i don   t think there   s ani urgenc to move today   i do think we can go from a balanc risk statement today to an increas in the fund rate in may without ani problem at all   and i  too  like the idea of put in the statement someth about monetari polici be accommod now
yes   let me clarifi a point with respect to what i said to  bill pool   bill  my view of    or    basi point is that i would think we   d start with move of      we may have to pick up the pace   inde  that   s a judgment we can make   it   s just that i would not start with a    basi point increas   i think that would be disrupt
i   m certain inclin to go that way  too   but i can imagin data come in that would suggest that thing are move a whole lot fa  than we anticip and that a move of    basi point would be appropri
the burden of proof would have to be on a veri extraordinari chang that we realli didn   t anticip   at least that   s the way i would look at it  presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman   let me just make one addit comment   we   ve been look recent at what i suppos i would generous call some low inflat polici rule   while recogn that beauti is frequent in the eye of the behold  the implic of these rule  at least at the moment  is that there is no need to move today
i support your recommend  and i particular like the comment about polici be accommod
mr  chairman  i certain see a need to proceed as you   ve outlin  today  and i would support that   i would add  though  that i think we could continu to see some fair strong data and perhap some data surpris on the upsid  given what we   ve experienc recent   so i believ that have the accommod languag in the statement is veri import   and in my view the possibl of an intermeet move of    basi point should be a possibl that is out there   if the market understand is that we   re not plan to do    basi point but that we may be move sooner than at the may meet  i think that could be veri healthi for us   i hope the press statement  sn   t foreclos that possibl
yes   you know  we   ve been veri fortun   we have been abl to move  with veri few except in the last coupl of year  onli at meet   that is not our histori   we have been requir to move intermeet mani  e   so it   s onli if polici is extraordinarili well construct that we move onli at these arbitrarili schedul  e   we hope that will to continu to be the case  but we can   t assum that  and i suspect you may well be right   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i   m typic easili persuad by simul  but i think i like the scenario that you laid out    where we get start relat earli with smallish step  feel our way   better than the black and blue choic  laughter  that   gave us   the latter might be black and blue in some differ way   i would recal a point that jerri jordan made earlier  and that is that if we rais nomin rate slowli  if the real rate is rise  we   re still be pretti accommod   so that might be anoth argument for get start on a rate increas relat soon   but the one point i would note about the simul is that they lower the cost of delay below what i would have thought  come into the meet   and that   s an interest point   i   m not sure i   m readi to believ it  but it   s worth think about
in view of the clock  i will agre with your recommend without further editori comment
i support both part of the recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
that   s it
i think that   it   would you  mr  secretari  read an appropri direct
the bluebook page i   ll be read from  sn   t have a number  but if it did  it would be page       laughter      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output  to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent      and for the press statement     against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are balanc with respect to prospect for both goal in the forese futur

if there are no comment  i   d like to turn the floor over to governor   who will continu our discuss on disclosur polici
thank you veri much   at our last meet we had a brief and not fulli conclus discuss on the question of disclos dissent   the issu on the tabl was not onli a transpar issu  but perhap more import it involv legal consider   from  the standpoint of legal advic it appear that it might be appropri to disclos dissent earlier than we have histor   sinc we discuss this last  e we   ve gotten further advic in a memo from kieran fallon and   mat  which was sent to you   also you receiv anoth memo from me regard a discuss among a small number of us on how to respond to both the legal issu and the philosoph issu about transpar   sinc i   ve sent you a memo about that  i   ll tri to be brief  the group of us who look at this  which includ michael    bob parri  bill pool  ned    and myself  reach a coupl of conclus   first  we propos that the committe make one set of chang in it disclosur polici   second  we suggest that a number of other element of our strategi with respect to communic remain unchang  the chang that we propos is the one that is list as item   a in the memo that i sent to you   that is to releas the talli of the vote  the ident of the voter  and the prefer of the dissent and to releas all of that inform as part of the press statement   let me note the  logic for that argument   to be clear  we believ that adopt ani of these option has some risk and some benefit   so there is no option that is without concern   we thought that the option of put into the press statement the talli of the vote  includ the name and the prefer of ani dissent  would get us into a posit where we are no longer toler the element of legal risk that we face current   that risk is that we   re wait for someon to ask a question  in which case we would have to disclos the vote and perhap be embarrass that we  hadn   t disclos it earlier   at the same  e  we view this as a moder or middl step as oppos to some of the other thing we might have done  such as tri to creat mini minut or to releas the full minut at a point that  while not contemporan  would be closer to the meet   we are  if you will  feel our way here  sinc we have no easi option of return to our previous practic onc we take a decis   so i think our littl group thought that the so call   a option that i just outlin would be the best  recogn that there are some risk to it  now  we also felt that a number of thing should not chang   we thought that we should not chang the concept of a blackout period both befor the meet  which was not on the tabl  but also after the meet   we favor maintain the blackout for the rest of the week after the  fomc meet  which is through friday   we thought it was also import that dure the intermeet period we not disclos the content of the meet   as we current do not disclos them   and wait for the minut to come out   the third element of no chang is that we would hold the releas of the minut until after the subsequ meet   that recommend was driven by a number of concern  some have to do with the mechan of tri to get the minut done   other relat to concern about the fact that there is a great varieti of inform in the minut  some of which may continu to be relev and some of which may not be relev   anoth factor  obvious  was the sens that onc we   ve made a decis to go ahead with someth  we can   t go back  there is one other thing that would not be chang   obvious dure the cours of each intermeet interv  after the blackout period and befor the subsequ blackout period there   s a  e when we all give speech and have discuss  etcetera   we would at that point be free to discuss the economi or to discuss an outlook but we would still be expect to tri to avoid go over the line of disclos ani actual content of or convers that occur at one of these meet  so that   s where this group came out  and i hope all of you have had a chanc to read the memo   at this stage i   d like to open the discuss up for ani comment  first from the other member of the group   presid parri  pool  and    and governor     to make sure i have summar our agreement   then i would turn to other on the committe who may have question or may just want to state a point of view or prefer   shall we start with governor
well  i would make just one point   the group was in agreement and roger summar the issu well   but there was a question of whether the dissent would actual be put in the press releas or would mere be avail to those in the press who happen to ask our public affair staff for that inform   i think our committe felt it was fairer to everybodi  and particular to those who do not inquir  just to put everyth right in the announc and also to modifi the way we announc the discount rate vote as well
i think we came out at the right place in term of the announc and how it would be done   the onli issu that i thought might at some point be worth more discuss is when the blackout should end   there   s a certain logic to have it end at the close of the day on thursday   have it termin at the end of friday mean in effect that it realli end monday morn   it   s no big deal   some  it   s great to have an excus not to accept a speech assign   but i think there is a logic to have it end on thursday after the releas of the minut
roger   s summari was excel   i would just add that we had a veri thorough discuss of all of the option  and i think it was a consensus that this was the best rout to go
i think that   s true   presid pool
yes  i think we were all in agreement that if we could sustain the current procedur indefinit  that would be great   it work fine   but it   s not up to us to make that decis   we are face with a legal opinion here   and our small group was in agreement that it would be veri unfortun if this issu were forc upon us by someon els put a foia request to us   so to us  announc the vote talli is almost a    no brainer      we need to get out in front and do this in the most satisfactori way   stay with the current practic is just not an option
okay  let   s open the discuss now   i have jerri jordan next on my list
i would have prefer   b as my first option becaus it involv the least chang and bring the least attent to the fact of a dissent   but i can live with   a  and mayb the realiti is that that would be forc on us eventu   howev  i   m not realli concern about the peopl who are not in the press room at the  e we releas our statement
cathi   is next on my list
well  i   m go to tilt at windmil here   i recogn that it   s tilt at windmil  but i do want to be on the record with my concern about this  i have been in a lot of discuss about foia item   this is an unusu one   usual the question is about whether or not inform must be releas or should be releas   this is a debat about inform we alreadi releas on a routin basi   so the debat is realli around concept of reason and prompt when appli to the  e of the inform releas   i think   and his colleagu have done a nice job of explain to us how in the context of foia law    reason and prompt    can onli be defin as relat short period of  e   i also see the relev of exist procedur with regard to the discount rate and other non exempt matter   but he also note that some delay in releas the inform might be allow if an earlier releas were shown to have advers effect on the accomplish of the committe   s object   and here   s where i have question and concern  clear  we cannot  should not  and do not refus to disclos the vote   we alreadi make it avail   but we  like all other central bank that vote and disclos the vote  make that inform avail after the passag of some  e   whi   well  to borrow tom melzer   s word when this was discuss in earli       it was perhap so as not to focus attent on the minor view rather than the consensus view of the committe   we   re a consensu committe  to use alan blinder   s term   we releas a vote that reflect the best sens of the committe as a unit at the  e   that is our object at least in part   to encourag the media and market to spend  e on the dissent is to take away from that object  at least in my view      s note argu that not disclos the vote may serv to depriv market of inform that is use about futur polici   i think the realiti is that that   s not alway the case  the polici decis at the next open market committe meet are not direct by the dissent at the previous meet   event occur   thing chang   some  relat fast   and peopl   s perspect chang as well   in fact  i think there   s at least a chanc that releas the vote will serv to harden peopl   s opinion in way that frustrat the oper of the committe   if we make this chang  sever thing could happen   member could becom increas unwil to dissent  dread the media onslaught   and in that regard  i question whether it is feasibl to constrain member from speak about dissent  even for as short a period of  e as about a week   the second thing that could happen  on the opposit side  is that member could find the spotlight and this extra bit of attent to their like   they might  welcom the focus on the minor  which could creat real schism in the committe   of cours  i   m not talk about present member    laughter  in sum  if we believ that our current disclosur polici serv to meet the object of this committe and if we make inform avail in a  e frame that again meet our object   as do other central bank that disclos as much as we do   i don   t see whi we shouldn   t be will to stand up for those polici   if we get a foia request and are requir to defend our current practic  i think we should do so   in fact  i don   t see how we get out of this bind when the next step in this process is legisl  as has been propos in the past  on the desir of televis our procedur   i don   t know how we get off this slipperi slope if we go down it this far   how do we justifi not bring the televis camera in here   i don   t see what it is that we   re go to be talk about  with the possibl except of a limit amount of confidenti materi  that would be so high confidenti   i   m not sure that anybodi read the transcript of our meet five year after the fact would be convinc that what we talk about at the meet here is all that confidenti   how far are we down the slipperi slope to the televis camera   that   s my tilt at windmil
i see where this propos come from  and i understand it   i have a bit of sympathi for what cathi was say in the sens that releas the minut earlier and delay the disclosur of the vote until those minut are releas made a lot of sens to me   that   s becaus i still believ that put the dissent in context help   i know your committe discuss that option  i read the memo   i don   t know how the lawyer would interpret it if we got into an argument  but i think a case can be made for delay the releas of the vote until the minut are avail   and the delay we   ve talk about is onli two week  which is not an unreason period   but have said that  i think we are in a bind as far as releas the vote at some point   so if we don   t want to releas the minut sooner  i don   t think we have ani choic but to releas the vote after the meet
well  i think both cathi and tom have made good point   these disclosur issu are alway difficult  but it   s general help for me to tri to get back to basic and fundament when i think about these issu   the way i see our action affect the economi  both short run and long run  is basic through the combin effect of what we do on the fund rate  what we say in the statement  the tilt  and all the other inform we releas as it relat to expect and the yield curv   against that background  i think greater transpar is better than less transpar   and that includ earlier releas of inform in most case   so i   m veri much in favor of where you came out   i recogn cathi   s point about the slipperi slope   i see that that has merit   but i think there is some point where the slope is go to flatten out befor we get to the tv camera stage in our room here   mayb i   m too op ist  but that   s the way i feel about it  even if we go with the recommend you   ve made with respect to an immedi announc of the vote  i still think it would be a good idea   in fact this probabl give us more reason   to bring the releas of the minut forward  as soon as possibl   it might involv some addit expens   but in the context of all the other fund we spend on monetari polici and the privat sector spend tri to figur out what we   re tri to do  it   s probabl rather minor   so i would hope that we would think about move in that direct
okay   presid guynn
i   m comfort with where you came out   with  e to think about it  it  sn   t seem terribl threaten to have the vote releas   it   s far better than ani of the altern  which all seem to creat anoth polici event of some kind   in my view  the last thing we need is anoth interim statement or announc regard our polici decis   i share presid broaddus   s thought that if we could releas the minut earlier  even if it   s a week earlier  that might be desir   so that   s someth that i think we still ought to consid and get back to   but i   m comfort with where you came out
okay  thank   governor bie
i support the recommend  includ the fact that i think the vote should be in the announc as oppos to just avail separ   we get electron inform nowaday  and it   s easier for everybodi to see it at the same  e and in the same document
okay   i have nobodi els who has ask to speak   i assum that mean that everyon els is   i m sorri  presid  n
well  i can be veri brief   i agre with the comment that al and jack made   and as far as the tv camera is concern  i suspect the rate would be disappoint  to say the least    laughter
oh  i don   t know  it depend on our star perform here   are there ani other comment   no one els came to my attent
i agre with your recommend
okay  thank you   i think what this mean is that while there are still  some concern   and no one will soft pedal them or ignor them   we feel almost oblig to go down this path   the second question on the tabl is that we have the opportun to implement this plan today   today may actual be a perfect  e becaus there were no dissent and  as someon said  it was probabl one of our easiest decis   so we actual have prepar the same kind of press statement we had but with the ad inform about the talli of the vote  think that perhap this would be the way to go
oh  mayor daley would have love you   guid democraci
i would call your attent to the last paragraph
is that the way it will be done for the discount rate  roger
yes  we   re go to chang that  as ned mention   we will conform the discount rate approach to this one   current the way the press announc of a discount rate chang work is that a well inform member of the press will ask the question about the vote and the public affair staff will give the answer   so we think we realli should conform the board   s practic on discount rate vote to this approach for reason that governor bie and other have note
what if there   s a dissent in this vote    laughter
as cathi has alreadi indic  we   re a matur committe  and we will not let these decis influenc our vote on polici   besid  the vote on the polici decis has alreadi been taken   are there ani question or comment   hear no object  we will proceed down this path   obvious  for this meet after    vote for    the name of all of the member will be list  and after    vote against    this  e will be the word    none
let   s just say unanim
all right   we   ll say unanim   that   s what we   re go to do  okay   thank you veri much   and thank for your effort on this one
offici we have to confirm the date of the next meet  which is tuesday  may     let   s proceed to luncheon or supper or whatev you want to call it
mr  chairman  i   ve ask peopl to submit suggest for discuss topic at the june meet   i   ve gotten return from about half the reserv bank presid and board member   i   ll take ani suggest through the end of this week if the rest of you want to submit someth or if ani of you want to amend your previous submiss  end of meet
