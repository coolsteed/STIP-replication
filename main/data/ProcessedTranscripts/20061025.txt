thank you   dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the chart that were distribut  and i will divid my comment into two part   first  a slim down report on market develop in the intermeet period  and then i   ll touch on the    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     highlight of the memo i circul last week regard manag of  the system open market account   the short intermeet period was relat calm   henc  volatil remain low and credit spread tight  while some equiti index rose to multiyear high  occasion rumor that a larg hedg fund lost signific amount of money bet that yield would rise did not dent the under sens of confid or relat tranquil   on the first page of the handout  the top panel graph the three month deposit rate and the same rate three  nine  and fifteen month forward   the longer date forward   as reflect by the solid red line   have declin more than    basi point from earli summer to earli octob as market particip price in an eas of polici for earli        those expect were heighten as gdp forecast for the third quarter were consist trim downward   but have push forward rate too far  market particip were poor posit for the revers in past few week after a surpris philadelphia fed survey and comment by governor kohn and other committe member were interpret as suggest that polici would not like be eas on the trajectori that market had built in  longer date forward rate still anticip an eas late next year  but the magnitud of that eas has been scale back   longer term treasuri yield show a similar pattern  as indic in the middl panel   the yield curv remain invert  though less than it was a month ago   with credit spread remain tight and credit qualiti favor  there has been less agit in market that the invert curv is send a recessionari signal   meanwhil  breakeven inflat rate from tip paint a favor pictur  especi at short matur given the fall in energi price   as shown in the bottom panel  the five year breakeven continu to narrow  to about      percent  and has now contract more than    basi point in less than three month   longer term matur  which are less affect by short run energi price move  had less of a declin  as shown by the ten year matur   meanwhil the five year rate five year forward   the red line   is littl chang from the last fomc meet   the prospect that polici rate may have peak plus fall oil price support equiti price and trump advers factor such as evid that econom growth had slow   as shown in the top left panel on page    the dow jone industri averag final pierc the        level to a new record high   other major index  such as the s p     and the nasdaq   as shown in the top right panel   also rose  though they remain some distanc from their record high   one featur of the equiti market sinc the tighten cycl began has been the outperform of so call valu stock  as shown in the middl left panel  when econom growth is strong  valu stock   repres by the larger cyclic compani   tend to do better becaus their earn are s ul by the strong economi   but sinc earli august  coincid with the paus in polici tighten  the growth stock have begun to outperform   one interpret is that  with econom growth slow  the effect is biggest on cyclic compani  whose margin compress  wherea growth stock are better abl to maintain margin   anoth interpret is that the equiti market are also price in a peak in the tighten cycl on the theori that the committe will not tighten into a slow economi   final  this general benign pictur is also reflect in the foreign exchang market   the bottom panel graph the dollar against a rang of currenc sinc the last fomc meet   none of these currenc move more than   percent in either direct  and most are clu  within a band of   percent   for what it   s worth  the currenc that appreci tend to be higher yield currenc   this pattern tend to support anecdot report that  in the absenc of direct opportun  carri trade continu to attract specul flow   switch gear somewhat  i want to summar the main point of the memo that i sent to the committe last week about the domest portfolio guidelin   the last  e that we systemat look at the portfolio was in        we look at it again in      and      in the context of consid altern asset given that the treasuri market was shrink and the committe was face with the prospect of acquir privat sector asset   the tabl on the right side of page   provid a recent snapshot of the system open market account   given the amount of  e that has elaps and the chang environ  we thought it would be  e to refresh our analysi and assess whether the principl we had been use to manag the soma portfolio still made sens   inde  we conclud that the four principl identifi previous   safeti  liquid  market neutral  and return   remain appropri given the object for soma   safeti is the bedrock of a central bank balanc sheet  and it import is uncontroversi   the committe has achiev the goal embed in this principl by maintain a portfolio of treasuri secur with no credit risk   for year soma also held smaller amount of agenc and gse  govern sponsor enterpris  secur  but these were allow to roll off   the last gse secur in soma matur in        somewhat more complic is liquid   the committe has discuss liquid at various  e in the past two decad   in practic term  the issu is how fast the desk can offset a reserv ad event  such as a larg discount window loan or a larg foreign exchang intervent   our view is that the critic period for such oper is the short run   longer term  il will like be slow and can be manag in the normal cours of reserv manag oper   as the memo describ   so i will not go into detail   our conclus is that it is prudent to add a second limit or guidelin of     billion of liquid asset over a three month period while keep the current      billion limit over a twelv month period   in practic  as shown in the bottom chart on page    soma maintain liquid from matur bill  coupon  and repo far beyond these minimum   a featur we will continu  addit  the desk has other tool if need in extremi  as shown on the left side  these includ the abil to conduct revers repo and  as a last resort  outright sale   the third principl is market neutral  if you would turn to the next page   this is also somewhat complic   this issu is  in mani way  simpler now than it was six year ago  when the stock of treasuri was declin   at that  e  we adopt a per issu limit structur  which is summar in the top right panel of page     in short  per issu limit of    percent were adopt for bill  which gradual declin to    percent for bond   the blue bar repres soma   s hold for each specif secur   this respons was reason given the environ in        howev  the limit structur has  in recent year  creat situat in which we have had forc redempt to stay within these limit  which in turn forc us to make addit outright purchas to offset those matur asset   we are therefor propos to revert to an inform flat limit structur of    percent for all matur   i should note that this chang would  in realiti  have a veri limit effect on the portfolio given other restrict that we have  and which i   ll get to later   at the margin it might allow us to reduc our huge relianc on hold at the short end of the curv   we are somewhat underrepres in the middl of the curv   an associ issu i want to rais is soma   s auction particip   our particip can be high variabl   there are two factor that we cannot control  first  the treasuri   s auction calendar is itself variabl and depend on fiscal need  second  the desk cannot particip in auction unless it has secur matur that veri day   the middl right panel show this variabl   the yellow box highlight soma   s anticip particip for the three year note in the next three refund  we anticip take down      billion in novemb       billion in februari  and then      billion in may   whi is  this import given that we are an add on in the auction   the fed   s hold are part of the float suppli  which can influenc the way an issu trade in the repo market   this can  i hope  be seen in the bottom panel  our particip in the five year note went from quarter particip to month when the treasuri shift from a mid month settlement to a month end settlement  soma   s particip is the   bar   the chang allow us to smooth out our particip becaus we had larg amount of two year note matur at month end  the black line repres the special spread in the repo market for each issu  note that this spread has been much smaller in recent month  when soma   s hold have been both steadi and avail to be lent   our prefer for steadi and consist auction particip is  howev  constrain by restrict on how we invest matur proceed and  of cours  by chang the treasuri make to the auction calendar   in short  we are like to continu to wrestl with this principl for some  e   the last principl veri briefli is return   in our view  this principl should not drive the way soma is manag  given that our profit are deriv from interest on our treasuri hold and in turn flow back to the treasuri   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper dure this period  and i will need a vote to approv domest oper   helen and i would be happi to answer ani question
are there question   i see none   do i have a motion
the motion is pass without object   thank you veri much   we   ll turn now to the econom situat   dave
thank you  mr  chairman   about a week ago  as we were close the forecast  i was marvel at how littl it had chang over the intermeet period   both the broad stroke and the detail   but the warm glow of accomplish had bare been kindl when a glanc at my desk calendar reveal the sourc of our success   the last fomc meet had been onli five week ago  so we simpli had not had  e to accumul our usual backlog of forecast error   laughter   i recogn that even this assert is open to some challeng   becaus of the incom data  we have revis down our es  of third quarter growth of real gdp about   percentag point  to an annual pace of just   percent   howev  we don   t think this downward revis carri with it much  if ani  macroeconom signal about greater weak go forward   import  consumpt  hous  and busi fix invest all came in veri close to our septemb forecast   the downsid surpris that we experienc last quarter were concentr in motor vehicl product  defens spend  and net export   in each case  we believ some good reason exist for anticip that these sourc of restraint will abat or revers in the fourth quarter   with regard to motor vehicl  the product cut need to deal with the inventori overhang that develop last spring have been larger and have come more quick than we had expect   as a consequ  the drop in motor vehicl output took a bigger bite out of growth in the third quarter and is now expect to be a rough neutral factor for growth in the current quarter  rather than be a small drag on growth in both quarter   defens spend also fell far short of our expect last quarter  but we expect these outlay to rebound in the fourth quarter to a level more in line with defens appropri   final  import are es  to have surg in the third quarter more than seem warrant by the fundament and  as best we can tell  without a full offset in other compon of spend     and her team expect some of that import surpris to be unwound in the fourth quarter  provid a small plus to es  growth   all told  we are project the growth of real gdp to rebound to a pace of    percent in the fourth quarter   for the second half  output is anticip to grow at an annual rate of     percent  a forecast not much differ from the one in septemb   we also have made onli minor adjust to our longer term gdp forecast   by our assess  lower oil price and a stronger stock market more than offset the effect of a slight higher dollar and a bit weaker trajectori for hous price   all told  we revis up our forecast for the growth of real gdp     percent in both      and       to     and     percent respect   basic  the general contour of the forecast is the same as in septemb   as befor  the veri subdu pace of the expans that is project for the second half of this year result princip from a sharp contract in residenti invest that direct subtract more than    percentag point from the growth of real gdp   residenti invest continu to contract next year  though that contract gradual diminish   in addit  the drag on spend and activ from the run up in energi price that has occur  on net  over the past three year is expect to lessen consider from this year to the next  the attenu of the drag from hous and energi alon would result in a prompter return of growth to potenti   howev  we expect the hous slump to restrain the growth of real output this year and next through wealth effect and multipli acceler influenc   most notabl  hous price are project to about flatten out  and as the impetus from past hous appreci wane  consumpt growth should slow  and the save rate should begin to edg up   with it usual lag  the overal deceler in output  incom  and sale further damp consumpt and busi invest   as a consequ  growth remain slight below potenti in       and the output gap edg up to rough    percent of gdp by the end of the year   with the bulk of the direct and indirect effect of the hous slump expect to have larg play out by then  real gdp growth is expect to expand in line with it potenti in        meanwhil  core pce price inflat  which is current run a bit less than     percent  edg down to about   percent in        the open up of a small output gap help to head off an intensif of inflat pressur   but by far the most potent influenc are the diminish upward pressur from price for energi  non energi import  and other commod   becaus this basic stori is virtual unchang from the septemb  book and becaus we had relat few surpris to deal with in the forecast  i thought that i would dispens with a further explic of the contour of the forecast   instead  i=ll offer you a scorecard of sort to help you audit the plausibl of the forecast stori in light of data that we will be receiv in come month   let me start with hous  becaus as i note a moment ago  the recent and project contract in residenti invest is the princip sourc of the below trend growth that we are project over the next year   for that stori to be on track  hous start will need to drop sharpli further by the end of the year  singl famili start averag about     million unit in the third quarter  and in our forecast  we are anticip a further    percent declin  to a pace of    million unit this quarter   we read the incom data as be consist with that outlook  although start bounc up in septemb  permit   a less noisi indic of hous activ   continu to plung   moreov  inventori of unsold home remain at a veri high level  and sale cancel have continu to increas   but after a long period of what seem to be unrel bad news  the hous data receiv over the intermeet period could be fair character as more mix   sale of new and exist home firm a bit in late summer  the index of pend home sale move up in august  and homebuy attitud as measur in the michigan survey jump up in septemb and octob   although it is far too earli to conclud that these indic are point to stabil in hous market  they provid at least some encourag to the view that the bottom may now be closer than the top   we will also be scrutin the inform on hous price   anoth read on the ofheo  offic of feder hous enterpris oversight  price index will becom avail in earli decemb befor the next meet   here we will be look for anoth notic step down in the rate of hous price appreci  from the   percent pace post in the second quarter to a project    percent pace in the third   that forecast is rough consist with our near term forecast model that make use of the inform in the case shiller price index and other high frequenc measur of home price   as you know  we are not forecast the nation averag of hous price to drop  but our veri low project rate of hous price appreci impli that a substanti fraction of household will be experienc outright declin   consumpt will be the second major area that should be monitor  in part becaus we are expect the slow in hous price to show through here   in brief  we will be look for a continu in come month of the moder increas in consum spend that we have observ sinc the spring   over the past half year  consum spend exclud motor vehicl has been increas at a pace of rough    to   percent  and we are expect more of the same in come month   that relat steadi expect growth reflect some crosscurr that seem like to be at work   real incom gain should be bol  by the recent fall in energi price and continu  albeit modest  gain in employ   but the lag effect of higher borrow cost and an eb of posit wealth effect from hous are expect to hold spend below the gain in incom and result in a slight upward tilt to the save rate   obvious  given the import of consumpt in overal aggreg demand  develop here will have a critic bear on the probabl of achiev our project soft land   a snap back in consum spend in come month   an outcom that seem to underli some of the outsid forecast that are stronger than our   might lead to no land rather than a soft land   in contrast  ani serious falter of consum spend is    buckl the seat belt and assum the crash posit      the third major develop that we will be look for is anoth sustain step down in the pace of employ growth   slower employ growth is a key link in the multipli mechan through which the hous induc slowdown in aggreg output and spend propag forward into below trend growth next year   we correct anticip the first leg of that slow earlier this year  when averag gain in nonfarm payrol drop from the         per month pace of the preced sever year to the rough         per month pace observ sinc the spring   but our project anticip a further slow in the fourth quarter to an averag pace of about        per month   to be sure  the increas in septemb was just         but that came on the heel of a gain in august of          so we wouldn   t want to lean too heavili on the septemb observ for support   moreov  if ask to present just one piec of evid that cast the greatest doubt on the staff project at present  i would point to initi claim for unemploy insur   claim have basic been move sideway in recent month and provid no indic that a further soften in labor market is under way   given the loos of the relationship  our forecast of payrol employ is not inconsist with the current level of initi claim  but right now this import piec of our forecast seem to have more upsid risk than downsid risk   the fourth element of our forecast that we will be look for in come month is some sign of slow in busi fix invest   of cours  the acceler consequ for equip spend of the slow we now think is under way in aggreg demand is realli a stori for       and given the volatil in the data  it will take some  e to detect that slow when  or if  it occur   but more immedi  we are expect to see some slow in nonresidenti construct from the    percent pace that we   ve experienc over the past half year to someth closer to a    percent pace in come quarter  thus provid less offset to the weak in residenti construct than has been the case thus far this year   with energi price level out  the upward impetus from drill and mine activ seem like to gradual abat   outsid drill and mine  smaller employ gain  slower growth of manufactur output  and still high vacanc rate suggest to us that this sector will cool somewhat go forward   the final item on the scorecard is inflat   we are go to be look for core pce price to continu to increas an averag of about     percent per month for the remaind of the year  with core cpi run between     and     percent per month  those increas would be higher than in most recent year but lower than the pace observ last spring   moreov  some of the key factor that underli our project of a gradual slow of core inflat over the project period now seem to be fall into place   after near three year of persist upsid surpris  oil and other energi price have drop notic from the level of late summer   if these recent develop hold  the cost pressur from rise energi price should eas over  e   moreov  the sharp increas in residenti rent that occur in the spring appear to have simmer down of late  and we are expect that pattern to continu in come month   meanwhil  most of the major measur of inflat expect that we monitor have continu to fluctuat in a reason narrow rang  and we expect that to remain the case go forward   i am tempt to say that  arm with this scorecard  you will arriv at the decemb meet with a clear idea of how the staff forecast has stood up to the incom data   but of cours  we all know how the stori goe   much like the cliffhang serial movi of the     s  the promis appear to be that  if you come back next  e  all the current problem will be resolv   howev  given ration expect  you know that  to the extent ani problem are resolv over the intermeet period  they will simpli be replac by a new set of puzzl and peril    will continu our present
onc again i find myself report to you that movement in global oil price are among the develop dure the intermeet period that were factor in our deliber about the extern sector   global crude oil spot and futur price fell further follow our septemb project but by differ amount over the matur spectrum   when we final the current baselin forecast  spot price and veri near term futur price had move down more than    per barrel  futur contract that matur at the end of      had record price declin of about     those matur at the end of      had price declin of about    cent  inde  for contract matur beyond       price actual rose such that the far date contract for decemb      had move up about    per barrel in price   we adjust our project for u s  oil import price by amount similar to these chang in futur price   the differenti movement in price impli that  even though price have move down all along the path through the forecast period  this path now slope up more steepli than it previous did   so our outlook is for oil price to rise rather sharpli over the forecast period  although from a lower start point than in the septemb  book   the reason for the addit declin in price dure septemb and octob includ the return of product to near previous rate at prudho bay  the absenc of ani sign of late season hurrican in the gulf of mexico  and awar of current high inventori level   these inventori are by their veri natur transitori  henc  market particip seem to believ that some of the current abund suppli will diminish over  e  leav limit spare product capac and chronic risk to product in nigeria  iran  iraq  and elsewher   late last week  opec announc product cut of     million barrel per day as of novemb    although the size of actual cut by individu opec supplier remain to be seen  we judg that signific cut  albeit not as larg as those announc  are need for prospect demand to be consist with price in the futur curv   those price remain elev   around the level expect at the start of this year   we again ask ourselv how the substanti drop in oil price sinc their august peak matter for the u s  economi   as dave mention  some of the near term varianc in u s  real gdp growth reflect the path of real import  includ oil import   the nomin trade deficit is clear narrow as a consequ of lower oil price   we expect that the averag oil bill in the fourth quarter will show an improv from the third quarter of     billion at an annual rate   the net trade balanc on nomin good and servic will improv by just about the same amount as other trade compon experi small  offset chang   as oil price rise go forward  the nomin valu of oil import should move back up  but for      as a whole  we expect that the total figur will be about the same as the total for this year  follow by a moder increas in        with respect to our forecast for export  we again expect that real export of good and servic will expand at an annual rate of about     percent through earli      and then will acceler slight  to about   percent  over the second half of        we see this pace of export growth as reflect moder strong growth of trade in both servic and merchandis   these compon in turn reflect solid averag growth of around    percent in foreign real gdp   the project acceler in real export in      reflect a boost from relat price as u s  export price inflat moder   this project pace of export growth is somewhat below that observ in recent year  particular in the first half of this year   to some extent  the doubl digit growth of u s  real export earli this year reflect rapid real gdp growth abroad at that  e   but our model cannot explain all the strong growth  and a sizabl posit residu has emerg in our model   dure the first quarter  except rapid growth of real gdp was widespread abroad as most industri countri and mani emerg market economi in both asia and latin america record particular robust real expans   the rapid growth move mani foreign economi closer to potenti and was not sustain over the long run   we read recent indic of activ abroad as general confirm our expect that slow from those veri rapid rate would occur through the year   accord to the data  among the industri countri  canada and japan have gdp alreadi deceler in the second quarter   in contrast  the pace of expans strengthen in the euro area  but with further tighten of monetari polici and an increas in the valu ad tax in germani to take effect at the start of next year  our outlook call for a slowdown in growth there as well   for the emerg market economi  the most import news is chines third quarter real gdp growth  announc just after the  book was distribut   base on the data and our best es  of a season adjust seri for the level of chines gdp  real growth in china was at an annual rate of about     percent in the third quarter from the second quarter  follow two quarter of growth abov    percent  these data are onli approxim as they are infer from the annual growth rate publish by the chines author   howev  it   seem clear that the measur implement by chines offici to cool the economi have had some effect   we are project that growth go forward will return to rate between   and     percent  of cours  the band of uncertainti around this forecast is signific   we judg growth at that pace to be consist with chines potenti and accept to chines offici   this pictur of real output growth abroad is a benign soft land   we are project slow that   not overshoot in mani foreign economi  includ import the euro area  japan  and china   we believ that domest demand growth in canada  japan  the euro area  and mexico will continu to sustain their domest expans and growth in the global economi and will underli ongo moder strength in u s  export   with respect to the current quarter  trade data for august surpris us with the strength of export and led us to revis up by more than     percentag point our es  of the annual rate of growth of real export in the third quarter   the surpris was widespread across categori of merchandis trade other than comput and semiconductor and includ strong export to most of our trade partner  with the import except of canada and mexico   with no special stori or specif compon of interest  we have project that real export growth will revert to it histor relationship with foreign output and relat price   howev  the posit surpris in august remind us that there is upsid risk to our forecast for real export as well as downsid risk should foreign growth slow more than expect   real merchandis import in august came in abov our expect as well   we have accommod that surpris in part by reduc real import project for the fourth quarter  particular real oil import   all in all  our baselin forecast for the combin contribut of import and export to u s  gdp growth over the forecast period is for a small negat effect dure the second half of this year that becom slight more negat through the second half of       reach about     percentag point as strengthen u s  real gdp growth boost import growth abov that for export     and i will be happi to answer ani question
thank you veri much   are there question   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a question for    and it concern the  book altern scenario and the moral we should draw from them concern the committe   s abil to affect inflat   the  book this  e had two scenario show how the forecast would be affect by shock to aggreg demand   one was a stronger demand scenario  the other a hous correct with spillov   demand  of cours  is much weaker in that second scenario   in both of them  unemploy by the end of      deviat mark from baselin  but even so there is virtual no effect on core inflat   it fall just     percent by the end of      in the negat hous shock scenario  even though unemploy rise to   percent   when i actual took a magnifi glass to the panel on page i    to look at the core inflat path  the shock appear actual to have a pervers effect on core inflat   the hous correct shock has a pervers effect on core inflat in mid       with inflat actual up in the weak demand scenario and down a bit in the case where demand strengthen   now  i scratch my head and ask myself if i could i invent a reason that this might occur   my thought went to possibl repercuss on the exchang rate that might have an inflationari effect   but my trusti staff told me that it might be someth els entir   name  the way inflat expect are model in frb us   they told me that inflat expect in these simul aren   t much affect by ani movement in unemploy with shock like this becaus implicit those form inflat expect take the shock to be transitori   but expect are perturb  and pervers so  by the reaction of the fed to the shock   in other word  the taylor rule type respons that   s embodi in the scenario has the fed lower the fed fund rate to address econom weak follow a downsid hous shock   my staff tell me that the fed   s cut to address the weak then rais expect inflat  which pass through into inflat in these scenario  and that   s whi we get a stronger hous correct pervers rais inflat  would you comment general on this   do i have the correct understand of how it work   if i do  do these simul give an unduli pessimist assess of the effect of aggreg demand shock both on inflat and on our committe   s abil to affect inflat through polici   is it plausibl to assum in your view that easier monetari polici has this direct effect on inflat expect  even when all it   s do is offset a demand shock
i think  actual  your first stori was the more potent one in offset these effect   that we   d have an exchang rate respons to the monetari polici effect  now  there is a small chang in inflat expect in respons to your do someth the market don   t expect you to do given the macroeconom outcom   the market lean in a direct in term of inflat expect  and if they see you eas signific  they   re confus as to whether that might say someth about your inflat object be higher
even when there are negat demand shock and even though unemploy is rise
that is part of it   yes   obvious  the question is whether they see those shock as well
they would see unemploy rise
well  they don   t see that   the unemploy effect do take a while to begin to develop   all these thing happen veri slowli   if someth is pervers here  it is that we   re show too short a  e frame for the effect to actual play out   with an output gap open up  we would obvious expect in this model that eventu there would be downward pressur on inflat in the hous scenario and upward pressur in the stronger demand scenario   so there   s noth unstabl about the model or someth that work in the wrong direct over the longer haul  but as you know  inflat is so inerti in the basic structur of the model that those effect don   t realli show through and  becaus these shock typic are relat slow  they tend to get offset in the near term by exchang rate movement in particular but by some movement in inflat expect as well   so i don   t think that   s necessarili a flaw of the model  but i do think it   s probabl a flaw in the short  e frame that we show for these altern scenario  where most of the interest effect on inflat  if you think it take as long as the model    are typic happen beyond the horizon that we   re show here  that get back to an issu that governor   rais last  e about want to look a littl further down the road to actual see the respons of inflat   now  that  sn   t mean that the model has got it right in term of how persist or inerti inflat is   i think reason men and women could come to differ view about that   but i don   t think there   s someth pervers in the under structur of the model
thank you  mr  chairman   dave  i want to ask you a question about residenti hous market and the effect of this slowdown that we   ve seen on the price of hous   as you mention in your comment  we   ve seen the rate of increas slow   in one of the altern simul  you actual plug in a major reduct in hous price   are you awar of ani empir work that has been done  or have you done ani work to show us what the  e lag would be here that we could expect to see from the drop in hous to some effect on hous price go forward
a littl work has been done in this area  but it   s a bit like model the stock market   you wouldn   t take it veri serious in the sens that these are asset market and they   re some  move in way that are veri difficult to model on the basi of  for exampl  fundament   especi in a period when  by our assess  price have move up signific abov what we think can be justifi in term of interest rate and rent   so now we have a situat in which that asset price misalign is project in our forecast to just bare begin to unwind but we   re realli uncertain about what the  e of that process is go to be  one of the reason we want to show the altern simul is that we   ve taken a fair conserv approach here   our slowdown in the growth rate of hous price  to rough     to    percentag point over the next two year   sn   t make a big dent   if you rememb from the brief that we did one and a half year ago   in the price to rent ratio  which we plot there and show that that had increas veri signific  so our best guess is that  as in the past  those nomin price will flatten out rather than actual declin   but the run up was so larg that we couldn   t rule out this  e around that the adjust of hous price could be more signific and more rapid than in the past   but i don   t know of ani reliabl empir model or evid   we   ve certain done our share of work in model those hous price  and i know our colleagu at the new york fed have as well  there   s a lot of controversi about whether there even is an asset price misalign  much less  if there is  how it will unwind   so i don   t have a lot to offer you there  except that we   re go to tri to present you with the rang of possibl outcom in the sensit of our forecast to the baselin assumpt that we   ve made   in that regard  i still see more downsid risk there than upsid risk to our hous price forecast
thank you   presid
i have just an inform question    and     if my memori is correct  the septemb cpi number exclud food and energi were not substanti differ from those in august   what i   m curious about  if you could just quick comment  are the dynam of owner    equival rent  oer    that was you  dave
as you know  those increas were veri substanti in the spring  we had project them to slow some   they have slow some   whether that is nois in the data or an actual respons to develop on the ground in hous such as   as i think governor bie has mention   the possibl that some of this flow of excess hous may turn back into the rental market  and that could help put a lid on rent   we   re expect a littl further slow go forward   as i note in my remark  i see some upsid risk  so we   re take comfort from the fact that those     and     percent increas that we saw in the spring have now been run more like     and     percent increas   but it   s too soon to conclud that that whole process is over   that it   s all work out and that thing are go to slow down   there   s enough volatil in those rent that we could experi a return to the increas that we saw in the spring   we   re not forecast that  but i don   t think that outcom should be out of your probabl distribut  obvious  our reason for expect some slowdown is that  in fact  there will be some adjust in the hous market and especi that peopl   s expect for price appreci on owner occupi dwell have shift down signific   that downshift is go to make homeownership look less attract and the rental market look stronger   that   s whi we get some slow but not so much as to go back to the rate that we had a year or two ago  when they were increas more like   and     percent
so  in summari  we are look at high three  upward
high three in the near term on rent  go down  we think  to more like three by next year
the most arrest figur  as you point out  is report chines growth in the third quarter   what   that stem from   is it their faux monetari polici or moral suasion or what we call  negoti with the chines     immor suasion      or do you sens that some capac constraint are at work here
well  i don   t know that we have enough detail inform to speak definit to the question of whether some capac constraint were reach   we do see the slowdown occur  import  in the sector of fix invest   that is  the gdp number themselv do not give us real compon inform  but other measur of invest did turn down in the third quarter in a way that   s consist with see gdp slow   the  e of the latest round of administr measur suggest to us that we are see some effect from those  i don   t know that i would call it monetari polici exact  but i think the bundl of moral suasion and  to some degre  real action that  in and of themselv  have some bite contribut to this  after two quarter of what we infer from manipul the number as veri strong growth  is it possibl that in some particular place capac constraint are reach   it certain could have been the case  from our attempt to turn the seri into quarter to quarter chang rather than the data that are announc  we certain had higher number for the first half of this year than were general talk about   the releas number were ten and so forth  and we had twelv  similar  as a consequ we had a much greater slowdown than the releas number  and we could be exagger both   possibl  it wasn   t realli quit as strong as we thought in the first half  and it may not have slow quit as much as we saw in the third quarter   but it would be a real gambl on our part to conclud that it wasn   t  at least in some import sens  due to the administr measur that they took   i don   t think the offici are so unabl to have a consequ with their polici tool  such as they are  if they are realli determin   and they certain seem to be determin   thus i would attribut much of the figur to the administr measur  but we can   t rule out some capac constraint here and there
thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   as you suggest  labor forc particip play an import role go forward in how you think about your forecast of the longer term growth rate and how it evolv   so i have two question about labor forc particip in tri to understand where it come from and what   s go on   one is the distinct between what   s go on cyclic versus what   s go on in your trend demograph of the labor forc particip rate   that distinct is part of it  as is whether the way you es  the cyclic compon of employ and so forth affect the forecast and whether it adjust veri quick or veri slowli in shape the pictur go forward  particular into      and       the second question has to do with the secular declin in general that you   re predict from demograph   is there ani mechan in the way you come up with those forecast that has feedback from the economi   for exampl  through a certain period  labor particip rate for the    year old cohort were fall rapid   from more recent data  that cohort appear to be back in the labor forc more aggress than it was   i   m not exact sure whi that is   mayb it   s uncertainti about pension  social secur  and what have you and whether real wage and adjust in the labor market affect the secular declin   so i   d like a littl discuss about what   s go on in the model that might help me understand where those piec fit
i   ll turn your question around and address the trend aspect first and then discuss a bit how the cycl get overlaid on this   our forecast is base on some research that we   ve been do in the past sever year that was recent present at the brook panel on econom activ   it   s base on a veri detail decomposit of the labor forc by cohort  gender  and age  the downward tilt in our project trend in labor forc particip is driven princip by two factor   one is the end of the larg uptilt in the particip of women in the labor forc   for a long  e  women   s particip had been drive the upward trend  that continu rise offset the downward trend in the men   s particip in the labor forc  which actual has been a long  ongo trend that we expect to continu   now the labor forc particip of the enter cohort of women look a lot like women exit   we   re not get ani further upward press there  but we are see some continu downward press from men   second  the labor forc is age  and it   s age within this forecast frame   in       we   re at the front edg of the babi boomer who are elig at age    to collect social secur payment   bill wascher is here if you want him to add anyth about the detail of his research   but when we run that model  it project a pretti steep trend in labor forc particip  now i will get to your question about all the dynam feedback   i think we would admit that this work   not have all the general equilibrium effect  the potenti way in which employ and employe might respond go forward over the longer haul to the big demograph chang that are at hand   so  ani substanti chang in the incent that employ are provid for older worker to stay in the labor forc longer  if they occur  are realli not built in here in ani signific way   i feel pretti darn comfort with this forecast over the  e frame for which we   re do it  which is through        i think that these demograph factor will  in fact  be felt and that the labor market institut will probabl not adjust quick enough to overwhelm the downward demograph tilt   but if we go out a lot further  we have more think to do about how those adjust might occur and whether the steep downward trend that we are current project would continu   as you are probabl awar  in tri to model labor forc particip  real wage and various other thing that make a lot of sens to economist don   t alway show up strong in those model   so in this forecast we   re let the demograph drive the trend in labor forc particip  on top of the demograph is the cyclic behavior of labor forc particip   we now think the labor forc particip rate is probabl a bit abov it trend   given the cyclic behavior of particip  we think that is not unreason to think that labor forc particip has probabl alreadi overshot it trend   admit  just a bit   when the unemploy rate is below the nairu   so the employ dynam and the labor forc dynam that we have go forward are driven both by the labor forc particip rate return to it trend and that trend continu to declin   as we discuss at the last meet  those thing togeth produc a veri small increas in overal employ growth   also  as i think we mention last  e  we recogn that we   re out of the consensus on this piec of the forecast   again  i haven   t seen anyth over the past year or two to make me more uncomfort   if anyth  i   ve becom more comfort with that view  given the behavior of the labor forc particip rate and the unemploy rate in this period as labor market have tighten up  as i said last  e  howev  if we chang this aspect of our forecast go forward and went back to a forecast of just a flat labor forc particip rate  we   d obvious rais employ growth and the growth of potenti output   but we   d also rais the growth of project actual output  and thus this chang wouldn   t affect our forecast of the output gap much at all go forward   so this has a big effect on the top line gdp but not on the gdp gap   thus if we make a mistak here  it will not have signific polici consequ becaus with demand and suppli revis up by similar amount  you don   t have to have a higher interest rate to choke off that demand
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you   dave  i have a question on the less persist inflat scenario   the descript indic that the scenario allow for inflat to be less persist in the baselin perhap for structur reason   could you give me a coupl of exampl of how the structur might chang and what the data might tell us or what data would be tell us that such a chang is occur
clear  if you have manag to achiev a signific degre of credibl and that credibl has anchor inflat expect at a rate of     percent go forward and if  therefor  agent expect whatev inflat shock you   ve had to be temporari and for inflat to revert to it averag over the past ten year relat quick  then inflat could quick fall back to     percent as suggest by the scenario   we would be look for evid that the level of inflat expect had remain exact where it was previous and had remain unchang  at a rang of rough     to    percent   now  we don   t think that   s the case  so that scenario   not underli our baselin forecast   in fact  we think inflat expect are probabl higher than that  more like the   percent level that i think implicit under this forecast  but work by our colleagu     at the san francisco fed  es  over a veri short  e span    produc an es  that suggest that it might be reason to expect   as a good forecast   that inflat revert reason quick to it recent averag   we   re not persuad by that  but we don   t think it   s entir unreason
ani other question   dave and    thank you  as alway  for a veri good report   we   re readi now for the econom go round   we haven   t made much use of the two hand intervent late  but it   s an option   if you want to make a comment or ask a question  pleas rais two hand instead of one   we   ll start with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the seventh district appear to be quit similar to what i report last  e   except for hous and auto  activ remain on a solid foot  and most of our contact are relat op ist about the outlook   for instanc  the two larg temp firm we talk to regular both report that  although billabl hour were rough flat  their client were upbeat about the outlook   furthermor  demand for worker in light industri   the segment most close tie to the nation busi cycl   continu to grow   in term of wage  both temp firm note that compens increas have been run much higher than last year at this  e   the difficulti of the big three automak continu to be a problem for our region and are show through in the nation number for the third quarter   these difficulti don   t stem from an overal lack of demand   light vehicl sale continu to run at a pretti healthi pace  as the  book note   to some extent  the big three   s difficulti are a consequ of the energi price shock   demand has shift away from pickup and big suv  which have been their bread and butter   despit the recent gas price declin  ford and gm told us that they do not expect a revers of this shift any  soon  otherwis  the district is do reason well   i heard a lot of op    inde  a few contact explicit describ the current slowdown as similar to the brief paus in the mid     s  which was follow by sustain expans  turn to the nation outlook  clear econom activ was soft dure the third quarter  but the fair solid growth in consumpt and busi fix invest indic that at least to date we have not seen a spillov of the weak in hous to other sector of the economi   this is consist with the anecdot that i   m hear   look ahead  we expect sever quarter of weak residenti invest  but activ in other sector should increas rough in line with longer run sustain rate   assum market expect for interest rate  we see gdp growth averag modest below potenti over the next year and a half   we think growth will be a bit abov potenti in         in our view  the under fundament   wealth  incom  interest rate  and the current level of liquid in the economi   should support a higher level of spend than what   s in the  book baselin  of cours  a major risk for our outlook is that there could be more substanti spillov from the hous sector   as has been note around this tabl  it could take some  e for the weak in hous demand to show through to hous price   i was hope we could get more inform  but it sound as though the research isn   t there yet   if price do fall substanti  a reduct in wealth could have serious ramif for consumpt and spend overal   it   s hard to say when we   ll have a clearer pictur as to how event are unfold   at some point  probabl befor the declin in the broad measur of hous price  we   ll like see earli evid in either anecdot or risk spread   or if the risk is overst  we may hear of improv from our contact  turn to inflat  the project from our model have not chang much with the incom data   they still show core pce inflat in       come in between     and     percent  depend on the period use to es  the model   so i continu to have the same question i had last  e regard the interplay between such inflat rate  inflat expect  and fed credibl   will continu high level of core inflat eventu make the public doubt our resolv to maintain low and stabl inflat   even if inflat is less persist  as some have suggest  will it settl out at rate like those in the past few year   name    percent   rather than the     percent in the  book   s less persist inflat scenario   are the current long run core pce inflat expect  which are like abov   percent  just simpli too high  i   m quit concern that the answer to these question might be    yes      if so  and the hous spillov risk fade  then we may have to act more forc than the  book baselin polici assumpt in order to ensur that inflat is more clear head into the rang consist with price stabil
okay  governor kohn
i wonder  presid    if you had a sens of whether ford was in a kind of death spiral   i might be influenc by the headlin of today and ye day   at risk of lose the confid of custom  so it won   t be abl to sell car  and of creditor   i   m wonder whether that would have ani effect on the macroeconomi  or whether we just take down the ford sign  put up toyota sign  and continu to produc
my general assess has been that this is a market share stori   it   s not a stori of aggreg demand for automobil or light vehicl in that it is a shift from the domest  what we use to call the big three  to foreign manufactur  whether they   re produc here in the unit state or export more to the unit state   obvious  we know there has been a big ramp up in transplant here  but the import share of light vehicl is go up  too   so i general think it   s a market share stori and  as you said  there will be a lot of disloc if  god forbid  ford goe out of busi   but i think it would just be a shift  now  in term of whether what   s happen at ford is  as you said  a death spiral  i realli wouldn   t know   a new ceo is come in  and there is the old adag     when a new ceo come in  he   s go to write off as much as he possibl can and get it behind him      so some of that may be occur as well   but the problem with the u s  firm is both the product they have and the percept of that product   i think their product has gotten better   i don   t  person  think it   s as good as the foreign firm    product  but i think the percept of it is much wors than the percept of the foreign firm    product
presid    didn   t you say that you saw output grow below potenti in         did i hear correct
so with energi price down and so forth  whi do you see core inflat rise from near term level
no  i saw it come down   oh  you mean in the outer year   well  i think sever thing are go on   there is still the spillov of energi price increas flow through the economi  but also there are more resourc constraint than are built into the baselin forecast
thank you  mr  chairman   the new england district economi continu to grow at a moder pace  pretti much as it was grow the last  e we met  with job count slowli increas and busi and consum confid relat good about both current and futur condit   as i   ve note befor  incom growth has been robust in the district  with region incom grow better than   percent from second quarter       to second quarter         inde  incom in massachusett and connecticut both rose about   percent  reflect this rise  the fiscal condit of the state in the region  while vari  remain posit  region corpor health is solid  and read of region stock index follow the posit pace of the nation   s financi market   contact from a wide rang of manufactur industri report posit trend  fewer cost pressur from commod  energi  and interest rate  and a continu of competit pressur to restrain cost and keep price stabl   we regard this pressur as a return to busi as usual  on the negat side  the slowdown in the hous sector becom more appar with each pass month   accord to the overal ofheo hous price index  year over year appreci in the second quarter of       for new england was about half of that for the nation  the chang from the first to the second quarter in       was virtual zero   the region now has the lowest rate of annual hous appreci of ani area of the countri except the midwest   this situat is not entir unwelcom  as hous price level in the region remain quit high relat to the nation  and there has been much hand wring local about the effect high hous cost have on attract skill labor to the region   of cours  the cyclic effect of a sharp residenti invest slowdown is of concern   exist home sale volum are down    percent from their      peak   new home construct is weaken signific  and construct employ has declin in both connecticut and massachusett sinc year end        inde  negat commentari from area busi contact revolv most around market for product aim at the residenti hous industri   while there may be some light at the end of this tunnel  with recent lower mortgag interest rate and some sens of bottom out  the usual season slowdown in the real estat industri as winter approach may make this improv difficult to appreci for some  e  the effect of slow residenti invest remain one of the key uncertainti on the nation scene as well   combin with the negat effect of trade  hous trend have caus us to mark down our es  of third quarter gdp growth to about the level of the  book  howev  posit incom data on employ  consum spend  and corpor profit  spur as they have been by favor trend in energi price  financi market  and worldwid growth  support a modest rebound in overal activ in the fourth quarter and a forecast for      and      of just slight less than potenti   inde  i was pleas to see the upward revis to the  book forecast for the fourth quarter of this year  as i had worri whether the earlier trajectori had increas the risk of a spiral downward into a recess   i don   t think that   s like  and i realiz that overal the second half gdp project remain about the same   but the upward revis to the fourth quarter in the  book  which bring it closer to our boston forecast  make me somewhat more comfort about the under trajectori of econom activ  we  like the  book author  have revis down slight our es  of potenti  so our sens of ani gap in resourc usag remain about the same as it was at the last meet  thus  unemploy rise veri slowli  to just about   percent in       and inflat fall slowli as well  along the line of the forecast at the last meet   all in all  that is not a lot of chang   i must admit  howev  to some small amount of hope that we may be see the bottom out of the hous market declin becaus of the mixtur of the data that dave refer to earlier  moreov  other aspect of the current situat seem quit posit as well   in particular  the veri accommod natur of financi market and the continu profit of the nation   s corpor   thus  the risk to what continu to be in mani way a rather benign forecast seem to me to be a bit less on the downsid than they seem at our last meet   energi driven inflat may be lower as well  but i remain concern about the under pressur on resourc util if the economi   not slow as much as we now expect   corpor driven product growth  though we haven   t seen it escal recent  could come to the rescu here  but i think it   s hard to bet on that   thus  i do see some continu uncertainti as to whether inflat will be as well behav as in either the boston or the  book forecast
thank you  mr  chairman   our region econom stori is similar to that of the nation economi   region activ has slow in the third quarter  main becaus of the hous sector   in general  our busi contact expect the region economi to continu to expand  albeit at a modest pace   price pressur remain elev in the third district but have not strengthen over the intermeet period  turn to the individu sector  manufactur activ in our region has soften over the past two month   the index of general econom activ in our busi outlook survey  which turn slight negat last month  remain slight negat this month  indic basic not much chang sinc septemb   howev  there were some posit in the octob survey that were not in the septemb report   in particular  there was a rebound in the index of new order and shipment  suggest slight posit growth in our respond    firm   also  manufactur execut were much more op ist this month about futur activ  with most indic rebound from their septemb low read   this op  is consist with presid     s comment about the op  of some execut that he has observ  now  consist with the slowdown in activ  payrol employ growth in our three state slow in the third quarter to an annual rate of about     percent  compar with     percent in the nation   the unemploy rate  which had been run under the nation rate for the past three year  has now move up to that rate   still  our busi contact as well as respond to our manufactur survey continu to cite difficulti in find qualifi worker as one of their major busi concern  as in the nation  the hous sector in our region continu to declin   we   ve seen some slow in the valu of nonresidenti contract as well over the past three month   but these data are quit noisi  and i think it   s too earli to read much of a turn point into the nonresidenti construct sector for our region at this point   offic vacanc rate continu to edg down  and the net absorpt of offic space continu to be posit  consum spend continu to hold up well in our region   we saw a pickup in retail sale in septemb  except for auto   area retail told us that their sale had increas in recent week  and their back to school sale exceed their expect   their view is that continu growth at that pace depend on consum confid  which for the mid atlant region increas in septemb  no doubt becaus of the declin in oil price  the fed   s current econom activ index indic a slow in activ in our region over the past three month  especi in new jersey  which has shown the sharpest deceler  as of august  year to date averag growth in these index  weight by gross state product  for our three state has been about     percent  compar with   percent for the unit state   over the past three month  region growth has slow to about     percent   the lead indic for our three state also have move down this year  suggest onli modest growth over the come six to nine month  on the inflat front  consum price in the philadelphia region continu to rise at a pace fa  than that of the nation   the fa  pace is due main to the larger increas in shelter price in the philadelphia metro area compar with those in the unit state   on a more posit note  while area manufactur continu to report higher product cost  these cost increas have been less widespread in recent survey than earlier in the year   the index of price paid in our manufactur survey has declin for the past three month  and the index of price receiv was down signific in octob   so while the level of these index remain high  indic continu inflationari pressur  some solac may be found in the less elev level of these indic  at least in recent month  for the nation economi  my outlook is not much differ from what it was at the last meet   real gdp growth in the second quarter was revis down to     percent  as has been note  and the data receiv to date suggest that growth in the third quarter was even weaker  perhap   to     percent   i expect some rebound in the fourth quarter and  like presid    was pleas to see the upward revis in the fourth quarter forecast in the  book  the main sourc of the slowdown  of cours  is the fall in the demand for hous  manufactur also soften in the third quarter compar with it robust pace earlier in the year  about half of that slowdown was due to auto  and i expect some rebound there  too  in the fourth quarter   trade subtract from growth in the third quarter relat to the second quarter  but again  as has been point out  i expect that to be less of a drag in the fourth quarter than it was in the third  so asid from hous  most other sector of the economi  includ consum spend and busi invest  are hold up  even in the philadelphia region in the third district  they aren   t grow as rapid as they were in the first part of this year  but they are grow somewhat below trend  and they continu to expand   if the slowdown in hous continu to be an order one  without larg spillov as has been frequent mention  i would not character that correct as unwelcom   hous activ has been at an unsustain high pace in recent year   of cours  at this point we cannot rule out the possibl that the correct in hous from the unsustain high pace of activ that we   ve seen over the past few year will derail the expans   but so far  we have not seen spillov of hous into other sector  in particular  we have not seen ani retrench by the consum for the most part   the moder we   ve seen in consum spend after the strong first quarter is larg in line with expect   real dispos incom growth remain healthi  and we have been lucki with two posit   the declin in gasolin price and the rise in the stock market  we   ve had some hope news on the inflat front over the intermeet period  but the level of inflat continu to concern me   as we anticip at the  e of our last meet  the drop in energi price led to a signific deceler in headlin inflat for septemb  although the twelv month chang in core cpi actual edg up to     percent  a rate that i consid well abov price stabil  it may be begin to stabil   but  frank  a lot of uncertainti remain  and it is danger  to my mind  to reli too heavili on one month   s number   some of the acceler of core inflat over the past year was like due to the pass through from energi price  as we discuss befor   so if oil price fall or continu to stabil  then acceler of core inflat from this sourc will like dissip   howev  we   ve seen energi price retreat onli to move back up again  so i don   t think we should becom too sanguin   inde  the inflat pictur remain uncertain   i   ll be more comfort when we begin to see twelv month core inflat begin to deceler   to the extent that some of the acceler in inflat was fuel by veri accommod monetari polici over the past five year  we still need to consid whether monetari polici has firm enough to remov the cumul effect of the past polici accommod to get inflat back down to a level consist with price stabil in a reason  e so that our credibl is not at risk   the longer we allow that deviat from price stabil to persist  the higher the risk to our credibl and the higher the risk that recent high inflat read will rais longer term inflationari expect   so far  long run expect have been stabl  and shorter run expect have fallen with oil price   nevertheless  i think the fed   s commit to price stabil deserv our protect   one thing to note go forward  though  is that if econom growth remain below trend for a while  then there   s an implicit firm of monetari polici  even without chang the nomin interest rate   given our econom outlook and the risk to that outlook  at this point that may be actual the most desir path   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   for a while now  i   ve been somewhat more pessimist than most of the committe about the downsid risk to the real economi   i was begin to get worri that this might be the perpetu disposit of someon from ohio   laughter   as a promin member of our busi communiti said to me not too long ago  it   s not the weather  it   s the climat    laughter  sinc our last meet  i   ve becom more comfort with the idea that substanti weaker than forecast growth is less probabl   part becaus we   re now a littl further down the road without ani sign that the worst case scenario are materi and part becaus my director and my busi contact seem more posit about the econom outlook  specif  as i listen to some of my busi contact in construct  retail  and even real estat  the expect that thing will get substanti wors just aren   t there   also  the demand for labor seem to be grow at a moder pace  on the price side  my contact are not indic much of an impetus for higher final good price   although project compens growth seem to be firm just a bit  my contact are tell me that they think product gain will keep cost in check   with the declin energi and materi cost  i don   t hear much about the potenti for acceler pressur on price  when i combin what i   m hear from my district contact with the aggreg data that have come in sinc our last meet  i sens that we have weather the worst in soft on the real side for now   in septemb i note that my biggest concern was the possibl that the inflat trend would worsen   it   not appear that this is happen at this point   howev  we have yet to see lower rate of core inflat  and i   m sensit to the fact that core measur of inflat are be held up by the contribut to owner    equival rent from the rise rent and fall util bill   although more stabl energi price will make the latter effect go away  it   s not clear that the rent part of the pictur will quick fade  as rent continu to converg toward still high hous price   when we look at the distribut of price in the cpi  exclud energi  food  and owner    equival rent  price seem to be either rise rapid or fall  there isn   t much in the middl  and that make the under movement in the inflat trend hard to interpret  it seem to me that the key risk on the real side of the economi has been that the hous market would declin much fa  and more deepli than we had forecast and that the effect on consumpt spend would be greater than we anticip   so far  as other have comment  the collater effect on consumpt appear to have been contain   furthermor  we expect that other form of spend would hold up as the hous sector slump  and those expect appear to be on track for now   i recogn that we   re not out of the wood yet  but the downsid risk to the real economi appear somewhat more benign than they did at both the august and the septemb meet   in regard to the inflat risk  the probabl of acceler inflat has decreas  in my opinion  but the risk that inflat will remain higher than i person desir hasn   t realli chang   thank you  mr  chairman

mr  chairman  i   ll start with the district this  e  and i will tell you that condit in the district remain general good   energi activ remain strong  both in the tradit sector  such as gas  oil  and coal  and in our new sector call ethanol    laughter  they are boom  i   m afraid   despit the recent declin in energi price  we are not yet hear  in talk to differ produc in the region  about ani signific pullback in energi product   in part  this situat reflect a prevail view right now among those produc that the weak in energi price is like to be temporari   howev  if energi price remain at current level or move lower at a sustain rate  i think we will then see some pullback in retail activ and so forth   more than we   ve seen so far  in other area of the district economi  we saw some soften in manufactur activ in the third quarter  but our manufactur survey show that busi remain most op ist about futur hire and capit expenditur plan   hous activ has certain slow across the district   howev  we have receiv few report of unusu weak in our recent meet with director and econom advisori council member   so it is slow but show no sign of collaps  at this point anyway   we have also seen  with the declin in energi price  strengthen in district retail sale activ and a sharp rebound in expect for retail activ in the fourth quarter   except for domest auto sale   labor market remain firm across the district   unemploy rate are low  and our director and other contact continu to report shortag of skill labor across the district   district agricultur condit remain rather mix   drought continu to affect much of the we n part of our region   howev  livestock and crop price have been support by strong world demand and lower suppli  so those farmer who are abl to bring in a crop are do quit well  turn to the nation economi  i think that the recent declin in energi price will provid import support to the near term outlook   current  i see second half growth of around   percent  rebound to between     and   percent as we get into next year   general speak  i am more op ist than the  book  both in the near term and for the next year  inde  with the current financi condit that other have talk about  i don   t envis the pullback in consum spend and busi invest spend that the  book has project at this point  one area that is worth discuss   and dave talk about it a bit in respond to a question   is the employ outlook  an area for which the  book continu to have  as dave said  a differ perspect   although demograph forc will clear work in the direct of slower labor forc growth in the come year  i   m not as convinc that the slowdown will be as sharp or as sudden as the  book suggest right now   i say that becaus i want to be cautious about view the recent slow in month employ growth as be driven by these demograph factor   i believ the recent slow in employ larg reflect some employ caution about the econom outlook  combin with the effect of weak in hous and retail sale   support for this view can be found in the recent slow of growth in temporari help that has been report to us   should the econom growth pick up  as i anticip  we should begin to see some stronger employ number as we get into next year  as to the effect of demograph   again  i think they are go to play a veri import part  but anoth signific factor to keep in mind is the educ composit of the labor forc and the skill composit as we move forward in term of labor demand  becaus that   s the shortag we   re alway hear about  now  return to the near term outlook  the recent declin in energi price has help to counter the effect of hous weak   consequ  the downsid risk to the outlook has diminish somewhat   howev  becaus we have not necessarili seen the bottom of the hous market  i do believ that that is an import downsid risk to the economi  final  let me share some of my perspect on the inflat outlook   my overal view on inflat have not chang materi sinc the last meet   i continu to expect core cpi inflat to moder from about     percent to about     percent next year and  similar  core pce inflat to moder from about     percent to     percent   a signific fall in price for oil and gasolin and natur gas in recent week has alreadi begun to show through to overal inflat   i believ this is a posit develop in help to ensur that inflat expect remain anchor and perhap in help to moder core inflat next year   although the declin in energi price has reduc the upsid risk to inflat somewhat  i agre with other that core inflat   remain too high  and i think we have to keep that in mind as we consid our polici option   thank you

mr  chairman  at our last meet i engag in a littl texa brag   i mention that the employ growth rate in our district was twice that of the nation averag  then i read in the pre brief for the board last night the penul  sentenc  which had a wonder three word phrase      humil is requir      so let me report that econom growth in our district has slow somewhat  and i want to put the    somewhat    in perspect   we redid the number of our first quarter real gdp growth   growth of the state real gross product for the first quarter was   percent for the eleventh district   so it   s not a great wonder that it is slow   it is slow down from too torrid a pace   but our hous sector is still sweet   perhap the onli spot left in the countri   particular in the houston area   we actual are build a new auto plant  presid    a toyota plant in san antonio  which is get an inordin amount of attent   the export from our state are grow at a month rate annual at    percent  and texa is now the largest export state in the nation   so from the standpoint of econom growth  even as i am tri to be humbl  the district is do exceed well  the onli consist sour note that we hear is what you have heard around this tabl   and just now from first vice presid barron   that we have continu report of shortag of skill and unskil labor  from chemic engin to school teacher to bank teller and even to hotel housekeep staff   so we have a signific problem in term of labor shortag   skill  semi skill  and now  increas  unskil   to put some number on this  we have a contact who has survey fifti plant on the gulf coast for the price of welder   in eight month  the price for a welder has gone from     an hour to     an hour   you have to pay them a bonus of      when they show up  and you have to pay them a complet bonus as well   the bottom line is that in the eleventh district we   re behav as though we were a full employ economi  in the rest of my comment  i   d like to emphas not my district but our view on the u s  and the global economi  particular the u s  economi   i want to go back to your conclud remark  mr  chairman  at the last meet  when you remind us that  if we believ we need to have output below potenti to help address inflat pressur  it   s a delic oper  and we may have a veri narrow channel to navig as we go forward   just to keep with your naval analog of a few second ago   this summer i sail the corinth canal  which is so narrow that at  e you feel you can reach out and touch both side   even though i was on vacat  i was actual think of one side as the shoal of slow econom growth   almost recessionari growth  which seem to be what the  book is forecast at least for the third quarter  and the risk that seem to be out there   and of the other side as the shoal of inflat  from the    or    ceo and cfos to whom i spoke in prepar for this meet  as i alway do  i do hear report of a slowdown   i talk to two of the big five housebuild this  e  they are cut back signific   let me give you some number   for exampl  centex own         lot outright and has        lot under hard option and        lot under soft option  as they call it   they   ve cancel    percent of their hard option   that is     million worth of properti   hovnanian is walk away from      million worth of hard option properti   the effort there is to cut back so that what was a two month lead suppli has now becom a three month lead suppli   you can see how the dynam are begin to work   they   re move on price  but they are also tri to shut down their inventori and are take veri quick action   that is a depress factor   one of the truck dealer i talk with  rush enterpris  has about      billion a year in sale   i believ they are the largest in the countri  they are nationwid   they are report that christma retail activ seem to be back up  in other word  it is slower than it was in previous year   this is an oper with    year of experi   they are also build their inventori  particular in the coastal area  with the heavi truck that are go to be use for home construct   the book to bill ratio for texa instrument has fallen below    it is the lowest sinc        and if you read the newspap  you will see that the airlin are offer veri deep discount and for longer period than befor   so there seem to be a slowdown in activ  with that said  when you talk to the rail  there is a diminut of growth  perhap   percent third quarter over second quarter  and if you talk to up  as i report last  e  you   re still see some rather robust report of econom growth of   to   percent   i think the best way to summar the economi is  as presid   said earlier  that although there are weak sign  the economi is still robust   the chairman and ceo of cadburi schwepp said     i keep look and listen  but i   m just not see what everybodi tell me is go to happen      again  as i report last  e  the ceo of ed  who is an experienc businessman  said     it   s a funni period   everybodi is prepar to be bearish  but it   s simpli not materi      so     from an econom standpoint  both from the anecdot evid and our own econom model  we don   t quit accept the  book   s forecast of the kind of slowdown that you   re expect for the third quarter or for the second half  there are posit benefit  and the benefit are  of cours  with price pressur abat  my favorit anecdot exampl  by the way  come from global at work     interest  the ceo of fluor  who is one of my contact  report that when they bid for the bay bridg construct  their bid on u s  steel price was reject as be too expens   they went back and bid base on what they could buy steel from china for  and the bid was accept  canadian steel now sell for    percent less than u s  steel  and chines steel is be dump into this market at a price    percent lower than canadian steel   from the standpoint of raw materi and energi  you have seen price pressur abat   but from businessperson after businessperson  we still hear the same report  mr  chairman  that we hear in our district and that you   ve heard around this tabl  which is of signific price pressur stem from labor   as i mention earlier  it is not just skill labor  it is now semi skill labor such as truck driver and welder  increas shortag are be report  throughout our district and the rest of the countri  so i would summar by agre with presid   in that we in the eleventh district find the  book   s project of econom growth to be too pessimist   although price pressur have abat somewhat  we know by our measur   the trim mean pce  off of which we key our view of the economi   that the three month rate is still run at     percent and the twelv month rate is run at     percent   i would argu as we navig this narrow channel  mr  chairman  whether it   s the channel you describ or the corinth canal  that i would be more care of the inflationari shoal than of the risk of excess slowdown of growth   thank you
clarifi for me   you said that some of your nation contact were see a slowdown in the book of busi   is that the minor of the contact   i   m not quit sure i know what you were convey
the question that i put to each contact was to compar the third quarter with the second quarter   i was tri to get a feel becaus i   m quit concern about our staff analysi and the  book   s analysi of the dramat slowdown to   percent in third quarter growth   so the answer is  yes  there is a slowdown  but it is not now of the sever that our staff project seem to indic   but i do want to note that there is some slowdown take place
as to your refer to the truck compani   one of our truck compani contact indic that busi is still good   their book out have been reduc from three week to about four or five day   so they   ve seen a slowdown  but they   re still busi   they still have busi come in
part of that  by the way  is in the averag fleet of  say  class a truck  which are the big one   the averag fleet age is now fourteen month  the normal fleet age is twenti two month   part of that has to do with all of these environment protect agenc chang that keep be mandat   so you have to sort out that distort from econom activ   but the point i was report is that the util of those truck in term of carri christma inventori appear to have slow and is not run at the pace that it was in previous year
i agre   thank you
presid    did you have someth
yes   i just want to add someth that i forgot to mention earlier  presid     s comment remind me of it   whether you look at the kmv data on expect default frequenc for the five major homebuild or at the dow jone home construct index and the stock price for the top five homebuild  none of them seem to be indic a major problem   now  the expect default frequenc  which again is driven from stock price  may certain be abov the rest of u s  industri  but by no mean is it even at ani kind of histor medium posit  let alon high posit  and there has been a recent uptrend in the dow jone home construct index overal   so that   s anoth bit of the data that i was use  and other may be use as well  to suggest that mayb thing won   t get as bad as the worst of our project in term of homebuild
mr  chairman  veri quick   i ask two of the big homebuild to whom i spoke about that veri phenomenon   their answer was veri interest   they have strong balanc sheet   one of them said     i can feel the privat equiti shark swim around my feet      in fact  there is rumor of one sizabl deal that has been propos   i haven   t been abl to figur out what it is   to take one of them entir privat   so some of the buttress  presid    is come from signific amount of liquid in the system
privat equiti interest  yes   but not all five of them  and they all point in the same direct
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   we had a meet at the bank last week with repres from the hous industri in the twin citi  includ builder  broker  and lender  and most of these particip oper nation   in fact  one of the first you mention     was there   some of these firm are in nonresidenti develop and construct as well   the bottom line of the meet  i would say  was that the comment overal track pretti well with the  book forecast of hous activ   that is  both a further and a prolong slump in hous   let me just give you a few of the specif   they report  as we know  that sale of new home have declin dramat and price of new home are go down with sale  also dramat   retail brokerag are start to contract in term of both number of offic and number of broker   it was report that so call investor have disappear entir from mani market and that inventori of unsold home are rise and the extent of the increas may be underst by the publish data   there was littl expect among this group of improv in hous in the next sever month at least  and i would say not a whole heck of a lot of confid that there was improv in store even out beyond that  mayb as you get later into         in contrast  and on a somewhat more posit note  the peopl who are also in nonresidenti construct   in particular  offic and retail develop   thought that the outlook was promis  inde posit  and are see a lot of activ in that busi  the hous situat notwithstand  i remain somewhat more op ist about our prospect for real growth both in       and in       than the  book   appar my assess of the implic of the sustain increas in incom  of the run up in equiti valu  and of the declin in energi price is just more posit than the  book   s  and that   s how i arriv at a somewhat more op ist assess   i continu to think that core inflat will diminish modest over this period   so my overal view of the outlook realli has chang veri littl sinc the last meet
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start by say that i think the  book outlook is a veri good central tendenc outlook   i am go to make some comment that are more on the downsid of that  which come from hunch and gut instinct   i want to emphas that i don   t want to make polici on the basi of gut instinct  but i think it help to keep an open mind about some of the thing that might be go on  first  on the posit side  my up contact say that he is expect a peak season with a glut of volum and not enough lift   they   re go to have to move express busi over to truck  so if you   re count on get a last minut present at christmas   i urg you to order a littl earlier than you might otherwis   that   s his expect   on the labor side  up has some fair big increas come next year as a consequ of recent contract they sign   they had a long negoti with pilot  but on the ground side  obvious the less skill worker  they   re expect about     percent compens  veri much in line with a normal situat  my wal mart contact said that they have not experienc the pickup in sale that they would have anticip from the declin in energi price   they had expect an increas of about    basi point   they alway measur their sale as same store  year over year   they haven   t seen that   they   re go to be lucki to get   percent year over year in octob   my contact say that week inform suggest that octob is slow down week by week as we go through the month   wal mart receiv a lot of attent recent in the press about their slowdown in build new store next year   they probabl had a lot more press than the actual size of the slowdown warrant   they are expect to increas their squar footag     percent in       compar with     percent in         so the slowdown is hard gigant   construct cost this year are rise    percent  next year they   re anticip    to    percent   so there is a slowdown in the increas  but    to    percent is still a pretti big increas in construct cost  my contact in the truck industri say   and this may make a littl more explicit what     was say   that thing in the industri are continu to slow down   he say it   s the first  e in his experi   and he   s been with the compani twenti year or more   that the season peak has not yet start   ordinarili the season peak in ship for the holiday shop season would have start   it just hasn   t start  and i think he said they   re run   i forget exact what the number was     percent below a year ago    incident  one thing that i was think when   was talk was that some  the busi peopl have a hard  e do the season adjust  so when you compar the third quarter with the second quarter  they may not be see a season adjust slowdown becaus the volum is bigger in the third than in the second    my truck industri contact say that the slower busi seem pretti even distribut geograph   perhap a greater soft in the southeast than in other part of the countri   it is more concentr in home improv   i think home depot is one of the big custom   and probabl auto  but the soft is spread fair general across commod categori  we   ve also spent a lot of  e talk recent with contact in the hous industri   the word that we   re get is that some of the smaller and even region builder have perhap six month  and if they don   t see a pickup  they   re go to be file for bankruptci   they are veri  veri hard press   a lot of them overbuilt   they are stuck with a big inventori   they have the carri cost of that inventori  and lay off worker  sn   t solv that problem   they may bring the new construct down veri low  but it  sn   t solv the problem of what to do with the unsold inventori   so without a pickup in hous  i think we can anticip some bankruptci file in that area  peopl around the tabl here and  i think  general have been treat oil price declin as an unambigu posit  and i would like to rais a caution flag on that   i rememb from my first year in graduat school milton friedman pound into me that a price never declin without a shift in either the suppli curv or the demand curv   over and over again  that   s what friedman would say   now  on the suppli side in oil  as far as i know  there have been no gigant new suppli that have come on the market  and the op ist view on oil is that last winter and spring or start in the fall perhap a year ago  there was mayb a     to     premium built into crude on the basi of geopolit and weather uncertainti   so a possibl is that price in the mid to upper seventi were abov what was clear current suppli and demand   inventori accumul   we know that there has been a big inventori accumul in the unit state for sure   and eventu  with noth realli bad happen on the geopolit front and with no hurrican hit  the price drop back down   it seem to me that is the op ist way of look at what   s happen to oil price   but i think we should not rule out the possibl that some fundament weak in world demand is show up in the demand for energi and that might have someth to do with the soft   i take that as a hunch  not by ani mean as a certainti  but i think we ought to be open to that possibl  clear  the yield curv has been invert for quit a few month   the market seem to be quit persist in believ that some  e next year there are go to be some declin in short term interest rate  presum becaus of some combin of slower real growth and more benign inflat   possibl it   s not all expect relat   it may simpli be that the under demand for fund is soften   that   s sure true in the mortgag and hous industri   and that is what   s drive yield down   so i think that it   s import to keep an open mind to the possibl that a more fundament slow than we see in the current number is take place and to make sure that we don   t dismiss incom data and say it can   t realli be happen   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   five week have pass sinc our last fomc meet  and not surpris the outlook   not appear to have chang in ani fundament way   recent data bear on the near term situat point to notic slower growth in the third quarter than we anticip at our last meet   howev  the  book has revis up it project for growth dure the current and next few quarter so that the overal effect on slack next year is rough neutral   this forecast strike me as plausibl  but there are few data thus far to bear it out   meanwhil  measur of consum price inflat remain uncomfort high  although the latest read have been veri slight better  with regard to the pace of econom activ  there   s uncertainti in all direct   in fact  we seem to have a bimod economi with a coupl of weak sector  and the rest of the economi do just fine   those two weak sector are  of cours  hous and domest auto product  auto seem like to have onli a short live effect   in the case of hous  we agre with the  book assess of hous activ and find it quit consist with the report of our contact in this sector   besid the falloff in activ  hous price increas have also slow mark   the case shiller hous price index has been flat in recent month  and futur on this index show outright declin next year   howev  equiti valuat for homebuild  as cathi mention  have risen moder in the past coupl of month  follow larg declin over the previous year  and we interpret that as provid some indic that the expect futur path of home price has at least stop deterior   of cours  hous is a relat small sector of the economi  and it declin should be self correct   so the bigger danger is that weak in hous price could spread to overal consumpt through wealth effect   this develop would deepen and extend econom weak  potenti touch off a nonlinear type of downward dynam that could trigger a recess   but so far at least  there are no sign of such spillov   consumpt spend seem on track for healthi growth  nonetheless  the growth es  for the third quarter begin with a   and just bare  ani  e a forecast is that low  it   s reason to consid the possibl that the economi could enter recess   so for this reason  we  like the board   s staff  took a care look at various approach to assess this issu  includ yield curv base model  past forecast error  lead indic model  and survey   our bottom line is that we agre with the basic result report in monday   s nonfinanci brief   the highest probabl of recess that we found  around    percent  was obtain from a model develop by a board staff member   the model includ the slope of the yield curv and the level of the fund rate   an issu with this result is that long term rate may current be low  henc the yield curv invert  for unusu and not veri well understood reason have to do with the risk premium   es  from the other approach came in with lower probabl   final  other financi develop that could presag futur econom perform  like stock market movement and risk spread  suggest some op  on the part of financi market particip  so our sens is that  except for hous and auto  the economi appear to be do quit well   inde  the recent rather sharp drop in energi price could boost consumpt spend even more than assum in the  book   while this is a possibl  it seem more like to me that household ran down their save to fill their gas tank when gas price rose and are  therefor  like to use their recent save at the pump to bol  their financ  at least part  overal  under the assumpt of an unchang fund rate  our forecast show a beauti soft land  with real gdp grow at a moder below trend pace for a few more quarter and home in near trend thereaft   but i must admit that we got this forecast essenti by averag the strong and weak side of the economi   i think that way of proceed is reason  and i hope the land happen that way   but i acknowledg there is plenti of risk  we may end up instead with either the strong or the weak side domin the outcom   for exampl  if the hous market declin   not spread signific to consumpt  we could end up with a strong economi in fair short order   howev  if it   spread  the slowdown could last quit a while   scenario like this are nice spell out in the altern simul in the  book  which way thing go is a key issu  given that we   re in the vicin of full employ  the desir soft land depend on growth remain below trend long enough to offset the moder amount of excess demand that appear to be in the economi so that inflat can trend gradual lower   the slight drop in unemploy  to     percent  in septemb did not help in that regard  and i should note that recent comment by our head offic director almost uniform support the idea that labor market  especi for skill worker  are tight   howev  we do expect the unemploy rate to edg higher over the next year in respons to sluggish growth  our forecast for core consum inflat come down a bit fa  than foreseen by the  book   we have core pce price inflat edg down from just under     percent this year to just over   percent in      and see a good chanc that it may fall a bit below   percent in the follow year   we see the relief on energi price as help  although we keep tri to resist ani temptat to overes  the extent to which past energi price pass through has been boost core inflat   inflat also may benefit from an unwind of the earlier strong pressur on rent   final  as in the discuss we had earlier about the altern  book scenario  we think inflat may have becom less persist over the past decad  and this is one reason that we   re a bit more op ist than the  book about the possibl degre of disinfl over the next coupl of year   but on balanc  i have to admit we don   t have a perfect understand of whi inflat has been so high over the past few year  and so i tri to remain humbl  as alway  in my predict  my bottom line is this   i see a non neglig chanc that the downsid risk to the economi  eman especi from hous  could produc a recess in come quarter  but there   s a veri good chanc that the spillov will be suffici modest that the economi will avoid a recess   i also see a signific chanc that growth could modest exceed potenti  in that sens  the overal risk to the outlook for real gdp growth could be character as balanc   in addit  i see quit a bit of uncertainti about inflat go forward with the risk to my forecast probabl be a bit to the high side
thank you   it   s just a littl after        whi don   t we take a coffe break and come back at        coffe break
it   s amaz how great my answer are to your question at   o   clock in the morn after an fomc meet    laughter   i want to address just a coupl of thing that came up dure the question and answer session  first  on the issu that presid   rais about the expect channel   that   s a pretti small piec of the stori in the way that these model simul work  so i don   t think you should worri too much that it is be a signific factor   it is a small factor slow the pace of disinfl   the model guy tell me that the dollar channel is probabl the more import factor there  second  in respons to presid     s question about hous price model  i should have said we do have sever model of hous price determin  none of which we think are veri good    laughter   one is an error correct model that take serious the notion that  when hous price are veri high relat to rent  there   s a correct that will bring the price rent ratio back to the histor averag  and we es  the speed of that correct   that model taken serious would suggest outright hous price declin in      and        we also have a simpler model base on momentum   that model suggest a bit of deceler but nowher near the amount of deceler suggest by the error correct model   our forecast cut between those two simpli as an indic of our ignor about which of those model might be best at captur the current situat  third  in respons to presid pianalto   s question  besid the notion that the less persist scenario could reflect greater credibl anchor monetari polici  some structur chang could be take place in the economi in term of greater flexibl of labor market and mayb greater price flexibl as well   i don   t think that   s an unreason hypothesi   one could think about and be surpris at the extent to which worker have taken a signific hit to their real wage this  e without tri to recoup ani of it through higher nomin wage   that may indic that labor market and mayb product market are chang in a way that will make the overal inflat adjust more rapid than the inertia model that underli our staff project   i hope those respons are a littl clearer   i   ll sleep better tonight   laughter   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district survey for octob just releas today show manufactur flatten out after a run up last month  though expect remain upbeat   servic firm note solid increas in revenu  and overal district job growth remain strong   among retail  big ticket sale were softer  and hous relat sale slow further  but with other retail  the pictur brighten  with sale and traffic notabl stronger  the hous sector continu to slow  with sale weaken further in the d c  area and modest price reduct occur in other larg market   some citi in the  ina  howev  continu to report modest increas in home sale price and even permit  and in mani locat  activ vari signific across differ price rang   district labor market remain tight  and our survey indic that expect are for some addit wage pressur in the next six month   this commentari includ the now usual report of shortag of particular skill   our price measur moder some  but they remain elev  the nation outlook has chang onli margin in the past five week   at our last few meet  we have seen the staff mark down their forecast for second half growth as the pace of the contract in hous activ has becom clear   the inform that has come in over the past sever week   not suggest ani steepen in the rate of declin  and if anyth  there are scatter sign suggest that we might be get close to the bottom   except for hous  the economi still appear to be in good shape   consum spend is hold up well  employ is track labor forc growth   commerci construct is fair robust  and busi invest spend continu to grow   so we   re still not see ani major spillov from the hous market to other econom sector   hous is certain go to subtract from headlin growth over the next coupl of quarter  but i expect gdp growth to return to close to potenti at some point next year  and i remain more op ist than the staff about when that will occur   there is a risk that output growth will come in lower than i anticip becaus of a more sever deterior of the hous market or more substanti spillov effect on other spend categori   although it   s certain too earli to rule this out  i think the probabl of such an outcom has reced in recent week   so my outlook for real growth is about the same as it was in septemb with  if anyth  a tad less downsid risk  the inflat outlook has not improv sinc our last meet   the septemb core cpi read was     at an annual rate  ident to the august read  and core pce inflat for septemb is es  at an annual rate of about     percent  i think   i grant that three month core pce inflat has come down off it may peak of close to   percent   i do take some comfort in the fact that core inflat did not remain so high  but that measur of inflat has been right about    percent for three straight month   the  book forecast has it step up to     percent for the next six month and fall below     percent onli in the second quarter of        so three month core pce inflat is now as low as it get for the next year and a half in the  book forecast  and at the end of       core inflat will have been abov   percent for five straight year  i have my doubt about the prospect for even the modest declin describ in the  book   the notion that slow real growth will bring inflat down much has alreadi been heavili discount around this tabl   and right so  in my view  given the tenuous status of the relationship between real gap and inflat   the recent fall in energi price may help  but reli on tame energi price is problemat  i think   it would encourag the public to believ that we will allow core inflat to rise whenev energi price surg   that belief is  for me  the lead hypothesi explain the run up in core inflat that we saw last fall and earlier this year   we are like to see some signific swing in energi price in the year ahead   so help from this direct is by no mean certain   more broad  i believ we should be leeri of let a relat price move core inflat around  there was a lot of discuss at our last meet about the state of inflat expect  and a number of peopl point to evid that market particip did not seem to believ we intend to bring inflat down to the center of the   to   percent rang   this is confirm by the bluebook  which provid a veri use compil this  e from various sourc of market expect for core pce inflat  and they are all clu  around    percent   if the  book forecast is realiz and core inflat gradual come down to     percent over the next two year  it   s hard to believ these expect would fall much   so with core inflat run around    percent and not like to come down much soon and with expect appar settl at about the same rate  i   m deepli concern about inflat   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   our view of the nation outlook hasn   t chang much sinc septemb   if monetari polici follow the path that   s laid out in the  book  and it   s flat for the next few quarter  then we expect growth to return to a level close to   percent in       and for inflat to moder gradual from current level  howev  we still face the basic tension in the forecast   the combin of relat high core inflat today and an economi that has slow signific below trend   and we still face the same basic question   will inflat moder enough and soon enough to keep inflat expect reason stabl at reason low level   will weak spread beyond hous and cumul   relat to septemb  we see somewhat less downsid risk to growth and somewhat less upsid risk to inflat  but as in septemb  i think inflat risk should remain our predomin concern  relat to the  book  we expect somewhat fa  growth in        but we have a higher es  of potenti   the differ is realli most about hour and trend labor forc growth   we expect more moder in core pce and expect it to fall just below   percent in        but this differ is most the result of differ assumpt about persist   with these except  our basic stori about the contour of the expans is fair close to the  book  and the implic for monetari polici are similar  the market do seem relat posit  a littl more op ist about the near term outlook   equiti price  credit spread  and market interest rate all reflect somewhat less concern about both recess and inflat risk   some of this  howev  is probabl the result of the except factor support what the market call liquid   what is liquid  and what   s behind it   i don   t know that we have a good answer to that   most peopl would cite a combin of the fact that real interest rate are fair low in much of the world still  that reserv accumul by the countri that shadow the dollar is still quit larg  that a big energi price windfal is produc demand for financi asset  particular in dollar  and that there is confid in the willing and abil of the central bank  particular this central bank  to save the world from ani signific risk of a recess   i don   t think all of this  therefor  is the result simpli of confid about fundament  so we shouldn   t take too much reassur   but it still is a somewhat more posit constel of asset price  of market view about the outlook  someon wrote this week that the fog over the outlook has lift   i don   t think that   s quit right   it   s true that the economi still look pretti good except for hous  and i do think it   s fair to say that core inflat is moder and that expect are behav in way that should be pretti reassur to us   but it is too soon to be confid that inflat is go to moder suffici soon enough with the path of monetari polici price into market today  and it is too soon to be confid also that the weak we see in hous  in particular  won   t spread and won   t cumul   so i think that overal the balanc of risk hasn   t chang dramat  and as in septemb  i still view the inflat risk as the predomin concern of the committe
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   the committe   s focus has been on encourag a gradual abat of core inflat  and i think the limit evid we   ve gotten sinc the last meet is consist with this outcom   the price data themselv show some sign of deceler of core inflat on a three month basi from the veri high level of last spring and summer  though the rate are still elev   a further declin in energi price should help to keep inflat expect down and will take a littl pressur off busi cost and core inflat even if pass through are fair small   as expect  the rent of shelter compon has been increas less rapid  support the project that  in a soft hous market with overhang of unsold hous unit  this compon will not be boost measur inflat rate veri much   inflat expect as deriv from financi market quot remain at the lower level reach earlier this fall   as the bluebook note  the exact level of these expect is realli imposs to teas out of the data  and although they may be a bit higher than we would like  they do look lower than the recent twelv month inflat rate and  at these level  should exert some downward gravit pull on realiz inflat  the economi appear to be run modest below the rate of growth of it potenti  and this should reliev pressur on labor and product market   how far the economi is run below potenti in an under sens is uncertain   i suspect it is not as weak as the es  third quarter gdp number but is somewhat softer than the labor market indic  which show no slacken in the pace of demand or declin in resourc util   i base this conclus in part on the data and project of final domest and total demand  which the  book has averag in the neighborhood of   percent in the second half of the year   industri product was weak in august and septemb  pull down by the ongo inventori correct in hous and auto  and this reinforc my sens that  at least for a  e  the economi is grow a bit below the rate of growth of it potenti   go forward  i think a project of econom growth gradual recov next year as the drag from hous abat is reason  with growth support by favor financi condit and lower energi price   how quick it return to potenti is an open question   though other form of spend have proven resili to date  i agre with the staff analysi that some spillov on consumpt and invest from the weak in hous and in hous wealth are like to restrain growth at least a littl next year  i also see that the spend risk is still point somewhat to the downsid  although less so than at the last meet   to be sure  the recent sign are somewhat reassur that the hous market isn   t weaken fa  than expect   still  in the staff forecast the hous market is left with a relat high level of inventori at the end of       and price are still elev relat to rent  suggest the possibl of greater declin in activ and price   in addit  equiti price are vulner to disappoint earn as labor cost rise even gradual  the economi is most like to grow a littl below it potenti for a while and inflat to trend gradual lower   all in all  this is a pretti good outcom follow the earlier oil price shock and rise in core inflat and hous market correct   with demand outsid of hous as resili as it has been and inflat as high as it has persist  the extent and trajectori of the expect inflat trend is uncertain and should remain our focus   a failur of inflat to revers the uptick of earlier this year befor it becom embed in higher inflat expect continu to be the main risk to good  sustain econom perform over  e  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   well  again  as some of you have said  in five week we don   t have a whole lot of new inform   but i   m come back and start with hous again   as you know  that continu to be someth i watch   let me just make a few comment and give you recent feedback from some exam and dialogu with broker that i   d like to share with you   look at both start and permit  we all know that hous is continu to soften in term of construct  and we have also identifi the increas number of contract cancel for new hous   someon mention earlier the nois that we may be have around hous data  and i get this through some of the anecdot convers that i   ve had with folk   one topic was the inventori of exist hous for sale   i   m hear from a coupl of real estat broker that peopl who may have want to sell their home or may have put them up for sale are withdraw them from the market   they don   t need to move  and it isn   t worthwhil for them to move if they don   t get the price they want   i think the suppli was possibl bigger than what we   re realli measur  and so we   re see some underst of what desir hous sale would be in term of inventori   that   s continu  it is just begin at this stage  at least in a coupl of region  accord to folk with whom i   ve talk  one of the challeng that we   re face with here is that   again  i tri to look for the good news   in the hous purchas process  peopl file applic for mortgag veri often befor they qualifi to buy the hous   when you look at the mortgag banker associ data on purchas mortgag applic  as i mention befor  they drop    percent from their peak of last summer  but in the past few month they have been level off   so if applic are a lead indic  we may begin to see some moder in hous purchas   howev  the    percent drop in purchas mortgag applic mean that mortgag broker are earn a lot less incom   if they don   t close a transact  most of them get no paycheck becaus three out of four mortgag are origin not in financi institut but by independ broker   we   re begin to see increas evid of this in term of the qualiti of mortgag that are out there   we continu to track the mortgag that have vintag   in other word  that were origin   in       and we are continu to see that  as these mortgag age  the earli delinqu for these are greater than earli delinqu for similar age mortgag of earlier vintag  which impli a loosen of underwrit standard and more stress on the borrow  we are also see in a small way increas predatori activ with loan   certain practic have been describ to me late with new product  such as the      mortgag  which is fix for two year and then escal and becom an arm tie to libor in the third year  but don   t worri   you can refin it with the broker and bring your payment down and do it all over again   we   re see those kind of thing   mortgag for which peopl are be qualifi by broker with no escrow account  all of a sudden tax are due  and borrow don   t have the money for them   so predatori lend is rear it head at the lower end of the scale  and it   s someth we have to continu to watch for   howev  befor i leav hous  let me just say that the bottom line is that overal mortgag credit qualiti is still veri  veri strong  we   re see predatori lend onli in pocket of the market  i continu to believ that the rest of the economi   except for auto  i should add   is still veri strong   consum spend is good  and busi fix invest is veri sound   the moder in energi price and the growth in consum incom will continu to add support to the economi go forward   jobless claim have been low and move in a veri narrow rang the past few month   as sever of you have mention  i   m hear more concern by corpor execut about the inabl to hire the talent they need to meet their busi plan  and so i   m see more indic of tight in labor market  turn to inflat  as mani of you have said  core inflat has moder from the pace in the third quarter   but go forward in the  book forecast  it is still show signific persist even though we think we will be grow  at least for a period  below potenti   that concern me becaus that level is higher than i   m comfort with in the long run   we might have had some spillov effect from rise commod and energi price earlier on  but i was hope at this point that  with the revers  we would see more posit spillov effect that would mitig inflat   so i am veri worri about inflat   at the same  e  i know that negat spillov effect on growth due to the rapid declin in hous construct and the moder hous price appreci are risk  which we cannot dismiss  to growth  but on net i am still much more concern about the persist of inflat   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   my own view are quit consist with what i express five week ago and with the central tendenc of mani of the speaker today   that is  a greater concern about inflat prospect than growth prospect   so i thought what i   d do is just give you mayb three or four perspect on market activ in the intermeet period and suggest to you what conclus we can draw from them and what conclus i   d hesit to draw  first  as we note at the last meet  the growth in the equiti market is all about earn and not about multipl   as the market record the eighteenth doubl digit quarter growth rate  with quarter growth in the third quarter like to exceed  on an annual basi  the second quarter  on one level you would see reason for earn momentum and for more robust than the  book show in the prospect for busi fix invest   despit those headlin  i think the  book probabl has the general slowdown in busi fix invest and the general slowdown in manufactur about right   again  at some superfici level you would think that these stock price would be juic busi activ   that anim spirit would be as high as they   ve ever been   but in fact  what we can say with some confid is that histor model of cash and profit have done a poor job of indic what the strength of busi demand would be here   although busi demand has certain pick up over this cycl  it appear not to have pick up as dramat as a lot of the data might suggest  so what   that mean   i think it mean that there is general still conservat in board room  conservat by cfos   although they have plenti of ammunit in term of their access to capit market and their cash balanc  we   ll like see them use that onli when it   s clear that the economi has turn   if this soft land follow by a gradual acceler   appear to be the most like path  i would expect to see these compani put their feet on the acceler a bit more and make sure that growth get back to trend relat quick   but the idea that busi are go to turbo charg their way through this without hesit appear to be less like than the data would suggest  second  let me turn to the debt market   there is a discuss among pundit about a tug of war go on between growth risk and inflat risk   as i look at the data in the debt market  i must say that i don   t see that tug of war   the onli tug of war is realli between a soft land and a harder land  under the view that inflat is almost assur go to be solv by the central bank or by exogen factor   again  a superfici conclus would be  boy  the market are not worri about inflat  and we should take great comfort in it   rather  the thing that give me the greatest paus is that  just as inflat is nowher on the tabl in the capit market now  it could quick emerg  and it would not take much data  which all of us would consid to be relat noisi and perhap not over valid  for inflat to becom part of the discuss in the debt market   that   s someth i think we have to prepar for   i suspect  as i think about the balanc of this year  that anoth round of discuss in the capit market about an inflat scare is quit possibl  the third issu is realli one of short term volatil  which i tend not to overreact to  but i do think this particular case is tell   typic  sever week after a quarter  the market    assess of that quarter   s gdp end up trend toward truth and end up without a huge dispar as they get closer to and smarter about the under inform   i have no reason to doubt our own staff   s view that third quarter gdp is like to come in around   percent  nonetheless  the market    es  are quit far away from that   market es  have  in fact  trend down  but i   d say the median es  in the market is still in the high one  mayb even   percent   so the question realli is  come friday  if the headlin number post the way that the staff suggest it will  what the market will say about that   my own view is that there will then be an immedi rush to judgment probabl amplifi to the downsid in a polit season like this  they will say     boy  the economi is realli on the wrong track  and the econom land is a veri hard one      whether that judgment dissip as market look forward and start to understand the reason for the shortfal is a bit of a concern   also  some in the marketplac may have the view that  if that land is relat hard and fast  the pace of econom growth will do our work for us on the inflat front   obvious i don   t think that view is share by mani of us around the tabl  in fact  there might be more work for us to do   it wouldn   t surpris me if the market didn   t  at the end of this period  expect there to be a coupl of rate cut built into the first half of       and i suspect we   ll need to send don back out there to give them anoth speech   laughter
i second the motion    laughter
what   all of this mean for the real economi   again  i   d break it up into two piec   first  in term of a consum reaction function  i think consum are go to be veri stubborn and veri strong and are not go to be over scare by a third quarter gdp number that they don   t realli pay that much attent to   on a veri fundament level they are feel much better about their prospect now than they have felt in some  e  this is a function of some of the wage growth that we   ve seen and a function of oil price and the unemploy rate   so i don   t realli worri that there will be ani short or intermedi effect on the consum  i think the  book has consum spend continu in the fourth quarter at someth like   percent   that   s probabl a veri conserv es  given the strength of some of those under fundament   second  what   s the effect of this on the real economi for busi  i   m more concern about their reaction function   despit the rather robust discuss in the busi sector that i mention at the outset  i would expect them to be concern   as they   re think about their capit expenditur plan for      and as they   re do their fiscal year end meet  on balanc the concern and the discuss of a hard land may well affect their abil to bet big and make big project   so  again  i share the rather conserv view that the staff express in the  book in term of where busi invest is go to be  final  let me just talk for a moment about inflat   again in the context of these market perspect   i tri to be as witti as   is in this discuss  and dure the break it occur to me that i should call this section    inflat  are object in mirror larger than they appear       laughter   that   s my half heart effort at humor   i   ve probabl talk about the tip market at least as much as other folk around this tabl in the past six or seven month  and i do find some comfort in them   but i find myself increas view them as be a bit divorc from some of the data   my view is that expect of inflat relev for price set may have deterior much more substanti than the tip market and the survey measur suggest   i think the  book has an altern simul that hit this case well  and it conclus has to be that expect may account for more of this year   s rise in core inflat than either we or the market es    inflat is like go to be particular sticki in the labor market  given my discuss a moment ago   veri low unemploy insur claim  veri low unemploy  and strong wage and job growth make me believ that the labor market may actual be tighten at the same  e that everyth els we   ve talk about is happen in the hous market   the revis from bls suggest that they found         job through march   when all is said and done about the subsequ six month period  they may have found more job as well  bol  the case that the labor market may  in fact  be quit tight   total compens is up about     percent  the fastest rate sinc the third quarter of       averag hour earn have acceler now to   percent   at the end of the day  we should take some comfort from the tip spread  but not relianc   as we think about the measur of tip spread as an indic of inflat expect  i am troubl  probabl increas  that the tip market appear to be follow our forecast rather than the actual data  and we have to continu to address that problem proactiv with the market   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d actual like to start with a plea base on someth that presid   said   i   d like to be treat like a welder   can i get a show up bonus    laughter

as everyon has said  there has been relat littl inform to chang peopl   s outlook fundament   we have the same sort of tension that we   ve had befor   slow growth but persist inflat   although we see some sign that inflat is come down  it is still persist at a higher level than mani peopl  includ me  would like it to be   despit the slow hous market  privat domest final purchas continu to be reason robust   the low third quarter number in the  book are realli due to some volatil area  some special factor   inventori reflect the weak in the auto sector  some chang in the auto sector  and  e of defens purchas   net export also tend to be fair volatil  the suggest is that mayb this low is just temporari  as the  book has said   also  virtual everyon around the tabl has suggest that the labor market are realli quit robust  exact as governor   said  some of the recent number suggest that compens is on the rise  although the eci is still not quit as robust as some of the other measur   certain we could have a benign scenario in which the continu high profit margin absorb some of these higher labor cost without necessarili lead to higher price pressur down the line   but the high equiti market may also be support high demand  or the recent increas in the equiti market could be to some extent offset the decreas wealth effect from the hous market   obvious  there could be a tension if the market start to come down and profit aren   t quit as robust as peopl have been project   we also may have other temporari factor that seem to be boost domest final purchas   the declin in price for oil  natur gas  and gasolin   i hope that the lower price will persist  but certain the energi sector is extrem volatil with price move around enorm  and as a number of peopl mention  there are a lot of potenti problem down the line that could lead to higher energi price   one thing that didn   t lead to higher energi price this year was a veri benign climat   we had unusu good weather this year   last year and the previous year  we had unusu bad weather   so i don   t know whether a number of factor are just make us have a bit of luck right now and are perhap temporarili boost demand  what   this mean for inflat   as we alway say  there are transitori factor  and there are more like to be perman factor   we   ve talk about some measur issu with respect to owner    equival rent   probabl that   s someth transitori   we   re certain not certain about that   as for energi shock  we have veri littl evid that there has been a lot of feed through from energi shock to core inflat  and as a number of peopl mention  i don   t think we can reli too much on the declin in energi to say     well  it didn   t get there on the way up  but it will help us on the way down      i don   t see a good basi for reli on that asymmetri   there is the standard output gap stori  but from discuss around the tabl and certain from the  book  i think there is not an enorm output gap to reli on to bring inflat down  even if one believ that that gap has an import effect   and there is vanish evid that it has an import effect  then there   s the role of expect in the econom model   the multipl equilibrium stori   just our market    belief that inflat will be relat low go forward affect price set behavior  which affect the willing of consum to pay more for good and servic   that leav us with a benign but veri fragil scenario   as we know  with ani so call multipl equilibrium situat  it   s not clear exact what is drive expect   obvious  part is their belief in the peopl around this tabl  which is someth that is incred import  it   s someth that we realli need to maintain  but someth that we don   t understand veri well   in these five week  we haven   t had much chang in the fundament  but i am left just as uncomfort about realli understand the inflat situat  the short run inflat dynam  becaus we have an output gap approach  an energi shock approach  an expect approach  and sort of a measur approach with owner    equival rent  i take a bit of each of these  and there has been a lot of discuss of the differ one around the tabl  but i don   t think we have a good  overarch view of what is drive inflat  what the key inflat factor are   for me  that   s one of the most worrisom thing go forward becaus i find it hard to put all of them into a consist framework   it would be valuabl for us to think a great deal about that   certain  it may come up in the discuss of the communic strategi  but it   s someth that i   m tri to face more and have found it more difficult to understand  we   re go to get an enorm amount of inform   we have holiday retail sale come up  so we   re go to find out a lot about consumpt   we have two employ report come up   we have two round of ism  preliminari revis gdp  eci  and a lot of inform on the hous market   we   ll probabl find out a lot more  becaus in the colder area the hous market tend to slow down natur   the season is veri strong there   so we should know from some of the data in decemb whether the number from permit  which suggest that the hous market is continu to go down  or the start number  which seem to be flatten out  show where we are like to be at the begin of next year   there   s a lot of uncertainti with respect to both the economi and inflat   in particular  my inflat concern come from not have an overarch way of understand whether the factor that we talk about as temporari are realli go to be temporari   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as i see it  the data have actual been come in veri much along the line of where we were at the last meet in term of the outlook   the onli way that i would chang my view slight is actual good news  in that i see somewhat less downsid potenti than i saw at the last meet   in particular  i think that the hous market  although it has retrench a lot  which i actual consid a rebalanc of the economi    not look as though it   s go to collaps in a nonlinear way   for exampl  we see that the market has some expect along those line   for exampl  the stock price of builder have actual come back a substanti amount   we also see that consum seem to be hold up veri well   the real danger that we were worri about in term of a hous market retrench is that it would spill over in a nonlinear way to the household sector   we don   t see ani evid of that either   consum confid is stay strong   the stock market is up   again  an indic that these spillov effect are not occur over and abov those that we think would be normal in term of wealth effect and so forth   so  for me  there is actual some good news here in that the possibl of a soft land has actual increas   my view of where the economi is head has not undergon a major chang  but i have a bit less in the downsid tail than i had befor  the character of a deceler of core pce inflat also seem to be a veri reason one   i think the evid is move in that direct   but i do want to emphas that i see no reason that core pce inflat will fall below   percent   we see that inflat expect are solid ground   the good news in that has been that we had an increas in energi price and we did not see an acceler of inflat expect   howev  the number there are around     percent on the cpi  and that   s consist with a   percent pce deflat inflat   when we think about go out past the two year  i do see deceler along the line of the  book   i don   t see anyth more encourag after that   talk about the issu of potenti less persist   not tell us  in fact  that inflat should fall below what inflat expect are anchor at   so thank you veri much
thank you   let me summar what i heard  and then i would like to make a few comment of my own  there were sever theme around the tabl   mani peopl note the bimod economi  hous is still quit weak  although a number of peopl note that they thought the lower tail had been trim somewhat   auto are undergo inventori adjust  and some peopl note slow in a few other sector   howev  the general view was that spillov from hous to the rest of the economi had not yet occur   most peopl note that the labor market is quit healthi  with widespread shortag of labor  particular of skill worker   it was further note that consumpt spend would be support by the job market  by incom growth  and by the fall in energi price   overal  the assess of growth  as i heard them  were that it would be moder go forward  either around potenti or perhap slight below potenti  and some saw a bit of upsid risk to that project  with respect to inflat  cost of raw materi and energi are rise more slowli or are declin  and headlin inflat has fallen with energi cost   some felt that core inflat would moder gradual  but other were less confid about that   the behavior of rent and the behavior of product are two import unknown go forward  and wage growth probabl present the biggest upsid risk to inflat   most member express concern that the high level of inflat could rais inflat expect and undermin fed credibl   so the general view  which i think essenti everyon share  was that the upsid risk to inflat exceed the downsid risk to growth at this junctur  i hope that summari was okay  let me just make a few comment of my own   as a number of peopl note  the intermeet data were actual fair limit   the employ report did indic a fair strong labor market   there is still  to my mind  some disconnect between the anecdot and the data  in particular  the wage data do not yet reflect what i   m hear around the tabl about wage premium   for exampl  averag hour earn actual grew more slowli in the third quarter than in the second quarter   i think the eci next week will be a veri import check for our anecdot   on the posit side  as kevin and other note  the tone was general stronger in financi market   the stock market is up   i note the ten year real rate was up about    basi point sinc the last meet  which i take to be a posit indic of growth  oil price continu to declin  which obvious is good for both growth and inflat   i thought you might be interest in think about the quantiti effect of the declin in oil price  we   ve had a declin in oil price of about      which back of the envelop calcul or frb us analysi can tell us should add about      percent to the level of real consumpt or about      percent to the level of real gdp   dave reifschneid was veri help in find those number   that   s a chang to the level  so the oil price declin could add     to     percentag point to growth  say  over the next six quarter   anoth way to look at that is to think about the relationship between oil price and hous price   a rule of thumb that might be use is that a    declin in oil price offset approxim a   percentag point declin in hous price in term of overal consumpt effect   so oil price declin are essenti the negat equival of a   percent declin in hous price   an interest question that we may have to address at some point is  what is the polici implic of oil price declin   i think it   s clear that oil price declin will lower both total and core inflat  but will also increas growth  therefor  our polici respons to the lower oil price could depend on our prefer about growth versus inflat and also our assess of the risk to both of those variabl  on the hous correct  i agre that there is perhap some reduct in the lower tail  but it   s import to point out that  even if we see some stabil in start and permit  a lot of inventori is still out there  and there   s go to be an inventori correct process that could be quit signific   the current month    suppli of home for sale is greater than   now  exclud cancel  the number over the past eight year has been veri stabl around    although befor      it was higher and more variabl  which is a sourc of uncertainti   to get a sens of the magnitud of the potenti hous correct  i ask josh gallin to do the follow simpl simul   singl famili hous sale were about     million at an annual rate in juli  about      million in august   so i ask josh to consid a case in which sale flatten out at the level of     million and continu at that level indefinit  in addit  homebuild respond to three fourth of the increas in sale by extra build and allow the other fourth to go into reduc inventori   when you do that calcul  you find that you actual work off the inventori   by the end of       the month    suppli is down to       part of that decreas occur becaus the sale level is higher  and so the denomin is bigger as well  thus that particular scenario is a sensibl one in term of get the inventori down  howev  the effect on gdp  becaus the correct is still signific  are not trivial  but they are also not that larg   the effect of this scenario on gdp growth from the fourth quarter of this year to the second quarter of next year is about     on growth and about     in the third and fourth quarter   so a veri substanti part of the hous correct is still in place becaus of the need to work off inventori over the next few quarter  those are a few comment on the real side   i think that some of the tail risk has been reduc   i agre with the  book that growth should be slow  at least through the first quarter of next year  becaus of hous correct  but consumpt will probabl pick up and lead to a stronger growth path after that  let me say a few word about inflat   i think i need to push back a littl on the view that there has been no improv in core inflat or total inflat   in fact  inflat is veri slow to respond to it determin  and the fact that we actual have seen some improv in some sens is a posit surpris  not a negat surpris   the attent that   s paid to the twelv month lag inflat measur is a problem in this context  becaus we had four month of     percent read from march to june  and they   re go to stay in that twelv month lag measur until next march   i can predict with great confid that next march through next june the twelv month lag inflat measur will declin   so i think it   s more use  presid    to look  a bit at least  at the higher frequenc measur to see what the trend of movement is   although  like presid   and other  i   m not happi with the level  i think the direct is actual veri good   for exampl  the core cpi three month went from      in may to      in septemb  so it   s a declin of     basi point   the core pce three month inflat measur went from      in may to      in septemb  use the staff es  for the core pce deflat for septemb   so it   s certain move in the right direct  the other comment i would make about this subject is that we must keep in mind how much is tie to the owner    equival rent compon   i would say  in fact  that onc you exclud that  if you do  just for comparison  that      is rough equival to      in term of core pce inflat   to look at the high frequenc number  exclud oer  which i   m do now for illustr purpos  core cpi fell from      in may to      in septemb  and core pce inflat fell from      in may to      in septemb at an annual rate   this is say that a signific part of the speedup and now the declin in the rate is relat to this owner    equival rent phenomenon   not all of it  but a signific part   it   s import to know that becaus  as we   ve discuss around the tabl  the oer may have it own dynam   it may respond in differ way to monetari polici than some other compon do   it is an imput price  which peopl do not actual observ  and so it may have a differ effect on expect than  say  gasolin price or other easili observ price   the other import aspect of the oer is that  to the extent that it is a major sourc of the inflat problem  it make clear that inflat probabl has not been a wage push problem so far becaus owner    equival rent is obvious the cost of build  not the cost of labor   so if you look at inflat over the past few month  there has been slow improv  and so far i don   t think that we have seen a great deal of feedthrough of wage pressur into inflat   i   ve look through all the various categori of good and servic whose price have increas  and i can find no particular relationship to labor market factor  anoth comment along this line   it   s also true that inflat of even      percent  which was the core pce three month inflat rate in septemb  is too high in the long run   i agre it should be lower than that   we do have to ask ourselv  given that inflat has been high and that  as peopl point out  it has been high for a number of year now  how quick we should bring it down   most op  monetari polici model will suggest that a slow reduct is what you would tri to achiev if you start off far away from the target and if the real economi is relat weak   now  the question aris whether we are go in the right direct   i think so far we are  but i would certain agre that we have to ensur that we continu to go in the right direct   the  book forecast is predic on a constant feder fund rate from the current level  actual the rate declin in        but what it leav out is the notion that we are gather inform and tri to resolv uncertainti  depend on how thing develop   obvious  polici can respond in one direct or anoth and could  if inflat   not continu to declin  be more aggress to achiev that   i felt i need to talk a bit about the fact that we do have some improv in inflat  and so the situat cannot realli be said to be deterior  have said all of that  now let me come back and agre with what i   ve heard  which is that  although we have not yet seen much wage push inflat  clear the risk is there  anecdot  and to some extent statist  we have veri tight labor market   it is surpris how littl wage push there has been so far  and if labor market continu to stay at this level of tight  then one would expect that you would get an inflat effect that would be uncomfort persist   that is a real concern  which i share with everyon around the tabl  if the phillip curv languag  sn   t appeal to you  anoth way of think about it is that  if the labor market stay this tight  which mean that growth is at potenti or better  then the real interest rate that is consist with that growth rate need to be higher than it is now   i agre with that point as well   so my bottom line is that i do agre that inflat is the greater risk  certain  i think that the downsid risk from output has been slight reduc   i also think the upsid risk to inflat has been slight reduc   thus we   re not in all that differ a posit than we were at our last meet   we can discuss the implic of that tomorrow   i think i   ll stop there   yes  presid pool
mr  chairman  i was go to make a suggest   i don   t know whether there is general assent to this   it seem to me it would be help  befor our decemb meet  to have a better read on the vulner of the hous firm to bankruptci   i can imagin a lot of default there  caus us some concern or a lot of public concern   presum  with all our bank and hous contact  we ought to be abl to get a better read   all i know is the veri inform kind of feedback that i receiv over recent week  and a lot of peopl brought up that all these builder have onli six month or so and some of them are go to go under   so a suggest is that  as part of the beig book process  we tri to get a better read on that situat
i would ask the peopl around the tabl  in their convers in their district in particular  to talk to medium size homebuild   we   ve had the larg homebuild at the board  and we have consider contact with them  but what we don   t have is contact with the medium size homebuild
right   my understand is that the larg one are in pretti good shape
okay   let me ask the committe   s prefer here   the recept tonight start at       follow by dinner half an hour later   we can adjourn now  or vinc is prepar to give his open remark on the polici session  which would allow us to finish earlier tomorrow   we   ll do the go round tomorrow  of cours
let   s adjourn now
okay   how mani peopl would like to adjourn now
half the class   laughter
is presid   allow to dissent on that    laughter
noth person  vinc
we   ll probabl rememb it between tonight and tomorrow  vinc
all right   do i take it  then  that we would like to hear     s present  sever   yes
all right      whenev you   re readi
thank you  mr  chairman   the puls of the market regard your polici action today is the flat line in the top panel of your first exhibit   laughter   not weakish data releas earli in the period  nor stronger one later  nor speech by some of you interpret as hawkish shook the belief that the intend feder fund rate would remain at    percent after this meet   expect about the polici rate at the end of next year  proxi by the decemb      eurodollar futur rate   the dot line   show more life  fall about    basi point by the middl of the period but end up   basi point higher  on net   as can be seen in the middl left panel  market particip still anticip almost    percentag point of polici eas next year   onc again  as denot by the   shade area  the    percent confid interv deriv from option price is quit narrow   we routin track the econom forecast of a subset of nine of the primari dealer  and their averag path for the feder fund rate through      is plot as the dash line in the middl

dealer expect real gdp growth to track about    percentag point higher than   the staff   one possibl is that these market particip  compar with the staff  forese both more drag on domest spend and fa  expand potenti output   if so  dealer would correspond view polici eas as necessari to generat econom growth that will be accept to you      materi use by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     your own view as to the economi   s potenti to produc no doubt influenc your view on polici  as do your interpret of the three factor describ in exhibit    the top left panel plot exist and new home sale as the solid and dot line  respect   you might see in that chart that hous sale have declin sharpli and view the result weak as a risk to the outlook  as has been the case at the past few meet   altern  you might see that home sale appear to be bottom out amid general strong fundament   as one newslett put it   and i think that the author meant it to be good news about the prospect for spend   that    the point of maximum deterior in hous activ has probabl pass      the middl panel plot the real feder fund rate  which some of you may emphas has risen consider and take it level now to be restrict   other  howev  might stress that the real feder fund rate remain below it averag of the late     s   a third potenti sourc of altern interpret might be the measur of inflat compens plot in the bottom left panel   for some  the chart show that inflat compens remain contain and has declin of late at shorter horizon  other may find onli cold comfort in this becaus inflat compens nevertheless remain abov the rang consist with their price stabil object   the polici choic today depend on your assess both of the economi in the near term and of the appropri path of inflat over a longer  e frame   the subject of exhibit    which repeat some materi from the    medium term strategi    section of the bluebook   the solid line in the top left panel plot the set of the nomin fund rate that  in the frb us model  best achiev the object of minim deviat of the unemploy rate from the nairu and of core pce inflat from a goal of     percent  while avoid jar adjust in

asset valu   wage and price setter  in contrast  base their expect on less inform and alter their view on long run inflat onli sluggish in respons to actual inflat   as is familiar from such exercis in previous bluebook  it thus take a long  e to work down inflat when the goal is below prevail inflat expect at the start of the simul  with the phillip curv as flat and inflat expect as inerti as in the frb us model and with equal weight place on the object  policymak find it op  to trade off a persist miss of the inflat goal  the bottom left panel  for smaller cumul labor market slack  the middl left panel    in this simul  progress may seem especi glacial becaus the steadi dollar depreci that is requir to rein in the deterior of the current account generat persist upward pressur on domest inflat   but even the modest progress that is made on inflat under this scenario requir about   percentag point of firm over the next year   we explor two modif of the standard framework to help speed disinfl   in the first  and as plot as the dash red line on the left  policymak are assum to put much more weight on the inflat goal relat to maximum employ   inde  progress in reduc inflat is notabl  but the unemploy rate is also notabl elev   the simul under the dot   line maintain the assumpt of equal weight in the object function but chang the assumpt about the inform that wage and price setter use so as to creat a more favor inflat unemploy rate tradeoff in the short run   this variant assum that the level of the nomin fund rate convey a noisi signal to wage and price setter about policymak    inflat goal   it is op   then  to impos polici restraint earli on so as to send inflat expect down and accomplish a quicker and less cost disinfl   the credibl you attach to such a channel may play some role in your willing to firm polici in the near term   but you may not see ani need to do so if you are drawn to the dash blue line in the right hand column of chart   those line summar macroeconom outcom for policymak with an inflat goal of   percent   becaus current inflat expect about comport with that goal  policymak can keep the nomin fund rate at    percent for some  e and still observ declin in inflat given the other forc of disinfl in the baselin   exhibit   consid some aspect of the word of your statement to be releas after this meet  start with the rational portion in the box at the top   as note at the left  in draft the bluebook  we propos includ in row   of all the draft statement that    econom growth appear to have slow further in the third quarter      this word seem to have the advantag of acknowledg the upcom releas of the initi third quarter es  of real gdp on friday  which by the staff   s reckon is like to be weak   some of you may be concern

market particip nevertheless appear to attach greater likelihood to polici eas than tighten   to protest that view and to underscor it commit to reduc inflat  the committe might choos to modifi it

thank you   are there ani question for vinc   presid
vinc  i want to ask you about chart   and   in the bluebook   also  i want to make a comment and then ask a question   chart    the equilibrium real feder fund rate chart  show that the current fed fund rate is slight abov the rang of model that close the output gap within twelv quarter   it  sn   t realli speak to inflat tension in monetari polici   howev  chart   deal direct with inflat and monetari polici  and you have the   percent target and the     percent target   neither scenario achiev the target by       though you do get closer to the   percent target if that were  in fact  our target   both of the chart are help to us as policymak   my comment is that i recommend that in futur bluebook you includ them both  as you have done this  e and as you have done some  but not consist in the past   i think they give us a fuller pictur of the total outlook  and it   s more help for policymak   the question is whether chart   and chart   can be integr more close so that we can understand the implic in chart   of the output gap for inflat
you   re exact right  and that   s whi we tri to put them closer togeth in this bluebook    laughter
so we   re make progress
we   re make progress   increment  as all progress at the feder reserv is    laughter   the notion of the equilibrium real rate is   if you held the real rate constant for the next twelv quarter  the output gap would close at the end of that period   that  sn   t  howev  mean that you would like the inflat rate you get at the end  twelv quarter from now   it   s not a polici rule   it   s just a way of summar the forc at work in the model  the op um polici exercis explicit take into account your prefer about inflat as well  henc  you can get differ result   in the futur we do want to tri talk more about the equilibrium real interest rate in term of the full model simul rather than the reduct present in chart     actual  my intent was to includ a medium term scenario in the bluebook four  e a year   they don   t chang all that much  and if your calendar is such that you   re go to have four two day meet next year  it seem appropri to line those up
well  i know they don   t chang veri much  but i still think it   s help to have them side by side as we look at them
i think i   m echo michael  but i want to compliment the staff on the evolut of the bluebook   i think that see that complement of prism on differ polici choic or differ path is use  and we should see them all the  e and more of them   i sort of miss the inclus of the rang of one we saw in june   but have said that  may i ask a broader question   i want to come back to the debat we didn   t realli have about whether what we see in tip about long term inflat expect should be encourag or discourag about the prospect for achiev suffici moder in inflat   would vinc or   or anybodi els like to speak to the question of whether  if tip five year inflat compens five year forward stay at it current level of between   and      that would be hold up under inflat go forward   or would that be consist with moder  now  you   ve given us a bunch of chart that express a view on that  i think   i don   t know much about the assumpt underpin those about the path of expect go forward
let me make two point  mr  vice chairman   first  a good measur of the compliment should be direct to dave and his staff as well becaus these model simul realli do take a lot of effort on the part of the folk in the maq section in research and statist   second  in the box in the bluebook we tri to take our best guess of that   actual  presid   mention it   the basic problem is that those are measur of inflat compens  not inflat expect   there are both an inflat risk premium and a differenti liquid premium between nomin and index debt that pollut the measur of inflat compens   not onli could they chang  which potenti chang the level relat to inflat expect  but also they could veri well be  e vari   we   ve seen big swing in our es  term premium in the nomin yield curv   we could just as well also be see swing in the inflat risk premium   when we go to those factor model of the term structur and tri to back out those es  of the inflat risk premium and also tri to take account of the adjust between cpi and what most of you talk about in term of core pce inflat  we see inflat expect  at least come from the treasuri market  in the neighborhood of   to     percent across the term structur   that   s a higher number than what mani of you have identifi as your comfort zone  and it   s not inconsist with what we see from survey measur as well
if you think about the extens of the staff forecast   basic  if you look at beyond the      period   it   s easi to see how you get back to   percent   beyond that  i guess our under assumpt would be that you will have to get inflat expect down if you want to have inflat below   percent over that longer term   now  given the way that we typic run these simul  you have to creat an output gap   there could be other channel that the model can   t captur   perhap talk or communic or someth could shift that   as we have indic  we don   t know the evid that we would be abl to present to you to assur you that that would be the case   but it look as though  to get below   percent  more work would have to be done to get at those expect
other question   presid
just to follow up on that  when we were experienc rate of pce and cpi core inflat below   percent and there was consider concern about the level of disinfl  what were market expect say about inflat at that  e   what were measur of inflat expect say   my sens is that the profession forecast have been     percent sinc  e began   but were ani other measur suggest at that  e that they expect inflat that low go forward
basic  it look as though the five year inflat compens five year ahead was run around   percent and even then fluctuat   it   s a littl harder the further you reach back  so i don   t know about the liquid premium and all the various way in which you would extract that   it has fluctuat but  sn   t realli look as though it has had much trend up or down   there would be more nois in the tip than there is in the profession survey  but they all seem to be sort of consist with   percent
it kind of beg the question then   sn   t it  about what level of low  stabl inflat is the right level of low  stabl inflat    laughter
that come tomorrow    laughter
that   s whi i pose the question right now
what a lead in
i mean  we don   t have to answer it   i don   t think anybodi has an answer to it  but we   ve been through a whole cycl here  and inflat expect are not tell a total differ stori  even through the whole cycl
the ten year tip came down quit a bit dure the deflat scare
you do see fluctuat over the past five or six year   it look relat trendless after that
are there other question for vinc   we   ll reassembl tomorrow at      a m   meet recess  octob               of     octob            morn session
good morn   we   ve alreadi heard     s report on the statement and polici propos  so we   ll begin the program this morn with the polici go round   after that  we   ll have our discuss on communic   we   ll adjourn at that point  for those of you who can stay for lunch  we have a short present on plan for the feder reserv centenni  which i hope most of you can stay to hear about   so without further ado  let   s begin the second go round  and   will take your name   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with my polici conclus and then explain how i got there   first of all  i support hold the feder fund rate at the current level of     and i also support minim chang in the statement becaus i think that not much has happen and ani chang that we put in place is onli go to produc question in the market about what we meant and whi we did it  i also want to say that my polici outlook go forward is symmetr around      that may take some peopl by surpris  given that i am general character as an inflat hawk  and i want you to understand the logic of that view   in term of the decemb meet  i would  given current inform  put a probabl of  say  two third that we will want to keep the fed fund rate where it is  split even the other one third up and down  depend on the data  when i look six month ahead  my outlook remain symmetr  but my probabl on the current fed fund rate of    might drop to one third and split the other two third on either side  if other around the tabl agre that the outlook for the fed fund rate should be symmetr or if there are some other view along those line  i would hope that the minut could report that view becaus guidanc to the market on this matter could be import in term of the way the market treat incom data  so where   that view come from   we need to have a sharp distinct between  first  polici prefer  or the object function  or the loss function  second  the way the economi work  or the current state of the economi  and third  probabl of various possibl econom outcom  or data look forward   those three concept are analyt distinct   with regard to the first  i have a veri asymmetr loss function   if inflat fail to slow or  wors yet  if it increas  we would have much higher long run cost from that outcom than from gdp growth modest below potenti   in that sens  my loss function is decid asymmetr  say that we must deal with inflat that fail to slow or  wors  increas   but i note that market expect are quit asymmetr   the polici conclus come from combin the situat in the market   the market structur or the way the economi behav   with the loss function   if the economi were in a symmetr posit  the asymmetr loss function would lead to an asymmetr polici outlook for the fund rate   but the economi is not in a symmetr situat and has not been for quit a long  e  with the market expect of easier polici next year  now  of cours  that may chang as data come in  but that   s how i see it right now  upsid surpris in the data  some combin of stronger econom activ and upsid inflat surpris  could easili drive up the ten year bond rate    basi point  which would take it up to the current fed fund rate     basi point might restor a more normal term premium   or you could even anticip that the bond market might go a good bit higher than that   over the past fifti year  the averag spread between the ten year rate and the fed fund rate has been about    basi point  so there   s lot of room for the ten year rate to go up without our do anyth   in fact  if we got an outcom of the data in that direct between now and decemb  or even januari  i   m guess that  if the ten year rate went up    basi point in respons to the incom news  we might be loath   depend on the natur of the news  of cours   to add to it by rais the fed fund rate  even though our loss function  in my view  ought to be heavili tilt toward fight inflat   so the combin of the asymmetr loss function and the economi be asymmetr in the other direct  i believ  ought to point to a symmetr outlook for the fed fund rate   if the incom data were substanti weaker than current expect and the ten year rate were to declin    or    basi point from where it is now  that process couldn   t go veri far unless the market start to develop the view that there would be a polici eas in the futur   that is  if the market were convinc that we were go to hang on     perhap in part becaus we keep insist on our concern about inflat and the market read us as have a polici bias toward tighten the fed fund rate  then we would not get the full possibl benefit of a market respons to weak data bring down longer term rate   we should want that to happen if we got weak data go forward  that   s my argument as to whi i believ the polici outlook for the fed fund rate ought to be symmetr   i   m not argu for ani chang today  i hope that   s clear   but i believ that we should provid guidanc to the market go forward that  in the event that the economi come in weak  we   re prepar to cut rate   convers  we should emphas that  if we have strong data  particular bad inflat news  we won   t necessarili pull the trigger right away   i believ that is the right guidanc go forward   thank you
thank you   yes  two hand intervent
bill  i   m not sure this is quit the way to ask the question  but if the committe adopt that approach and if the market   s respons to that chang in the signal were to lower the expect fund rate path becaus of the way they interpret the chang in the signal  would that be consist with the object you   re tri to achiev
i think so  yes
so that would leav you with a forecast for inflat that you   d be comfort with
right   my view of the recent news on inflat is that it has been margin better  that it is tilt a bit in the right direct   i think that   s the view that the chairman express ye day  and that has certain been my view   but we should want the market to respond to incom data in a way that it would be veri help to the polici enterpris that we   re involv in   so given that my outlook for the economi is pretti symmetr around the  book forecast  i think we should give some genuin weight to the possibl that the economi could come in weaker   we should not want to rule that out and tell the market that it   s go to take a realli bad outcom for the economi for us to be will to move
i wasn   t tri to talk you out of your view   laughter  but don   t the polici rule  as a prism on these choic  tell you that  if you alter your weight on your loss function
no  no   the loss function should reflect our fundament belief about our object and what we   re tri to accomplish   you need to keep the loss function analyt distinct from your judgment about the way the economi work and the stanc of the economi  our prefer ought not to blow in the wind
this is realli just a question about the framework the polici rule give us for this choic   the way i understood this is that  if you alter the weight and you   re asymmetr in your weight  in your polici rule  but you   re talk about a forecast that   s sort of the basic central forecast underpin your rule  don   t you get a higher path
but there   s a distinct   what i want to say was that my weight are asymmetr  they have been asymmetr  and i expect them to continu to be asymmetr   the exercis that we had in the bluebook and in the present ye day is to suppos that your weight are differ from my weight   not that we alter our weight as we go along but that your weight might be differ from mine   and then what would be the polici conclus from that
i agre with you on that
i was just listen to bill  and i consid us neither hawk nor sparrow nor dove   i hope that we   re be owlish  and that was a veri owlish approach   but i   d like to come around to what bill said  mayb in a differ way   it struck me  mr  chairman  when i reflect last night on what i heard at the tabl ye day  that on balanc we sustain a barrag of attack on the inflationari front   they came from energi   they came from commod price   they also came from potenti shift in the price behavior among busi produc  and we   ve come out whole   i attribut this to our action and our comport and to the continu abil of the privat sector to adapt and of privat sector produc and consum to mine resourc worldwid and through cyberspac as they   ve done so effect   i know we   re do a lot of work on that   it struck me particular ye day that we are not hear anyth about price power at this tabl   that was our preoccup for a while   not one person at the tabl mention it in the way it had been mention in the past sever convers   we are  howev  continu to hear about the avail and the cost of labor  and some of those cost  incident   such as the welder and governor     s show up premium   are not go to be reflect in the data  the bottom line is that i think we   ve made substanti progress   but i think we have to be veri mind  mr  chairman  about percept if we   re to influenc what realli count  which is inflationari expect  and about whether those expect are measur accur by tip spread  which i person doubt   one need look no further than this morn   s financi  e editori or bill gross   s recent client letter   i   ve known gross for twenti year  and i know he   s an oddbal   actual  i   d like that word struck from the record   laughter
what do you want to substitut    laughter
he   s increas addl  but his word do carri weight   in his recent client letter  he say     inflat is level off at admit unaccept level      henc my care refer to the word    comport      i think first about the immedi statement  and i want to come to that  i also think  by the way  of one thing we   ll get to this afternoon  which is the centenni  the transcript of these meet will be releas as we approach the centenni  and i think we have to make veri clear that this fomc  like previous one  is extrem vigil with regard to the greatest threat to our societi  which is inflat   at least to our econom societi   we need to issu a statement that make it clear that we   re mind of and remain vigil about inflationari risk   in vinc   s tabl  someth between b and b   as you laid it out ye day afternoon  would do the t    by the way  i would tack on    to the upsid    at the end of the first sentenc in that right hand column b   it   s sort of a mix between b and b    becaus we do view inflationari risk as be to the upsid   that   s an asymmetri  i want to make one other comment   governor   gave a veri impress brief ye day on the financi market   s perspect  and we   ve heard from other that the equiti market   s robust has given us someth of a cushion with regard to the weak in hous  although mani at the tabl do not seem to share the staff   s es  of third quarter growth    we   ll find out on friday   and to my mind  hsbc is the onli secur hous i   ve found that has an analysi similar to your  we have to be veri care in state our view on growth   and this come around to bill   s statement  i think  on the first rational box of altern b  becaus we say that econom growth appear to have slow further in q    i can accept that   but then we say    go forward      impli go forward from q    the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace   so are we say    moder    from a veri slow third quarter   that   s not even what the staff seem to be say   that phraseolog might spook the equiti market  which are be driven  by the way  as i think ani analyst would find out  not by top line growth but by earn  by continu effici in the cost of good sold  and the manag of cost of good sold and inventori   again  we take comfort from the fact that we have a strong equiti market   so i   d like to suggest replac the word    moder    in section   of altern b with    improv      i think it   s a small word chang      go forward      that   s go forward from the third quarter      the economi seem like to expand at an improv pace      that   s what we   re say  that   s what the staff is say  that   s what we   re hear around the tabl  and i think we should say so   thank you  mr  chairman
i have a question for     when you said that inflat risk are tilt to the upsid   i think you said someth like that   did you mean that you believ the incom data will like show higher inflat  or did you mean that your util function or polici object function put a high weight on inflat   i think it   s veri import to distinguish those concept
like you  i feel that we have some moder but still substanti inflationari impuls   what i   m concern about is expect
but i want to pin you down on that becaus i think it   s an import point  do you believ that the probabl is higher that inflat will come in higher than it has been or lower than it has been
do you want me to answer the question
i   m just tri to make the question sharp   to me  the outlook for the inflat data that we   re go to see is pretti symmetr around where we have been  mayb even tilt a littl to the downsid
yes  i do think we   ve had a moder of inflat  howev  i don   t think it has come down to a level that we should be proud of
then i agre with that
i do worri that  if we don   t get it down to a level that we should be proud of  we will feed expect that we don   t have the backbon to deal with what the market expect us to deal with  which should  in my view  be our singl purpos
the rate that we would be proud of is realli a way of state the object or loss function   okay   thank you   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i support keep rate unchang and altern b   i think that rate  at least for now  seem consist with growth of the economi just a tad below the growth of it potenti and a gradual declin in inflat   incom data will tell us if we   re wrong on that  but right now that look like our best bet to accomplish the object i think the committe ought to be accomplish  i agre that the pace and the extent of disinfl are great uncertainti here   presid pool has made a valuabl contribut here about the loss function relat to the polici path   a failur to revers the earlier increas in inflat is the main risk to good econom perform that we face   therefor  we need to see a downward path of inflat   i think our minut and our speech have made it pretti clear that that   s what the committe mean by inflat risk remain   i think the public understand that  presid pool has made a valuabl distinct between the loss function and the econom outlook and what that impli for interest rate  but i don   t agre with his conclus  after all  the  book forecast has essenti a flat feder fund rate and a veri  veri gradual declin in inflat bare along the path that most committe member could toler   if our loss function is asymmetr relat to that  it   s more like that interest rate would have to rise than to fall relat to the  book path   moreov  mani member of the committe seem to have a stronger path for output  and mayb even inflat go forward  than is embed in the  book   so the word about addit firm that may be need  the asymmetr word of a risk assess  is the appropri represent of how this committe is look at the potenti futur path of interest rate given both the loss function and the committe   s outlook for growth and inflat  i do have some comment on the languag   in section    i like the addit of the forward look languag and  unlik presid    the use of    moder      it seem to me that the word    moder    is fair ambigu  but it   suggest that we don   t expect a great deal of weak go forward or a great deal of strength   i think that   s about where the committe is   growth close to  mayb a bit below  the growth of potenti  and the word    moder    convey the sens that the committe wasn   t look for someth realli weak or someth realli strong go forward   so i think that was a valuabl addit  like you  presid    i did wonder about the specif refer to the third quarter and how that would play out   governor   actual brought this to my attent on friday   the advantag of the refer to the third quarter is that  by our acknowledg a weak third quarter  the market might not react as strong to a print that begin with the number   as they would if we didn   t acknowledg that   there are also a coupl of disadvantag   the third quarter could come in much closer to     percent   there are a lot of assumpt built into that number   we could be wrong   but even more import  from my perspect  an aw lot of the weak in the third quarter is in net export and inventori chang   the under feel to the third quarter and final demand aren   t realli all that differ from the second quarter   so emphas the weak in the third quarter in our languag may not give a good sens of what we think the under situat was   altern languag might be a more general sentenc say that    econom growth has slow over the cours of the year  part reflect a cool of the hous market      that more general sentenc about    over the cours of the year    probabl reflect better where the committe is   i could live with the third quarter languag that   s in there now  but i would have a slight prefer for the other one  in section    i actual have a slight prefer for the word under altern a   i   ve alway been a littl uncomfort with relat the outlook for inflat to the level of energi price   the last major increas in energi price was last spring  and i think they   ve been kind of level sinc april or may and actual have come down   some of the commentari after our last announc point out the contradict in which we have energi price both push up inflat and pull it down in the futur   so my slight prefer  again  would be for the word of altern a  which say that the high level of resourc util has the potenti to sustain pressur   it  sn   t refer the high level of price of energi and other commod  in section    the risk assess  look at the languag that   put on the tabl ye day  i think the first sentenc of that   a better job of enunci what the committe has been think about   that the reduct of inflat is what we   re look at   but i   m hesit to chang the risk assess languag   i think that peopl do understand what we mean by our risk assess languag now   i am concern that chang it would provok a reaction  and i   m not confid that i know what the reaction would be   so my prefer  again  is to stick with the current risk assess languag that   s in altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
could you just repeat the chang you suggest  don  in section
instead of    econom growth appear to have slow further in the third quarter    it would just be    econom growth has slow over the cours of the year
this is a glossari or dictionari question   like don  i interpret    moder     becaus i was advis by the staff to do so  as    at or slight below potenti      have we use that phrase in the recent past in a way that would allow the reason inform outsid person to interpret it that way
i don   t know
we   ve use it as a verb and not as an adject    laughter
what is our euphem for    potenti      is it    solid     is    solid    the convent use
it   s sustain or solid   i realli hate to have to say this    laughter  we have been use    solid    as    at or abov potenti     and it seem symmetr to use    moder    as    at or below potenti
if we consid the merit of don   s chang  or the   kohn chang  to that second section    it convey the sens of growth   if you look through the recent slowdown  growth strengthen relat to the pace in the second and third quarter        moder    impli some modest strengthen relat to the pace of the second and third quarter
i think the issu is whether    go forward    mean start from the quarter we   re current in or whether it is a statement about        the reason we draft the explicit refer to the third quarter is that we   re in the fourth quarter  and at least if you believ the staff forecast  you think gdp growth has alreadi bounc back from the third quarter
moder    laughter
i was just go to say  too  that all of this is complic by the fact that our assess of potenti has been written down   even an inform observ might not have caught that nuanc of how much we   ve written it down   look at what would have been refer to in a    moder    or    solid    context  the number were differ two year ago from what they are now   that creat an even greater level of possibl confus here   is   percent good  bad  or indiffer   it depend on where you think potenti is  and that has chang   so there is a complex here that i think speak to the difficulti of word this sentenc
i would say  presid    that the refer in the minut of the past two meet to the staff   s mark down the rate of growth of potenti has certain caught the attent of market particip
do you think it has caught enough attent that they would still interpret a fourth quarter growth rate of     percent or so as okay
i think  actual  that the chart i had in my brief that show the nine primari dealer    forecast of real gdp track abov the  book forecast suggest that they may have move it down but they haven   t move it down as much as the staff
governor kohn  concern the assess of risk  i think i heard you say about altern b  that you weren   t sure what effect it would have   i   m interest in what under that uncertainti
well  my basic concern here is that we have someth alreadi that peopl seem to understand   whi chang it   in my view  the current risk assess is well understood  thank to the minut   thing haven   t chang   as everybodi stress in their discuss of the economi ye day and their sens of the risk to the outlook  noth has chang   so i didn   t see a reason to chang the languag
i understand those rational for retain languag  but you express uncertainti about what the effect of b  was   it struck me   and i think was intend by vinc   as ad a dollop of hawkish to the statement   do you doubt that the market would interpret it that way
i think that   s quit possibl   given that peopl haven   t chang their view  i   m not sure whi we would necessarili want to do that
all right   presid
as i note ye day  i   ve becom somewhat less worri about the downsid risk to the baselin outlook   so to some degre  that factor has chang a littl sinc the last  e   in fact  i think the baselin isn   t bad at all   inde  it   s a testament  again  to the resili of the u s  economi if we can actual pull off  as we seem to be do  a gradual slow of the power u s  hous market against the background of consider geopolit and energi market uncertainti and price pressur  not to mention the potenti for both strong consum retrench and financi market volatil  so we seem to be thread the line through a lot of risk on both side of this baselin  and we seem to be do it success in negoti that soft land   i think we should take some pride in that so far so good and that monetari polici has play a key role in this unwind process   in that regard  i continu to believ that the cost to the central bank of be wrong on inflat risk is greater than be wrong on the side of growth at this  e   if growth wane more than is now expect  we can eas polici fair quick   get behind the curv on inflat could be a good deal more cost   thus  i am pretti comfort with the current stanc of polici  which i see as slight restrict   at least for the  e be  i think it balanc the risk of be wrong on inflat with the risk of slower growth and is appropri given the brighter tone of much of the incom data  with the possibl except of residenti invest  a risk manag argument could be made for rais rate  and certain those less comfort with the current and prospect level of core inflat might find such an action attract   i don   t  as i continu to worri some about downsid risk to growth  and i am more or less comfort with our forecast that  with no chang in polici in the near term  inflat will gradual fall to just over   percent as measur by the core pce in the next eighteen month or so   that project  at least at this  e  seem right   so i come down on the side of keep the fed fund rate at      so that   s the polici choic  the next issu is what to say about it   i think it   s import to continu to emphas some concern regard inflat rather than to move to more of a balanc of risk   financi market remain quit accommod  and i realli see no reason to encourag them to be more so  think that polici eas might occur sooner than they do now   i think that would be the outcom of altern a   so i   d prefer altern b  the next question is  which altern b   we now seem to have b   b   and b   let me just comment a bit on the varieti of altern that have been rais   you know  i have a lot of regard for governor kohn  and i take his point   and governor     s point   about section     howev  when read through it myself  i did think that the refer to the third quarter might help the market react better if  in fact  the  book forecast is accur about the number that we   re go to see on friday  which is consider less than what a lot of peopl in the market think we   re go to see   i thought that the refer to the third quarter was help there   but  again  i have a great deal of regard for the cumul wisdom on the other side of that  with regard to section    i  too  believ that there is some benefit to make the chang that   s suggest in the bluebook of use the altern a word for section     the shorter word   reflect the moder that has occur in energi and commod price  and it put the level of resourc util more front and center as an inflat risk   i also find that it   s somewhat shorter  which  in general  i think is desir  in section    i found the b  word attract becaus it suggest a concern regard inflat that i heard around the tabl ye day and somewhat of a diminut of deep concern about the downsid risk   in a way  i think there is a benefit at the margin to get away from stock phrase   but i take governor kohn   s point veri serious that one   that recogn that there   s a potenti for unknow consequ   so while i am margin in favor of b   i am more than happi to go with altern b  either as it   s present  with the switch of section    or the new languag for section     i   m easi  you might say    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been a lot of interest discuss so far in this go round  and i find my own view refin a bit as we go along   the bottom line today is that certain i agre with everyon who has spoken so far that to maintain the fund rate at    percent is the appropri action   the incom data we have receiv over the period have not realli chang my outlook veri much for the economi   of cours  i was a littl more op ist than some of the peopl last  e  and so i   m glad to see everybodi has come around to my point of view    laughter
beginn   s luck
that   s right    laughter   well  you   ve got to take it when you can  right   inflat continu to be higher than i   d like to see  and i still believ there are larger risk on the inflat side than on the growth side   growth will be slower in the third quarter   we have all acknowledg that   but we also discuss around this tabl the fact that even the  book is now predict a somewhat larger bounceback in the fourth quarter  inde  i remain op ist that in general the bounceback is go to be somewhat quicker than the  book   s forecast   we   ve had some good news on inflat   it seem to have stabil somewhat   but given our earlier paus  extend the paus seem the prudent thing to do from my perspect   if growth as forecast by the  book into the next sever quarter remain signific below trend  actual hold rate steadi for a while would be an implicit firm of polici  which may have the desir effect on inflat that we might need to have in order to bring down inflat   howev  if growth bounc back more strong than the  book forecast  which i believ is a like outcom  we may have to consid addit increas in the fed fund rate go forward   thus  from that standpoint  i realli don   t view the prospect polici path as particular symmetr   i believ that the path more like would be to hold it fix and allow a weaken economi to somewhat firm polici and do our inflat work that way  or if growth respond more quick  we may  in fact  have to engag in more firm polici  as regard the languag  i   m a littl torn   i   m a bit with presid     i kind of like b  i kind of like b   but i also worri a bit about the languag and the implic it has for the market   i actual find myself in agreement with governor kohn on mani of his point   i like his prospect chang to section    get away from what we think are somewhat unusu factor in the third quarter and not emphas that quarter too much   of cours  you might do that by just leav section   almost as it was last  e   the onli differ is that you   re make a statement that go forward the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace  the first sentenc in section   of our last statement  or the onli sentenc in section    realli convey almost the same thing that i think governor kohn was tri to achiev  but i   m certain happi with section   as suggest by governor kohn  i believ it   s clear prematur to send ani signal whatsoev that a rate cut is be contempl in the near term  which i think is how the languag of altern a  section    would be read   i think that ani chang in the risk assess languag that would lead market particip to lower their expect path of the fed fund rate would in my opinion be counterproduct   i also think that mention the possibl that the slowdown in econom growth will becom more pronounc  again as section   of altern a seem to suggest  would be veri mislead and would be inconsist  as has been note  with some of the op  express around the tabl ye day   thus friday  when the advanc es  of the third quarter is releas  languag a would be read as our expect growth to be less than   percent go forward  and i think that   s realli not what ani of our forecast are suggest   i believ there is a greater likelihood that growth will be higher rather than lower in the come month than the  book show  and unless we see evid that econom growth is weaken signific compar with our forecast  lower the fed fund rate just will not be a veri like outcom   i think we should be reluct to suggest in our statement that we are now more inclin to lower rate   for those reason  i realli don   t favor the languag in altern a   relat to altern b  the languag in b   as i have suggest  accur reflect the view that mani of us around the tabl have   that the data we have seen actual have truncat some of the tail on the downsid and that the risk of a realli bad outcom has somewhat diminish over the past few week   but i   m afraid that tri to use b  to fine tune expect too precis may creat more problem than it solv   so i tend to favor keep the languag as constant as we can   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   my prefer also is to maintain the rate at    percent   for the near term outlook  i think an import recent develop that has been note is the declin in energi price   as i said ye day  lower energi price do help cushion the effect of the hous slowdown  and they do reduc the downsid risk to growth over the near term   at the same  e  by lower headlin inflat  i think they help contain some of the inflationari expect   so if that rate is maintain  i think we will  in fact  contribut to lower core inflat  by reduc both the downsid risk to growth and the upsid risk to inflat  the declin in energi price make it more like that we can continu to maintain the fed fund rate at what i   ve describ as it current moder restrict level until core inflat return to more a accept level   at the same  e  i continu to believ that the upsid risk to inflat   remain   the recent month pattern in core inflat  while encourag    not firm establish a downward trajectori  which i think is veri import to establish   consequ  i would be prepar to leav the fed fund rate at that level and have it natur firm as mention by other  and i would support addit tighten should inflat revers cours  let me veri briefli talk about the statement   while downsid risk to growth remain  i would not want to convey to the market the impress that ani near term eas of polici is like at all   as market have onli recent understood the messag in the last press statement  i believ we can best accomplish this by updat the rational section use the word suggest in altern b  section     i   m comfort with the word    moder      i think vinc gave a good definit of it   at or slight less than potenti   i don   t think that word would be harm at all  but then i would go altern a for section    and i would maintain the word of the assess of risk that was use last  e   i would not be in favor of modifi the languag of the risk assess in an attempt to get the market to alter their current view of the expect polici path  thank you
did you mean to say that you want to strike the word in the inflat section   was that what you were say
okay   thank you
you said you didn   t like the word    moder
no  i said i am veri comfort with the word    moder
oh  comfort with it   i   m sorri
thank you  mr  chairman   as i note ye day  i   m more comfort than i was at our last meet that econom growth will not deterior signific  and i continu to believ that the risk that inflat will remain higher than i person desir is still there   so today i support no chang in the fed fund rate  and i support the languag in altern b  howev  in listen to some of the comment around the tabl today  i like governor kohn   s suggest for section     for all the reason he state  i think that his suggest make it a littl clearer than the way it   s state now   i was also go to suggest that in section   we use the languag under altern a  as governor kohn suggest   as a few other have said  i prefer to leav the assess of risk languag unchang becaus i   m not sure that much has chang sinc our last meet   the bluebook note that we could use the b  languag to protest the view that market have that there is a greater likelihood that we   re go to be eas rather than tighten  i   m not sure they are go to view it as a protest  and i prefer to use our minut and speech to more fulli communic that sen ent   so for those reason i   m comfort with the assess of risk languag under altern b   it   s becom clearer to me that our discuss after this round is becom more import becaus the issu we   re confront are what level of inflat we find accept  how fast we are go to get there  and how we intend to get there   so i   m look forward to that discuss after this go round   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support keep rate unchang   on the word  i guess i lean slight toward b  over b  but it   s not a matter that i feel strong about  and i could certain accept either altern   i remain quit uncertain about how the various forc in the economi are go to play out   as i said in the econom go round  i think that  if we maintain the current stanc of polici  most like we will get the desir featur of a soft land with inflat come down gradual   but i do think there are substanti risk for output growth   i guess they   re balanc around moder growth  but i remain concern about a downsid that would includ a period of sustain and signific weak   on the inflat front  i do think that the risk remain tilt in the direct of higher inflat both becaus i   m uncertain just how the inflat process is work and becaus  while i believ inflat will come down  i don   t have confid in the scenario under it   if we don   t get the play out of the downsid hous risk  i think there is some probabl that growth will actual be suffici strong that we   ll get some upward pressur on inflat from the labor market   we   re go to learn a lot by decemb   a lot of data are come out that will bear on growth  inflat pressur  the labor market  and so forth  it clear make sens to wait  i guess i   m slight attract to b  over b becaus i think the languag more clear suggest an upward bias for futur rate chang and that   reflect my view of the risk to inflat and the like path of polici   at a minimum  it seem to push back a bit against the market   s view that we   re go to be unwind rather quick   but i take the argument that have been made around the tabl for b as oppos to b    i   m not sure that there realli is much to be gain by chang the languag we have in place on this  and leav it alon may be the wiser cours at the end of the day   on section    i think that governor kohn made a good argument for chang that languag   again  i could go either way   final  on section    i prefer the word in altern a to that in altern b   refer to the high level of price of energi and other commod  given that we   ve had a substanti declin in energi price  realli   seem a bit out of date and a bit out of touch
thank you   first vice presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   the bottom line is that i   m comfort with the current polici stanc and see no need to move until we becom convinc that our forecast for inflat moder won   t be realiz   as for the word  i   m support of altern b as current provid in the bluebook   while i   m attract to governor kohn   s suggest chang  given that it has onli been five week and there is like to be some pull back in the third quarter  i would be inclin to leav the word as it current is written   but i would be cautious about chang other word   again  given the short durat between our last meet and this meet and given the lack of evid that a lot of thing have chang dramat  as for my reason  i think that there is clear evid that output is slow  but my sens is that there   s uncertainti with regard to the degre of the slowdown   that is  how slow we will grow  despit the output uncertainti  busi and consum seem reason comfort with their prospect   employ gain remain posit  albeit at a slower pace  and incom and spend continu to grow   there are  howev  real side concern in the hous sector  yet none of these scenario we   ve run seem to suggest anyth approach a recess level slowdown   concern remain weight toward an upsid risk to inflat  but not necessarili one that demand immedi action   despit the concern on the inflat front  i think we can afford to wait a bit longer so that we can assess the actual outcom regard inflat and output  see how they match up against the forecast  and then determin whether the current level of the feder fund rate provid enough restraint to reduc inflat   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   given our decis to paus a coupl of meet ago  i don   t think that we should move rate today   we   ve made onli small chang to the outlook sinc our last meet  and we   re still face an uncertain polici environ   i   m feel a bit more comfort about the resili of the real economi  as i mention   still  i recogn it could be a while befor we have a reason clear pictur of how the correct in the hous market is play out   with regard to inflat  it   s true the past three month of price data were better than the previous three  but as we have pretti much a consensus here  it   s still way too soon at this point to say that core inflat has peak   my basic think about inflat has not chang  it   s too high  and i see a signific risk that it will not come down fast enough   i just want to refer back also to the medium run scenario in the bluebook   rememb we had those two target  the     percent target and   percent target   you recal that  depend on which target you chose  you had a differ seri of polici action earli next year   so i think our discuss about communic later today will have some relev for our near term polici decis as well as our longer term communic strategi  in term of the languag  let me go through it section by section   in section    i like the chang that don kohn suggest  say that econom growth has slow over the cours of the year instead of refer specif to the third quarter   there   s no major benefit in singl out the third quarter   the substitut sentenc accomplish much of the same thing that point to the third quarter    and so i like that chang   about the second sentenc in section   and the question as to what the word    moder    mean  i can see there will be some confus here  come into this meet  i thought    moder    meant    below potenti    not    at potenti    becaus    moder    to me mean good but not great   that   s the way i interpret it  and i would assum that market observ and fed observ are go to be do exact what vice chairman   did
professor    laughter   professor   did  say     what   s the dictionari say      they   re go to be rush to the dictionari to figur out what    moder    realli mean here   so there   s confus about the definit   then there   s the confus that was point out about what the baselin is   from where  from the third quarter  from the averag of the first three quarter   i think these are valid critiqu   i think we can say the same thing for the word    improv     though i don   t think that help us   i guess i   m not happi with the sentenc  but i can   t think of a better way to improv it at this point except to drop it complet   on section     i agre that altern a is better than altern b  to take out the refer to energi in that first sentenc   then in section    i like the languag of b   but it   s a close call as to whether or not this is the  e to make that chang   i guess i have a slight prefer for leav it the way it is now   i just don   t think this is the  e to make chang in section    and we   ll certain have anoth chanc to revisit this at our next meet
there   s more discuss about the word    moder      it occur to me this aris also in other context   do we realli have to speak in code word   if what we mean by    moder    is that we believ growth will be near trend or near potenti go forward  whi don   t we just say that   it   s just a suggest
that would break mani year of tradit    laughter
just say    slight    or    somewhat moder
that   s okay  presid     you   re new    laughter
i   m a bit of a slow learner  but i   ll catch on
i see a two hand intervent from presid pool
as he was speak  i start to write exact     couldn   t we just say the economi seem like to expand at a pace at or slight below potenti      that   s what we   re all say we mean   whi not say it
so long as we don   t get sidetrack onto what    potenti    is at this point
whi don   t we say     whatev that is       laughter
you fill in the blank
this is go to come up later   there are real issu about use the word    potenti    that i think will get us into troubl   so i   m sympathet to your view about be clear  but i think we had better wait on this   it   s someth that   s more complic than i think we want to deal with at this stage
all right   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i support maintain the feder fund rate at    percent   second  i have some concern about edit on the fli   i   m not sure it lead to effect communic  but sinc that   s the game we   re play   laughter  i will enter into it  albeit a littl reluct   with regard to use altern b as the framework  in section    i favor the kohn   chang main becaus i think it put a littl less emphasi on high frequenc data and  other thing be equal  the less emphasi on that the better   in section    i do think the express under altern a is prefer over altern b for the reason that presid   identifi   it seem out of touch to continu to talk about high energi price   yes  they   re high relat to histori  but they   re not high relat to the past ten or twelv month   i might like to say someth more art about resourc util  but i think that   s a battl for anoth day  and i   ll avoid that   as far as section   is concern  like other  i find that a veri close call   i may just have my own view of polici  which lean slight toward b   but i don   t know how much we gain by make the chang at this  e   but if we don   t want to do it today  we might want to think about do so in the longer term   make more frequent languag chang may have some advantag becaus it may mean that ani chang carri less weight with it   we seem to have gotten ourselv into a posit in which it   s veri hard to chang even an adverb or an adject without worri a lot about what peopl in the financi market are go to make of it   i   d like to find a way out of that posit  and one logic way out of it  i think  is to make chang more frequent and make clear that it   s the way we   re go to oper in the futur and that these particular word don   t carri an excess amount of signific   if we don   t want to do it today  i also would favor b   but it   s someth i think we need to think about   thank you
i think the communic subcommitte should take that under advis    laughter
good idea    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i support leav the fed fund rate unchang at this meet   i   ve puzzl over section    and i like what governor kohn has suggest becaus one of the challeng i have had in this whole thing is what i heard around the tabl ye day  which in general support the conclus i   ve been come to   we realli are go from veri rapid growth to slow  but if you pars out the piec  what   s realli chang is hous   the rapid growth from      to      was due to unsustain hous construct  it   s come down  and it   s a big chunk of that chang   now  other sector have nois or are weak   sector like auto and export are jump around  but it   s hous that has to adjust   i think it   s go to run below trend as the  book say   at the same  e  as we all were mention ye day  we have tight in the labor market  which again signal that in most sector of the economi it   s hard to find peopl who are avail to work to sustain the economi   it   s almost as though we have a dichotomi right now wherebi hous is run below trend but the rest of the economi is run at or abov potenti   so i think it   s import to leav in the comment about the hous sector   that is what we   re focus on   to me that is bring the aggreg number below potenti and is moder the growth rate   but in term of the way to go on section    i can go either way   i do like the chang that governor kohn suggest in section     i think that is a good chang   i believ that we should not chang section    the assess of risk  at this meet   it has been onli five week  we   ve had a discuss about chang more frequent  again  i think we ought to leav that to the communic subcommitte to think about   but i think we ought to leav it as it is becaus it say what we realli mean   the first sentenc say that there are inflat risk  and that   s a sens that we need to convey   too much could be read into a chang that may be unintend  and so i   d rather just at this meet leav it the way it was at the previous meet   thank you
mani of us have said that inflat is too high   mani of us have said it recent in public  and i haven   t heard ani of us say that we   re satisfi with inflat be    percent indefinit   but public expect clear seem inconsist with core inflat return to below   percent in a reason amount of  e   we   ve tri to communic our concern about inflat  but that effort has fallen short   we intend the august decis to be a hawkish paus  but i think it   s fair to say that the market overlook the hawkish part   market subsequ came to believ that a set of rate cut were in store earli next year   in recent week the polici path has move up a bit  but i don   t see ani evid that peopl expect us to bring core inflat down below   percent any  soon   i think communic collect and more explicit about our intent would sure help the situat   we   re go to discuss that later today  but in the mean   we have to make polici the old fashion way  base on our own implicit or explicit individu target and our own sens of the appropri way to achiev them  my own assess at this meet  as it was at the last two meet  is that a further tighten is need to help ensur that core inflat declin to an accept rate in come quarter and that the real economi can withstand a further increas in the fed fund rate   discuss with staff ye day made it quit clear that  in their view  inflat will not come down below   percent any  soon without our do someth about it  and that   s a view with which i concur  now  reflect on the result of the last two meet and the discuss i   ve heard so far  my sens is that there   s a decent probabl that i   m go to be outvot again today    laughter   i understand and respect the argument for paus now   the hous slowdown is weaken demand growth  and at  e weaker demand growth warrant a lower real interest rate  all els be equal   i could put that into the output gap or the phillip curv languag  if you want   i recogn that under flexibl inflat target  if that were our agre upon strategi  it would take  e to bring inflat back down to target  and the speed at which one did so would depend on the state of the economi   but in my view  the rate of converg embodi in the  book forecast and the bluebook extend simul is too slow and risk that inflat will becom even more entrench than it is now   i think bring inflat down more rapid than that would be both feasibl and appropri  and i hope you can appreci that  given the limit data we   ve seen sinc our last meet  i   m reluct to signal that my concern about the trajectori of core inflat has in ani way diminish   accord  i favor altern c  for those of you support altern b  it   s hard for me to see that market polici expect  even after the adjust of the past few week  are consist with the view i   ve heard you express around this tabl   so i would think you would want to enhanc the align of market expect with your view by tweak the statement in a more hawkish direct
thank you   governor
i support no chang at this  e   as mani peopl have said  we   ve had veri littl new inform to chang our view from the last meet  and i think that the posit that we   re in is consist with growth a tad under trend potenti  whatev word we might want to use   i share     s caution about be too explicit about that becaus i think there   s a lot of controversi about what that precis mean  and i don   t think we want to get into that in this statement or at least not at this point   also  we have seen some inflationari pressur come off  inflat has been evolv a bit as i expect   i was talk about the temporari factor versus the more perman factor   the key temporari factor seem to have been a temporari elev in owner    equival rent and the way we put that into our core cpi and pce  so some of it is a measur issu   some of it is a transit in the hous market away from purchas toward rental   that seem to have come off a bit  and so go forward  it   seem as though we   re unlik to have that continu at elev level  my concern  as i mention ye day  is that i don   t understand the path or the dynam go forward   certain we have some simul in the bluebook which are veri  veri sticki  inflat seem to evolv veri slowli  or veri littl seem to affect it   part of that seem to be  if we look at the data  that the energi price run up appear not to have push much on inflat  so i don   t think we can reli on the energi price declin to give us much benefit in term of core   recent data on output gap don   t seem to suggest that there   s much empir evid that a chang in the cyclic behavior of the economi is go to have an import effect on inflat   expect certain potenti have a veri import effect  and i think we have seen a reduct in inflat expect and inflat compens  both in survey measur and in tip spread or other market base measur   but as i mention ye day  that is a veri fragil thing   the process is someth that i don   t fulli understand   obvious  our credibl is veri import  and our statement are veri import   but it   seem as though the minut and speech have help to clarifi what our posit is   if you look at the evolut of the expect fed fund rate in vinc   s exhibit    you see that not much chang has been expect over quit a bit of  e now and mayb    basi point is expect a year henc   that posit is differ from our posit a few month ago   i think it   s an appropri posit given our discuss   it leav us a lot of flexibl to respond either to surpris strong growth  to surpris strong inflat number  or to surpris weak hous   so i think that market expect are in a reason good posit in the near term   we do have to think about the longer term issu that presid   has rais and that may come up in our discuss of communic  speak of communic  in particular the statement   we   ve been talk a lot about how the committe is focus on data and the role of data and our forecast   becaus not much data have come in and our view have not chang a lot  i think we should not be chang the statement much   that is consist with our view that we are realli focus on the data   in particular  i don   t like specul about a particular number  especi when that number is go to be reveal in a few day  for three reason   one is the potenti embarrass factor if we   ve miss the number   the second is that  even if we have veri high confid that we have gotten the number rough right  get it right onli feed the view that a lot of market particip have   and i   m sure you   ve all heard this   that we know someth the rest of the world  sn   t  that we know these data befor the rest of the world   i don   t   mayb some of you guy do  laughter    at least the staff has not reveal ani of that to me   third  what we   ve been tri to say is that we look at a mosaic of data  we don   t look at ani one piec  and to emphas one piec is problemat  so that said  obvious the type of approach that don was discuss is one that i would support  but i do think it is veri import to make sure that we have a good understand  in the context of that statement  of what    moder    would be interpret as   obvious it will be veri import in the minut to make veri clear what that is  and obvious with our blackout period  it will take us a while befor we can make explicit statement if there   s confus in the market   so i do think we need to think about the interpret of    moder      howev  i like the idea of convey that the economi is like to be come back  perhap not at the robust pace that we   ve seen in the past but at a reason or moder pace  given that energi price and commod price have come down  we should be take out that energi price and commod price are push up inflat or seem to be sustain inflat pressur   also given that we have not seen much chang in the data or have not made much chang in our approach  there   s realli no reason to chang the assess of risk discuss  particular as the market seem to be interpret our assess rough where we think is reason consid the risk go forward   if the market were interpret thing as they had been interpret them a month or two ago  we may have want to chang our statement  but i see no reason to do that now
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i support keep the feder fund target constant   let me enter the fray about languag by state the opinion that we should chang languag if we think the market do not understand our view   we shouldn   t chang languag just becaus the market disagre with our view   so regard the distinct between b and b   i think becaus of the minut and becaus of the speech that mani of you have given sinc the last meet  the market hear what we   re say about inflat  they just simpli don   t agre with it   i feel veri comfort with that   that is  we have told them that inflat is our top concern   they are veri smart  and it   s not  in my judgment  essenti that we somehow match the market    expect to our own   our oblig is to tell them realli what we think  and frank  it is quit help for them to be come to an independ view   so without go to the distinct between b and b  about whether we should chang languag  i don   t see ani compel reason  in light of their understand of where we are  that we should be chang to the somewhat more hawkish descript in b    as i   ve said befor  the languag should not be an attempt to rewrit what we could have done better or could have done differ last  e   it has to be a view of  given where we are  what the increment benefit of chang is   thus i favor relat strong not make the chang to the b  languag that   forward ye day   the market are most focus on growth  as i talk about ye day   the suggest that don made about altern a  section    languag is perfect appropri  and i think it is reconcil and share by everyon here  so let me go to altern b  section    languag and tri to make my view clear in term of the chang that have been suggest   first  if instead of describ econom growth in the third quarter we refer to econom growth over the cours of the year  my concern is that the market will then see what get post as the third quarter number and will think that we think that growth is go to continu to be weak in the fourth quarter   so even though i don   t like pinpoint a particular  e  i get a littl uncomfort if we use the first sentenc to say that econom growth has slow further through the present  that is  a   percent number get post on friday  let   s say  and then that will be read to say the committe believ that that is the trend for the fourth quarter  then coupl that sentenc with the next  in which we say    go forward      i think    go forward    then larg mean      becaus we   ve opin in the first sentenc on the third and fourth quarter  i think the general view will be that the    go forward    sentenc will relat to      and we will have left some misunderstand about where we collect are on fourth quarter gdp  and the market aren   t go to have that just right   so i would leav the languag in the first sentenc refer to the third quarter   share the view that mani of you have that    moder    is not as clear as we   d like  i think we want to have the first sentenc end with the third quarter and have the next sentenc then talk  in effect  about the fourth quarter and beyond   then becaus i can   t come up with a better word than    moder     i would suggest the follow      go forward  the economi seem pois to expand at a moder pace      again  i   m tri to suggest some op   some inflect point there   the other languag i   ve mess around with would be    pois to return to a more moder pace    or someth els along that line   but i think we   re tri to show an inflect point  so that would be my modest suggest for that   all in all  the market are go to be most focus on our growth statement   so even though we   ve spent a lot of  e on wordsmith  i think it is quit import   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
i see the data that have come in over the past five week as indic that the economi is actual evolv in a way that i find quit attract   in that sens i hate to use this languag  but i think it   s actual appropri   i think the right languag is    stay the cours      laughter   in that regard  in term of the statement  we want to modifi as few word as possibl  clear it make sens not to mention energi for the reason that have been discuss  but i think the right way to let the market know where we are is that basic we   ve paus in the last coupl of meet  that paus has actual work out quit well  and that we   ll wait to see how the data evolv   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
i am  as i think the center of graviti in this committe is  somewhat uncomfort with the amount of moder that the  book expect to see in core pce inflat  and i   m somewhat uncomfort with the view that  with the market    expect for the fed fund rate  we   re go to see enough moder of inflat   we can   t be that confid   even if the fed fund rate stay constant  as the  book suggest  over the next few quarter   that we will get the right amount of moder   so i think the rang of plausibl outcom for monetari polici is like abov the path that   s now price into the market  mayb somewhat abov the assumpt that underpin the  book   i   m not confid that we can effect alter those expect or calibr our signal in a way that can engin that kind of desir chang two to three quarter out in the expect path of the fed fund rate   i don   t think there   s a good case for move polici today  of cours   i think the first sentenc in c is sort of what we meant in august  and if we had use it then  i   d be in favor of use it today   but i don   t think there   s a strong case for put it in today on the ground that i don   t know that  on the basi of the evid we   ve seen over the past five week  we can justifi what would be interpret as a signific firm in the signal the committe is send   i also think it has the slight disadvantag of mayb be harder to extric ourselv from than the current formul   have said that  i think the signal need to be asymmetr and the risk are still asymmetr   we should be more worri about the risk that inflat  sn   t moder enough than we should be worri about the other risk to the forecast  i would be reason comfort with the chang to section   and   that don propos  i have some uneasi about whether section   as modifi convey the sens that  if you look through the adjust we   re see so far  we have growth strengthen from the pace in the second and third quarter to a level that   s at or close to potenti  and i do think the sens we want to convey is pretti close to what    bill pool  and perhap kevin in a sens said   but i just don   t think we can at this  e wade into a character of potenti or what   s sustain without the risk that we   d regret the formul that we use   so on the ground that i don   t have a better altern  i would support the modif to section   and   and leav the risk assess in section   unchang   i think that will leav us in a pretti good posit   we should be pretti comfort with where we are  but i do think the plausibl scenario for what we   re like to do with the fed fund rate lie abov what   s now price in the market and mayb abov the assumpt that underpin the  book forecast
who say    peopl can   t draft a statement    laughter   i have some late break news   if you go to the dictionari  the first mean of    moder    is    be within reason limit     which i believ is what governor kohn was refer to   but it also mean    of limit or averag qualiti     and in the feder statist  there is a term of art     moder incom     which refer to household support by averag or slight below averag incom    laughter
that was truli amaz    laughter   presid
mr  chairman  i   d like to just go back and endors governor kohn   s recommend   i was worri about the numer denomin relationship   if the refer to    moder    as defin and clarifi by vinc key off the third quarter  then i   m concern   if  howev  we take the phraseolog that governor kohn suggest  i think it would be accept
thank you   well  thank you all veri much for a veri use  veri inform discuss   my bottom line is that we have not had a great deal of inform in the past five week on which to base a sharp chang either in polici or in this statement   therefor  i would propos that we make no chang in the feder fund rate target today  mani of the issu that were rais ye day were in some sens prospect   will the hous market declin further or stabil   will labor market strengthen or weaken   will growth slow or return to potenti   over the next six or seven week  until the next meet  we   ll be see the employ cost index  the third quarter gdp  two employ report  and a raft of data on hous price and other key indic   so i think it would be sensibl to think veri hard in decemb about whether a cours adjust is necessit both in term of polici and in term of the statement  i would just say that governor     s comment about the market was one that i   ve thought about myself   if the market disagre with you  do you tri to persuad them or not   i think the ideal thing is  again  to convey strong what our view are   in particular  both our object function and our outlook   but in general not to tri to direct influenc the posit of the yield curv becaus do so make us lose an import sourc of inform about the economi  howev  in the intermeet period we can continu with our verbal tighten in the sens that we can emphas our ongo concern about inflat and the pace of chang in inflat  and we can convey  those of you who believ this  that the risk to lower growth seem to have been at least somewhat moder  with respect to the languag  i   ve been tri to keep track here   laughter  but i think i have a clear major in the third section to strike    and of the price of energi and other commod      i heard no disagr there   the kohn amend seem to have a major  governor   rais some of the issu that i thought about in tri to distinguish the third quarter from the fourth quarter   i guess i   m okay with governor kohn   s suggest   is there anyon who would like to re enter this discuss after hear the whole thing   if not  i take the general thrust to be in favor of make that chang
is there a comment   yes  governor
this is certain someth that i am veri support of  but as i had mention  i was concern  as governor   and other were  about the interpret   would it make sens to use the word    pois    rather than    like     or do you think that would be a mistak
i think    pois    suggest in the futur even more than what we alreadi have   frank  this may or may not occur  but i think that second sentenc     seem like to expand at a moder pace     is actual a fair hawkish sen ent becaus it will tell the market that we are less concern about a meltdown in hous than mani peopl in the bond market appear to be   so i guess i don   t see the advantag of    pois      i think    moder     even without vinc   s veri appropri intervent    convey the sens of reason  near trend  certain greater than   percent   so i do think it   s a reason suggest   we will  of cours  be talk in subsequ session about how much more we want to go into forecast and how much more explicit we want to be about those thing in the futur  and that will be a point for signific discuss  on the risk assess  section    a few peopl express interest in b   but i think the overwhelm sen ent was that chang in this case would be somewhat riski  and so the status quo seem to have the major   again  it will be a veri interest intermeet period   we   ll see what the data are  and we   ll also see how the market respond to those data   as presid pool point out  if the data are except strong  i think the market will anticip our action and begin to move financi condit in the appropri direct   so that   s my recommend  would anyon like to comment   if not  ms     could you call the roll
i   ll be read the direct word and the risk assess for altern b from page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent     then the risk assess     nonetheless  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform     chairman bernank vice chairman   governor bie  governor kohn  governor   presid    governor    presid pianalto  presid pool  governor   presid
thank you veri much   it   s         whi don   t we take a yes yes yes yes yes no yes yes yes yes yes            fifteen minut coffe break and return for our discuss   coffe break
the meet can come to order   this portion of the meet is devot to a discuss of communic   governor kohn  could you lead us off
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to say just a few word by way of introduct about the expect for today and the process go forward   today we   re approach the general topic of communic  but also i think everyon agre that today   s discuss  in particular  is about more than communic   it   s about the regim  how we run polici  to an extent   so we will get into that  we   ve been approach this topic in a veri gradual  deliber way   these issu are import  and i don   t think there   s ani rush   there   s noth that we   re do now that is so sever broken that we have to fix it in the short run   we want to consid these issu  as we have discuss in the past few meet  on a number of front  and the area in which we may be chang   the numer specif of price stabil  the forecast  the announc  the minut   are all interrel   we want to end up with a program across all these thing that make sens  is coher  reinforc itself  and balanc all the various consider that we talk about at the last meet with principl that should guid these thing   we need to look at the individu piec and then the whole packag  make sure we understand the implic  and prepar the public and possibl the congress for some of the chang we might make   so i see this process as veri deliber in typic feder reserv style  and i think that is justifi in this case   one thing we   ve discov about communic polici is that  onc you make chang  they are realli hard to take back   so we need to get clear among ourselv what we are do  whi we are do it  and what the implic are for our own deliber  for our communic with the public  and for the materi we might get from the staff for meet  as for today  the issu on the tabl is the numer specif of price stabil     has circul a memo with a decis tree in it rais key question  and i hope we come out of this meet without a decis   i think make a decis today would be a mistak becaus what we   re go to talk about today will be relat to thing we   ll talk about in the futur   but if we could get a sens of the center of graviti of the committe on the various question that   has rais and other key issu that you want to rais in connect with this particular topic  then we will get some sens of how we want to move forward both in term of staff work and in term of futur committe discuss  we have a two day meet schedul for januari  and our think on the subcommitte was that we would devot that extra day to a discuss of the forecast and project   how can we make them potenti more use   what about how we explain them in the monetari polici report   how might they fit into the announc as well as into the monetari polici report  that area has a huge potenti for clarifi the committe   s think to the public  but it also has a lot of challeng regard how to go about that and preserv the divers of the committe  which so mani of you discuss at the last meet  if the center of graviti of the committe today is lean toward go forward with a numer specif of price stabil  we would expect to come back to the committe at the subsequ two day meet in march with some specif on how we would go there and some of the choic we would have   we   ll probabl need some staff analysi to back that up   we had a lot of analysi a year and a half ago or almost two year ago  but i   m sure we will need some more piec to back that up   so my bottom line here is that we   re just tri to get a sens of where the committe is go   this is a deliber and delib process that will take a number of month  if not quarter  to get to a place with which we   re comfort
thank you  governor kohn   let me just add a coupl of comment   i   ll talk more substant at the end of the round  but i just want to say that i   m look forward to the discuss   i think we   re go to learn a lot   our object should be to find a packag of measur that will improv our communic and our polici effect  but i hope also that we will find someth that will attract a broad support and consensus around the tabl becaus we realli need to have the whole committe behind this kind of thing  if at all possibl  i know the focus today is on explicit specif of a numer definit of price stabil  certain in my case  and i   m sure in mani of your case  the interest in that depend a lot on interact with other element of the packag   for exampl  project   if that   s import to you  i hope that you   ll refer to it becaus i do think we   ll have to proceed on some of these other element as well  let me conclud by reiter a point that governor kohn made  which is that we will not be make ani decis today   i ask you pleas not to give the impress to the outsid world that we have made decis becaus the process is go to be extend and gradual and we want to make sure both that all the piec of whatev it is we decid to do are coher and that we   re all comfort with the plan   so with that  i will simpli ask peopl to rais a hand if they   d like to speak  and we   ll go around the tabl
mr  chairman  may i ask one clarifi question   will someon remind us how the minut are go to character the convers we will have over the next sever meet   is it go to be a standard section like the one we use the last  e  which was pretti much without content    laughter
sinc you   re not like to be make ani decis  then there   s not much to convey in the minut other than that you had a full and frank exchang of view  laughter  regard your attitud toward articul a price object
good   so we   ll proceed on that understand   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   vinc reinhart did a good job of organ the issu in his three fundament question  but i   d revers the order   the last of his three question ask whether adopt a numer object would constrain or influenc subsequ policymak   i think we should start by ask the question what constraint we want to impos on ourselv and then work backward to what kind of inflat target would provid constraint that we view as use   in other word  what discret do we want to convinc peopl we will not use  or to put it yet anoth way  what monetari polici do we want to rule out for ourselv   it   s fair self evid that give up at least some monetari polici discret is use  and in fact we   ve done this   after all  our success in bring down inflat under chairmen volcker and  span was achiev by give up the discret to follow pre      style polici in which trend inflat drift upward and by give up the discret not to respond forc enough to inflat scare  regard an explicit inflat object  let me again start by consid the expect valu of one year inflat begin n year ahead  where n is  say  ten year or more   this number can be taken to repres expect long run inflat  and we can make it anyth we like   take that as a kind of postul   i don   t know of ani econom reason for expect one year inflat begin ten year from now to vari materi over  e   in fact  fluctuat in expect long run inflat imped the effect of financi market and reduc econom welfar   moreov  as a matter of public account in a constitut democraci  we owe it to the citizen of the unit state to tell them this simpl and yet veri import implic of how we conduct monetari polici  if onli to make the use of retir plan softwar easier   laughter   so i presum we   ll be abl to agre that we want to give up the discret to pursu monetari polici in which expect long run inflat vari over  e   ul  we need to choos a number for what measur inflat rate correspond to price stabil  beyond choos a specif number  howev  i think the more challeng choic come when we talk about  e period   over what  e period should we say that we intend to have inflat return on averag to our long run object   in other word  how fast should that converg take place   this question is critic and substant  and it   s go to requir care analysi and consider   on the one hand  the  e frame should not be too short   obvious  say that inflat should return to target next month would have us give up too much discret   on the other hand  set too long a  e frame will not do enough to stabil inflat expect   moreov  the longer the  e frame that we set for return inflat to target  the harder it   s go to be for the public to verifi our adher to an announc target and  thus  the longer it may take for us to establish the credibl of our announc intent  the approach i   ve outlin here by start at the back and invert vinc   s question   has some implic for vinc   s question     how should the fomc choos an inflat object   in general  sinc the econom benefit of numer object stem from reduc unnecessari uncertainti  we maxim those benefit when we make the choic of object more perman and less subject to reconsider by our futur selv   this suggest make a numer object as close as possibl to a onc and for all choic or decis  for exampl  by have the inflat target explicit vote on onc by the committe when adopt and not reconsid annual   relat to that  an explicit committe decis  it seem to me  would be prefer to amalgam member    forecast and prefer as in the relat opaqu humphrey hawkin process   the latter would have the potenti for generat object that vari over  e with committe membership  let me briefli make just a few other observ that i think are relat to this   first  after we initi announc our adopt of an inflat object  assum that   s what we do  we will need to act and speak in a way that   s consist with our announc   that   s sort of obvious  but our announc by itself is not go to convey instant credibl   it will be essenti that we follow through   second  while our announc will no doubt convey a general sens of what it will mean for conduct monetari polici  how we actual make monetari polici immedi follow the announc is go to demonstr to peopl what we think it mean   in other word  how it   s go to constrain us in practic   so we should think about adopt an inflat object as consist of two set of thing   an initi statement and the way we subsequ act and communic   and i think we should discuss those both   third  i   m in the camp that believ that adopt an explicit inflat object could improv interact between the staff and the committe by provid guidanc as to what analysi is most use to us   for exampl  the staff might routin report altern simul of more or less aggress approach to return inflat to target over  e  as in the bluebook   final  regard the question of whether unilater adopt is consist with our legisl framework  i was not privi to your privat convers last novemb  mr  chairman  but your nomin hear appear to provid the congress with an opportun to object  if they were so inclin  to unilater adopt of an inflat target by the feder open market committe   i take the fact that they did not do so  at least public  as evid that they would view a numer inflat object as broad consist with the wide latitud accord to us by our exist legisl mandat  i recogn that some cite the so call dual mandat as a reason to question whether we can adopt an inflat target without a more formal mandat to do so from the congress   but in the past we have made a great deal of effort to communic  to educ the public about the relationship between inflat and output  the two of our three mandat that enter in here  and to convinc peopl that we contribut best to keep output grow at a maxim rate by keep inflat low and stabl   moreov  we can make the averag inflat rate  long run expect inflat  anyth we want   that  sn   t hold for employ growth or output growth or the unemploy rate  those are my remark  mr  chairman
thank you  presid     presid
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s probabl best to state at the outset that i prefer a differ approach to quantit inflat guidelin  and that approach is actual touch on in vinc   s second question   the approach i would prefer is extend our econom forecast horizon   i   ll address this consider first and fill in some of the detail request by vinc and the subcommitte  and i hope we would consid this option go forward  move to an explicit numer specif of price stabil would be a veri big step for the feder reserv  for this committe   onc we do that  as don said  there   s no turn back   so this decis is extrem import for the committe   to date  when we   ve been face with major decis of this type  we have taken an increment approach  and i think that approach has serv us veri well   for exampl  we have increas transpar step by step over the past twelv year  and i think that approach has realli been quit success  so i   m attract to an intermedi step of extend our econom forecast horizon   i think do so would be a natur extens of what we alreadi do  and it would give us experi with mani aspect of the quantit inflat regim   my prefer would be to extend the econom forecast to a horizon that is at least five year ahead   at five year out  the inflat forecast should be close to our implicit inflat guidelin   output growth and the unemploy rate should move around onli with regard to structur chang  like demograph chang and total factor product growth  for exampl  i realiz that mani detail would have to be address to extend the forecast horizon  but figur them out and get experi with this approach would help us to learn what   s involv in move toward an explicit numer object or to learn whi not to go that far   first  what is the polici assumpt under the forecast   second  we current report gdp growth  the unemploy rate  and core inflat   so how mani variabl would we report   third  should we continu with our current approach of use a central tendenc or develop an integr consensus forecast   fourth  should we convey uncertainti band around that forecast at the longer horizon  i realiz these question are difficult for us to answer as a committe  but there are other tough challeng in move to an explicit specif of price stabil   for me the biggest issu is the dual mandat respons and our relationship to the congress   clear  a persuas case must be made that we will continu to fulfil our dual mandat respons   the challeng is how to make an explicit numer specif of price stabil oper compliant with the dual mandat  and to do so  we need to clarifi the flexibl of the  e period for bring inflat back to it target  as   just talk about   the amount of  e to do this would depend on the size of the current inflat deviat and the deviat from maximum sustain growth and employ   so i think the intermedi step of explain longer term forecast would help us learn how to communic these difficult dual mandat issu more effect  let me cycl back to the question in vinc   s memo   with regard to the first question  i think that further clarif of our price stabil object would be help and that extend the forecast horizon is a good first step   provid more inform about our long term inflat goal should help us maintain or even reduc the current low inflat risk premium in long term nomin financi contract and interest rate   these inflat premium are risk compens against the econom outcom that we have a lot to say about   the long term inflat inform will great facilit communic both within the committe and extern   i have express my view on explicit inflat object previous   just to summar  econom theori   not sharpli pin down the op um inflat rate  but my prefer is a rang of   to   percent for core pce inflat   my prefer is for core inflat to be     percent  in the center of that zone  when inflat is outsid the zone  polici should be broad design to move inflat back to the center of the zone   howev  the  e frame for core inflat to return to the center of the zone depend on a number of factor  like the dual mandat that i mention earlier  final  an import issu that we should discuss is whether to use core inflat or headlin inflat   other central bank use headlin inflat  and they seem to manag that well  i   m open to a discuss on this  but i think the communic issu are more complic for headlin inflat when it deviat so much for transitori reason than for core inflat   to conclud  i favor take the intermedi step of extend the forecast horizon to five year  and i   d like to leav open the question of whether to establish quantit guidelin until we get more experi with that approach
thank you   presid pool
thank you   i want to associ myself with comment that presid   offer   if we are go to do this  we ought to make it veri clean and explicit   i would not favor the approach that presid   offer becaus call the target a forecast leav too much room for it to chang over  e   i think that the central idea of a target is that it is a long term commit and not someth that ought to chang with each new fomc that come in  i believ that a coher polici for the fomc requir that the committe at least act as though it has an inflat target   we can   t have a coher discuss if     and i are both favor zero percent and other peopl are favor   percent   i have often said that i would like zero proper measur  but i think it is far more import to have ani reason  low rang and to say exact what that number is   i think we ought to be abl to do that  i have said that the target rang should be understood to be perman unless develop in the literatur and the theori suggest that it need to be recalibr   as a matter of govern  each incom fomc is go to have to reaffirm that rang  but i think it would be understood that there would not be a chang without substanti analysi and communic with the general public   in fact  the constraint that there would be communic with the general public would produc a veri  veri high hurdl for even discuss a chang   i think that would be appropri becaus discuss a chang on the insid and spring it on the general public would not reflect good monetari polici  i also believ that there   s good reason to adopt an inflat rang sooner rather than later   i realiz that we need a deliber process here  but i would argu for do it sooner  first of all  becaus our new chairman has view as an academ that are well known on this subject and becaus we have been discuss it for some  e   also  we have an opportun   whether it would be success i don   t know but we shouldn   t pass it by   to help deal with the current inflat environ   it is true that  if you take the staff model and arbitrarili dial down the inflat expect that are embed in the phillip curv  you get a veri nice result   general  the way that the simul go  the inflat expect term grind away over  e  and onli the creation of a period of slack and lower inflat gradual chang expect   if we can wind down inflat expect discret through this method  it produc a gain in welfar for the countri that i believ we should not light pass by  and so i would like to do it sooner rather than later  i   m not go to go into the detail about exact how we might do it   i   ve given a lot of thought to those detail and the way we talk about them   as part of the process of talk about a rang  i agre that a rang of   to   percent in core pce inflat would be a veri good place to go  but what do we mean if we say it appli to the medium term   i could imagin event that would make the medium term longer rather than shorter   just to give one exampl to get the flavor   if the countri went to a valu ad tax system  it would dial in price increas for quit some  e as a part of move to essenti a nation sale tax   that would be taken into account  and therefor  a rigid definit would not serv us well   we would need to be abl to explain whi the horizon would have to be elast under certain circumst  and i think we could do that when we had situat for which we could provid solid analysi   thank you
thank you   governor
some peopl who know me quit well have been surpris at how brief some of my statement have been   so in this case i hope you   ll indulg me a littl    laughter
the good  e are over    laughter
as mani of you know  i have thought quit a lot about this issu and have written quit a lot about it   i   ve also been think a lot about it recent  particular in the context of differ polit environ and structur of committe in which to oper   i just finish a report on sweden   sweden is not the same as the unit state  and the riksbank is not the same as the feder reserv  so that will reflect some of my think that may be a littl bit differ from what you have seen befor  let me go down the decis tree  which i thought was excel   the committe and the staff did a superb job in frame it in a way i find veri use  so i am go to proceed exact along the line that they suggest   the first question is  is an explicit numer specif of price stabil help   you are not go to be surpris at my answer   it   s a veri strong    yes      i could go on and on about this becaus i have written so much about it  but i   ll tri to be veri brief on these issu   the key to success monetari polici is have a strong nomin anchor   the kind of success that we   ve seen in central bank throughout the world  which would not have been predict ten or fifteen year ago  is realli remark  and it is becaus have a strong nomin anchor allow the market to do a lot of the work for you   but also what   s veri import to emphas is that you don   t have to do it with a long run numer inflat goal   the feder reserv has been veri success in do it with an individu   so i don   t see that this has been a problem in recent year   i have to tell you that  mayb becaus i am here  i feel we are veri lucki to have had the chairmen we have had   it could have come out quit differ   have an explicit numer definit of price stabil  a long run goal for inflat  mean that the nomin anchor is less depend upon who the chairman is  and i think that   s actual someth that is veri good   it   s true in the past that we have not had a problem with that  with volcker   span  and now chairman bernank
you did befor that though
but we did have a problem befor that  and that is exact my point   in fact  not onli might you not get the right person in the futur   and that could have happen this  e around  but we were lucki in that regard   but even when you have the right person  the transit to a new chairman has been veri complic   in particular  peopl might not rememb this  but when  span came in  there was an inflat scare in the bond market   long bond rate went up about     basi point  and the bond market tank   i think that there was also some confus in the market when our current chairman took this offic about whether he was a hawk or a dove on control inflat   luckili  i think that confus has dissip  but i think it actual made your life  ben  a littl more complic than you would have chosen it to be   so the way i think about this is that i would like the transit to a new chairman to be veri bore  and have an explicit numer inflat goal for the long run would help in that regard  clear  there are also the standard advantag that have an explicit long run numer inflat goal would clarifi communic with the public  the market  and the politician   it increas transpar and account   what is not discuss as much   but i think bill pool hit on it   is that it could clarifi and make more coher discuss insid the fomc   i would realli like to know  when somebodi is advoc a certain set of the feder fund rate  what his or her inflat goal is       has dissent in this particular meet   i have an idea whi you did becaus i think you have been clear on what your goal is   but if i were confus about that  i would have a harder  e understand whi you   re take the posit that you   re take   we have seen evid in look at how central bank oper that have an explicit goal has actual improv the natur of the deliber in these committe  anoth thing that is veri import is that have an explicit numer goal would allow us to think about the way of do monetari polici  which is becom better understood in the academ literatur on op  polici   the way we think about do op  polici is look at what is an appropri inflat path   in particular  have a long run goal that you know you   re head to and then talk about the path to that goal is exact the right way to think about polici  let me tell you where i would like to head ul  and then where i think the committe should head in the short run   there   s a slight differ becaus of some consider i   m go to bring up   i   d like to see in the long run exact what bill pool and     mention  which is the fomc   s agre on an explicit long run numer inflat goal and do it in term of say that we are defin what we mean by price stabil   so i am in full agreement with you that we should ul  head there   then the discuss of monetari polici  both insid and outsid  should focus on what the appropri path is to get there and how long it should take   this approach is consist with what we have learn in term of modern monetari polici analysi   it is the way we have learn to think about this and  by the way   is consist with the kind of polici for the most part that have been pursu by the feder reserv over the past ten year   a key part of the success of the feder reserv   s oper is that  in practic  we have actual been oper in that way  when you have such an approach  there are four basic principl regard the way you think about chang the path that you think is appropri in term of achiev the long run goal  first of all  we ask how far away we are current from the long run goal   so where we are realli matter   second  the natur of the shock  whether they   re transitori or perman  is clear import   third  it is veri import to be awar of how big the project output gap are becaus we should care about output fluctuat  someth i will turn to in a second   final  we also want to be veri concern about financi stabil issu becaus  if someth is occur on the financi stabil front  we have to be abl to deal with it   this kind of approach would allow us to have a concern about busi cycl fluctuat  which i think is key for a central bank   it would also allow us to chang polici in respons to financi instabl concern   it should allow us to deal with the ltcm type of situat  in which there was a potenti small probabl of veri disastr thing happen   in fact  it should be consist with what  span call the risk manag approach   so i think it is veri import to understand that we   re not talk about go to a rigid form of inflat target if we pursu this goal  now let me turn to the second issu on the decis tree  which is how we express an explicit nomin definit of price stabil   i want to discuss some subtleti that realli do concern me right now  which mean that i   m go to shift slight from where i want to get in the long run to where i think we should head in the intermedi term   four critic consider worri me  the first is the polit process   it is veri import that we do not get too far ahead of the congress on this   it is extrem import that we express a further definit of what we mean by price stabil in a way that is absolut consist with the feder reserv act and with the law and with the dual mandat   this consider becam veri clear to me in look at what happen dure the tes oni that the chairman gave when he took his posit   it was clear a central issu in the tes oni that i gave   it   s veri clear that this process is part of the american system and that it differ from mani other countri   so that   s consider one  consider two is that it   s extrem import that we not be consid to be what mervyn king art has call    inflat nutter      the british have better train in english than we have   they alway have better phrase for thing   but we need to make veri clear that  in fact  we are not inflat fanat   a key part of the success of the feder reserv has been base on the fact that the feder reserv is clear perceiv by the public  the politician  and the market as have a weight on output fluctuat in our decis   what is also an import part of our success is that  in contrast to mani other central bank  we have been will to express our concern about output fluctuat and the busi cycl   so in my past write  i have talk about the dirti littl secret of central bank  which is that most central bank are not will to admit that they care about output fluctuat   i think this is actual a serious problem for them  luckili  we don   t have that problem  but if we move toward an explicit nomin long run inflat goal  we need to be clear that we differ in that regard from other central bank   the issu here is that this is a primari reason that we   ve had the support of the public and the politician   we certain don   t want to lose that   that   s the second consider  the third consider is that we differ from other countri in a major way  and when i look at the riksbank versus the feder reserv  i see how differ we are   we have nineteen particip make decis about monetari polici  and that   s extrem unusu   the onli other compar situat is the european system of central bank   our situat is differ not onli becaus there are nineteen peopl but also becaus the particip resid in differ locat  now there are six but there will be seven of us exist in hous  and there are twelv of you who factor in differ locat and have a veri differ role   you are ceo of an organ  and you have to communic differ with the public than the governor do   i realli understand this becaus i   ve been on both side  have been at a reserv bank and also here   that situat actual make thing veri  veri differ  the fourth consider is that the feder reserv has been extrem success   that give peopl confid in us and tell us that the more evolutionari we can be the better off we are  this consider is import in two sens   one is that we want to say that we have done a good job in the past  and we are go to continu to do a good job in the futur   thus we build on the credibl that we   ve establish over the past fifteen year or so   the second sens is polit  we realli want to promot polit support  and look as though we   re do someth that is depart from where we were is not a good way to move forward  now that i have given you basic principl  let me put forth a propos   not one to be vote on today but where i would like to see us head   although in the long run i would like the fomc to be abl to sit down and agre on what our long run inflat goal should be in term of a specif number  i would argu that the four consider i brought up suggest that we need to go a bit more slowli to that path   so here is what i would suggest   as part of our report procedur that we do for our monetari polici report twice a year  we produc forecast   in a similar vein  i think it would be veri effect for all nineteen particip  when they are give forecast  to say what their definit of price stabil are and  in fact  provid that number   but i would recommend that this be done onli onc a year  not twice a year  what are the advantag of do this   one advantag is that i think we are fair close or will becom fair close to have agreement on it   i would argu that the number will not be that differ among us  and provid our number will make it easier for us to come to consensus in the futur   so it is an intermedi step to get us there in the long run   anoth advantag has to do with the fact that we have nineteen particip   i think it   s veri import that all particip are heard from and that we don   t encroach on their particular view until we can actual build a consensus   so it realli fit in with the issu that there are nineteen peopl in differ locat with differ job to do   also  it   s evolutionari  it realli is not a radic departur   it   s veri much in the spirit of say that we have a dual mandat   we   ve actual had individu talk about comfort zone and so forth   we   re just formal the process  and we   re do it in a way that is a step forward in transpar  so it realli move us veri much in the direct we have been go   the bottom line here is that it get us close to have an agreement   i think that is not too far away  i do want to mention the onc a year issu  which would come up if the fomc actual vote on this   i think peopl worri about that veri much becaus   and i agre strong with presid pool and presid     we do not want to have the number chang veri much over  e    we could also talk about some t i issu that are creat by bad inflat expect dynam  but not now becaus they are more complic    in practic  we have actual seen someth that give us a lot of inform about this issu becaus one of the concern that peopl had when inflat target start was that it would be decid by govern   the problem with govern is that we know what politician are like   they have to get elect  and they think short term  this is one reason that we like to insul the central bank from the polit process   there was then a concern that  if the govern provid a number  it will do so opportunist   we have not found that to happen  and the reason it has not happen is that provid a number is so transpar   when you actual have to give a number  you have to have a darn good reason for chang it   in fact  i think it would be veri unlik that we would find this committe  even if we did this on an annual basi  want to chang it   transpar realli has huge benefit   it   s remark that  when there have been such chang  they have clear been for technic reason and have been in the right direct   in one case  the bank of england chang the number becaus of a chang in the calcul of their price index   it was done in the case of the reserv bank of new zealand  with some resist from the reserv bank  but they agre that the rang they went to   eventu to   to   from zero to     was a better number for them   thus  i think that concern is realli not go to be a problem even if we do this onc a year  i have an asid that i wasn   t go to mention  but i think it   s import to mention   it has to do with the issu of potenti gdp and potenti employ or a discuss of the nairu  and it relat a bit to presid     s suggest  which i do not think is the right way to go   if we provid inform about our explicit numer inflat goal  it   s veri import to explain whi do so should not drive us to provid a similar definit of potenti employ  potenti output  or the nairu for sever reason   the first is that it   s extrem hard to know what the correct valu are for those number  and they   re extrem hard to es  in real  e  as we know   i don   t even know what they are conceptu   this is a big issu in the academ literatur  we have a good exampl of this issu right now  which is that the  book has a veri differ view on this from what we find in the privat market   you see much slower growth of potenti gdp than the market do   ani suggest that we have someth like an employ goal would be veri  veri damag to us   we also know that  when the feder reserv has act this way  which they did in the      s  it led to disastr outcom  burn focus too much on output gap  and it got the fed into a lot of troubl   this find come from work done by your staff   in particular  athanasio orphanid  in contrast  it is import to clarifi that the reason for the big differ between defin price stabil and defin employ goal is that we know from a welfar viewpoint it  sn   t matter much whether we are off by    or even     basi point   i think this is the point that bill made   he like zero  take into account measur error  but if we said it was     basi point more than that  i don   t think it would be that big a deal   we know that what is realli import is to have a number to pin down inflat expect  and not the specif number   that is absolut not true of an employ goal   so it is veri import to get that across  and it is the reason i react to presid     s comment about this issu of talk about potenti  although i think that he agre with me  it is also one reason that i have a concern with the propos that presid   has made   first of all  i don   t think it is explicit enough   but i also have the problem that  if you talk about a five year inflat forecast as a goal  peopl start to interpret that as a goal  and if you talk about a five year gdp forecast  they   ll also interpret that as a goal   i think it lead exact to a lack of clariti that will get us into troubl   so we need to be much clearer on this   if you ask me my five year inflat forecast  that might not be the same thing as my view of the appropri level of price stabil becaus i have to think about what everybodi els   s decis are go to be  who may be the next chairman  or whatev  anoth issu  which is not the main subject today  is import to discuss becaus it may affect what the staff has to do   i have anoth propos  which is complet independ of our decis to go toward an explicit inflat goal  it is that market would tremend benefit from more inform about our forecast  which are now twice a year  and to have that inform four  e a year   by the way  this propos came out veri strong in the   survey  which i   m sure you   re all familiar with   they were quit in favor of it   again  this could be done in an evolutionari fashion   we have a report procedur on monetari polici  which we are mandat to carri out twice a year   by say that we   re will to do it four  e a year  we are actual say that  in the spirit of cooper with the congress  we are tri to be even more help   so i think it would fit in veri natur   what it would requir  of cours  is a littl more work on the part of all of us becaus we   d have to do it four  e a year rather than twice a year   but i   m will to do that  and i think other peopl would be will to do it as well  anoth key issu is that we need to great improv the qualiti of the written document that go with this process   the current monetari polici report is realli terribl   it   s dull  it   s sex made bore   i don   t want to critic too much  but it is    laughter
tell us what you realli think    laughter
if it were a textbook  and i can tell you i know a lot about this  you wouldn   t sell one copi    laughter   so it   s a problem   we see this in practic in that the market pay veri littl attent to the monetari polici report   a featur of inflat target regim is that they produc someth call inflat report    by the way  i would never want to call it that in the unit state  i would want to stick with monetari polici report   it is a good name  and it fit into this evolutionari view    they have improv the qualiti of these document so that they receiv a lot of attent   those report have becom extrem import vehicl for get the central bank   s view across to the public and for help the public understand what the central bank are do  they actual also provid support for the central bank to pursu op  polici   so improv these document would have tremend benefit  and i think it could be done  and i actual think the staff would probabl enjoy do them   well  mayb not    laughter   you   d be work harder  but that   s whi you get paid the big buck   i think you   d actual enjoy do this  in the inflat report  they   ve move to use the best textbook write techniqu   nice color  box   ben and i have been involv in this process   it   s the reason that i can afford my spous  it   s a chang in the natur of the way this is done  but i think it   s veri doabl and will have a lot of benefit  the last box in the decis tree is technic issu   that   s not what we   re here to discuss today   there are a lot of them   how should we report the particip    forecast  if we go that rout   what price index should we use   we would have to agre at least on what price index and whether it is a core or a headlin measur befor provid our view about what price stabil mean   would it be a point or a rang   what should be the form of the monetari polici report document   also  what   econom analysi tell us about the op  level of long run inflat rate so that we can actual think about the sens of it   even though i   ve written a lot about this  i would like to think about all of it from scratch  and i would encourag the committe to do that as well   in that regard  i would like to have the staff do even more work   the staff would need to provid us with a set of document to get us to rethink these issu   there are a lot of technic issu   the document that you provid for the januari      meet were excel   but i would basic have a complet relook becaus i think there are some chang that we should be awar of  and then we can decid on what index   some of us may chang our view on exact what number we think is the right number for the long run inflat goal  if we go this rout  we might tri a dri run on some of these thing becaus of what governor kohn mention   onc you go this rout  it   s not easi to go back  so you had better get it right   we might want to tri dri run of what procedur we would use to provid inform   if we have a monetari polici report document  we might tri dri run that we would actual discuss in this committe   i think by do that we would be more like to get it right   anyway  i am sorri to have gone on so long   i have now made up for the fact that i have been quieter other  e  and i   ll tri to be quiet in the futur if i can   thank you veri much
thank you   presid
it probabl come as no surpris to most of you that i share a lot of the view express by    bill  and    and so i   ll tri to reinforc some and mayb fine tune a coupl about which i might have some addit thought   i do applaud the chang that the fomc has made   over the past decad  in particular   it has enhanc it credibl   it has improv it communic and it transpar about the policymak process  and i think that has been a great step forward   in principl  i view the announc of a long term numer definit of price stabil or long term inflat target  howev you want to think about it  as anoth import step in that direct  and in that sens  the announc is go to be evolutionari rather than revolutionari   i also believ that it will fundament improv the policymak process without unduli restrict our flexibl to respond to crise  i think it is often import to remind the public and other that we   the feder reserv  the central bank   have the uniqu respons to maintain price stabil   no other agenc of the govern is charg with maintain price stabil  and nobodi els can do it for us   so in some sens  when you think about mandat and what our respons are  we are the onli vehicl for achiev that  specifi our long term price stabil object numer would help coordin expect by reduc the public   s uncertainti about our goal   long run expect would becom less respons to short term inflat  therefor probabl less persist   this should enhanc monetari polici flexibl in mani way   thus  rather than be unduli constrain  it could add to our flexibl   but that   s not to say that a numer definit would not influenc our policymak  inde  there would be littl point in specifi a target if we thought that it wouldn   t   the numer goal would be a long run anchor   the nomin anchor to our monetari polici   it would help coordin our own discuss of appropri polici and serv as the guidepost for our polici deliber  at  e a policymak would like to deviat from the commit to long term price stabil  the so call  e consist problem   a precis definit of what we mean by price stabil  howev  would make it harder to succumb to the temptat to deviat and therebi would improv polici outcom   what we know in the context of most polici is that welfar under form of full commit general exceed welfar under form of discret   now  that   not mean that there will not be except unforeseen event or event with such low probabl of occur that reaction to them would not have been pre specifi but would requir deviat from polici as usual   but these special circumst are easili recogn   in such instanc  such as      and other crise  the fomc will be abl to react appropri  we are fortun  as   point out  that a number of other central bank in the develop world have set numer inflat object and inflat target   numer specif has been view quit favor by those bank  and it seem to produc a moder improv in monetari polici   there is evid that inflat expect have becom better anchor in these countri and that inflat outcom have improv without ani negat consequ for output growth  it can be reason argu that the fomc has implicit target inflat over the past ten year   twelv month averag of core cpi inflat have remain insid a band of   to   percent  i believ  given the shock that have hit the economi over this period  that has not been just good luck   rather  it has been good polici   thus  an explicit set of a numer object would be evolutionari and not revolutionari for the fed  now  i have not come to firm conclus about the precis formul of the price stabil object   we   ll need to consid   as has been allud to   which index  what period over which to defin the goal  and whether we should choos a rang or a point for the definit   the choic  to me  are interrel   for exampl  a long horizon would mean a tighter rang and perhap even a point   a long horizon make the choic between headlin and core inflat less import   ani propos will have it pros and con   for exampl  specifi a rang may be prefer if it communic explicit upper and lower bound  presum abov or below which we would say we are definit away from price stabil   of cours  becaus of inflat dynam  to maintain inflat in that rang  policymak would have to take action befor inflat move abov or below those bound   on the other hand  a rang might induc some complac on the part of policymak so that they would not feel ani urgenc to take action until inflat move outsid the rang  at which point it might be too late or at least more cost to restor price stabil and reestablish our credibl   if so  a point es  actual may be best becaus it would forc the polici to be more explicit about whi or whi not ani deviat should be toler and for how long  as i said  i   ve not realli come to a firm conclus about a particular formul in that regard  presum  decid on a definit of price stabil would entail es  measur bias in particular index   robert gordon in recent work es  that the bias in the headlin cpi is about     percent per year    there are like differ es  of the bias   presum have rang will help us determin what those definit might be   if we decid and agre upon a bias  let   s say it was      should that be our target   yes  if price stabil is our goal   howev  in this regard  i agre with bill     and   that have a uniqu number may  in fact  be more import than what that number is  so long as it is within a fair narrow rang  i think that this problem is a littl more complex becaus we also have to consid the view of model in which there is actual op  inflat   mani model of op  monetari polici suggest  depend on the exact formul of the model  that the op  rate of inflat fall in a rang of slight negat to slight posit   thus  price stabil may be desir  but it may not be op  in some circumst  final  monetari polici is a committe decis   we may differ on our forecast  our model  and our understand of the channel through which monetari polici affect the economi  but it seem to me that the committe must agre on it inflat object   i don   t see  as has been discuss  how we can formul coher polici if we disagre on the numer long run goal we are tri to achiev   in help communic and the public   s understand of polici  individu definit would creat much too much confus   this problem is evid today   for exampl  there seem to be a disconnect between the market   s view of long run inflat  which accord to survey and financi market seem to remain around     percent  and the statement made by mani of us on this committe who seem to be comfort with   to   percent   do the market not believ that we are serious commit to that goal   are we realli commit to the goal of   percent or below   by public commit to a specif target  we might  i hope  obtain greater congruenc of our goal and the market   s expect   of cours  we have to rememb that we will not succeed at all unless our action are consist with our state object  let me make two realli quick point about communic   first  as i said earlier  some  when i   ve read past fomc statement i   ve said     well  whi don   t you just say what you mean      i agre with     i don   t realli like    potenti output    either   i think it   s import that we strive toward achiev a communic strategi in which we are not tri either to confus the market or to send signal but are basic state what our forecast are  what our polici object are  and how we propos to get to them   second  i   d like to reinforc the idea   and   spent a good deal of  e talk about this so i won   t elabor on it   of a document like an inflat report   call it a monetari polici report   part of our communic strategi would be great enhanc by our abil to communic on a more regular basi what our view about the economi are and where we think it is go   as a way of communic  such a report would be veri valuabl   it would be t i becaus it need to be a report of this committe and not necessarili of the staff   how we mesh what the staff   with what the committe think can be a veri t i process   so i recogn that get to that report entail some discuss about how to proceed  what constitut the report  and how we communic the committe   s view independ or how we aggreg them   thus  i appreci     s argument that mayb we could have some dri run in think about how we aggreg our view   what variabl we need to put in the report  which are the critic one  and what polici assumpt underli some of those forecast are all veri subtl and complex issu  i taught in a busi school for most of my career   thirti year of teach busi student   one thing i said to student was that the tough part of manag often wasn   t figur out where you want to go  the tough part often was figur out how you get there from where you are   inde  in run an organ  in mani case that is where you run into most of your problem and where you step into the biggest pothol   therefor  i   m veri sensit that  if we agre that we want to get to some goal  the t  is figur out how we get there from where we are  that is critic  the last thing i   d like to comment on relat to the so call dual object and     s comment about the import of the central bank   s concern for output and employ  the    dirti littl secret    as you refer to it   that we don   t have to worri about it becaus the public know that we are concern about it   but i think we have to be veri care in our communic becaus i worri some  that the public   s view of monetari polici is often that we can do anyth  and at the slightest deviat or problem  we some  step into the hole of lead them to believ that we can either fine tune or achiev object that we realli can   t achiev   so in the context of this discuss  we need to tri to communic to the public that  although we may have a dual mandat in some respect  our abil to achiev certain object is veri  veri limit   we   ve come danger close in this period to go from a posit in which monetari polici was never consid to matter for anyth to one in which it   s all that matter   our communic can play a role in which we are a bit more humbl and admit what we can do and what we cannot do  we should be veri care not to lead the public along a path that suggest we can actual accomplish thing that most of us around the tabl don   t believ we realli can   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
well  it will probabl come as no surpris to anybodi around this tabl that i don   t agre with some of the thing that have been said  though i have a great deal of respect for the opinion that have been express   i want to go through the question in a somewhat differ order   first of all  whether or not explicit numer specif of price stabil is help  second  whether i think it would affect polici set  and then third  if we   re go to do it  some begin thought   and they are onli begin thought   on how we would do it  is an explicit numer specif of price stabil help   my answer to the question hasn   t chang much sinc we last talk about this in februari        i don   t think it is   base on the evid then and the updat sinc  i don   t believ an explicit numer specif of price stabil would have suffici benefit to u s  policymak to outweigh the potenti cost involv in either actual take our eye off the other goal of polici or be seen as like to do so   there is no doubt that such a specif has been use in countri with a track record of veri high inflat or no central bank credibl   i think it also was use in the format of the ecb  sinc there was a new central bank with no track record   in the case of both the bank of england and the bank of japan  it was part and parcel of their gain independ  which was import in a number of other way   so i don   t think the situat in other countri necessarili appli to the unit state  and i don   t think we have a good bodi of evid that they   ve done with inflat target  howev they   ve been set  ani better than we   ve done over the past whatev relev  e period it is  it is assert that an inflat target of some sort enhanc the effect of monetari polici by help to generat market expect and action that are consist with the goal of the central bank   but it   s not clear to me that our current process  sn   t do that about as well as it can be done while leav some room for the flexibl that i believ is vital to the polici process  now if we adopt  and we probabl are like to adopt  some form of price stabil specif  what   that do to polici set   if such a target or goal is to be credibl  then market ought to have some confid that the feder reserv will react in predict way each  e the goal is either met or miss   but we don   t have just one goal   we have two goal  and how we react to inflat read or forecast will depend import on the trajectori we see for econom growth  output gap  unemploy  howev we want to phrase it   thus  the set of an object for just one of our goal could result in somewhat less transpar about what our polici action right now might actual be  even wors  have such an object could result in actual make polici in a way that is insuffici sensit to growth  everi paper we have receiv on this topic has stress that aspect of set a so call flexibl inflat goal can reduc the possibl cost of confus about our commit to dual goal   specif  we could set a wide rang   we could choos a long period over which to attain the target   we could choos an inflat measur less subject to volatil  particular over the long run   we could communic extens about all aspect of our forecast  et cetera  et cetera   but in the end  if everyth about the goal is so flexibl or need continu communic  how   it  in fact  deliv it benefit  i realli wonder what problem we   re tri to solv   the communic subcommitte ask for our perspect on the goal of communic   i believ we can improv how and what we communic  but i don   t see that the effort to communic better by definit has to includ an explicit numer target for inflat   for the best part of twenti five year  no matter how we have measur inflat  it has move down   gdp has falter onli occasion  and unemploy has realli been the envi of the develop world   this was done without an explicit inflat target  and i wonder whether one would have help much   i also wonder whether we know enough about what the under inflat mechan is within our economi to lead us to certainti about what the correct rang is   is it zero proper measur  or is some level of inflat  low and stabl  actual good for the way the economi function   i am not sure i know the answer to that question  which make me hesit to put a numer rang around my goal  final  we do need to consid the like interact with the congress as we set a target for one of our goal but not anoth   in my view  the congress should be veri interest in the short run tradeoff between that target and growth in unemploy   it might be hard  for exampl  to explain the virtu of a goal that   s focus on a     percent midpoint rather than the current inflat of     percent   over the long run  i think either one of these number could be consist with solid growth   but in the short run  move from one level to anoth would requir some sacrific  and i think the long run chart in the bluebook show that   there   s no research i know of that prove a lower rate is clear prefer  though inflat stabil at ani low level might be   so how is the sacrific justifi   what els might that interact with the congress provok   the possibl for unintend consequ is clear  now  i think i   m as commit to be account  credibl  and transpar as anybodi els around this tabl   howev  i believ that we   ve achiev those goal in spade and that an explicit numer target has the potenti to do some harm   the possibl benefit of set a numer target seem to me to lie sole in the advantag to some of be abl to point to a number rather than think of price stabil as the absenc of concern about price in everyday busi and consum activ   a number convey precis  but that precis itself could backfir by seem to requir a polici respons that may not be op   that probabl cover the question about whether a numer price specif is help and the relat question   about whether the quantif of the long run object would serv as a new influenc on polici set   i think it would serv as a new influenc on polici set  frank  i don   t find it hard to understand where peopl around this tabl come from at present or where they have come from over the past thirteen year   i think that if you set out a numer target  it will chang the dynam around the tabl  and i   m not sure in a posit direct  okay   i know i am in a small minor   i know most peopl see onli good or at least noth bad come from an explicit specif of price stabil   i know the decis over  e is like to be to pursu such a specif   if that happen  here   s a general idea of how i think it should be done   first  i agre with don and  i think    as well   one ought to approach this process veri care   onc in the public domain  an inflat goal  target  specif  whatev you want to call it  will be there and will be veri difficult to take away   i believ the market at present think we   re after the lowest feasibl level of inflat that we can get consist with a reason level of growth   onc a number or a rang is attach  market percept might chang in unforese way   when or if we take this step  it will be veri hard  if not imposs  to revers it  so we had better be both thought and care about do it   so i like idea such as     s that there are way we can evolv to this and we can take some dri run or intermedi step that give us a sens of what the longer run might be  second  i haven   t given a lot of thought to the possibl of each member of the committe set his or her own goal  but it is consist with my understand of the way the committe is intend to function  with each of us bring our own thought and framework to the tabl   over  e  the result divers of perspect is vital to the way the committe work   thus there is some appeal to the direct in which   was go  which is  as a first step  dissemin perhap twice a year or more frequent the rang of fomc particip    person definit of price stabil in conjunct with their near term forecast   i wouldn   t extend the forecast   the differ between the two could well indic polici concern even without fulli specifi the under polici path in the forecast   i don   t know if that   s where you were head     but i see some valu in that step as a matter of evolut   perhap a key reason i seem to think more about each particip   s own price stabil definit is that it allow for some uncertainti about how the polici discuss will come out   mayb unlik other  i see some polici uncertainti as a good thing   most of the  e we cannot forecast exact what the committe will find necessari to do  and i think we should avoid give the appear that polici move are alway known month in advanc when they aren   t   make it clear that nineteen differ perspect and definit are involv could  i think  contribut to that  final  regardless of whether a numer specif of price stabil is set for the committe as a whole or reflect a rang of our individu prefer  the target specif need to be a rang rather than a singl number   i think of it as an umbrella rather than a target   we should use a measur base on either the headlin or the core cpi on the ground that most peopl know what that is   it is part of the life that they live day by day  and so it reson in our communic   we should set a medium run to long run target of five year or so over which the specif would be met if the relev rang were exceed   i think that give us enough flexibl to deal with crise of one sort or anoth   we should do whatev we can to make sure that we  the central bank  and not the congress  set the target if we   re go to have a target   that   s as far as i can go
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   in august  this committe discuss the goal for our polici communic and general agre that one goal is to improv the effect of monetari polici and the perform of the economi by help agent generat well inform expect consist with the goal and strategi of the central bank   the other goal is to enhanc the account  credibl  and democrat legi aci of an independ central bank  i think that an explicit numer specif of price stabil can help us achiev these goal   i   m in favor of establish an explicit numer object by a vote of the committe  but i recogn that we have mani issu to resolv befor we would feel readi to implement such a practic   the econom research in support of explicit numer object is encourag but nowher near conclus   the same can be said about the experi of other central bank   so  unfortun  there is no singl off the shelf solut for us   our challeng is to craft our own framework   one that   s achiev  understand  and believ   fortun  there are step that we can take to move us in that direct   a signific intern benefit to adopt an explicit numer object is that it would help communic within the committe   at a minimum  know each other   s inflat object would help us understand when we disagre  whether the disagr concern our object or the mean of achiev those object   extern  greater specif could help us anchor the public   s inflat expect   in our current environ  with inflat low and credibl high  i don   t see the extern benefit as be especi larg   howev  histori   have a way of repeat itself  if we had to face condit like those of the     s or the     s again  have an establish practic of achiev explicit inflat object could prove help  and it could be a potent insur polici   so the benefit of have an explicit numer object will be signific greater dure those period of extrem inflationari or deflationari pressur than they are today  of cours  as other have indic  an explicit numer object has potenti cost  we might want to deviat from our object for good reason but feel constrain from do so  here i   m encourag by the experi of other foreign central bank  which suggest that flexibl is avail   there is also the potenti loss of credibl from not achiev the object when we should be achiev it  but that is a cost that i think we should dedic ourselv not to incur   our challeng is to construct a framework in which we have the flexibl to make small deviat from a numer object   but not larg and persist one   two other potenti cost matter to me   first  i want to pursu this option within the mandat that we have from the congress today   i   m not sure that invit new legisl would prove  on balanc  to be construct   second  as we explor our option for joint establish an explicit numer object  i would like to see the independ contribut of individu committe member preserv  turn to     s question about how we should choos the inflat object  i prefer  as i said earlier  ul  to arriv at the object by a committe vote rather than by establish individu object   i think the public would be least confus by a simpl statement from the committe that say it oper definit of    price stabil    is x percent  with a rang  and that specifi the particular index we   re use and the  e horizon by which we   re tri to achiev the object   in other word  this approach would be the most understand   in choos the x percent with the rang and the  e horizon  we   ll have to be sure that we achiev the test of achiev and believ   we might benefit from have a period dure which the public can get more comfort with this option   an express that i like is    make hast slowli      one step for get us start would be to survey the committe member about their work definit of    price stabil    and to publish the distribut along with our semiannu econom project   obvious  a potenti pitfal of this practic  as other have mention  is that eventu peopl are go to know that we   re do this and they   re go to want to know our specif individu object   so as we move forward with that practic  we   re go to have to be awar of that  turn to     s third question      will quantif serv as a new influenc in set polici       i think that we can expect that have an explicit numer object could chang polici set in way that we can   t forese   but i can also see some intent chang to the polici set process   first and foremost  be more explicit about our inflat object will shift the  e horizon of our analysi and our discuss at our meet into the futur a coupl of year  which i think is a good thing   a shift in the focus on the medium term would lead us to spend less  e talk about where we are relat to the short term  book baselin and to spend more  e talk about whether we agre or disagre about issu like product trend  the transmiss mechan  the cost of inflat  inflat measur  and so on   these are now regard as special topic  but i think they would becom more normal fare under a new regim  i like governor     s and presid     s suggest to improv the monetari polici report to the congress and to the public   onc we start to discuss these longer term trend  they could be includ in the report  and their inclus would make the report more benefici   the posit i   ve taken on these specif question are posit that i had befor i walk into this room  but i recogn that my view are evolv as i   m listen to some of my colleagu    comment on these issu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start at the top of the sheet but then jump around   so the answer to the first question is    yes      i do think that an explicit numer specif of price stabil would be help and that the fomc should move toward such a specif   i alway thought this step was a close call in term of it cost and benefit   there have been a coupl of develop sinc januari        when we last discuss the topic  that have led me to chang my posit to favor this step   first  we   ve been through two more episod   in the spring of       and the spring of         when a surg in actual inflat rais question in financi market about our intent and expect   in both case  higher inflat expect did not persist   but make our long term intent clearer should reduc the risk that temporarili heighten inflat pressur result in increas in expect that becom more perman and more cost to revers   a coupl of studi in the past two year have tend to support the hypothesi that a numer specif might help tie down expect at least a littl within the financi market   second  i think a lack of clariti on this question has increas muddi discuss in this committe and communic with the public   within the committe  it has some  been difficult to discern whether differ viewpoint reflect divers percept of the cours of inflat and econom growth or of the desir end point or path for inflat   the public   not know whether the comfort zone enunci by various committe member reflect the view of the committe or onli those of the individu   come to an agreement on an end point and on the role that end point should play in polici and announc that agreement should help our discuss and enhanc the public   s understand of our intent  have said that  i think we need to recogn that ani explicit inflat specif is like to exert some pull on polici   it will not simpli institution the volcker or  span polici regim  as is some  said   it cannot help but to increas the committe   s focus on particular numer outcom and project for inflat   that   s good to the extent that it reduc the odd on a repeat of the cumul error of the     s  but it also may make it more difficult for the committe to take action that might be perceiv at the  e as inconsist with achiev price stabil in the next few year but that were still in the public interest   say  by counter financi distress  as in       or by move veri  veri aggress against econom weak  as in       when core inflat was actual rise   a risk manag approach to polici may well call for aim away from the price stabil object from  e to  e  i continu to believ that monetari polici over the past twenti five year has been exemplari   we should be veri cautious in tinker with it design   whatev we do must be clear consist with the dual mandat and be perceiv as such   this is import for democrat legi aci   the feder reserv act includ maximum employ equal with price stabil   i recogn and have often use the principl that price stabil enhanc maximum employ   but i also note that propos introduc in the congress over the past two decad to make price stabil our primari object have not had support  and they   ve gotten nowher   i   m encourag by the fact that chairman bernank in his hear didn   t meet too much opposit  laughter  but i think we need to recogn that there have been attempt to chang our mandat and there has been no congression support for those attempt   i think the last attempt was about ten year ago   the dual mandat is also good econom   fluctuat around potenti imped plan and long term save and invest decis  just as do fluctuat around price stabil   we need to take explicit account of these cost as we pursu our price stabil object  and this impli that we should toler deviat from price stabil on occas and that the  e path to price stabil should depend on the circumst  includ the like cost in lost output along with the deviat from price stabil   support for the feder reserv in the popul and among it elect repres has never been higher  certain never higher in my thirti seven year at this institut   that support flow from the result of the past twenti five year and from confid that we know what we   re do and will behav sensibl   this was the second type of credibl that chairman bernank talk about at the last meet  we should not depend on ani announc to have a substanti immedi effect on inflat expect  where they count most for econom perform   profession econom forecast would have a number to coordin on  and they probabl will   it may help tie down expect in financi market  but even in financi market  the effect are like to be small  long run inflat expect are alreadi well anchor in the unit state   spread over index debt move around quit a bit  even in inflat target countri   for exampl  as we saw in the brief on monday  inflat compens has fallen sinc juli the same amount in canada that it has in the unit state   as the staff memo on price dynam note  the data do not support an infer that such an announc per se would affect wage set and price set behavior   such influenc would come becaus our behavior and the econom result would chang  these caveat and concern lead me to favor a numer definit of price stabil without an explicit  e dimens rather than an inflat target that we would expect to achiev in a defin  e frame   i have in mind someth along the line of chairman bernank   s suggest in st  loui three year ago   the long run averag inflat rate we will be seek in order to meet the price stabil mandat in our act   we would not expect to achiev this object year by year or even necessarili on a two year ahead project   that would depend on the circumst   my expect  or mayb it   s a hope  would be that the benefit of such a formul would exceed it cost   that without great imped the type of flexibl policymak that has so benefit the econom perform sinc       it would help a littl to tie down expect  aid the public in make it plan  clarifi intern and extern communic  and make it more difficult for futur fomc  when all of us have retir  to allow inflat to drift higher   i don   t have well defin view on the exact specif of this definit   the index  it level  point or rang  whether it should be express in term of total or core   but these specif will be critic in judg the eventu like balanc of cost and benefit  if we go down this rout  we   ll have a lot of work to do   besid the detail of the specif  it   s vital import that the committe think through veri care the role that ani definit of price stabil would play in polici formul and that we convey our expect to the public   it would have implic for all our mode of communic as well as for the input to policymak and would call for consider communic to the congress and the public to prepar the way   understand what we   re do and explain it to the public in turn requir that the committe come to a decis on the definit and the way it will be treat in policymak   so i favor the    joint    arm of     s chart   i can see some of the suggest of aggreg the view of individu policymak as a possibl way station  but i   m concern that such aggreg will rais as mani question as it answer   if we go to a numer definit of price stabil  we should be prepar to explain and justifi it fulli  and that requir the committe to consid those implic explicit   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   first vice presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   in light of the hour and the fact that mani of my more learn colleagu have yet to speak  i   ll tri to be brief   my comment come from one who has been with the feder reserv system for some thirti nine year  has been seat on the sidelin of this committe for fifteen year  and has observ the evolut of communic and the critic import of transpar  i   d like to make two observ   first  if the goal of adopt an explicit target is to institution credibl  then this should not be a big concern now   the committe has credibl  and the recent market evid on low market volatil and contain inflat expect is clear consist with the conclus   the recent wall street journal articl notwithstand   that this committe has credibl   over the long run  howev  there are some loom fiscal issu   specif  the project growth of nondiscretionari spend   that make the conduct of monetari polici veri difficult   from this perspect  an explicit target may provid addit reassur to the market that the committe can pursu it low inflat object with some independ from the pressur to accommod fiscal deficit   second  as mani have note  to move to an explicit numer target rais a number of both practic and polit issu   these issu concern not onli the specif of the target  the choic of the  e horizon  and the method employ to ensur transpar and account but also the natur of the negoti to ensur congression accept and support   the system   s mandat has been modifi sever  e  most recent in decemb        if  and i would emphas    if     the congress requir or even suggest addit legisl  i believ the risk and potenti cost of open up the feder reserv act might be great   for exampl  the committe might also get numer target for employ or even specif target for hous or other sector that might be of special interest to individu member of the congress   my bottom line is that  given the risk  i take some comfort in the current vagu of the word of the feder reserv act as it relat to monetari polici object and the way it has been interpret over the past mani year  my sens is that the committe may well be close to have the right balanc with regard to communic it object and ensur credibl   although  clear  the congress can chang our mandat ani  e  i would urg caution in provid the impetus for such chang until we have thought long and hard about the cost and benefit of that chang   have said all that  i find a great deal of comfort in governor     s approach at gradual   i would certain be comfort with that approach if we could avoid nail  so to speak  a tablet to the hall of the congress say     this is go to be our explicit target      i think to do so would simpli lure them into a fight that i wouldn   t want to take on at this  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  in prepar for today   s comment  i found it interest and somewhat instruct to look back to similar discuss that this committe has had in the past   this includ not just our more recent one but an extend debat that took place in juli        i can confirm  therefor  that we have a delib process    laughter   look back over how my own view have evolv  i am as convinc now as befor about the import of an unqualifi commit to price stabil as the underpin of our monetari polici   i have long had an interest in how an inflat target approach to polici might help us  and that   s where i think it get interest becaus i think the devil is in the detail  if you will   as the staff and i have tri to work through some of the detail we would have to confront in implement such an approach  i have becom somewhat less enamor than i was about the use of establish an explicit numer inflat object   i am not necessarili oppos to such a step  and if we were to go there  i   m more drawn to governor     s approach than to other i   ve heard   but i do have concern about the valu of do so  as well as how such a decis would be implement and how it might alter the decisionmak process and our discuss within this meet   the so call unintend consequ of move along this line  let me address these point by frame my comment accord to the question in vinc   s memo   first  is it help   as i understand the literatur on central bank transpar and credibl  the valu of establish an explicit numer definit of price stabil come from anchor the public   s inflat expect and reduc the volatil of these expect   in this regard  i have been struck by how well anchor inflat expect have been in the current tighten cycl here in the unit state   this is in contrast  i realiz  to some histor context  but the fact of the matter is that they have remain quit anchor  how much further improv would come from the adopt of an explicit target at this point  i question   would it be meaning   i   m not so sure  anoth argument is that adopt an explicit numer object would make it more difficult for futur committe to backslid on their commit to price stabil   i find this argument somewhat weak   short of a chang to the feder reserv act  futur committe would not be bound  nor would they feel bound  to action taken by this committe   i can see someon push forward at some  e  in term of the dual mandat  an issu relat to stabl output as becom a new import element   moreov  my read of the literatur compar the perform of inflat target and non inflat target countri suggest that there is veri littl measur differ in perform to this point  in the absenc of a clear benefit of establish an explicit numer object  we also need to look at it cost   one possibl cost is the constraint that might be place on short run polici decis   in this regard  i wonder how an explicit numer object might have alter our respons to the weaken economi in       which governor kohn mention   sinc core inflat measur tend to lag output  core inflat was still rise as we began to reduc rate  would we have been as abl to cut rate as readili if we had establish an explicit numer object   perhap yes  perhap no  how should the object be chosen   turn to the question of choos an explicit numer object  i see a host of procedur and logist issu   as to procedur  i feel strong that ani decis should reflect unanim on the part of the committe  otherwis  the credibl of such a decis is immedi call into question   establish unanim about the detail of an object could prove difficult   for exampl  i would not be comfort with use the core pce deflat exclus in defin a measur of price stabil   theoret  pce is general judg superior to the cpi becaus chain weight avoid the substitut bias in the cpi   in anoth import dimens  howev  the case for the pce is much weaker  perhap most notabl  the core pce deflat is subject to regular and some  signific revis   the revis to pce over the past six year have not been trivial  moreov  they have all been in the same direct   by underes  inflationari pressur dure this period  core pce sent mislead signal about those pressur   moreov  the cpi play a much larger role in the institut fabric of this economi   i find it interest that so few member of the financi communiti produc forecast of pce inflat  even as they view it as the fed   s prefer measur   more import  tip deriv measur of inflat expect are base on the cpi   thus  to line up market inflat expect with the pce we are forc to go through the sort of exercis that is report in the current bluebook   i wonder how accur or use such a translat might be over an extend  e   consequ  if we were to go the rout of establish an explicit numer object  i would advoc not tie ourselv exclus  for exampl  to the pce  as to whether an explicit or implicit approach is prefer  i would lean toward an explicit approach of survey member on their long run object   i feel this approach would be more transpar and effici than expand the horizon of central tendenc forecast  how would an object influenc polici set   i believ there would be effect  but gaug these effect would be difficult without a more thorough and detail understand of how the object would be implement   if we decid to go in this direct  it will be import to maintain the divers and independ of view express by the committe member  both in our deliber here and in our interact with the public  final  if we explor a form of price target or inflat target  we should hold off on an ul  decis until we have a thorough understand of the detail of such a regim and their implic for the polici process within the committe   onc again  just as reinforc  i prefer go forward along the line that governor   outlin for us  thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   the last  e we discuss an explicit numer object in an organ way i said someth to the effect that i thought one reason to have one would be to formal and institution what i thought the committe had larg been do over the past ten or fifteen year   i continu to feel that way  and in that sens do it is evolutionari along the line that some other peopl have describ   but evolutionari is not insignific  and i do think this would make some signific chang  which i believ would be help   we have alreadi touch on some of the communic and account issu  and i certain share the view that this would be posit with regard to those matter  anoth import relat consider is that it   s a potenti effect way of address the issu of  e inconsist   i do think it   s veri import that we tie our short run decis to our long run object   i don   t think there is much disagr about our long run object   state general  that is to achiev and maintain price stabil   i   m eager to see that we put in place some framework   this is not the onli framework that one can conceiv   that accomplish that object   so i think that this would be both help and import and that it would be a new influenc in polici set   that   s it intent  it   rais  as other have alreadi comment  a number of interest intellectu issu have to do with whether to have a rang or a point es   over what  e horizon we are tri to achiev the object  what it all mean for how the committe is go to chang the feder fund rate over  e  and so on and so forth   i think those question are potenti veri import   by the way  just so i can preserv some degre of freedom  let me state explicit that i   m not persuad at the moment that a rang of   to   percent is the appropri target for us  even though that rang has been in the public domain for a while  final  how should the committe choos the inflat object   at the end of the day  i think it should be a committe decis   but i can see get there in a more evolutionari manner  and i would associ myself with mani of governor     s suggest
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll address the major question pose in     s memo in the order present   first  i support the enunci of a long run numer inflat object   my view on the benefit and cost of enunci public such an object have chang veri littl sinc we discuss this topic in januari        begin with the benefit  i believ a numer object would focus our intern polici deliber and improv their coher  particular if the committe   agre on a common object   a numer object appropri communic could also improv the public   s understand of our goal and the strategi for attain them  therebi help to align market percept with those of the committe   solid anchor of the public   s inflat expect could aid us in avoid deflat in the vicin of the zero bound on interest rate and could reduc the potenti for destabil inflat scare follow advers suppli shock  thus enhanc the scope for monetari polici to respond to their real effect   final  the public enunci of the long run inflat object would enhanc account and transpar in a way that i think is appropri   it   s a desir goal in a democraci  although i do perceiv there to be net benefit from enunci a numer object  i do not think these gain are enorm relat to the status quo   the public alreadi has a reason good idea of the committe   s inflat prefer  and inflat expect are now pretti well  if not perfect  anchor   moreov  the evid  as i read it  suggest that a central bank   s credibl on inflat depend more on it actual record of perform than on it utter about it object   so no dramat improv in the sacrific ratio seem like  interest  a recent survey that sever of you have refer to  and i   m assum most peopl have seen  by our former colleagu larri   find that onli a minor of the respond favor the committe   s adopt of a numer inflat object   market particip appear far more interest in improv communic concern our assess of the near term outlook and prospect for monetari polici  and that suggest that as we go forward we should place consider emphasi  as governor   emphas  on enhanc our forecast in the context of the monetari polici report  the enunci of a numer inflat object could have cost as well as benefit  my main worri is the potenti for de emphasi on the other part of our mandat  name maximum sustain employ   such a de emphasi could occur in the mind of the public  and i could easili see how it could affect our own deliber   i think the current situat provid a case in point   if the structur phillip curv has inde becom as flat as frb us es   an op  polici for lower inflat to target bring it down except slowli when equal weight are place on the inflat and the output gap in the loss function   you can see that in the bluebook simul   with the public focus on a numer inflat object  howev  it is natur tempt to seek more rapid converg to a target   i think we feel uncomfort with the path that we see in the bluebook  and it would be easi to effect down weight our emphasi on the employ object   interest  almost half of the respond to     s survey believ that the enunci of a numer inflat object would impair the fomc   s abil to meet it maximum employ object   therefor  enunci of a numer inflat goal  in my view  must occur in the context of a clear statement concern our commit to the dual object   in this regard  i remain attract to our chairman   s      suggest that we state the target inflat rate as a long run object onli and emphas   again  to paraphras our chairman   that in decid how quick to move toward the long run inflat object  the fomc will alway take into account the implic for near term econom and financi stabil   consider of the horizon issu is mention in the other question section of     s memo  and i  for one  take this issu to be crucial and would be unabl to support a numer object unless the horizon can be long enough and flexibl enough to respond appropri to employ consider  now  i   d like to turn to the second major question  which deal with govern in essenc   will the inflat object be chosen by the committe member or by the meet particip  and will it be chosen as a group decis or by summar our individu view   i think there are enorm advantag to reach a joint committe decis   this approach would provid the clearest focus in our polici deliber and committe communic  and it would probabl work best in anchor inflat expect   it would also provid a well defin standard against which we could be held account   howev  i  too  recogn that it is probabl wise to move in this direct cautious   i would certain support  as a first step  governor     s propos to report a consensus of respons to an annual survey concern long run numer inflat object of the particip   this approach would be a measur stanc  more measur than a committe vote  and i think it would be less like to be divis within the committe and vis  vis the congress   such a survey respect the possibl divers within the committe  and the congress might be less like to object to the committe particip    state their individu interpret of the monetari polici mandat than to the formal adopt of an inflat object   of cours  choos to use a survey now would not preclud us from vote as a committe on a singl object later on  we could  as an altern  communic the committe   s long run inflat object through lengthen the horizon of our inflat forecast   such an approach  howev  has signific disadvantag in my view relat to a straightforward survey of opinion   consid the current situat   if the extend  book forecast is accur  ad just a year or two to the forecast we prepar for the semiannu monetari polici report would not work   in fact  to convey our implicit inflat object  if we accept the op  polici path in the bluebook  we might have to add five year or more to those forecast   moreov  if we extend the inflat forecast  we will also need to extend forecast  as governor   note  of real gdp and the unemploy rate  and some member of the public and the congress could misinterpret these es  as the committe   s goal for these variabl  at a minimum  such es  could lead to unproduct discuss about what the correct es  of those key concept are   that is an exercis i would not relish  final  on the question of whether polici set will be affect by a long run inflat object   in some sens  the answer has to be    yes      for exampl  i argu that the benefit of have an inflat object is that it would help to anchor public expect of polici  and if it did  it would affect bond rate and other financi variabl and their respons  presum in construct way  and would therefor feed back onto polici  but the real issu is this   will a public announc inflat object affect the weight that we put on the element of our dual mandat   will it caus us to respond more strong to inflat and less strong to employ   as i said befor  i am concern that this could happen  if onli inadvert   if we go this rout  i myself would make everi effort to prevent such a distort to the weight that i use in analyz polici decis
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know  sinc we   ve start talk about this issu  i   ve been undecid      open mind    is perhap anoth way to say it   wear my supervisor   s hat  i see that we   ve been talk to player in the market about how import transpar is to the effect function of financi market and to financi transact   so it   s hard for me to give a rational for whi the central bank is not more transpar   be part of a democraci mean that for us as a central bank   especi sinc we weren   t direct elect by the citizen   transpar is veri import  howev  the unintend consequ of what set a goal would mean have alway held me back   that   s whi i support the process that has been laid out here   we realli do need to take the  e to think through all the consequ and  as best we can  identifi some possibl unintend consequ   so the evolutionari approach   let   s look at it all togeth befor we decid   i veri strong endors becaus  at the end of the day  our credibl is paramount   it is someth that we have to cherish as much as we possibl can  i also want to think a littl more about the dual mandat issu as we go forward   i tend to believ that have a more explicit target and continu to achiev low and consist inflat will  in effect  support and encourag growth and full employ   so the issu may be one of communic that relationship   i realli feel strong about this   i have no empir basi but just fifteen year as a corpor cfo   one disconnect that you have as a cfo in the corpor world is that you live in a world of nomin  not real  rate of growth   you worri about growth of earn per share  and you want to know what your top line revenu is go to do  so you think about price and output   have a nomin anchor for inflat would actual support corpor decisionmak  give peopl better disciplin about price power versus ride the wave of inflat  alert them when inflat is below target  and make them understand that this could be a short run downturn in top line revenu growth   when i think back to the      s  a lot of compani thought top line growth was stupend  and it took their eye away from realli work and oper effici   so i think that have a nomin anchor would actual enhanc the real world tie between our role as the central bank and corpor decis process  again put on my supervisori hat  i think that one of the critic thing as we state this object is that we clear say how financi stabil fit in   we   ve been talk about central bank move more and more to inflat target  but they have also been focus more and more on financi stabil and the role of the central bank in financi stabil   that is one of the implement issu we need to think through   what is the framework in which we will look at financi stabil  and where might it conflict with our price object and inflat object  regard how we would choos an inflat object  i am veri leeri of one of the propos in the staff memo to use longer term forecast   i agre with governor   that we can improv the monetari polici report  but make longer forecast is fraught with a lot of risk  and i don   t realli see there   s much benefit to it   after all  our object is not to be the best forecast in the world   it   s to control inflat   so i don   t think it add a whole lot of valu  as presid   said  everybodi will be ask     what are the under assumpt      it will get us sidetrack away from our overal object   i prefer the altern in the staff memo that the way forward is what we did year ago when we took the rate of growth and money suppli  and we just survey all of us   mayb along the line suggest a bit earlier  we just say     here is the rang of price object      just announc a long term forecast  sn   t clear say what the object is   if we want to set an object  let   s set an object and not just give a long run forecast  anoth part of set an object is spend a lot of  e think about the  e frame over which we are go to achiev it   say that this is our long run object is one thing   it   s veri differ to say how quick we   re go to return to the goal when we move away from that goal   in the discuss around the tabl ye day  mani of us said that inflat  even in the forecast  is run a bit higher than our comfort zone   we know we   ve been abov it for a coupl of year  but with this forecast we   ll be abov our comfort zone for five year   in effect  have an object   and know what each other   s object are   would have chang the discuss we had around the tabl   if we realli believ that we   re abov our comfort zone  then how can we make the decis we   re make   what is the path   that would have implic for the staff   if we realli want to hit an object  strategi  as presid   said  is the real issu   how do you execut   we can all set great goal  but it   s execut that matter   a nomin object would forc the staff to spend a lot more resourc in talk about the path of polici and the way we would respond to variat around that path  that perhap could actual improv decisionmak  final  get back to the transpar issu  i think an explicit object would put good govern around us  particular in the difficult  e when we are vari from our object  becaus we would have to talk about the tradeoff we have with our dual mandat or financi stabil concern or whatev is creat a long run deviat from that path   so i come back to my thought that the effort to look at this is worthwhil  but i realli encourag us to think about all the consequ as we go forward
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me frame my remark around the relev constitu  tri not to avoid answer the hard question   the prism through which i think about this is  what   s the polit accept for what we   re tri to do   what   s the market accept and what   s the polici accept for what we are tri to do  as i think about the three issu and weigh the cost and benefit  i find the cost of each are easi to elabor in great detail   the benefit appear to me to be veri real but hard to pin down with confid as to both when we would achiev those benefit and how they would accru to the credibl of this institut   i am most in accord with presid     s descript  which is that there may well be net benefit to go down this path but the cost are much easier to put our hand around   we   re approach this discuss through the prism of inflat target  which is realli the eleph in the discuss   in some way  i dare say it made our previous discuss tough becaus we were tipto around the core inflat target question   inflat target has taken a life of it own in academia  in the capit market  and in the polit environ   although inflat target is a proper framework for the discuss here  it is a veri danger way in which to approach our public discuss  let me discuss that point in a littl detail   inflat target  certain on capitol hill and to mani market particip  suggest that some mechan exogen forc will be an absolut constraint on the fomc   s action   that   s not the way most peopl here today have talk about inflat object  but it   taint the discuss in our relev constitu outsid the build  and we have to be veri much awar of that fact   it strike me that  onc we   ve figur out more or less our own path to make an institut decis on this  we should be discuss it more broad outsid the institut as a continu and manifest of what the fed has long done   instead of use word like    inflat target    outsid the institut  we should use word like    price stabil      talk about this as the next generat and the formal of the comfort zone languag  which either by design or by practic has mark mani of our discuss in the past year  is a much more use way for us to make meaning progress in washington and in the capit market  you saw from larri     s survey that there was  i think  a decid tone of    hey  we just want to know what the right answer is   tell us what you guy are go to do next   we just want data that give us the answer becaus then we can put them into our excel spreadsheet and life will be grand       laughter   i think that   s a trap that we do not want to fall into   what we want to be do  rather than general tri to provid them with greater clariti than we can provid about what our decis are go to be  is to give them better inform on what we   re use to make decis  i fear that  if we announc an inflat target per se  and provid some specif about that announc  we will have engend credibl question that we will need to answer  in the most recent cycl of our interest rate decis  veri few of us  i think  would have somehow done thing differ if an inflat target regim had been in place   my own sens is that we can   t believ that we need to hamstr ourselv with such an exogen forc  at the other extrem  we don   t want to go down this path if we say inflat target  sn   t chang our flexibl at all   so the relev question is  what   this do to our flexibl   if the answer is that it  sn   t constrain our flexibl at all  then it is realli unwis becaus of all those cost that we   ve talk about   if the answer to that question is that it   constrain our flexibl signific  then we have a huge problem in all our constitu   so we end up have to admit  as we go down this path  that it   somewhat constrain our flexibl but say that the fomc is as prepar as ever to respond to real market develop with respect to employ  output  and financi crise  so where   that put us   again  the debat should be frame as a continu of what we   ve long done   after we announc our conclus from these discuss  at some point we would need to reject the straw man of what inflat target has becom   if an interrog on capitol hill or in the capit market say     this is the goal  this is the number  and you will get inflat down to that goal within x number of year     the respons has to be    no      that is  that   s not how we   re think about the next generat of transpar  regard an increment approach to get from where we are to where we want to be  i would begin  onc we   re readi to go prime  e with our announc  by avoid the adopt of inflat target per se and by let that straw man be put out there and shoot it down to suggest that   s not where we are   my next measur would be to acceler the  e of exist inform  by which i would refer the minut  the lag in the forecast  and the generat of our central tendenc   then i   d add frequenc   i think the idea of go from a semiannu to a quarter present of our inform  as governor   suggest  would be next in the evolut of be more transpar to the market about what we mean by    price stabil      then i would consid ad robust to the data provid   that is  what data set that are not in the public realm and that we use for our own decisionmak could be help   final  look at how that inform has proceed along this path of transpar  we then ask ourselv whether we need to have a formal vote on the big question that   laid out for us or whether a vote is unnecessari becaus we   ve alreadi proceed so far down the path that we   ve end up with a rather  though not total  explicit definit of what price stabil mean  as a final comment   we   ve discuss around this tabl whether this decis is an individu or a collect one   in my judgment  a consensus decis is a good one   but i don   t think we should fool ourselv   feder reserv polici has been person  and no matter what we do  it will continu to be person in the form of the chairman   what the market and the congress will be most interest in is     well  i hear that   s the central tendenc view of the fomc   what   s your view      i want to make sure as we go through this process that  becaus we know that question will be ask of the chairman  we haven   t constrain his flexibl   he must duti report perhap what our consensus view are  but we shouldn   t let there be ani ambigu about what are our view and what are his view   to the extent that there   s a differ  perhap he is oblig to describ that   but i wouldn   t want this process end up by constrain the chairman about what he could say becaus at the end of the day  whether all of us like it or not  it is the chairman   s judgment  much more than ani of our  that influenc our monetari polici   thank you
thank you   presid
well  i don   t have ani written materi prepar  mr  chairman   just note i   ve taken  in part becaus i confess that befor this convers i was somewhat nonpluss about this issu   that is  i   m a littl perplex about whi we   re talk about it now  given what mani comment have said about where we are present   we have achiev signific credibl with the previous two chairmen of the committe and you and with the action of the committe   i have been ask my own staff in dalla to give me the compel reason to do this now  i   ve heard four compel argument  or argument that at least purport to be compel  dure this discuss   one is that it will improv the policymak process and focus  although i think presid   proper express some skeptic as to whether it would actual chang the focus  intens  and process that we have had   the second is that it would coordin and better anchor public expect   governor    with great enthusiasm by the way  made that argument   his remark were not onli insight  but they were also charm    laughter   the third is that it would plant our current legaci  i think governor kohn touch on one of those sensit nerv   the fourth is a subset of the third point   the polit risk of loss of a chairman with willpow  i won   t go into all the aspect of this that i have concern about   but i don   t want to bat away presid   like a mosquito here   i think he made an import point  which was summar by presid pianalto  who drew on her ancestri with the term    festina lent     which mean    make hast slowli      that   s whi i would like to suggest in one dimens onli   rather than discuss what everybodi els has alreadi talk about   the polit dimens of what we are discuss   i see an explicit numer target as extrem riski polit unless we manag it care  and i would just ask all of us to bear in mind what those polit risk are  we do have a dual mandat   i agre with those who have said that we do not want to run the risk of chang our current charg from the congress   as i listen to governor     again  i found his argument remark brilliant and persuas   i was think to myself that i would love to be in a room with you and hear you use those brilliant argument with  say  a senat major leader like harri reid  or a chairman of the way and mean committe like   rangel  or a chairman of the financi servic committe like barney frank   we have to be care of the risk that either you then have them say     that   s fine  but tell me what your employ target is becaus you have a dual mandat    or you end up negoti an inflat target higher than you want it to be   i happen to know those three men veri well   i have appear befor them   i think presid   and i along with presid   have probabl appear befor the congress more than anybodi els at this tabl  individu and certain collect  and i can imagin that convers take place  so i would proceed slowli  or hasten slowli  not just in the analyt aspect of this but also in explain whi we want to tie ourselv to this mast   is it that we are afraid of the siren call of the lack of disciplin becaus we don   t think we can bring about the disciplin that   s requir   we need to consid that there are polit aspect of this in light of which we may not even want to open that pandora   s box   that   s the onli advic i would give or comment i would make at this junctur  mr  chairman   thank you  oh  let me make one other comment   i keep hear about larri     s poll   we have a dean of a busi school  i   m an m b a   and we have other m b a s around the tabl  uncertainti is the enemi of decisionmak   of cours they want more frequent forecast  governor kohn and i talk about this befor   they want a full frontal view   i find a full frontal view most unbecom    laughter  thank you  mr  chairman
speak for yourself    laughter   governor
i don   t know whi presid   point to me when he said that   i do not endors his approach    laughter   certain  i think it   s appropri   sinc we   re get veri close to or mayb have pass our lunch  when we   ll talk about the    th anniversari of the fed   that we are think about someth that is realli quit histor here  potenti a major chang in the way that policymak is undertaken at the feder reserv   the memo that we have is excel   the discuss that we have had has been excel   even if it has been a bit lengthi  these issu are import  and it take  e to make sure that our view are air   after all the view that have been air  howev  i can add littl  so i   ll give just a veri short indic of some of my thought  key off what a lot of other have said  the way that i think about the issu is that we have our dual mandat  and we should do everyth think about how best to achiev our dual mandat of maximum employ growth consist with low and stabl inflat   the question is    be more explicit about what    price stabil    mean help us to get to our object better   i think in mani circumst that it can   peopl have brought up issu about whether or not it could interfer with that  and it   s veri import that it not in ani way be interpret  either by the committe member or the outsid world  as be inconsist with our abil to achiev that dual mandat  one concern that i brought up ye day was that i don   t think we understand short run or intermedi run inflat dynam veri well   i want to make sure that we don   t overpromis  when you look at the one exampl in the bluebook simul that get inflat down to     percent over quit a long period  you see that it would requir us to move our polici rate up     to     basi point for the next year to two year   that strike me as a veri differ approach from what mani peopl around the tabl would be will to take  although perhap if we did have an explicit     percent goal  peopl would be will to do that   but it   s veri  veri import to make sure that we understand whether we think that   s the right path   that is the consider that presid   brought up ye day   there are a number of issu with those simul  such as the foreign exchang movement and other thing  that may make us uncomfort with them   if we don   t understand the path veri well  it is veri danger for us to be make even long run commit to someth when we   re not quit sure how we can get to it   we know that in the veri long run we can get there   but if it   s so long that we   re not achiev it in real  e  that can actual undermin our credibl and make us appear less transpar rather than more transpar   so i just want to make sure that we work veri hard to push our understand of inflat dynam and that we know how we can achiev the goal if we enunci such a goal   as i said  in mani  perhap most  circumst enunci such a goal can be valuabl  although take a particular number at a particular horizon could be problemat  to get the main benefit and give guidanc to the market  we would want the goal to be a consensus decis rather than everyon   s have his or her own goal  which could result in less transpar and less credibl   i think it could affect the way that we undertak polici   in some sens  if it  sn   t  then what   s the point of do it   it has to have some effect  otherwis  it won   t be credibl to the market  and then it   s simpli not worth the candl   as i said  in that context  we have to make sure that we understand inflat dynam veri well so that we can explain to the world what the consequ of the goal would be for maximum employ growth and the evolut of the economi   thus my main concern is that we don   t know enough about the short run or intermedi run inflat dynam to feel comfort with articul a goal   we could articul a goal in a general way   as a rang  say   and not be tie down to a particular number that could be revis   that would be help  but in make all these decis  we have to be veri mind about understand how we can achiev the goal
thank you   presid   had a two hand intervent
with your indulg  mr  chairman  i   d like to comment on the role of the dual mandat and sketch out how i   d like to see this discuss evolv   i feel motiv to do this becaus this consider has play a greater role in today   s discuss than i had anticip   this is just a byproduct of my own lack of foresight and intellig  i think   and also becaus i took swipe at the dual mandat earlier in my career on the committe and was bat back by previous vice chairmen and other    laughter   what i want to say first is that i sens a substanti converg of view   as demonstr by governor kohn   s use of the best contribut formul  i think there   s converg of the sens of what it mean around here    governor kohn   s statement  by the way  was outstand  and i   d associ myself with all of it  top to bottom    but i sens that some of our polici disagr are on occas interpret as differ in view on the appropri weight to place on employ and inflat in a policymak welfar function or loss minim function   cast it that way tempt one to view those weight as reflect valu judgment analog  for exampl  to my prefer for grit over egg at this morn   s breakfast  i realiz that what i   m about to say run a great risk of seem pedant and academ  but i think it   s import   i   ll start provoc by say that i don   t care about output per se  and i don   t think ani one of us    and i don   t think ani one of us care about inflat per se  we care about the welfar of the citizen of our countri   that   s an obvious point to make  but i   ll just remind you that the practic of view policymak through the len of the analyt devic of a mathemat policymak face a loss function with weight on employ and inflat aros dure the     s   in contrast  polici analysi everywher els in econom was ground in model in which the consum was actual mathemat present   that is to say  the model treat explicit the prefer of consum and then craft polici to maxim those in a framework in which you could explicit calcul what consum prefer were  at the  e  the state of the art monetari polici framework did not includ consum explicit  these were reduc form model   you know  the patinkin generat of model   today  the state of the art monetari model captur a rich array of inflat and output dynam and do treat prefer of our citizen explicit   these model are capabl of deriv op  polici  and op  polici so deriv can be repres as the solut to a maxim problem by a policymak with given weight   but that  of cours  is veri differ from think of those weight as stem from non econom valu judgment about the util valu of employ and inflat   so  in principl  the weight that are most appropri to use to repres policymak can be scientif investig   they can be analyz through model at this level and through the data and can be compar regard good of fit and other measur as well   the congression mandat in the      s codifi exist practic and encapsul the notion that we   ve got weight and that we view ourselv as have a loss function regard these two thing when we realli just have one loss function and that relat to our citizen    welfar  i   d point out that sure we have heavili influenc the interpret of those mandat  you look at the act  and three object are there   i think that we   ve help induc peopl to call it a dual mandat by encourag them to drop the moder interest rate object   so  in principl  we could influenc the evolut of popular interpret and understand of these other object as well   i   d also point out that the way the congress codifi the object was without weight  and so the act is not at all inconsist with the state of the art approach to monetari econom   i say this becaus i   d like to move us beyond the relat  il debat over whether my weight is higher or lower on inflat or output  and i hope that we can evolv in both our discuss about the dual mandat and our analyt approach to the use of it in meet ahead   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
i   m tempt to say that i was hope we would run out of  e    laughter   i   ll be veri brief   let me just compliment don and his subcommitte and the chairman for how you   ve laid out the issu   this decis is import to think through care  even if we quick find a comfort center of graviti   it   s go to be consequenti  i   m sure  on the question   i   m chang them slight   would an explicit  public disclos  numer definit of    price stabil    be help   probabl  but it depend on how we do it   it depend on what els we do about the way we talk about our forecast  and it depend a lot on how we think through the implic of the way we make polici  how will  how should  how would  how could the fomc choos or choos to reveal an inflat object   three broad option that are implicit or explicit in this memo are worth think through   i   m sure that  if we choos to reveal public a quantit definit of our view of long term inflat  we have to do it as a decis of the committe   it   s hard for me to imagin how one could do that on the basi of some averag of prefer  which would chang with the composit of the committe over  e   much of what   s been said about the other two choic is right and sound sensibl  would the quantif of an inflat object be a new influenc   of cours it would   that has to be whi it   s worth think through   as   impli  think through what it would mean for our behavior is a critic part of this process   i   m go to discuss the other question veri briefli and make just two point about process  first  when you look at the broad evid  i think it is fair to say that the evid is weak on the achiev credibl gain relat to what we   ve alreadi achiev   i   m uncertain  of cours  whether those gain come from action over  e or what you disclos about your regim  your object  your framework   the evid is somewhat stronger against the concern of the skeptic and the critic in that there   s littl basi in the experi of other countri to justifi the broad concern exist   that embrac the softer respons variant of inflat target bring with them too much risk  that you lose flexibl to respond  that you   re forc into subop  weight among your various object  that  for exampl  you are compromis in your capac to respond to threat to financi stabil   i   m not sure that   s right  though   of cours  we   re not new zealand  norway  or sweden   we say that a lot   but we should talk through what it is that make us differ   how are we differ  and how might that differ make us view the evid   in some sens the question we face is  do the soft variant of the approach offer convinc credibl gain without signific reduc the risk and concern that have to accompani consider of this object   that basic tradeoff is what is critic  second  how do ignor and uncertainti about inflat dynam  about the respons of inflat to some of it tradit determin  about the shape of the phillip curv  and about inertia and persist affect our choic of regim   how   uncertainti about all the other dimens of how monetari polici work and how we measur this affect our choic of regim   this uncertainti is critic to how we choos among altern path for bring inflat back to target  how we choos among altern horizon  and how we think about polici consist with those differ path   all the variant of the regim on the tabl  all of which are of the softer form  would still forc us to be more explicit in public about where we are seek to move inflat and over what horizon   i think we have to ask ourselv whether we can be confid about how compel those argument will be in public given the relat weak of the analyt foundat that exist to help inform those choic   even with a no horizon  a long horizon  or a variabl horizon approach to the disclos explicit inflat object  you don   t avoid confront the choic about your horizon or how you come up with an altern horizon  and so forth   i think that the dimens of ignor and uncertainti we live with is inher  and it is not go to chang dramat over  e   thus it has to inform how we think through these broader option  the third question is  how would altern variant to the regim affect the dynam around the polici set   as i said  and mani other said  they will and must affect it   you have to assum they will   it   s prudent to assum they will   it   s veri import to think through those dynam   would we realli be comfort   even in a veri long run horizon  no horizon  or flexibl horizon regim   produc a forecast that has inflat stay well abov our target for veri long period of  e   i   m not sure that you wouldn   t want to assum that over  e the committe would be less comfort with that and want to hope and declar as an object that we move inflat down quicker over  e   i don   t think analysi or evid is go to help us think through those dynam  but i don   t think we can assum them away   i think they   re import  i have two quick comment about process   one is   i   ll call it the   propos  though he didn   t make it    laughter   i think we should spend more  e  and don should build into his  e frame more in depth discuss  on what we think we understand about the model that underpin our decis and what   s in those model about inertia and all the fundament determin of inflat   we   ve had a lot of turnov in the committe   we discuss it onc over light   in august  i believ   we should discuss it in more depth  at least to make sure we have a common understand about what we   re work with and what the limit and benefit are relat to the altern   two  i think it   s import not to get into the process discuss prematur   a lot of thought  interest idea were put forth about intermedi step toward some broad chang in regim   i don   t think it   s worth spend a lot of  e on altern variant of the intermedi step until we   ve realli thought through ul  where we want to go   if we spend  e on and get enough depth about the merit of that choic and we find some consensus with which we   re comfort  then we can go back and figur out how we want to get there   thank you
thank you   it   s been a veri long morn   i appreci everyon   s patienc in this long but veri use discuss   let me take just a coupl of minut  i   m not go to tri to respond to all the point that were rais   i just want to make just a coupl of observ  there was a lot of discuss about how this would affect polici  and inde  i think it would affect polici   but  rememb  this debat is about communic   i think it   s veri import that we communic better   while our polici has been good  we have had difficulti   i certain have   in communic with the public and the market   if we can find a more effect  clearer way to do that  i think the benefit would be signific  let me just say a coupl of word   and this goe somewhat against     s comment   about evolut   whatev we do  i would agre with sever peopl around the tabl  should be increment and evolutionari for sever reason   first  we have to make sure that we understand what we   re do   we have to learn how to implement what it is we   re do  second  we have to maintain continu with the previous regim  not have ani sharp chang in our polici or our percept   third  a transitionari  evolutionari approach will give us a chanc to educ the public  educ the congress  and get some reaction and feedback that will perhap allow us to make correct as necessari  in addit  i think that our step need to face two real constraint   the first is that we do have a dual mandat   that whatev we may say here  we have to persuad the congress and the public that we will look at both part of the mandat and that we will not reduc our interest in employ and output   the second constraint is our institut structur  the size of our committe  and those featur that the bank of england  for exampl    not have   all those thing have to be factor into our think  let me suggest a way one might think about proceed that i think meet some of these concern   it might be use  for exampl  for us at some point to clarifi what we mean by the    comfort zone     a term that is out there and is caus confus   i would prefer to do it collect  but we can think about way of do that   if we could confirm what the comfort zone is and what it mean  i think that would be a step in the right direct   in particular  i would argu that we should defin the comfort zone as the rang in which core inflat should remain most of the  e   over the past ten year  it has remain between     to   percent most of the  e   but all we would say about polici is that it should have some bias that will take us  in the long run  back toward that core rang  while not set fix horizon on the comfort zone  we need to exploit our project and forecast  which can describ to the public what we think the next two year will look like in term of the path of inflat and output   i would associ myself with sever peopl who have comment that perhap the best thing we can do  even if we downplay the comfort zone or the target  is to provid more inform to the public about our forecast  more regular monetari polici report  and consider more inform about our outlook and our approach   again  my prefer approach would be to provid some inform about the comfort zone   but for the public the big chang would be the addit inform we   re provid  which would address     s point about what the public is look for   when i make the speech describ this regim  i would go so far as to say   and this is a littl radic   that the feder reserv is not adopt inflat target  what we are do is simpli provid more inform   we   re provid more inform about where the committe think it want inflat to be on averag over longer period of  e  and we   re provid extens addit inform about the forecast and our view about the economi   if we do it that way  we will probabl avoid some of the pitfal that have been mention  again  i want to thank everyon for terrif input and to note that this process will be ongo   we are in no hurri   we should go on until we feel that we have a conclus with which we are comfort and that we   re all will to support  let   s confirm that the date of the next meet is tuesday  decemb      the meet is adjourn   lunch is avail next door   pleas bring your lunch back  and we   ll have a short present on the centenni while we   re have lunch   thank you so much  end of meet
