good afternoon  everybodi   whi don   t we begin  as usual  with the desk report and bill     bill
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m go to be refer to the handout that you should have in front of you   financi market have becom more resili to bad news in recent week   although the news associ with sever import group of financi intermediari   includ invest bank  commerci bank  and the monolin insur   has not been favor  contagion has been limit compar with some of our earlier experi dure the past year  moreov  the type of vicious feedback loop that were evid  for exampl  in earli march have been larg absent more recent   despit this  much of the news has not been good   look first at the u s  equiti and credit market  a good portion of the improv that occur in the run up to the april fomc meet has been unwound recent   the broad u s  equiti index are onli margin abov their low point reach in mid march and the price of the standard   poor   s     financi sub index has fallen to a new trough  exhibit      in contrast  corpor credit spread have held on to much of the gain achiev after mid march   as shown in exhibit    the spread on both invest grade and high yield corpor debt have been quit stabl recent   howev  as shown in exhibit    corpor credit default swap spread have widen over the past few week   most of the major invest bank have continu to struggl   as shown in exhibit    the share price of the four remain independ u s  invest bank remain depress   further write off  capit rais  which is increas the number of common share equival outstand   and investor    concern about the consequ of deleverag on long term profit have all been import factor weigh on share price   in contrast to this poor equiti price perform  credit default swap  cds  spread remain much narrow than at the  e of bear stearn   s demis in mid march  exhibit      the establish of the primari dealer credit facil and the feder reserv   s role in the acquisit of bear stearn by jpmorgan chase are undoubt both import factor behind the diverg of equiti price and credit default swap spread   lehman brother  which report a second quarter loss that was consider larger than expect  has been under the most stress   howev  in contrast to bear stearn   s experi in mid march  lehman   s short term financ counterparti have general prove to be patient  the financ backstop provid by the primari dealer credit facil has been cite by mani counterparti as a critic element that has encourag them to keep their    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     june                of     financ line to lehman in place   the invest bank have begun to rapid deleverag their balanc sheet   as shown in exhibit    the gross leverag ratio for lehman brother  goldman sach  and morgan stanley all fell sharpli in the second quarter   this stand in mark contrast to the rise in leverag ratio that persist through the first quarter of this year   region bank have also come under consider strain recent   deterior in their construct lend  commerci real estat  and residenti mortgag book has caus mani bank to rais their loan loss provis sharpli   potenti acquir of troubl region bank have been discourag by the account requir that these bank must mark down the asset of the bank that they   re acquir to the current market valu at the  e of the acquisit   the financi guarantor have also been under stress   both standard   poor   s and moodi   s recent downgrad ambac and mbia   the moodi   s downgrad of mbia was particular sharp   five notch to a  from aaa   these downgrad of the monolin guarantor have a number of import implic   first  the firm that have purchas protect from ambac and mbia will have to take signific write down   citigroup  merril lynch  and ub appear to have the largest exposur to these two firm   second  the abil of ambac and mbia to establish new aaa rate subsidiari that would enabl them to write new municip bond insur is increas in doubt   most like  these firm will be forc to go into runoff mode in which they can no longer write new busi   third  the financi resourc of these firm will be strain by the downgrad   for exampl  mbia said that  as a result of the downgrad  it may have to pay out      billion to satisfi certain contract and post up to      billion of addit collater   fourth  the risk of a default or a restructur event by a major monolin guarantor could potenti unsettl the cds market   as shown in exhibit   and    the share price of the monolin have continu to slide  and their credit default swap spread have risen further   as has been the case for some  e  there remain   even after the credit rate downgrad   a big disconnect between the cds spread of these firm and their credit rate   despit these rate downgrad  the effect on the municip secur market has been mute compar with the turmoil evid in the first quarter   put simpli  much of the adjust in the short term municip market   for exampl  the demis of the muni auction rate secur market and the restructur of mani variabl rate demand note  vrdn  and tender option bond  tob  secur  has alreadi taken place   although the yield on the vrdns wrap by ambac and mbia have increas sharpli  up to now much of this paper has been remarket rather than put back to the liquid provid   the effect on the municip bond market has been even more subdu   as shown in exhibit    the ratio of    year and    year municip yield to compar treasuri yield have risen onli slight recent and remain well below the peak reach in mid march   investor have alreadi been look through the credit rate of the monolin insur to the qualiti of the under tax exempt issuer  june                of     the perform of term fund market also suggest a greater resili to bad news   subsequ to the may expans of the taf auction size and the increas in the foreign exchang swap line with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank  one month and three month libor   oi spread have narrow signific  exhibit    and       the declin in term fund spread is particular noteworthi becaus it stand in contrast to the widen that occur in the last month of the three preced quarter   septemb  decemb  and march   the increas in the size of the taf auction has also been associ with a declin in bid to cover ratio  also  as shown in exhibit     the spread between the stop out rate and the minimum bid rate has been relat low   in contrast to the u s  auction  the bid to cover ratio in the ecb and snb auction have risen sharpli over the last three auction  exhibit       this like reflect sever factor includ     a reduct in the willing of u s  bank to lend at term to european bank   due most to balanc sheet constraint and     strateg bid behavior   as you recal  the ecb auction is a noncompetit auction with the stop out rate determin by the taf auction   as a consequ  increas the bid size in the ecb auction will not rais the price that the bank will have to pay  and that encourag more bid in the ecb auction   this strateg bid explan  howev  is undercut by the fact that european bank have also been strong bidder in both the taf and the snb auction   the introduct by icap of a compet measur of bank fund cost   the new york fund rate  nyfr    has most bol  the credibl of libor   the nyfr rate have consist been within   or   basi point of libor   howev  it is unclear how much this conform reflect the accuraci of libor   it is possibl that the nyfr respond use libor as a benchmark for their own respons  sinc libor come out earlier in the day than when they have to respond   demand for the term secur lend facil  tslf  auction has also general been subdu   onli one of the last nine auction has been fulli subscrib   this main reflect the converg in treasuri and non treasuri repo financ rate  follow the first tslf auction  treasuri repo rate rose sharpli   given the minimum bid rate for the schedul   and schedul   auction of    and    basi point respect  the converg in repo rate has erod the econom appeal of the tslf auction as a fund vehicl   the     billion of the singl tranch repo program has been more attract as a sourc of fund   moreov  the pdcf backstop has made investor more will to financ the non treasuri collater held by the invest bank and other primari dealer  and this has also reduc the demand for tslf borrow   the continu rise in commod price has been anoth import market develop   as shown in exhibit     both energi and agricultur price have been rise sharpli   although the weak of the dollar has often been cite by analyst as a causal factor behind the surg in commod price  the recent rise in energi and food price has been accompani by a slight stronger  rather than weaker  dollar  exhibit       nevertheless  short term movement in the dollar and oil price do june                of     appear to have becom more close link over the past few year   exhibit    plot the six month roll correl between the week chang in the spot price of west texa intermedi crude oil and the week chang in the valu of the trade weight dollar   as can be seen  these price chang have becom increas negat correl in recent year   of cours  correl   not impli causal  even if there is causal  it is unclear in what direct the causal run   from commod to the dollar or from the dollar to commod   although mani factor are undoubt at play  a coupl of possibl explan that have made the round may be worth consid   first  higher oil price swell the dollar reserv held by the oil produc countri   becaus these countri may respond to this dollar influx by sell dollar to diversifi their foreign exchang reserv hold  trader may sell dollar in anticip   second  trade data suggest that the composit of import demand from the oil export nation is skew away from the unit state  and this may also weigh on the dollar   the rise in commod price has fan anxieti about inflat   as shown in exhibit     the univers of michigan consum sen ent survey measur of one year and five to ten year inflat expect have increas recent   in contrast  both barclay    and the board   s five year  five year forward measur of breakeven inflat have moder a bit sinc the last meet   these measur remain well insid the rang evid over the past year  exhibit       the anxieti about higher commod price and inflat has been an import factor behind the sharp shift in monetari polici expect   as shown in exhibit    and     the feder fund rate and eurodollar futur curv have continu to shift upward sinc the april fomc meet   as shown in exhibit    and     our survey of primari dealer expect also show an upward shift in the expect path of the feder fund rate target  howev  compar with the expect embodi in futur price  the rise has been more modest   as a result  the gap between the averag of the dealer    forecast and the market   s forecast has continu to increas and is now unusu wide   the diverg between the dealer    forecast and market expect and the wide rang of the dealer    forecast one year ahead indic that there is consider uncertainti about the futur path of short term rate   this uncertainti is also evid in the fact that the impli volatil of short term interest rate is unusu high current   the tighten expect over the next year is not anticip to begin soon   as shown in exhibit    and     option on feder fund rate futur contract current impli that market particip expect that the fomc will stand pat at both this and the august fomc meet   although consider tighten is price in over the next year  this is not unusu at this stage of the monetari polici cycl   assum that we are at the trough of the current rate cycl  the magnitud of tighten expect over the next year is not signific greater than what has been price in follow other trough in the feder fund rate target   tomorrow we will be eight week beyond what may turn out to be the onset of the trough in the target rate   as shown in exhibit     the rough     basi point of tighten that is current price in over the next year is compar to what was anticip at the same point after the feder fund rate trough in       june                of     final  a few word about the primari dealer credit facil    art angulo will talk about this in more detail tomorrow    we have been activ manag our counterparti risk in this facil and have made it clear to market particip that this should be view as a backstop facil rather than as a core sourc of fund   by the end of next week  borrow from this facil is like to drop sharpli becaus of two event   the first is this week   s close of the bear stearn   jpmorgan chase transact  which will result in the elimin of bear stearn   s pdcf borrow  the second is the anticip close next week of the bank of america acquisit of countrywid  which is expect to elimin countrywid   s pdcf borrow   in the absenc of new financi shock that could provok renew fund difficulti  we would anticip littl persist pdcf borrow after these merger are complet   last week i sent you a memo inform you of our plan to initi a euro  e deposit with the netherland central bank  subject to regul n approv by the board   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the april fomc meet   as alway  i am veri happi to take ani question
thank you  bill   the quarter end premium seem less this   e  but am i correct that the dollar premium is higher than the euro and pound premium
it is a bit higher  yes
is there anyth to be infer from that
about     basi point are price in for our dollar turn   mayb     basi point or     basi point elsewher   but those are pretti small differ measur over just a coupl of day   so i wouldn   t read too much into it   the realiti is that the european bank are structur short of dollar fund  and so that may be whi there is a littl more upward pressur on dollar rate over the quarter end
other question for bill   presid
yes   i notic that in chart     in your tip impli averag inflationari plot to the ten year horizon  you omit the market group   s es    is that becaus of skeptic on your part that lead you to judg it as inferior or an overabund of humil   laughter
the latter  of cours    laughter
it    of cours  show a slight differ trend  right
it actual has increas a bit   but i have consist shown just the barclay and board measur over the past few month  so this is not    pick and choos
bill  by infer  talk about the primari dealer credit facil  two of the limit number of borrow have been the two institut you mention   have there been mani more or just one or two
there have been more borrow than just them   some have done it becaus they want to test the facil   some have done it becaus they view it as a fair advantag cost of fund   you know  there have been quit a few differ borrow  but those two borrow mention are the one that i would view as more persist than desir
thank you for discreet answer the question
other question   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   just to follow up on that question  i was at a meet in new york not too long ago and was talk with some peopl on wall street   they suggest that for the primari dealer there was stigma attach to borrow from the pdcf   i wasn   t quit sure what to make of that  and i just wonder if you had ani observ or comment about whether you thought that was real or perceiv  or is there an interpret i should give to that
i think there is some stigma attach to the primari dealer credit facil   it is hard to know exact how much   one thing i thought was interest   the first week the facil was outstand  a number of institut went to the primari dealer credit june                of     facil and then announc that they were do it as a test   now  presum you wouldn   t announc that you were do it as a test if there were no stigma associ with the facil   but i would judg that it is clear less stigmat than the primari credit facil  probabl becaus it  sn   t have the histori that the primari credit facil has   the fact is that it is an advantag rate or was an advantag rate sever week ago  and there were some institut that were borrow from the facil just on the basi of rate   so that suggest less stigma than the discount window
presid  n
yes   bill  on chart    just a quick question on the leverag ratio   do we know how good those data are   i mean  to the best of our knowledg  is that reliabl stuff
this is just asset divid by equiti  so i think it is pretti good   when the invest bank start propos their adjust leverag ratio  then i think you have a problem   you know  appl and orang   becaus the differ invest bank calcul those kind of adjust leverag ratio a bit differ   usual you see two leverag ratio   one that is gross and anoth one that exclud the match book   and the leverag ratio fall pretti signific when you exclud the match book
mr  chairman   presid  n  i have just one thing to add   for the first  e with the three invest bank that report for the quarter that end in may  the sec allow them to disclos their risk weight ratio on the sec   s version of basel ii   that   s the ratio for which your question is more german in some sens becaus it show a pretti signific cushion of capit against risk weight asset   the question is  how good are those measur of risk weight asset   this is a subject for discuss tomorrow  but june                 of     part of our problem is that we have much less confid in judg the integr of what goe into those measur of risk   not to mention whether the risk weight are ani good  which is a harder thing for the market to judg   but for the first  e the market can see what their risk weight measur are  at least on an sec basi  which is pretti close to basel ii  and those ratio were  if i recal correct  north of     tier    for the three that report   signific higher than they were on march    by their own measur
other question   if not  would someon move the ratif
without object   thank you   okay   let   s turn now to the econom situat   nathan  i   ll start with you
thank you  mr  chairman   given that develop in global commod market have continu to have influenti effect on our forecast for domest activ and price  we felt that it would be use for me to lead off with the intern portion of the chart show  which will includ a discuss of these market   follow my remark  larri and bill will present our outlook for the u s  economi   as shown in the top panel of your first exhibit  total foreign real gdp growth  line    step down from an averag pace of     percent in the first three quarter of      to around   percent in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year   we see growth abroad as like to declin to     percent in the current quarter and to pick up onli slight in the second half of the year   next year  with the expect firm of u s  activ and diminish headwind from the financi turmoil  foreign growth should rise back to a     percent pace   growth abroad was just a bit stronger in the first quarter than we had anticip  but the composit of that growth came as more of a surpris   canadian gdp  line    post a slight contract  reflect a continu downturn in export and stagnant invest   in contrast  the pace of activ in japan  line    and the euro area  line    was much more vigor than we had expect  includ a    percent surg in germani  nevertheless  recent data for these economi point to much weaker growth in the second quarter   as shown in the middl left panel  japanes manufactur output    the materi use by messr  sheet     and wascher are append to this transcript  appendix     june                 of     has declin recent  and labor market condit have soften   for the euro area  the middl right   various indic are show weak  includ retail sale and the purchas manag    index   as highlight in the bottom panel  growth in the emerg market economi is expect to step down over the next few quarter but should remain relat resili  especi compar with the weak perform of these economi dure the u s  recess earlier this decad   mani of the eme were particular vulner to the high tech  and manufactur led downturn that occur at that  e  and fundament in the eme are now stronger than was then the case   in addit  chines domest demand has remain quit robust of late  and this has like help to support growth in emerg asia   as shown in the top left panel of exhibit    oil price have continu to soar with the spot price of wti close ye day at      per barrel   the far date futur price has climb to about the same level   our forecast for the path of oil price is now rough     a barrel higher than at the  e of the januari chart show   divin the caus of this stagger rise in oil price is no doubt ground on which angel fear to tread  but we continu to assert brave that the primari driver of higher oil price is constrain  and price inelast  oil suppli coupl with relat strong  and price inelast  oil demand   these deep featur of the oil market   along with stress geopolit condit in mani oil produc countri  rise product cost  and concern about the reliabl of medium  to long run suppli   have sent oil price spiral upward   as shown in the last column of the middl tabl  the increas in oil price appear to have contribut to modest declin in oil consumpt in the advanc economi  includ the unit state  line      but oil consumpt has continu to move up in the emerg market economi  especi in china  line    and the middl east  line      consum in mani eme have been shield from rise price by govern fuel subsidi   the econom and fiscal cost of such subsidi are becom increas burdensom  howev  prompt some countri  includ china late last week  to allow domest fuel price to move toward world level   as seen on the top right  oil inventori in oecd countri have declin over the past year and a half   unfortun  littl inform is avail about the behavior of inventori outsid of oecd countri   the bottom left panel show that the rise in global oil product sinc      has signific lag the expans of world gdp  weight by oil consumpt   inde  product has remain relat flat dure most of that period   notabl  howev  the lack of oil product is not due to geolog constraint   data on year of prove reserv  shown on the bottom right  are at rough the same level as a decad ago   but those reserv are now concentr in area where product is constrain by acut geopolit risk  uncertainti about properti right  inadequ invest  and high product cost   turn to your next exhibit  nonfuel commod price have also risen signific on averag sinc your last chart show  with most of the increas come june                 of     in the first few month of the year   here  too  we believ that the elev level of price is a result main of strong and sustain global demand  lag suppli respons  and rise product cost   consist with this observ  inventori of key commod  shown in the middl left panel  have trend down in recent year   it bear emphas  howev  that nonfuel commod price certain have not move in lockstep with each other   as seen in the bottom left panel  the price of corn has surg to new high  support by ethanol demand and  more recent  as advers weather in the midwest has endang a substanti fraction of this year   s crop   in contrast  the price of wheat has fallen back from it recent peak  as improv grow condit in australia seem like to boost suppli   for metal  the price of zinc has move down signific sinc it peak in late       as new smelter have come on line   the price of copper has move sideway   but at a high level   over the past two year  as prospect increas in suppli have not yet materi   a number of other explan for the recent run up in oil and other commod price have also been advanc  includ the possibl that increas purchas by    specul    in commod futur market may be play an import role   given the magnitud of the financi flow into these market  we are hesit to slam the door complet on this explan  but our work find littl support evid  as note on the top right  price of a number of commod that are not trade in futur market have also risen substanti   second  a sustain increas in demand by investor would suggest that inventori should be rise  instead  as i have note  inventori are now relat tight   final  we see no evid that the posit taken by noncommerci trader in futur market actual predict commod price  for exampl  such posit for light sweet crude oil on the new york mercantil exchang have been rough flat sinc mid        two other frequent cite explan for the rise in commod price are the depreci of the dollar and declin in interest rate   the middl right panel show the correl of the broad nomin dollar with oil price and with an index of nonfuel commod price   both correl are negat over most of the sampl  impli that depreci of the dollar have tend to happen at the same  e as rise in commod price   while these correl have becom more negat sinc mid       they remain within the rang seen in recent year  and interpret the direct of causal for this relationship is difficult   also  as bill note  the dollar has been relat stabl over the past sever month  but oil price have continu their upward climb   similar plot of correl of interest rate with commod price  shown on the bottom right  are quit noisi and fail to point to ani clear conclus   as shown in exhibit    the run up in commod price has continu to lift headlin consum price inflat in both the advanc foreign economi and the emerg market   we expect that inflat abroad will remain elev in the near term but eventu move back down as slower global growth reduc pressur on resourc and as commod price flatten out  consist with quot from futur market    of cours  one clear risk to these project is that commod price may  yet again  confound our expect and continu rise   anoth risk is that the high rate of inflat now be record may becom embed in inflat june                 of     expect   as shown in the top right panel  measur of long term inflat compens have recent edg up in the euro area and increas more mark in canada   in recent week  major foreign central bank have intensifi their inflat fight rhetor   notabl  the ecb has warn that it may rais rate at it next meet  and in the unit kingdom  mervyn king   in his letter to the chancellor   underscor his determin to ensur that inflat remain contain   as shown on the bottom left  we now assum that both the ecb and the bank of england will rais rate in the second half of this year  compar with the near term cut we had anticip in the april  book   in addit  we now see the bank of canada keep polici on hold   in the emerg market economi  includ mexico and china  the bottom right panel   increas in inflat have larg been driven by rise food price  which account for a substanti share of consum expenditur   policymak in the eme have taken step to slow the rise in food price  with some countri introduc price control and export ban on agricultur good   but offici have also reli on more orthodox polici to combat inflat  includ rais polici rate and hike reserv requir  inde  over the intermeet period  monetari polici was tighten in a rang of emerg market economi  includ mexico  brazil  china  india  russia  and hungari   as shown in the top left panel of exhibit    the path of the broad real dollar is now just a littl weaker than we anticip at the  e of the januari chart show   we continu to expect the dollar to depreci at an annual rate of   percent through the forecast period  reflect persist downward pressur associ with the current account deficit   this depreci is project to come larg against emerg market currenc  includ the chines renminbi   which have move less sinc the dollar   s peak in earli        it   s safe to say that core import price inflat  on the right  has come in substanti higher than we project in januari   incorpor the bls month data for april and may  we now see core import price in the second quarter surg at an annual rate of      percent  the fastest rise in two decad   this increas  which come on the heel of an   percent jump in the first quarter  was heavili concentr in materi intens good and suggest a much more rapid and  perhap  stronger effect from the run up in commod price than we saw in the past   condit on nonfuel commod price flatten out  core import price inflat should declin to less than   percent next year   final  sum up what these develop mean for u s  activ  we now see the contribut from net export to u s  real gdp growth  line   in the tabl  as like to exceed   percentag point in the second quarter  as export expand at a smart pace  support by the lower dollar  and import contract sharpli   this mark weak in import reflect both a steep drop in real oil import and a continu declin in import of core good  reflect sluggish u s  gdp growth and rise price of import commod    the posit contribut from net export moder to   percentag point in the second half of this year and to    percentag point in        while the pace of export growth is project to remain strong  at june                 of     abov   percent  import should gradual acceler as the u s  economi recov  larri will now continu our present
last week  the washington post ran a front page stori with the headlin     whi we   re gloomier than the economi      like the author of the post articl  we too have notic the differ between what peopl are say about the economi in survey and what they appar are produc and spend   start first with the survey indic  the top left panel of exhibit   plot the plung in the michigan index of consum sen ent  which is far deeper than can be explain by it usual predictor such as labor market condit  inflat  and the stock market   the panel to the right plot two of the most  e survey of busi attitud  which continu to suggest that the respond are pessimist about overal busi condit   meanwhil  as shown in the middl left panel  although privat payrol continu to shrink  the declin have been much smaller than we were expect and  as you can see from the shade area  if you look veri close    laughter  much smaller than the one that occur dure the last recess   in term of spend data  the most strike piec of news was the upward revis to earlier retail sale figur   at the  e of the april  book  real outlay for consum good other than motor vehicl appear to be move sideway  the red line in the middl right panel    howev  the black line show that accord to the latest es    which  of cours  are still subject to addit revis   spend rose rapid in march and april and climb further in may   with these number  we revis up appreci our near term es  of the growth rate of real pce good other than motor vehicl  the inset box    on the busi side  the bottom left tabl  shipment of nondefens capit good  exclud transport  rose further in april  and new order jump   in addit  outlay for construct of nonresidenti build  the bottom line of the tabl  continu to climb in april   all told  these indic suggest stronger busi spend than we had anticip in our april forecast   a potenti import downsid develop may be emerg in the motor vehicl sector   the bottom right panel   where  accord to our industri contact  sale of light vehicl appear to be plummet in june   whether this is just a reaction to the surg in oil price that will be contain within the auto sector or whether it   s a canari in the coal mine point to someth far more serious for the entir economi remain to be seen  but it certain has grab our attent and highlight a downsid risk to our project   exhibit   focus on the overal gdp forecast through      and some of the key factor that inform our think about the outlook   we had a lot of move part to deal with this round  and the upper panel summar how we put them togeth  first  in light of the incom inform  we revis up our forecast for the first two quarter of this year  especi the second quarter   we now think that real gdp growth came in at an annual rate of     percent in the first quarter and pick up to a     percent pace in the second quarter   as you know  earlier this year we put in some june                 of     judgment adjust to the forecast  which reflect a combin of the tendenc for negat model residu to be correl dure cyclic downturn as well as the macro effect of financi turmoil and uncertainti that are not well captur by our model   we have interpret some of the recent spend surpris as suggest that we went too heavi on such effect in the april  book  and so we have temper them in this project   that said  we still anticip that some of these influenc will show through to spend  especi in the household sector  and we expect the economi to be on a veri subdu growth path for the next few quarter   as i will discuss short  residenti invest is still project to be a drag on econom growth well into next year   moreov  with hous price expect to fall through the end of next year  the ratio of household net worth to incom remain on a downward trajectori  reduc some of the wherewith for consum spend  household purchas power also is be held down by the surg in oil price that nathan discuss  the middl left panel    as shown in the inset box  by our reckon the increas in the spot and futur price of wti sinc the april  book subtract about   percentag point from real gdp growth in both      and       with much of the effect work through pce   despit these negat influenc  if the stori end here  the economi still would be oper with a somewhat higher util rate   that is  a smaller gdp gap   than in the april  book   in light of this consider  as well as the less favor outlook for inflat that bill will discuss  we have condit this forecast on a tighter path for monetari polici than the one in the previous  book   as you can see in the middl right panel  by the end of next year the feder fund rate is     basi point higher than in the april  book   i should note here that we also have rais our es  of the growth rate of potenti gdp  which bill will discuss short  becaus we view our revis es  of potenti as mere the staff   s catch up with what individu and firm were alreadi expect  these revis result in correspond adjust to the growth rate of real gdp go forward   all told  as illustr in the bottom left panel  after increas substanti fa  in the first half of the year  real gdp is now project to grow at an annual rate of   percent in the second half of       a bit less than in our previous project   in       real gdp is expect to increas     percent  about    percentag point less than in the april  book   the bottom line of the forecast is perhap most easili seen by the path of the gdp gap   as shown in the bottom right panel  the gap start out the project period be much narrow than in the april forecast   by the fourth quarter of       howev  the gap is essenti the same as in the april  book   after that high altitud flyover of the project  the next two exhibit swoop down for a closer look at some of the detail   exhibit   focus on the hous sector  with demand weak  the overhang of unsold new and exist singl famili home   the vacanc rate   has soar  put downward pressur on price   as shown to the right  the ofheo purchas onli index of hous price fell at an annual  of     june                 of     percent in the first quarter of       and we expect home price to continu declin around this pace into next year   anecdot and common sens suggest that mani prospect homebuy  leeri of purchas an asset whose valu is fall  are wait for hous price to bottom out befor enter the market   this behavior further sap alreadi sag hous demand   we don   t have direct survey evid for this supposit  howev  the middl panel present some suggest number taken from the michigan survey  first  as shown by the black line in the panel to the left  the share of current homeown who think the price of their home fell over the past    month jump dramat through earli this year and remain elev   in addit  the share that think the price will fall over the next    month also has drift up   the panel on the right  which is base on work by my colleagu claudia sahm  look at the view of renter   here the blue bar show the percentag of renter in the michigan survey who say that now is a bad  e to buy a hous   the red line plot an es  of hous price overvalu deriv from a price   rent model that we follow   as you can see  as hous becam increas overvalu  more and more renter becam pessimist about homebuy   appar for afford reason   of cours  relat price are not the onli influenc on afford   general macroeconom and credit market condit also are import   thus  even though the extent of overvalu has diminish so far this year  renter  at least thus far  remain quit pessimist about homebuy condit   so what bring us out of this seem death spiral   if hous price follow the expect trajectori  we es  that they will move into rough align with their long run relationship with rent earli next year and then  as typic happen  overshoot somewhat   as the market return to someth closer to equilibrium  prospect homebuy who had been wait out the price bubbl in rental quarter should begin to see hous as more afford and be more will to buy into owner occupi hous   as that happen  the rate of declin in hous price should slow  and sale of singl famili home  the bottom left panel  should start to improv   with demand improv and the inventori overhang be work off  we expect hous start to level out and then begin to gain altitud slowli in        exhibit   present the medium term outlook for consum spend and busi invest   start with pce  real spend is project to fall  on balanc  in the second half of this year   tax rebat push up the third quarter and creat a pothol in the fourth quarter as rebat relat spend drop off   more fundament  spend is held back by the effect of higher oil price on household purchas power  the ongo hit to household wealth from fall home price and earlier declin in equiti price  and the restrain effect of financi turmoil and unusu pessimist consum sen ent   in       spend pick up as mani of these factor begin to improv  but at     percent  the increas is still rather tepid   the middl panel focus on busi outlay for equip and softwar   real spend on the high tech compon  the   bar  has slow sharpli this year june                 of     and is expect

the bea report that outlay in the drill and mine compon  the   bar  dip in the first quarter  anecdot report suggest that this may have reflect bottleneck stem from shortag of skill labor and suppli

exhibit    review our assumpt about aggreg suppli  as you can see from the first two row of the tabl at the top  we now assum that potenti output growth will hold steadi at about     percent per year over the forecast period  about   percentag point per year higher from      to      than we had assum in the april  book   this upward revis is split rough equal between structur product growth  line   and    and trend hour  line   and      the middl two panel provid the reason for our chang   the left panel show the differ between actual product growth  the black line  and a simul from our standard model  the   line  use the pace of structur product growth that we had assum in april   as you can see  labor product growth in recent quarter has been stronger than the model would have expect given the deceler in econom activ   as shown in the inset box  a pure statist model base on a kalman filter would have respond to the recent data by rais it es  of structur product growth     percentag point   becaus we place less weight on data that have not yet been through an annual revis  we general tend to revis our own es  by less than the amount suggest by such model  moreov  the kalman filter model   not take into account the steep rise in energi price  which we think might subtract a bit from structur product growth in come year   nevertheless  we did think it appropri to nudg up our product growth trend a littl   the   line in the middl right panel show a similar model simul for the labor forc particip rate  again use our previous es  trend   here  too  the incom data have been a littl higher june                 of     than the model would have expect   one can think of potenti explan for this   for exampl  it may be that strain on household budget associ with rise cost of food and energi have increas labor forc particip among secondari earner  an influenc not captur by the model   we are not readi to back away from our basic stori that demograph will continu to put downward pressur on the particip rate over  e  but we did slight rais our assum trend in respons to the recent data   the key element of the labor market forecast are shown in the bottom panel   as indic to the left  nonfarm payrol employ  the black line  is project to declin about        per month through the rest of this year   as the economi improv in       we expect payrol to start rise again  although at a pace below our es  of trend employ growth  the   line  for most of the year   as shown in the inset box in the bottom right panel  we expect the unemploy rate to drop back in june from it suspici high may read  which would leav the averag jobless rate in the second quarter at     percent   howev  with employ declin project to continu for a while longer  we expect the unemploy rate to drift up to     percent by earli next year and remain near that level through the end of        exhibit    present the near term inflat outlook   as you can see in the top left panel  the recent data on consum price have come in a littl lower than we had expect at the  e of the april  book   as shown on line    core pce price rose onli     percent in april  and base on the latest cpi and ppi read  we expect an increas of     percent in may   as a result  we have mark down our es  of core pce inflat in the second quarter by     percentag point  to an annual rate of   percent   total pce price  line    have risen at a substanti fa  pace than core price  but here  too  the current quarter forecast is a littl lower than in our previous project  both becaus of the lower core inflat and becaus the sharp increas in oil price have been slow to feed through to finish energi price  despit this recent news  we expect inflat to rise sharpli over the next few month  in part  this reflect our judgment that core price were held down in the first half by some factor that will not persist into the second half   in addit  as shown to the right  we expect increas in food and energi price to push up the twelv month chang in the total pce price index more than   percentag point over the next sever month  to about     percent   the remain panel of the exhibit focus on the project for energi and food price   as shown by the black line in the middl left panel  rise crude oil price have push up retail gasolin price sharpli so far this year   even so  margin are still relat low  and we expect further sizabl increas in pump price in come month   spot price for natur gas  the red line  have also risen notic  reflect it substitut with crude oil   meanwhil  price for crop  plot in black at the right  have move well abov the level at the  e of the april  book  main in respons to the sever flood in the midwest   the higher price for grain have also push up livestock price  the blue line   although recent june                 of     increas in suppli have temper this rise somewhat   in both case  futur price indic that market particip expect these price to flatten out at about their current level   the bottom two panel show our forecast for overal consum food and energi price   base on current futur price  we expect energi price inflat to move yet higher next quarter befor slow to a pace close to zero in        we expect food price to show a similar   albeit less pronounc   pattern  with the four quarter chang peak at about   percent this quarter and then deceler to a pace of     percent next year   the upper panel of your next exhibit examin the implic of the recent increas in energi and other commod price for core inflat   the first thing to note is that these increas are show through to produc    cost   as indic in the top left panel  the produc price index for core intermedi materi  the black line  has acceler yet again and was up more than   percent over the past twelv month  with especi larg increas for metal product and energi intens materi   likewis  the diffus index for price paid from the institut for suppli manag   s manufactur survey  the red line  has climb steadili sinc late last year   as nathan note  rise commod price have been an import sourc of the sizabl increas in import price shown to the right   in addit  higher energi price have boost the cost of ship good from manufactur to wholesal and retail   as you can see in the middl left panel  the ppis for both truck and rail transport have acceler sharpli over the past year or so   obvious  a key question is the extent to which these higher cost will be pass through to core consum price   the panel to the right provid rough es  of the size of these pass through from our suit of econometr model  with the effect of energi price on core pce inflat shown by the blue bar and the combin effect of import price and other commod price indic by the red bar   as you can see  these effect add more than     percentag point to our forecast of core inflat this year  with energi and import price expect to deceler  the contribut of these factor to core inflat step down to   percentag point next year   in contrast to the evid of greater cost pressur from commod price  we   ve seen no sign of acceler in labor cost   the bottom left panel plot the three main measur of labor compens that we follow   none of them suggest that employ have experienc a step up in the pace of compens growth  and given the weaker labor market in our project  we don   t think that worker will do much better over the next year and a half either   accord  we expect the rise in trend unit labor cost  shown in the tabl to the right  to hold steadi at about   percent per year over the project period   in put togeth our forecast  we   ve also had to make some decis about how to interpret the recent data on inflat expect   the subject of your final exhibit   as shown in the top left panel  some measur of short run inflat expect have jump sharpli in respons to the run up in energi and food price this year   in particular  the reuter michigan measur of one year ahead expect  the blue line  rose abov   percent in may and remain high in the june                 of     preliminari june survey   meanwhil  as shown to the right  indic of long run inflat expect have rang from rough unchang to higher sinc late april  as i alreadi note  the recent compens data do not suggest that higher inflat expect have start to push up wage increas   howev  on balanc  we view the data as consist with a slight updrift in the under long run inflat expect that drive actual inflat  and we have carri this updrift into the project period   all told  we expect core pce inflat  line   of the middl left tabl  to step up to a     percent annual rate in the second half of this year  push up by the effect of higher input cost and the increas in inflat expect   in       core inflat is project to step back down to    percent  as the effect of deceler energi and import price and a wider unemploy gap offset a small further updrift in expect inflat   we have taken onli a small signal from the appar deterior in expect inflat  but we view the possibl that inflat expect will becom unmoor in respons to the persist high rate of headlin inflat as a risk to our forecast   accord  as indic in the box to the right  we includ in the  book an altern simul that assum that long run inflat expect move up   percentag point relat to baselin in the third quarter   consist with our usual practic  monetari polici in this simul is assum to respond accord to the es  taylor rule   both wage and price are affect by these higher inflat expect  and as you can see by the   line in the middl panel at the bottom  core inflat rise to     percent in       almost    percentag point higher than baselin   monetari polici respond in this simul by rais the feder fund rate more than in the baselin forecast   as a result of this addit tighten  the unemploy rate declin a bit more slowli  and core inflat moder to about    percent in          will now continu the present

your project for headlin pce inflat in the second half of      have been revis up more than   percentag point  to around     to    percent  larg as a result of the surg in price of energi and agricultur commod   howev  in view of better than expect news on core pce inflat  the central tendenc of your project for core inflat dure the second half  shown in the third set of row  revis up onli     percentag point   look ahead to       tabl    the middl column   you continu to expect growth to pick up as the drag from the hous sector dissip and credit condit eas   the midpoint of the central tendenc of your forecast for real gdp growth next year is     percent  the same as in april and the same as the staff   s current forecast  your growth forecast for       the third column  are a shade lower than in april  and the central tendenc of your forecast for the unemploy rate is a touch higher  perhap becaus a number of you assum more polici tighten over the forecast period in order to counter heighten inflat pressur   the midpoint of the central tendenc of your project for the unemploy rate edg down from about     percent in      to about    percent in        your commentari suggest that mani  albeit not all  of you view those rate as a quarter point to a half point abov your es  of the nairu   the third and fourth set of row indic that most of you see overal and core inflat stay abov   percent next year  but by       the extend period of econom slack and the assum level out of energi price push down overal and core inflat to around    to   percent  for core inflat  the central tendenc and rang are a touch higher than you forecast in april   for the first  e sinc you start these project last octob  the upper end of the rang of your project of total inflat in      exceed   percent  albeit margin   thus  mani of you project that  at the end of the forecast period  the economi will still be oper with some slack and real output growth will be slight abov the growth rate of potenti   the continu presenc of slack suggest that you anticip that inflat will continu to edg lower in      and  given the assumpt of appropri monetari polici  impli that you typic anticip that inflat will still be a bit higher in      than you see as consist with price stabil   exhibit   present your view on the risk and uncertainti in the outlook   as shown by the   bar in the top two panel  a larg major of you continu to perceiv the risk to growth as weight to the downsid  the left panel   and mani june                 of     judg that the degre of uncertainti regard prospect for econom activ is unusu high  the right panel   although the number of you see uncertainti about growth as elev has declin slight over the first half of the year   in your narrat  you attribut the downsid risk primarili to the potenti for steeper declin in hous price and persist financi strain  which through a further tighten of credit condit could exert an unexpect larg restraint on household and busi spend   although your view of the risk regard growth have shift onli modest  the distribut of your percept of the risk regard inflat  shown in the bottom two panel  has chang signific so far this year  as shown in the lower left panel  about three quarter of you now see the risk to the outlook for overal inflat as skew to the upsid   in your commentari  you typic point to continu increas in energi and food price and an upward drift in inflat expect as the main reason for the upsid risk to inflat   in addit  as shown to the right  the number of particip who perceiv the degre of uncertainti regard the inflat outlook as larger than usual has risen consider   turn to exhibit    as i note  your project suggest that you do not see the economi as have fulli settl into a steadi state by        the dynam of the economi evid are such that  follow moder larg shock  it can take quit a few year to converg back to steadi state  a view that is captur by mani econometr model such as frb us and is also reflect in the current  book forecast   thus  the three year forecast horizon current use by the committe   not necessarili allow your forecast to reveal fulli your view of the steadi state characterist of the economi and your view of the rate of inflat consist with the dual mandat   recogn this  the subcommitte on communic recent sent the committe a memo outlin sever possibl approach to provid longer term project   the approach are summar in the lower panel   one option would be for particip to extend their entir set of project out to  say  five year   under this option  particip would be ask to submit project for econom variabl in year   as well as in year     you would also expand your individu forecast narrat to explain the trajectori of the economi and inflat over the five year project period   this approach would have the advantag of provid the basi for a complet present of the committe   s medium term and long term view   the princip disadvantag of this option is the relat heavi burden it place on committe particip to make project cover five year   anoth disadvantag is that in some circumst   that is  follow a veri larg shock   the economi still may not be in a steadi state after five year   a second option is for particip to continu to submit econom project and narrat out to three year as now but also to provid es  of the valu of output growth  unemploy  and inflat in year   under the assumpt of appropri monetari polici   under this approach  you might wish to collect and publish long term project onli for output growth  unemploy  and total inflat  and not for core inflat  in order to emphas that total inflat rather june                 of     than core inflat is the appropri metric for the longer run goal of price stabil  this second approach presum place less demand on your  e than the first but it would make for a less integr present   it would also suffer from the same defect as the first approach  in that the figur you submit might not reveal the steadi state characterist of the economi after a larg shock   in a third approach  you would augment your three year project with project of the averag valu for output growth  unemploy  and total inflat over the period five to ten year ahead   this approach would have the advantag of more direct reveal your es  of the key oper characterist of the economi   that is  the paramet relat to product capac and your inflat object   it might also be less demand of your  e in the sens that you would need to project fewer  e period than in the first option   on the other hand  it might be more difficult in that you would need to consid like trend in demograph variabl and product further ahead than is ordinarili necessari for monetari polici make   moreov  it is possibl that some of the paramet you would be suppli for the period five to ten year ahead might take on differ valu than would appli to the medium term that is relev for monetari polici   in your comment in the upcom econom go round  you may wish to express your view on whether you support public of longer run project and  if so  which of the approach you prefer   you might also wish to comment on the desir of conduct a trial run with long term project   say  in octob   befor go live with long term project  perhap in januari   that conclud our prepar remark
thank you      are there question for our colleagu  presid
if i may  i would like to ask nathan  mr  chairman  about exhibit   and exhibit     particular noteworthi is that exhibit   is the forecast period show a signific declin in inflat in the emerg market economi   i am wonder what that is base on  do we have a sens of capac util or slack  if it is all reliabl  or is it base on a sens of commod price   what is that notic down swoop
you are ask particular with respect to the emerg market economi
yes  sir   in the top left hand panel
in the process of prepar our forecast  we do come up with es  of slack for the emerg market economi  but we are not inclin to put a whole lot of weight on them   the concept of an output gap is not realli a well defin construct for  say  china  nevertheless  these economi will be grow a littl more slowli than they have in the past  and some of the pressur on resourc associ with that growth may abat a bit   i think that is at least a piec of the stori of what you see here as the declin   but at the end of the day  it has to be a stori about commod price   food price and energi price have push this up  depend on exact which emerg market economi you   re in  food price will rang anywher from    percent to    percent of their basket   as long as those food price and energi price are move up dramat  you are go to see rapid increas in inflat   so the declin that you are see in this chart realli is condit first and foremost on commod price flatten out   i wish i had a better stori
you don   t know how happi i am to see global thing come first   but are you say that a great deal of uncertainti is attach to that forecast
oh  absolut
then  in exhibit   on core import price  i guess it is pretti much the same answer   one would expect that these would fall of their own weight after a while
yes   the spike that we have seen is driven particular by commod price   the depreci of the dollar has play a secondari role  so the declin in core import price inflat to below   percent next year is condit crucial on commod price flatten out and the dollar not depreci as rapid as it has over the past few year
mr  chairman  if i could ask just one other question   of larri  i think it was   on the hous exhibit   i am wonder if we are not in the eye of the storm here   we june                 of     have had the first wave of buckl at the knee   or wors  cascad   if you talk to the homebuild  they are  of cours  the most depress group imagin   but they are wait for anoth shoe to drop  which is the foreclosur on alt as   i   m wonder what our opinion is on that   thing have calm down a bit  but we still have anoth phase of the storm come through  which is what i just describ   what are our assumpt about that
we expect foreclosur to rise   and to rise appreci   one thing we have done in think about hous price is  in effect  to build in some extra hous price depreci  abov and beyond what our price   rent model would want to say  to reflect the kind of factor that you are talk about   the foreclosur  what that mean then for the vacanc rate  and what that   to hous price  particular in certain part of the countri   i see presid   nod her head becaus california  for sure  is one place where that could clear be an import factor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to ask a question about inflat and labor compens   at the last meet  mani of us  myself includ  mention that labor compens had not been grow veri strong  and we took that as a possibl comfort comment about inflationari pressur not be too strong   that comment was in this present and ye day   s  too   now  statist  isn   t it the case that labor compens is not realli a good predictor of inflat   it realli tend to lag more   so how should we think about interpret that lack of acceler for inflat expect and pressur   feel free to disput that
no  i agre with you   i think our model have been surpris by the low rate of compens growth   one way to think about it is that in the past we might have seen june                 of     higher headlin inflat pass through more quick to compens growth   as in the      s  when those wage   price spiral were realli led by price  but then wage contribut by follow  so far we haven   t seen ani sign that higher headlin inflat has been put upward pressur on compens cost   i think there   s a risk   we obvious includ the simul becaus we think there   s a risk that could happen in the futur  but to date we have not seen evid that that   s been the case   there are a number of reason to think that thing now might be differ than they use to be   for exampl  just a structur reason  union are less power than they use to be  a much smaller share of the work forc is union   in the     s there were all sort of automat cost of live adjust claus   even when there weren   t  there were big catch up for past inflat  anoth structur reason might be that the minimum wage was higher in the     s  and it is lower in real term now   i think more general this fit in with the general notion that inflat expect are less respons to immedi shock in headlin inflat than perhap they use to be
from a forecast perspect  presid    i think you   re right   i don   t think model that reli simpli on labor cost to predict price are veri sound in term of their forecast abil versus just a plain old price   price type of phillip curv or a price type of phillip curv augment with price expect   part of the reason may be that the compens data themselv are just so poor that  in fact  it   s realli a measur problem   it   s not that you would argu that labor cost  which are a veri signific chunk of overal busi cost  don   t matter   i do think you can probabl take  and we certain have taken  some limit comfort from the fact that we have not yet seen an acceler of labor cost   that like indic that you are not serious behind the curv alreadi or that someth is bake in the cake   i don   t think you can necessarili take comfort from the well behav compens thus far that you are not go to june                 of     confront some inflat problem go forward   it   s more that the compens data don   t suggest that you   ve fallen serious behind the curv   in some sens we see the higher inflat expect read themselv  or at least some of the mix to slight higher inflat expect data  as suggest that you   re face a bit more of an inflationari difficulti over the next two year than we thought two month ago would be the case
just a quick follow up  mr  chairman   to what extent do you imput the kind of insecur that come from competit and broader outsourc   if you imput anyth there in term of wage behavior here  to what extent are you assum go forward that the increas in wage be paid elsewher might bleed into our wage behavior here
well  we don   t account for that in our compens model   that said  as i mention  the model have been surpris about how low compens has been   that would be one possibl explan for that residu   if that factor were to diminish  it would impli that that residu would diminish  but we haven   t built such an effect into our forecast
other question   presid bullard
i want to ask a question about exhibit    which talk about factor affect the gdp forecast   the second bullet point mention judgment adjust  which were temper this  e relat to last  e   last  e i describ this as a regim switch model  and you said that was perhap too much   the economi sort of switch into this recess like behavior  and we know that the economi might behav differ in that environ   but do we now think the probabl of switch into that behavior is smaller   what is the forecast   is the forecast some kind of averag between this high state and this low state   that   s what you said june                 of     here   it has temper our judgment adjust   it sound as though there is less probabl of switch into that state
it   s hard for me to think of it in these probabilist term   i would say that we still think that the economi is go to have these negat effect that are associ with period of low growth   now  whether that is precis a recess or simpli just a low growth period  it   s hard for me to distinguish
but the rational is that you switch into the recess and you get the correl from
yes   the way to think about it is that we switch into a low growth period   whether it is precis a recess or just simpli a low growth period shouldn   t be the demarc point   we still think that the economi is oper in a low growth period   there is probabl not as much sever to that low growth period  but we still think that is where it   s oper
but then you   re switch into the low growth period  and then we take the correl for low growth period  which i guess are mayb not as sever as in recess period
just as a factoid to throw out here  one of my colleagu on the board staff  jeremi nalewaik  has es  some of these model look at switch between high growth period and low growth period  where a low growth period   not necessarili have to be a recess   use the gdp data through the first quarter plus our forecast for second quarter gdp  which is now at an annual rate of     percent  his model still would suggest that there   s an    percent probabl that the economi is oper in a low growth state   so i think that it was a fair thing for us to continu to have the judgment adjust  which by the way aren   t just june                 of     recess like effect   they also includ financi turmoil effect and some uncertainti thing   i think it   s a fair thing for us to have includ those  but as i say  we   ve temper them
i want to make sure i understand what you just said   your respons suggest that there   s a third state that   s even wors than we are in now  that one could possibl go into  and that what you   ve temper is the probabl that we   re in that worst state
again  we want to step back a bit from take this regim switch too serious as impli that there are just two state of the world or mayb three state of the world  there are lot of differ state of the world   what we are tri to do is look at the residu in our spend equat and ask how they behav in various kind of period   in period with substanti increas in the unemploy rate  weak payrol employ  and big declin in consum sen ent  there also are substanti negat residu in our spend equat  particular on the consum spend side   that is still built into this forecast   so we have not interpret the last six week of data as suggest that recess concern are all behind us  that we were just complet wrong  and that we are now on a much stronger growth path than we previous thought   if  in fact  you   re worri that the incom data might be signal a stronger growth path  then i would take a look at the    upsid risk    scenario that we show in the  book  there we take out all of our spend residu   those that are incorpor becaus we thought we might be in this low growth or recessionari like state and the one that are associ with financi turmoil   and you get growth in that case that is a littl abov potenti growth and a path for the fed fund rate that is even steeper than the current market expect  now  although we kept these negat residu in our forecast  we did have to acknowledg the fact that under aggreg demand appear stronger than we thought it was go to be at june                 of     the  e of the last fomc meet   there is an under strengthen of aggreg demand in this forecast that show up as an increas in the equilibrium fund rate of rough    percentag point   so we   re tri to acknowledg the strength of the incom data  but we want to be clear that this forecast still emb some signific negat add factor on spend go forward  that could be wrong   mayb the incom data are signal that we are just fundament wrong about that aspect of the forecast   as larri show  given the stun declin in consum sen ent  the continu weak busi sen ent  and the fact that the unemploy rate has risen as much as it has and has done this in the past onli in period of recess  we felt comfort still present you with a forecast that anticip that aggreg demand is go to be veri weak over the next sever quarter
i don   t want to belabor this too much   i was curious about what you temper   i think presid bullard was look for whether you temper the probabl on state     i   m with you in not want to place a lot of probabl on n state  but it sound as though the growth trajectori   you know  the magnitud of the add factor you were think of   has been drawn back a littl   is that a fair character
that   s correct   and the  e   so there are two aspect   one is that we have interpret some of the surpris as a persist strengthen in aggreg demand that we had not anticip   the other is that the economi is not as weak now  and therefor the bounceback in activ next year won   t be as strong   as larri said  there are a lot of move part  but both of those consider are built into this forecast
thank you   ani other question   okay   we are about readi for our go round   let me remind you about the propos to add a long term line to our june                 of     project   the rational for do so is that the current system  sn   t necessarili let the public know what our view on the steadi state of the economi are   to show my own hand  i think it would be help to add mayb one line that said in five to seven year out what we think the economi would do   but i think it is import for those of us who want to express an opinion to do so   if there is interest  as   mention  we can do a trial run in octob  and we won   t have to make a final decis about whether to go forward until octob or decemb or perhap later depend on how thing go   but if you have a view on that  pleas add that to your commentari   so let   s begin with the econom go round  and we   ll start with presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i will begin my remark this afternoon with a brief updat on the condit in our district   overal  district econom activ continu to expand moder  with strengthen energi  agricultur  and export manufactur more than offset the soft in our hous  retail sale  and other type of manufactur activ  district labor market continu to perform reason well   while job growth has slow over the past few month  unemploy remain veri low  and mani sector continu to have difficulti find worker  especi skill one   evid on wage pressur is mix  although wage pressur have moder somewhat in our beig book survey  some recent labor union contract have built in rise profil for hour wage increas over the term of the contract   rise energi and commod input price are continu to negat affect our district econom activ  report from busi suggest that higher energi and food price are be quick pass on to the custom now   howev  busi are have mix success in pass on other cost increas  result in some sever eros in margin and profit in some of the june                 of     firm   to illustr some of the cost   price dynam  i would like to take just a minut and relat the recent experi of one of our branch director  who oper a multi line manufactur firm   i mention this becaus i am hear it more and more   in addit to rise fuel price  his busi has seen a doubl in steel cost sinc januari  with juli quot on steel tube up an addit    percent   in respons  his compani recent announc a price increas of    to    percent across a rang of product   competitor immedi match or exceed his price increas   notabl  he made these price increas despit a declin in new order in may   he also note that import price from china that he has seen have risen    percent this year and that ocean freight price have risen about    percent   as a result  custom who previous bought chines product are now purchas u s  manufactur good   it is interest   i talk with some of the folk at union pacif  and their shipment into the midwest have drop slight  but their shipment out have increas about   to   percent   so that is what is go on in the region  more broad  turn to the nation economi  i have revis up my growth es  for the first half of       but it has made littl chang in my longer run outlook   compar with the  book  i see somewhat stronger growth in the second half of this year and somewhat weaker growth next year and in        most of the differ from the  book in      and      come from the polici path assumpt   i assum that polici accommod is remov at a more rapid pace than   the  book   recent econom data suggest that  although downsid risk to growth remain  they have diminish   i continu to judg that the potenti spillov effect from the financi distress have understand been overes  in this committe   s recent decis and in  book forecast in recent month   in my view  the greater risk to the outlook come from rise energi and commod price and less from the june                 of     financi distress as we go forward   in my view  current polici accommod is greater than need to address these risk  as i indic at the last meet  i believ that the upsid risk to inflat have increas consider over the past sever month   like the  book  i expect both overal and core pce inflat to move higher in the second half of this year   if this happen and we maintain the current level of the fund rate  i believ we are like to see further eros in inflat expect  which will undermin our credibl with financi market and the public   in this event  i judg we will great increas the likelihood that we will need to rais rate more aggress  take rate abov neutral  in order to achiev our longer run inflat object  and that is of signific concern to me  mr  chairman  turn to the issu of long term project  let me comment that i have felt somewhat constrain by the current three year horizon for our quarter project   of the option present by the subcommitte  i am most comfort with provid es  of the valu for total inflat  output growth  and unemploy at which the economi is like to converg   i am not sure  howev  how we want to label these es   if they are includ in the tabl   i understand that put these es  out might be interpret as a move closer to inflat target  but i think that this is a bridg we are readi to cross sinc we adopt the enhanc project process   the other option seem less desir   given the resourc requir  by my staff at least  i doubt that we could provid a meaning forecast at a four year or five year horizon  and i am not sure how project for averag valu over a period of five to ten year ahead would be interpret by the public   in my view  appropri polici should be expect to return the economi to it long run equilibrium over a three to five year period  with the length of the period depend on the natur of the shock   set out a five to ten year horizon could june                 of     be constru as a weaken in our commit to achiev our mandat in a  e manner  thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the intermeet period has been full of surpris   real side data came in consider stronger than i anticip  so like the  book i have adjust up my forecast for growth in the current quarter   at the same  e  the advers fundament that will weigh on household and busi spend go forward have grown somewhat heavier overal  and that has prompt me to revis down my growth forecast for the second half   on the inflat front  read on core inflat surpris to the downsid  nonetheless  given that the price of mani commod have continu to rise more rapid than i anticip and that some measur of inflat expect have turn up  i have adjust up my inflat forecast for       consider up for headlin inflat and modest up for core inflat  the strong incom data on spend eas my fear that we are in or are approach a recess regim of the sort embed in the last two  book   howev  given the numer larg and worsen drag on spend  a coupl of month of data aren   t enough to convinc me that we are on a solid trajectori   moreov  the spend data may well fail to reflect the real under strength of consum demand becaus of the effect of the tax rebat  spend pattern could easili be distort by small differ between what we project that household would spend each month out of rebat check and what they actual spent   in month spend data  a swing of just a few billion dollar look enorm   perhap household who were alreadi pay through the nose for food and gas and are increas credit constrain have put their rebat check to work a bit earli this  e   after all  household june                 of     knew in advanc that the check were go out   for exampl  googl search relat to tax rebat peak in april   we actual kept track of the data on that   so i will be close watch the data over the next few month  hope to get a cleaner read on the under state of consum demand  as i said  the advers fundament are still with us and in some part are worsen  evid that the credit crunch is ongo is all too clear   bank asset qualiti continu to deterior   bank continu to deleverag  and they are tighten lend standard as they do so   the market for privat label securit mortgag of even the highest qualiti remain moribund   spread on agenc back mortgag back secur have risen dure the intermeet period  which are like to spill over to the primari mortgag market with a lag  anecdot report suggest that the constraint on household borrow continu to tighten   for exampl  two of my most senior bank supervisor   both with fico score in the stratospher   have had their home equiti line slash   one has defer a plan home renov project as a consequ   if that is happen to them  i can onli imagin how hard it must be to get a loan if you have a mere averag credit rate  hous price have also fallen at a somewhat fa  rate than the  book previous anticip   given the overhang of home for sale  the recent rise in mortgag rate  and the fact that the homeownership rate is like to continu trend lower  i think the downward pressur on home price and construct will persist  as the  book suggest   the  book is actual at the conserv end in it es  of the wealth effect   it assum a margin propens to consum out of hous wealth of about     cent on the dollar   in contrast  a number of recent es  in the literatur are in the   cent to   cent rang   there is a clear risk  june                 of     then  that the combin of declin hous wealth and tighten credit could lead household to restrict spend more  and more persist  than anticip  but the big advers shock sinc the last meet is oil price  which are up     a barrel from the alreadi elev april level   empir  sinc the mid     s  the es  respons to relat exogen increas in the relat price of oil have tend to look qualit like the simul in the bluebook and the board staff   s special memo on oil price  in which we are credibl in our commit to long term price stabil   most notabl  the empir es  suggest at most a modest effect on core inflat   nomin wage bare respond  by some es  they even fall slight  the model result suggest that the outcom we have seen in the actual data are crucial depend on our have credibl   with substanti target drift  worker demand higher wage  which firm pay and then pass on   fortun  the anecdot i hear are more consist with credibl than with an upward wage   price spiral   in particular  my contact uniform report that they see no sign of wage pressur   there also is no evid of real wage rigid in respons to energi price   when energi price have risen  real wage   in product as well as consumpt term   have general fallen   in other word  real wage have been depress in the     s  at least in part reflect rise energi price   but there is no sign that worker have over a number of year tri to recoup these loss at the bargain tabl   given the import of credibl  the substanti increas in expect inflat in the michigan survey is concern but not yet alarm   i discount these read somewhat becaus of analysi by my staff that suggest that  at either the one year or the five to ten year horizon  consum have alway tend to react strong to contemporan inflat data  june                 of     chang in credibl are fundament about chang in the process by which peopl form expect   but as far as consum expect are concern  that process appear remark stabl   for exampl  if you use data through the earli     s to es  equat that link inflat expect to contemporan inflat  you will find that those relationship fit remark well out of sampl   they don   t show the systemat underpredict of inflat expect one might expect if the fed had suffer a signific loss of credibl at this point   the depend of consum inflat expect on recent data also lead me to believ that they will fall if  in fact  headlin inflat come down as we are predict as commod price level off  furthermor  i don   t think that household    elev expect will make it harder to achiev our project   earlier research suggest that survey did  in fact  provid use inform about futur inflat   but dure the past    or    year  the actual inflat process has becom much less persist even though household appear to assum otherwis  there is  thus  a notabl diverg between the actual inflat process and the one that is embodi in consum    inflat forecast   as a result  inflat forecast incorpor consum expect have been a lot less than stellar over this recent period   so it   not appear unreason to believ that the effect of recent commod price shock will wear off fa  than consum are expect   an unresolv question is  whose expect matter for the dynam of inflat   i take some solac from the fact that    year inflat expect in the survey of profession forecast have been relat stabl sinc the late     s and from the fact that five to ten year breakeven rate on tip are below their peak from earlier in the year  june                 of     taken all togeth  i think inflat expect remain reason well anchor   the oil price increas have led me to rais my project for overal pce inflat sharpli   cost pressur are like to push core inflat up a bit  though i see less pass through than the  book     higher oil price and interest rate and lower hous price have led me to modest reduc my forecast of growth in the second half of this year and next year   my forecast is predic on fed fund rate increas that begin in decemb of this year  gradual bring the fund rate to    percent in       briefli  on the issu of long term econom project  i welcom greater transpar about our long term object   i think that would be benefici  and there is a good reason  as you have articul  to tri to do that now  given that for mani of us   certain for me        is not long enough for me to project that the economi will have converg to a steadi state   my prefer is to provid project of the averag valu for output growth  unemploy  and total inflat that are expect  say  five to ten year out   i think that these valu can communic the necessari steadi state inform without burden us with forecast everi year of the transit to the steadi state   also  i would favor conduct a trial in octob
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  you are go to get a contrapunt tune here   that is the beauti of this tabl and the differ perspect around it   i am go to take a differ approach today than i have in the past   i am go to talk a bit about the eleventh district first  which i don   t often do   the reason for that is  becaus of it natur and size  becaus of it be the lead export state in the countri now  and becaus of it job creation  it is in a slight differ posit   or signific differ posit  depend on which district it is compar with   from the rest of the countri  june                 of     our job growth through march is run about     percent   unemploy in april was     percent  despit a sizabl influx of immigr  which we see from new licens plate registr from california and particular from florida as well as from peopl still come across the border   sale of exist home rose in may  while inventori and price held steadi  apart demand is robust  and rent in the major citi  such as dalla and houston  are rise  the real export growth of texa was     percent in april after     percent in the first quarter  that is tell you that our chemic are now be price aggress but also that everyth els is be price aggress worldwid   that   s a signific export sector for us  import  on the price front  the dalla fed   s own texa manufactur outlook survey and the region cpi data indic continu price increas and substanti evid of pass through to higher final good price   thirti nine percent of the respond report the abil to realiz higher price of finish good current  anoth    percent expect to be abl to realiz higher price in the next six month   despit these strong number  our sound and our instinct project a slowdown in the futur   we have been project a slowdown   we haven   t seen it   discretionari incom has been bol  by employ  but squeez by rise food and energi price and credit constrict   so we are look for the district to slow and yet to continu to outperform relat speak  i would like to devot the rest of my comment to the u s  economi and to the global economi  particular to the contrapunt insight i have gain from my sound   first  on the global economi  nathan  our own research at our littl global institut in dalla indic that the project of real econom growth of most of the advanc countri are be revis downward wherea expect inflat is be revis upward   for the major emerg market economi  growth realiz  at least as it appear in their forecast  for the june                 of     most part hold up  but inflat expect are be steadili revis upward   in other word  the two type of economi share on the inflat front  wherea there is dispar and a littl cacophoni as far as growth is concern   we are work on it  but we have yet to develop a reliabl measur of global slack   jpmorgan  with whom we have been work  has a slack index that purport to be global   but as you point out  nathan  it exclud china   minor oversight   it also exclud india  one would think that the grow slack in the advanc countri would be mitig price pressur   yet those countri with numer price object or inflat target   from mexico to turkey to new zealand to the european central bank to the brit   are now contend with inflat in excess of their target or comfort rang  i was think the other day of mervyn king   s comment that  onc they had to write to the chancellor of the exchequ  it would lead to a lot of letter write   it took    year for the first letter to be written after inflat target was embrac   of cours  two year ago this was resurrect  and now they seem to be do so with a great deal more frequenc   now there is a risk of acquir writer   s cramp   i would say that  if we were under the same strictur as the bank of england  we might be subject to the same concern   in our last meet  i posit that someth persist and pernici was occur on the inflat front   mr  chairman  the one thing that is even clearer now   particular after my sound  which i   ll report in just a second   than it was in may is that inflationari pressur  inflat expect  and anticipatori behavior respons among consum and busi have intensifi  wherea our confid about econom growth has improv  i don   t believ that we are out of the wood yet on the risk of a credit induc slowdown  though i believ our liquid initi are a proper and good palliat  as you know   but if june                 of     robert frost will forgiv me  the wood are not love  and they are inde deep and dark on the price front   although the tail risk of econom recess has diminish  i think it still exist  certain the anemia   just to use anoth word that you refer to       but the risk of inflat  in my view  has assum greater depth and breadth sinc we last met   state differ  i don   t believ that inflat expect are present well anchor  here or elsewher   i believ they are be   just to kill the sea analog  don   torn from their moor and are at risk of go adrift  now  i took a differ approach this  e with the    odd interlocutor with whom i discuss the outlook   i simpli ask them one question   what is differ in this cycl from what you have seen befor   most of these peopl have been in busi for    year plus   here are some sampl tes oni as to what they are see   the ceo of fluor  which has a     billion backlog current  said     when i start here in       we put inflat conting into everi contract   in the     s  that had not onli gone away  but we were confid we could negoti cost down to below what we were bid   now it is just the opposit      the cfo of frito lay  which just push through a   percent price increas  which  parenthet  wal mart accommod at   percent   said     most of our execut are in their late   s or earli to  mid   s   they have never seen these kind of number   this is reminisc of the aftershock to nixon   s wage and price control  and we are current have to hold seminar to teach manag how to manag inflat      from the ceo of wal mart usa      we see increas      and this is his word      pervas price pressur   i am tell you that we have an economi where the real peopl are be trampl by inflat  and for the first  e in memori  we are get nois from employe about the cost of live      wal mart rais the pay of    percent of their associ between singl and doubl digit in the last quarter  and my contact june                 of     said     we are now contempl a seri of measur such as provid discount to employe to counter consider employe angst about the cost of live      from the ceo of kimber clark  who just notifi the retail of a   percent price increas to come in august after the   percent they push through in februari  in addit to which they are go to add a ship surcharg      custom are no longer ask if  but when  we will increas price  so they can move in anticip     i can give you other tes oni  mr  chairman   one of my favorit  by the way  has to do with a veri small oper  a three store dri clean oper  faulkner   s fine dri clean in dalla   they

sick puppi   some of it vital organ   geograph region such as the one i am fortun to live in  or a strong export sector of the unit state  or entrepreneur and busi leader who have learn to wring unanticip effici and profit out of global or from within cyberspac   are veri strong   yet other   state like california and florida  the hous sector  and overal consum confid   are bleed  if not hemorrhag   this is not to mention the still precari state  despit the veri good report that bill gave  of our financi system as it recov  i hope with our help  from year of it reckless and excess   i think we have  like loyal practition and with the equival of the hippocrat oath  done the job that we are expect to do in term of resuscit the vic   that is the good news   the real bad news is that our patient appear to be acquir a staph infect in this hospit that we have creat  and that staph infect is inflat   i believ inflat is upon us   i believ expect are discount more inflat   veri import   and this is tough to get from the model   i believ that behavior chang are begin to manifest themselv   now  some would argu that this infect is temporari and may well go away   other will argu that it will be stay by strong rhetor   still other say that it will requir   i don   t know if it   s an antibiot or an antidot   further tighten  lest the infect spread and counteract the good that we have done with our liquid facil and by previous polici decis   that seem to me to be the problem that we will have to deal with at this meet  and i look forward to hear my other colleagu    opinion   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i would like to start with some anecdot feedback from the region   as you know  we have a lot of branch  so we have a lot of director  and we ask our director a lot of question   the anecdot feedback from our    director about the second half can be character as subdu   almost all report that they expect econom activ to be flat or slower  and i took special note that these expect deterior in june after have actual improv a bit in may  the residenti hous situat in the district resembl the nation pictur   both sale and new construct are weak   high level of inventori are be exacerb by foreclosur  which are ad to downward pressur on price   howev  there are tentat sign of a bottom form   our survey of realtor across the district indic that the pace of declin of singl famili home sale may be abat   industri contact tell us that foot traffic and buyer interest are pick up  particular in florida  although i would say that what constitut progress in florida would not be consid veri encourag elsewher   nevertheless  our view is that the begin of an adjust process is under way  but the end of the process look to be a long way off   some further home price deterior is like to accompani this bottom process  credit condit in the district continu to tighten becaus of perceiv risk and also liquid pressur on our bank   our bank indic that the process of deleverag continu  which is affect lend for residenti real estat and  to some extent  commerci real estat  we are also hear from sever sourc that fund of communiti bank is becom an increas problem becaus of their previous depend on wholesal and correspond bank sourc   higher energi price are  not surpris  affect our outlook   hospit industri june                 of     contact  for instanc  express concern about low summer book   although most tourist destin have report solid activ to date  few expect this to continu  the reacceler of energi and commod price inflat has busi focus on cost pressur   sever busi contact indic that price increas had been relat easi to pass through and make stick in this environ   i wouldn   t say that it   s widespread yet  but i do hear some report that busi are expect wage increas to eventu reflect the recent increas in the cost of live   this could be a signific factor  particular in servic price inflat   this and other anecdot input has color my outlook for the nation economi for the balanc of the year and into        i have revis up my forecast for headlin inflat in      and      by    and    basi point  respect   i am also assum that the recent inflationari pressur from elev energi and food price will unwind more slowli than i previous project   a view reinforc by expect express by my district contact  like everyon els  i am deepli concern that inflat expect seem to be rise and that expect of general price inflat  reflect second   third   and fourth order effect of recent oil and commod price rise  risk becom institution   i am prepar in the near term to think tactic regard the conflict between growth and employ polici object and inflat object  but sustain inflationari pressur that extend well into the fourth quarter and rise expect read may forc  at least on my part  a more strateg look at the tradeoff  i would like to talk for a moment about financi market   i made a number of call dure the intermeet period  and the growth versus inflat tactic dilemma is complic further by a veri mix pictur in financi market   my contact all acknowledg improv condit sinc mid march  but discuss of the current market circumst and the outlook june                 of     had a sort of half full half empti qualiti   my contact  taken togeth  point to sever posit  includ the health of the corpor loan market  improv cdo price  the readi of form distress fund to buy asset back secur  alt a mortgag demand  the grow percept that subprim loss es  have been overst  and some comment on goldman   s cheyn deal  which they believ will help creat price determin for certain secur   at the same  e  these contact cite area of continu or worsen weak  includ  heloc and second mortgag  option arm and alt a hybrid  indirect auto  given the collater valu of suv in current circumst  in contrast to cdo price  cdo squar price is veri weak and deterior  the obvious concern about the grow liquid issu of region bank  and the view that the auction rate secur market valuat  given illiquid  are suggest that this market has littl probabl of return to normalci   overal  my contact in financi market were encourag but express worri over still substanti downsid potenti  let me turn now to my nation forecast compar with the  book forecast   the atlanta project for the nation economi are broad similar to those of the  book   we have the same general narrat of slow growth for the balanc of the year follow by a gradual pickup through      and        my project for headlin and core inflat are virtual ident to the baselin  book project   howev  i believ that there may be less disinflationari pressur than seem implicit in the board staff   s forecast   as a consequ  the fed fund rate path that support my inflat outlook is well abov the  book   s at the end of      and        we are    basi point higher at year end      and     basi point higher at year end        notwithstand the upward revis of the first quarter gdp number and the better expect for this quarter  i still believ the near term risk to growth are weight to june                 of     the downsid   at the same  e  as suggest by my revis forecast  i see the risk to our inflat object as weight to the upsid  on the subject of the long term project  i favor the third approach  which is three year plus long term averag  and certain would be comfort with approach number     i   m general dubious about the abil to do actual forecast for the outyear  even as near term as the third year   so i realli don   t favor approach number     my experi  in the brief  e i have been with the fed  has at least person been  shall i say  challeng from the point of view of forecast   i tend to think of the long term project as be rough equival to our target or polici goal   in fact  the approach we have general taken with our three year forecast is make the outyear approach at least what we would consid to be the trend rate for growth and the employ and inflat object   so i think long term project realli do amount to more explicit target  and veri like the first question we get when we come out of the block   if we have this kind of approach   will be  is this your target   i am comfort say    yes    to that question and  therefor  would support the third approach   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   despit some encourag data recent  the boston fed econom outlook continu to see the economi grow below potenti over the next sever quarter  further weaken in labor market  and core pce trend down in respons to excess capac   overal  our forecast has not chang signific sinc our april meet   i view recent strength in consum spend indic as larg borrow from the second half of this year   this view is support by the assess that  apart june                 of     from the fiscal s ulus  consumpt fundament   incom  wealth  and employ   remain on the weak side  take on board some of the increas in the may unemploy rate  our forecast has the unemploy rate peak at a slight higher rate than at the last meet   in this respect  we are similar to mani other forecast   the may blue chip forecast had unemploy peak at     percent   the june blue chip forecast for unemploy peak at     percent   while the  book has the unemploy rate peak at     percent  as it did in april  it has the unemploy rate at     percent at the end of            percent higher than the april  book   so at least as measur by the unemploy rate  there seem littl improv in the outlook sinc the april meet   as in the  book  residenti invest in our forecast continu to be a drag on the economi in       and consumpt hold up primarili as a result of the fiscal s ulus packag  which is in part offset the negat impact of signific higher oil price on consumpt   a major uncertainti remain whether further home price declin will have a more negat effect on residenti invest and consumpt than we current have in our forecast  similar  i would view financi market condit as not have chang signific sinc our april meet   the three month libor   oi spread remain quit high by histor standard at rough    basi point  where it has been trade sinc the april fomc   the dow jone  s p      and nasdaq index have all declin sinc our april meet   invest bank  such as merril lynch and lehman brother  are now trade substanti below where they were trade at our april meet and below where they trade dure the middl of march when bear stearn experienc difficulti   stock price for larg region bank have declin as they have need to increas loan loss reserv  rais new capit  and reduc dividend june                 of     payment   i continu to be concern that we have more  signific difficulti ahead for mani financi institut   first and second mortgag and home equiti line of credit are deterior at mani bank as fall home price and job loss creat problem that have now spread to some prime residenti product   i would character financi market as remain fragil   the past two taf auction still produc stop out rate abov the primari credit rate  and financi market remain suscept to event risk   the recent flurri of articl on lehman befor their announc of their capit infus highlight continu concern about invest bank  despit our new liquid facil   as a result  i continu to view the downsid risk of further financi shock as be signific  core pce inflat has trend lower dure this quarter  bring the four quarter chang for the past year to     percent   given that the boston fed forecast expect signific excess capac over this year  we forecast that core pce inflat will be slight below   percent in        if food and energi price stabil  we expect total pce to converg to core pce   we have experienc signific food and energi shock  and oil price continu to be higher than our expect   i would be quit concern should the serial correl surpris in food and energi becom embed in inflat expect and wage and salari   but a critic element to my forecast is that total pce inflat converg to core pce as wage and salari increas remain larg unaffect by the suppli shock   in the data to date  wage and salari increas have not trend up in respons to the suppli shock  and my expect is that excess capac in labor market and continu competit from abroad make it unlik that the relat chang in food and energi price will becom embed in labor contract  for the intermedi term  i remain focus on core pce rather than total pce for sever reason   first  monetari polici is unlik to have much effect on food and energi price  which june                 of     are respond  among other develop  to the impact of natur disast such as flood in the midwest and manmad disast such as ongo polit difficulti in nigeria and the middl east   second  statist evid provid by our research depart seem to indic that over the past    year  when total and core inflat diverg  total has tend to converg to core and not the opposit   third  while inflat expect are difficult to model  the lack of an upward trend in wage and salari seem consist with worker expect be driven by core rather than total inflat   while the suppli shock may have increas the upsid inflat risk  the downsid risk to the economi and financi market remain quit elev  in my view  we need more  e and data to determin with greater confid which of these risk pose the greatest danger to the economi  in term of the option  i am comfort with either   or     i have a slight prefer for option     it is not that difficult for us to extend our forecast out five year   i actual think it would be easier to explain to the public than option    and i think explain to the public is one of the main goal of expand the forecast   but i could be happi with either option
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the third district  as anticip  manufactur activ  residenti construct  and employ have remain weak  nonresidenti construct has now soften  although vacanc rate in philadelphia and around the district remain relat low   retail sale remain sluggish   bank lend has been restrain   the outlook among our busi contact  howev  vari signific by sector  manufactur expect a rebound in activ over the come six month  and residenti real estat contact report that they believ market condit may be near bottom  although they expect ani recoveri to be slow   interest enough  it is the same sort of anecdot evid june                 of     that presid   refer to   now  it is hard to know whether it is just most wish think or whether there is someth real there   although his say it and my say it sort of reinforc it a littl   but it is the first  e that i have heard such news in a veri  veri long  e  retail are quit pessimist  howev  becaus they are expect the increas in energi price to limit sale  especi among lower incom custom  despit the tax rebat  despit the soft econom condit  the most promin concern that we have heard from our busi contact across a varieti of industri is the run up in commod price and other price   thus far  firm have resist pass along their rise cost to custom  to the extent that they could  but mani firm tell us that they have gone as far as they can on hold the line on their own price and plan to rais price further in the next few month   some firm are includ general cost increas claus in their new contract   earlier we saw various sort of fuel surcharg ad onto price  but now contract are be written in a way that includ broad cost adjust increas   this is still onli anecdot evid although it has been refer to   i think presid   made a coupl of comment in this regard   but it may be yet anoth earli warn sign that inflat expect cannot remain in check indefinit in this current environ   in june  the price paid index in our busi outlook survey of manufactur rose to the highest level it has been sinc        manufactur and firm contact across a wide rang of industri say that they expect their input price and the price of their own good to increas further over the next six month   they see no abat of price pressur in the near term or medium term and are veri pessimist about inflat  the nation econom situat is similar to what i see in my own district  and it is an uncomfort situat for all of us   the data we have receiv on econom activ over the intermeet period have come in slight better than i expect  but the continu price june                 of     increas  particular in oil and commod  have been a veri unpleas develop  certain  econom condit remain weak  and the recent posit news may prove to be transitori   from the financi side  credit spread have fallen  bond issuanc has risen  and it appear that financi market function has at least improv   in my view  although downsid risk to growth remain  the tail risk of a veri bad outcom has clear been diminish  i expect gdp growth to come in around     percent this year   onli margin higher than my april project   befor pick back up to trend of around     percent in          despit the upward revis in the  book baselin  my forecast remain somewhat more op ist for growth in      and      than the  book   in fact  my forecast is similar to the board staff   s    upsid risk    altern scenario  which essenti remov the downward adjust factor the staff ad to build in more recess like featur caus by the financi turmoil and other factor not captur in their baselin model  which is what dave was mention earlier  my concern about the inflat outlook have increas sinc our last meet   i am not alon   inflat has becom a predomin concern for mani busi and consum  and you onli have to read the newspap to see that   obvious  monetari polici cannot control the price of energi  but we do have a respons to act to keep broad base inflat under control   contribut to the increas in inflat risk is not onli the surg in energi and other commod price  it is support also by our own accommod stanc of monetari polici  short term inflat expect and headlin inflat measur are up signific sinc our last meet   so far  core inflat increas have been modest  and long term inflat expect remain  although volatil  within a toler rang   but if we continu to maintain the real fund rate well below zero  despit inflat that is well abov accept level  can we june                 of     realli expect inflat expect to remain anchor   we must rememb that longer term inflat expect tend to lag inflat not to lead it   if we wait until these measur rise  we will be too late  apropo of presid     s question about wage  i have been troubl by stori in the press suggest that we can be less concern about inflat than we were in the     s becaus wage haven   t risen and labor union are less promin   these stori suggest that the wage   price spiral caus the unanchor of inflat expect in the      s   but i think this get the direct of causat backward   in my view  the stori of the      s was that the public lack confid in the central bank   s commit to price stabil   it didn   t believ the central bank would take the necessari step to bring inflat under control   as a consequ  inflat expect rose and wage rose   it was the higher inflat and the lack of credibl that led to higher wage demand  the key to avoid such a situat  in my view  is maintain the credibl that the fed has work so hard to achiev   the board staff memo on op  monetari polici in the context of higher oil price illustr the import of maintain credibl  and i want to thank the staff for their effort in this regard   i think it was an excel piec of work   as they clear say  the critic factor in contain inflat through an expect channel is the belief that policymak will alway adher to a full commit rule   when the central bank is unabl or unwil to commit in a credibl manner to futur polici action or to a long run inflat goal  the result is both higher inflat and lower output   in the real world  of cours  full commit can never absolut be achiev   but belief about which regim better approxim realiti are inform by the action taken by the central bank to maintain it commit to price stabil  june                 of     i believ that the fomc has done a good job with our word   includ fomc statement  minut  and speech   in help to anchor longer term expect   i believ the chairman   s speech at the boston fed confer earlier this month deliv a well articul and import messag about the import of keep longer term inflat expect anchor   but our credibl rest on more than just word   we must act in a way that is consist with our hard earn reput  or our credibl could soon vanish   to underscor our word  we should take action and take back some of the insur we have put on in the context of elev downsid tail risk  given recent econom develop and the improv in financi market function  coupl with our accommod stanc of polici  it seem pretti clear to me that  if the economi continu to evolv as it has over the past coupl of month  we should move to rais the fund rate   this is also the view of market particip  whose expect for polici have steepen consider over the intermeet period   my forecast  therefor  incorpor a monetari polici path that is steeper than the one in the  book   i assum that the fund rate will reach      percent by the end of      and move up to     percent by the end of        this steeper fund rate path is necessari  in my view  to deliv inflat that is declin back toward our goal  regard the suggest by the subcommitte on communic on lengthen the forecast period  i think it can be a veri use devic  and i support it   my prefer  howev  is for option    although i think option   could work just as well   i   m for option   part becaus i  too  am less confid about forecast whatev the dynam adjust process happen to be  and so just go to year   i think would be use   omit year   is not omit ani inform that is terribl inform  as far as i am concern   i am a littl reluct to go to june                 of     some longer term averag like five to ten year becaus i think that muddl the communic pictur and may signal a weaken of our commit about the  efram over which we think we can realli achiev some object   so i am most comfort with option    or i could be happi with option   as well   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the fifth district has remain soft in recent week   our retail report declin activ in june  especi in auto  we are still hear scatter report of delay or cancel new construct project  either becaus of a lack of financ or becaus demand is expect to declin   our survey measur of manufactur activ  which by the way cover a manufactur sector bigger than the philadelphia and the empir index combin   laughter  has edg lower in the last two month  but export continu to be a bright spot with report of robust outbound activ at area port   manufactur contact report some success in pass on rise energi and transport cost to their custom  and their index of expect six month ahead manufactur price trend  both for price paid and price receiv  reach new record high for the    year histori of those seri   i  too  have heard scatter report in the last coupl of week of employ contempl provid extra compens boost to their employe to make up for rise energi cost  on the whole  i think the risk of the nation economi sink into a serious recess has reced  and the growth outlook has edg up a bit   i was reliev by the strength in retail sale in may as well as the upward revis for april and march   the ism index have steadi at right around    over the past four month  and although the labor market has been weak  it has not yet shown the acceler declin that i fear   the  book project for june                 of     q  real gdp has been revis from minus     to plus      and we have made a similar adjust in our own project  there remain plenti of reason for concern on the real side of the economi  of cours  real dispos incom has suffer with the fall in employ over the last half year  and the rise cost of gasolin is take it toll as well   the continu fall in hous price has cut into household net worth and could contribut to a rise in consum save   s ulus check might be play an import role in support consum spend right now  it is not clear how much   but i am concern that  when the s ulus effect wear off later this year  we may find that the under trend in consum spend is fair soft   commerci construct also remain a potenti risk  i believ   there is a bit of a disconnect between the surpris strong data on nonresidenti construct and the report of slow that we keep hear from region contact   this suggest that the number reflect project initi befor the begin of the year and that commerci construct is like to soften later this year and to be a drag next year   despit all of these element that could depress growth  i think the econom situat has undoubt turn out better than we expect at the april meet becaus of the better than expect consum and busi invest number    book now forecast a period of low but posit real growth  signific better than the experi of the last two fair mild recess  and i think that is about right  inflat is a grow problem  though   cpi came in at an annual rate of   percent in may and has averag     percent over the last three month   the core intermedi good ppi is increas at doubl digit rate   oil price have risen    percent by my calcul sinc the last meet   retail gas price are up    percent   chang in inflat expect sinc the last meet vari with the measur that you choos   but my read is that they continu to june                 of     deterior   in ani event  they are abov level consist with price stabil   the michigan survey number for inflat expect have risen notabl  especi for the one year horizon  the tip base measur of expect one year inflat five year forward has increas    basi point sinc the april meet  and although the five year  five year forward figur has been stabl sinc then  it is still quit close to the highest valu it reach at ani point last year  it is popular  as mani have note around the tabl  to cite the stabil of compens gain as evid that we are not see a wage   price spiral   i have done it myself recent   but i share the concern express by presid   and other around the tabl about that be a lag indic   i am concern that  if we wait until we see rise inflat expect show up as wage pressur  we will have wait too long   i note in just a casual glanc at the data from the     s that  although wage acceler was a promin compon of the acceler of inflat in the late     s  it was larg absent in the acceler that occur in       and        i think monetari polici is quit s ul right now   use the bluebook   s standard approach of subtract four quarter lag core inflat  the real fund rate now stand just below zero  about where it bottom out in the       recess and a good deal abov it trough in        but i don   t think lag core inflat is the best es  of overal inflat now   i am drawn to the bluebook   s real rate es   new in this edit  that use the  book   s project for headlin inflat   use that measur and go back and reconstruct it for the past  the real fund rate is now minus     percent  and that is substanti lower than it trough in the last two recess  which were right around zero   this is a lot of s ulus  arguabl way too much given the improv in the growth outlook  the reduct in downsid risk  and the continu of inflat pressur   i think withdraw the s ulus is go to be challeng  howev  june                 of     about the extend project  i am not convinc that the benefit exceed the cost   i don   t think it is go to provid much help on communic an inflat object   i think it will show about as much dispers as our third year forecast show now   in ani event  i haven   t notic much of a declin in the volatil of inflat expect sinc we began releas project on an acceler calendar late last year   moreov  i think those steadi state or longer run project are just go to tempt peopl to think that we have an unemploy rate target and a growth target   that some politician have suggest that we actual adopt such make it danger to engag in ani exercis that seem to compli with that suggest   besid  i am not sure who care about our steadi state growth forecast besid mayb some busi cycl model calibr   but we are like to get our steadi state growth forecast from those peopl in ani event  so i am not sure that is go to be veri help   i don   t think we should bother with these extend forecast   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman  the last two month have brought an interest shift in my convers with my busi contact   their concern have shift from problem in financi market to the rapid increas in input price   energi price are the june                 of     focus nationwid  but steel price are also captur the attent of the busi peopl in my district   sever manufactur and builder note that the price they pay for steel has almost doubl sinc the begin of this year   clear  busi are worri about sign of grow price pressur  but their reaction to these price shock tell a more complic stori   mani manufactur have not been abl to pass on price increas  result in a clear loss to profit margin   these busi often report cost contain or effici program that will affect their hire and capit decis for month to come  interest  the consum price data show a similar dichotomi   my staff note that our primari measur of core inflat are not provid a consist stori about the path of under inflat   in the may cpi report  rough one third of the weight price chang increas at rate abov   percent  and rough one third of price chang by rate less than   percent   for exampl  while energi cost were up strong and price for a number of general servic compon have been drift higher  larg declin in apparel and vehicl expens are impart signific offset   the    percent trim mean indic show an alarm   percent rise in price  while the median rose just at     percent   the weight of price chang in the   percent to   percent rang was unusu small  make it difficult to es  the central tendenc of the price chang distribut with much confid   so this make it difficult to get a good read on where futur price are head  my district busi contact remain pessimist about growth prospect   district retail report focus extens on the like effect of gasolin and food price on the purchas decis of consum   mani manufactur  builder  and distributor are face complic output and invest decis in the context of input price growth and weaker market  overal  most of the busi peopl that i talk with are still quit cautious about their busi june                 of     plan  despit the fact that most of them have found sourc of credit and term that are not too elev from what they have seen in previous year  in the econom project that i submit for this meet  i rais my near term forecast for output growth slight and for headlin inflat slight more   over the medium term  my outlook continu to be for modest growth becaus the hous market  in my forecast  recov slowli  actual more slowli than in the  book   my staff es  a model for nation hous start that take into account what has happen in the past in state that have seen major increas in foreclosur   the real estat difficulti that these state face were much more persist than anyth that we have yet seen in the nation data   the bottom line of this analysi is that  if the pattern of past hous cycl from the state that experienc the boom   bust cycl are repeat at the nation level  then hous start should remain relat weak over the next coupl of year   support this analysi  three of the larg region bank organ in my district are increas their loan loss provis signific in the second quarter base on the continu deterior in the hous sector   base on current project  these institut are project hous sector credit loss to acceler in the second half of      and to continu into        current  the weak output growth contribut to my forecast of declin inflat rate  especi the core rate  but i also see evid support that view in the    less worker bargain power    scenario that is in the  book   my contact see veri littl price pressur come from labor cost now or in the near futur  final  implicit in my forecast for output growth and inflat is a fed fund rate path that includ increas later this year and into next year   although addit risk to growth remain  the primari risk to my forecast concern input price and inflat expect   if commod price continu to acceler  they are go to put upward pressur on both headlin june                 of     and core inflat and downward pressur on output   that environ could lead to a high undesir increas in inflat expect   on the posit side of risk to the outlook  i think that the fed fund rate action that we have taken  in conjunct with the action that we took in august to bol  market liquid  have improv confid  and i have substanti lower the odd i had place on financi market meltdown and on a sever recess   in that sens  sinc our meet in april the downsid risk to my outlook for econom growth have lessen somewhat  and the risk to my inflat outlook have move up somewhat  regard the issu of provid longer term forecast  i have long support effort to clarifi the under object of fomc particip by provid our longer term econom project   of the propos that were offer by the subcommitte on communic  i favor report the averag valu for output growth  unemploy  and total inflat expect over a five to ten year period   option     the featur of these five to ten year project that i find attract are that they indic where the economi might converg and don   t impli too much knowledg of the path to the long run   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   most of my contact continu to report sluggish domest demand  and they are not current see ani improv in activ   in addit  their comment often focus on the substanti higher cost that they are face for a wide rang of nonlabor input   with regard to busi activ  much of what we heard about the district and the nation economi was a rehash of preexist develop   at our last meet  we felt that there was substanti risk of a further soften in second quarter growth  so the absenc of new news is a posit develop   with regard to specif sector  export i have talk with continu to thrive  and steel produc are do quit well   but ani busi june                 of     associ with hous market is veri weak  and the motor vehicl outlook continu to worsen   all detroit three ceo are expect light vehicl sale to be less than    million unit in       the seventh district has experienc substanti flood in recent week  particular in iowa   we have been in contact with state offici and numer busi   the corn and soybean crop have experienc signific loss  though the rang of es  is wide   higher es  for lost corn output in iowa are about    percent   that substanti loss would repres a nation crop loss of just about   percent   in addit  although there have been transport disrupt  especi on the mississippi  our contact expect these to be short live   so overal  our sens is that the econom damag seem to be relat contain  especi in comparison with the flood in       which hit a much wider geograph area and affect activ for a longer period of  e   turn to the nation pictur  the incom data regard growth general have been posit   inde  the string of upward quarter forecast revis continu   in particular  i have been impress by how much second quarter gdp growth forecast have move up   this is not to say that we are out of the wood   clear  the continu difficulti in the hous and credit market as well as the unrel increas in energi price pose import downsid risk to activ   our chicago fed nation activ index continu to be in territori i would character as a recess   the three month move averag is minus      this past month  still  the risk of the advers feedback loop that concern us so much clear seem less like today   import  the financi situat seem better   though condit are still far from normal  institut have had  e to cope with bad portfolio  much as presid bullard mention   they have made signific progress in rais capit and have increas provis june                 of     against loss   i think our lend facil have help financi institut gain  e to facilit the adjust process   it seem well beyond our abil  howev  to engin a return to    normal financi condit     given the extent of financi loss and overbuild in hous   with regard to our econom project  we expect growth this quarter to be similar to the  book  but unlik the  book  we are look for the momentum to carri forward to a better second half of the year   beyond this year  we think growth will run near potenti   this is base on a fed fund rate path close to that in the futur market   we are assum a fed fund rate of     percent by the fourth quarter and    percent by the end of       turn to inflat  a number of factor present a concern for inflat expect and our abil to bring inflat down   as i mention  my contact spent a good deal of  e talk about materi cost pressur  and mani around the tabl have talk about those as well   mani manufactur were cite larg increas in energi and most commod price  and everyon was pass along some portion of these cost increas   i have one anecdot on this  in retail  crate barrel report on recent buyer    trip to asia  say that price for item purchas there would be    to    percent higher for next year   final  wage pressur have been subdu thus far   still  econometr analysi by my staff remind me that wage inflat tend to follow price inflat not the other way around   so by the  e we see wage pressur  either we are not behind the curv now  or it is    kati  bar the door      it is probabl one or the other    laughter   inde  i am concern that larg and persist chang in cost and in relat price of high profil item  such as energi  could chang the inflationari mindset of busi and household   the result increas in inflat expect would pose a difficult challeng for monetari polici   mayb it will end up be okay  mayb survey will be right   but it is a big risk  and that risk is a bit larg for my comfort  june                 of     look ahead  we all see the substanti upsid risk to price stabil pose by the pass through of higher cost and ani possibl increas in inflat expect   while i hope i am wrong  i feel that we may need to accept a somewhat longer period of resourc slack than we would like in order to address these risk and put inflat more firm on a downward trajectori   under our project for gdp growth  the economi   not close the modest resourc gap we project will be in place at the end of      until beyond the forecast horizon  along with a flatten in energi and other commod price  such gap should be suffici to contain inflat expect and bring overal pce inflat near   percent in      and       that is our expect   but my base case   not have inflat move below   percent until after       and that is even with more aggress polici tighten than the  book path  now  turn to the long term project  i think that our forecast for        or at least the way that i think about it   do suffer from some difficulti   we would like to mention in the write up that  at the end of the period  the rang is between     percent and   percent  and we can infer policymak    prefer from that   that is one interpret   given the inflationari pressur  that is harder and harder for mani peopl to come up with   i think in some case it requir a monetari polici respons that is beyond what most peopl would expect that we could actual do   so i don   t tri to forc my inflat forecast into my prefer rang if it is too hard  base upon monetari polici  it is more medium term   so i do tend to favor a longer period   i am somewhat indiffer between the first and the second option   i don   t realli see a lot of differ  but someth that has a five year forecast i think is use   whether or not it has the fourth year and whether or not it is core pce or total are less import issu  one argument for this is an interest bodi of research  which i have been expos to onli at confer   and jim probabl know it better than most   on learn and whether june                 of     individu in the economi can learn these rule without a varieti of inform   some of the better paper that i have seen on that remind us that you need more piec of inform than just what the target is  whether it be     percent or   percent   you need some type of contour when peopl are learn with simplist learn rule  like least squar learn   so i think a bit more contour on the forecast would be help   in my mind  that push you toward the five year of forecast as oppos to a steadi state or a five to ten year forecast   i think that   s an import element   on the trial run  i think we could do it sooner than that  but i know a lot of staff resourc are involv   so i favor sooner rather than later   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  like some other   mayb mani other   i  too  have rais my forecast for growth for this year  basic just extend what   s happen in the first half of the year  and i   ve rais my project for growth next year margin as well  still  i must admit to some signific reserv about do that   as i look at the outlook and as larri   point out  there are a number of weak  concern  or downsid that you can pretti readili identifi   tight or tighten credit condit  a still signific declin in hous activ  a declin in hous valu and the negat wealth effect associ with that  the run up in energi price  and so forth   mani of those will advers affect the consum  it seem to me  when we have that high a number of what i would call identifi negat  i wouldn   t be surpris if we had one or more quarter of signific econom contract still ahead of us despit the recent relat good news on the growth side  at the same  e  the news on inflat hasn   t been particular posit from my perspect  and that   s particular true if the  book is right and some of the relat favor recent read on core inflat are like to prove transitori   i   m struck by the volum june                 of     of question i get and concern express about inflat when i   m out talk with busi group or give a speech to a more general audienc   now  a lot of this  of cours  is focus on or stem from what   s happen to energi price and food price  which are high visibl and which peopl experi direct and frequent   nevertheless  i   m concern that all of that make inflat expect a bit more vulner  mayb more than a bit more vulner  than they have been to this point  my read of inflat expect per se is that they  at least the longer term expect   and i   m reli most on the tip data here   have been remark well anchor so far   perhap a partial explan for that is that core inflat realli hasn   t move much sinc             that   s a bit of a doubl edg sword becaus it has lock in a bit higher than i might have prefer   nevertheless  stabil that has been maintain is there   perhap it goe some distanc to explain our continu  or what appear to be our continu  credibl on that issu  now  the  book   have some inch up of core inflat from here   if they   re right and that   s all we get  then i would be surpris if that led to a real deterior in inflat expect  but that may prove to be a big    if     as far as extend the project goe  i   m in favor of do that   i don   t think there will be a huge payoff  but i think it will provid some addit inform to us intern and to the public   i don   t have a strong prefer about which altern we go with   mayb the trial run will point out some advantag or disadvantag that we didn   t anticip   at the moment  if i had to vote  i   d probabl vote for the second altern  which would be to split the differ  put down the fifth year  and let it go at that
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we face an extend period of relat weak econom growth  quit weak domest demand growth  and overal growth signific below trend   i think this is both like and necessari   it   s like becaus we have more weak ahead as the hous drag continu  financi headwind remain acut  the economi adjust to the veri larg and sustain energi price shock  the save rate increas  and global demand moder   it   s necessari to achiev a reason inflat outcom over the forecast period  our central project has the u s  economi grow  though at a rate signific below potenti  and then recov gradual toward trend over the next year   this is our modal forecast  and in this forecast  the economi just skirt a recess   the output gap begin to narrow over the forecast period   hous price begin to stabil onli late in        after a cumul peak to trough drop of rough    percent  use the ofheo repeat sale purchas onli index   net export provid a signific  though fade  boost to gdp growth this year and next   we project a veri gradual  veri modest moder in core inflat over the forecast period   of cours  this forecast depend on a lot of thing happen   it depend on expect remain reason well contain  energi and commod price follow the futur curv  the dollar onli modest weaker  somewhat diminish pressur on resourc util here and around the world  and continu moder growth in compens and unit labor cost   our polici assumpt build in signific tighten   a signific move up in the fed fund rate over the forecast period   though not as soon as the market now expect  the uncertainti around and risk to this central project are substanti   on the growth front  although we believ the risk of a veri deep  prolong econom downturn have diminish   not on their own but becaus of the forc of the polici respons so far   we still think june                 of     the risk are weight signific to the downsid   the main risk remain   the ongo stress on financi market  the risk that this further restrict the suppli of credit  exacerb financi condit  push home price and other equiti price down more further tighten credit condit  et cetera  a steeper than expect rise in the save rate  and the adjust to the ongo drag from energi price  on the inflat front  we   i think like the rest of you   see the risk ahead tilt somewhat to the upsid for mani obvious reason   i think it   s true that  look at togeth  the mix of measur of inflat expect suggest that privat agent may have less confid in the fomc   s commit to price stabil than they did in previous period when total inflat was run signific abov core   so this is go to be a veri challeng period for polici   it   s not all terribl   product growth is a littl higher than we thought   under inflat and long term inflat expect certain could alreadi have been show sign of a more compel  immedi danger   spend has been somewhat stronger than confid measur would have suggest   the current account balanc has narrow signific   we are see veri substanti chang in behavior across the u s  economi in the consumpt of energi   so there are good thing to point to   but in the two danger area   in the financi sector and in the global inflat environ   i  think thing are materi wors than at our last meet  again  the risk of inflat is readili appar   apart from the number  i agre with mani of you who said that the alarm and concern is materi higher and materi differ today across a broad rang of firm in differ industri than it was even as recent as two month ago   we have to be worri about intensifi pressur on compens growth even with the degre of slack that we now see in the labor market   although firm are absorb in margin a signific part of the increas in unit cost   and a lot of the complain that we hear is about margin that are june                 of     come down and those that are expect to come down   i do think that firm are demonstr abl to pass on more than they would have been befor   of cours  what make it veri hard for us is that the pressur on resourc is come larg from outsid the unit state and the other major economi  from countri that are grow signific abov trend with central bank that are not independ and are run veri expansionari monetari polici   i think we are realli see an alarm acceler in inflat rate in larg part of the world for the first  e in a coupl of decad   if these countri do not tighten monetari polici suffici and reduc energi price subsidi materi  then we will have to be tighter than we otherwis would have to be  in the financi world  although i think it   s true that the market believ there has been some signific reduct in the risk of an acut system financi crisi  i think we have a long period of acut fragil ahead   we   re in the midst right now of more materi eros in sen ent  spread  asset price  balanc sheet pressur  and liquid in some market   overal financi condit are probabl somewhat tighter than when we last met   the financi headwind have intensifi again  and they are like to remain intens for some  e  again  i think this is go to be a veri challeng road ahead   it is import to recogn that the current stanc of polici embodi not just the fed fund rate today  relat to our best measur of equilibrium  but also the expect about polici that are now built into the treasuri curv   that polici today   not look that accommod   if you look at the bluebook chart and at a rang of measur of real fed fund rate today relat to differ measur of equilibrium  polici is less accommod just on that simpl measur than it was at the most accommod point of the last two downturn   that said  we   re go to have to tighten monetari polici  and the question is when   my sens is soon but not yet   right now we still face a veri delic  veri fine balanc and have to be care not to declar victori prematur on the growth front or on the june                 of     financi front   i think it   s go to be hard for us to do that until we see that we are closer to the point at which we can confid say that we start to see the bottom in hous price   also  we have to be care not to rais expect too much that we   re on the verg of an immin  signific tighten in polici   it is a difficult balanc   we should take some comfort from the fact that the market believ we will do enough soon enough to keep those expect down  on the project front  i have a complic view  mr  chairman   i apolog   if we are go to chang  we should focus on stuff that will chang thing signific   i don   t see huge gain from the chang in these option to our current communic regim   if we   re go to chang  a trial run in the fall is fine   but i think the fall is too soon to chang   we need to get through this thing   we have a veri challeng period with a lot of stuff go on  and i think we need to use everi molecul of oxygen in the system to get through this mess   i don   t think this project chang materi help the communic challeng in get through this mess and may complic it in some way  if we are go to do someth beyond our current regim  i would favor do someth slight differ from this   i would favor at least consid publish the averag of our individu view on what the desir long run rate of inflat is  an averag of our judgment of what trend growth is today  and mayb what the natur rate of unemploy is today   we know veri littl about what those latter variabl   trend growth and the natur rate of unemploy   are five to ten year ahead   it is veri hard for us individu to put much confid on whatev the path is toward that point   our current regim for aggreg our forecast the way we do  toss out the individu  make our basic forecast not particular use as a prism   so i would focus on do someth slight differ to chang the regim  and i wouldn   t do it this soon   if we   re go to chang  let   s debat the big thing and not spend too much  e on thing at the june                 of     margin  which fundament aren   t go to offer too much promis relat to the level of ignor we have or relat to the complex that peopl face in read ani particular meaning valu in the aggreg of our forecast the way we now do them
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   my forecast for both econom growth and inflat are within the central tendenc of the rest of you and a littl stronger than the staff   s outlook   in fact  my      project for econom activ for the second half of the year were revis veri littl from two month ago   growth turn out to be stronger than i expect in the first half  and that carri some weight go forward  but financi condit are tighter with higher bond rate and lower equiti price  and of cours oil price are a lot higher and that will damp demand go forward   so i expect slow growth in the second half follow by expans around  mayb a littl abov  the rate of growth of potenti in       and        with the same basic stori that everybodi els has   drag on activ from declin hous activ  decreas wealth  tight credit condit  and higher petroleum price   all of those drag will abat over  e  allow the natur resili  with slight accommod financi condit  to show through  and i assum a gradual tighten of monetari polici begin next year  incom inform on price and cost has been mix   oil and food price increas will rais headlin inflat  but core has been stabl and has come in a littl to the soft side of expect  and labor cost as yet show no sign of acceler   go forward  i see a sharp declin in headlin inflat later this year with the assum level out in oil price and a gradual decreas in core as econom slack inhibit wage and price increas  offset the pass through from oil price   now  that   s my central tendenc   i consid the odd on that be realiz to be even lower than usual  and the usual odd are disappear small   it seem to me that the defin june                 of     characterist of the current situat are uncertainti and risk   we   re face multipl shock  mani of them unpreced in size and persist  in the hous market  financi market  and commod   the outlook is full of puzzl  and in my mind anyon who think he or she understand what   s go on is either a lot smarter than i am or delusion   or both    laughter  i class the risk for both output and headlin inflat as greater than usual  and let me tell you about some of the thing i wrestl with   financi condit  are they accommod   i continu to believ that the   percent nomin fund rate is not indic of a high accommod financi condit  given the current state of financi market   that is  in my view we have limit insur   spread have widen suffici over the past    month both for long term and short term credit  and bank term and condit for loan and line of credit have tighten enough that onli a small part of the drop in the fed fund rate is show through to the cost of capit for median household and firm   the staff   s flow of fund es  show a mark deceler in the growth of both household and busi debt in the first half of this year  from    percent for household last year to   percent in the first half of the year and from    percent for busi to   percent in the first half of the year   a   percent fed fund rate will becom accommod as spread narrow and financi function return more toward normal  and that   s one reason i assum a gradual rise feder fund rate over      and forward  the evid about improv financi market over the intermeet period was decid mix   some spread did come in from late april   invest grade busi tap bond market in size  but almost all spread remain unusu wide   we were remind of the fragil of the evolv situat  especi in the financi sector  with the worri about continu credit problem result in sharp declin in equiti price on financi and an uptick in their cds spread  which had narrow the previous month or two  the downgrad of monolin and june                 of     invest bank  and the increas attent to the problem of region bank   it would be surpris if these were not reflect in even greater caution by bank and other lender in their lend practic   also the securit market  especi for non agenc mortgag  are not function in a way to replac bank intermedi   this is go to be a prolong process of re intermedi  deleverag  and build liquid with an uncertain endpoint   like the staff  i assum that the condit return to someth approach normal over the next    month  but the risk are skew toward an even longer recoveri period  the second topic is household spend   household are face a huge number of advers shock   higher oil price  tighter credit  declin hous price  and rise unemploy   it   s not surpris that confid is at recessionari level   it is surpris that spend is so resili   i assum that the save rate would rise veri gradual onc the tax rebat effect wore off  but i think a more abrupt and sizabl increas in household save is a distinct downsid risk   what about hous   some sale measur have shown a few tentat indic of level off   i was encourag by presid     s report from florida  but i   m also struck by renew pessim about hous in the financi market   equiti of construct firm and builder have declin after stabil  actual rise  earlier this year   abx index have turn down  revers earlier improv  and perhap under the previous two develop  the case shiller futur index remain in steep declin  though today   s inform was less weak than expect   the view of the financi market  anyhow  is that the light at the end of the hous tunnel is reced  and declin in expect hous price must be an import reason for the eros in market confid in financi intermediari  in sum  although the incom data may have reduc the threat of a sharp drop in spend  in my view there remain a veri pronounc downward skew around my outlook for modest growth june                 of     in h  and a strengthen next year   howev  that downward skew around output did not translat into a downward skew around my forecast for headlin inflat   in fact  i saw the risk on headlin inflat as tilt to the upsid  though rough balanc around the gradual decreas in core   i think the upsid risk result from two addit area of uncertainti   one area is commod price  though the trend increas in commod price over the past few year can be attribut to rise demand from emerg market economi relat to sluggish respond suppli   despit nathan   s best effort  i realli don   t think we have much of a clue about the caus of the spike in oil price this year   it has been especi strike to me over the intermeet period  when the price of industri commod have been fall on balanc   presum price in these market alreadi incorpor expect of reason strong global growth outsid the unit state as in the  book   absent ani surpris  futur market quot ought to be the best guid  but what we don   t understand can fool us  especi when so much of the relev inform involv emerg market economi  where data are spars and of question valu   given our experi over the past few year  i think continu increas in commod price would seem to be an upsid risk  the other area is inflat expect   i assum that as headlin inflat come down  both short  and long term inflat expect  especi in the survey data  will revers their recent increas base a lot on the kind of inform that presid   was observ about how the household survey has tend to follow contemporan inflat   i   m encourag by the relat flat read on core inflat and labor compens increas   higher expect have not so far becom embed in price and cost  despit all the talk of pass along cost increas   but headlin inflat is go to rise befor it fall   real wage will be further erod by higher energi cost   although this is a necessari part of an adjust to an advers term of june                 of     trade shock  it will be resist   henc  a further rise in inflat expect and a stronger determin by household and busi to act on those expect will be a risk over come month   with that further rise in oil price  it   s a bigger risk than it was a coupl of month ago  in term of the long term project  mr  chairman  i think i   m fine with someth like your propos   our object for ad a year was to give the public a better sens of where we   re go over the long term   given the shock to the economi  that   s not as inform as it was befor   i think we   re close to where most peopl would say their inflat object was  but not for the growth rate of potenti or the nairu   i could live with option   or presid bullard   s altern to that   to state exact what our long term expect are instead of talk about five to seven year or five to ten year   i don   t think we   ll gain a lot   i don   t think the cost or benefit are veri larg on either side of this   our problem now are not that peopl don   t understand where we   re go in the end   i think they have a pretti good idea that we want inflat to be a lot lower than it has been   but i think they don   t realli understand how we   re go to get either to full employ or to price stabil  given where we   re start   so i think the uncertainti about our object is a veri small problem relat to the other problem now   but if we can reinforc what those object are  it might help a littl around the edg   i do worri  as presid   said  that what we say about output and employ not be interpret as goal but rather as a judgment about the state and the structur of the economi   i am hope that we could take care of that in what we say about what we   re publish   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   at this point everyth has been said  but everybodi hasn   t said it   so let me tri    laughter   let me make three summari point  and then i will talk about three issu that i think are harder   first  on the economi  through late may  as the june                 of      book suggest  the real economi prove more resili and more dynam than the consensus had anticip   consum spend was moder but posit  and the labor market were soft  but neither was necessarili indic of a recess through late may   busi fix invest and corpor profit ex financi look all right   product growth look  frank  impress  and corpor  unlik consum  still appear okay through the month of june   but i   m go to return to june in just a short while   in sum  my assess of the economi reason approxim the averag gdp from the  book for       but i remain consider more cautious on the catalyst for return to trend growth in the forecast period of      and beyond   i suspect that this is a long  slow climb with the credit channel need to be rebuilt and that the process is still in it veri earli stage  second  let me talk about the financi market   financi market continu to show tenuous but real improv in market function   which  as bill   suggest  is remark given the weak among financi institut themselv   leverag loan and high yield market continu to trend toward improv market function   credit spread are well off their march high   credit market  in particular  are hold up well  despit the broad weak across equiti  third  let me turn to inflat risk   inflat risk  in my view  continu to predomin as the greater risk to the economi   there is more evid of a global secular revers of inflat trend  make the job of central banker worldwid consider more difficult   i remain worri about energi and food pass through and the effect of a weaken dollar if our polici rate and those of our major trade partner are perceiv to diverg   i would expect import price  core inflat  and expect to move up in the come month even more than in the  book  like caus a polici respons by our foreign peer   commod price  again  with the except june                 of     of metal  have been move up while global demand is fall  and market have come to see this rise of some  if not most  commod as essenti perman   so at the end of the day  we have to be concern about this period of abov accept inflat   it   s crucial that broader price do not start to rise at still fa  rate  and that could well happen if those make decis about price and pay expect higher inflat in the futur   anecdot are not comfort  particular on the price front   as a result  i think the trajectori of inflat is less favor than in the  book  therebi necessit a polici respons more signific than the  book would suggest  let me turn to three even harder issu   one is consum spend   we   re not done with the second quarter  and my sens of what   s happen in the first three week of june is pretti miser   i hate to extrapol base on three week of data to the trajectori of the economi   but from a discuss with contact from three credit card compani that constitut a littl more than half of the credit card spend  i would say that the view from these guy were shock in how bad thing look in the past three to four week  particular in comparison to reason posit news from the previous two month   it is suggest that june will be much weaker than may  and if i add that to the figur on auto that are come out of the detroit three  those are a coupl of anecdot that make me a littl hesit to declar with an exclam mark what an enviabl second quarter we   ve had   i also look at equiti market price some  as mayb tell us someth   i would say that consum compani and retail over the last three week have gotten kill   so i   m a littl hesit to suggest that the second quarter is go to be strong  delinqu and charg off have also move meaning to the downsid in the last three or four week among these credit card compani  and this weak appear to be much more focus on the coast than it is in the center of the countri   i heard that from three of three   my own view june                 of     may be  influenc by my take on the fiscal s ulus   it sure  sn   t appear to be help veri much  the second issu that i continu to struggl with is financi institut   financi institut equiti price show signific underperform  and some peopl say that is the feder reserv   s fault   we   re talk up our concern about inflat   we   re chang the treasuri curv go forward   i think that is a total red herring   the reason that financi are get kill is an equiti stori   they have busi model that are have a hard  e deliv profit in this environ   they have had to show a veri tough quarter set of loss   i think the problem on financi have to do with financi and not with the fed  though there is a disturb amount of chatter in the market that somehow we   re the caus of that   i am comfort  again as bill   remind us  that the broader market function has been abl to withstand this dramat financi institut weak   whether at some point that will give out i don   t know  but i   d say that   s extrem encourag   in addit  we have to recogn that massiv amount of new capit are go to be need for financi institut of all size   given the weak perform of virtual everi financi invest from novemb till now  i think it is veri easi to see a suppli   demand problem   it is veri easi to see that  with the number of bank that come to these market  some of them at some point might not be abl to find capit even at dramat lower price than their expect   it is prudent for us at the fed to think about altern sourc of more patient institut fund dure this period  the third issu for discuss is credit avail  especi for small busi   this strike me as be key to the labor market situat   credit avail for small busi has held up better than i would have expect four or five month ago  but pocket of weak remain  particular among the region bank  which are a sourc of concern   i guess i   ve becom june                 of     convinc that credit line have not been tap out   there was a theori  one that i even had some sympathi toward  that increas in c i lend in the last few quarter were involuntari  reflect exist credit line that were call upon   that strike me as be somewhat overst  accord to anecdot and our own survey of the term of busi lend  it   suggest that capit is still avail for these small busi to provid some strength to the economi  but again  continu weak among the region could call that into question  let me turn final  mr  chairman  to the project   i have some sympathi for the view that vice chairman   put forth   it strike me that at this  e the market will see the benefit of chang our communic strategi as  yet again  pretti small   the cost are harder for me to be certain about   so if anyon is propos to do this dure the next six month  i would have real hesit about introduc this variabl into our communic strategi amid our assess of all the other challeng that we have   so i favor have a trial run come octob  but i think we should revisit where we stand on the inflat front  the financi institut front  and the growth front befor ad this to the mix   to the extent that we find the appropri  e to go down this path  i would favor option     thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank a lot   well  as i   ve mention mani  e befor  i have thought about this as sort of a long  slow burn scenario  and as we well know  the ember are still smolder   it seem to be less of a risk that they could re ignit  caus a major conflagr  but there is still some chanc of re ignit  and i think there   s still a fair amount of heat   consist with that  my central tendenc view is probabl closer to the  book   s    delay credit recoveri    altern scenario than to the main  book forecast   in look at the altern scenario  there   s not much of a real effect on growth  but that respons is due to a lower fed fund path  june                 of     given the discuss that we   ve had  i think it may be veri difficult to pursu someth like that in this environ  particular given higher uncertainti about inflat and inflat expect  even if  as a number of peopl have mention  inflat expect haven   t move up that much or you pick your favorit measur and some have move up more than other   given that it   s like that we had some transitori factor keep core and headlin inflat down a littl lower than they otherwis might have been and they probabl are go to go up  i think that deal with the    delay credit recoveri    altern scenario in the way that   s discuss in the  book make our polici choic particular difficult  so let me focus briefli on whi i think the delay credit recoveri or slow burn scenario is a reason central tendenc one   i think it relat larg to our continu challeng on bank    balanc sheet  liquid  and capit   bank are face veri high short term financ cost   those libor   oi spread are still at extrem elev level compar with what they   re use to in fund themselv  and this is true whether they are commerci bank or invest bank   the forward suggest that this ain   t go away any  soon   so one thing that this   is simpli to cut into profit and the abil to earn your way out of the challeng   an easi way to do it   of just allow the machin to go forward   is go to produc less than it otherwis would   a lot of institut reli on the feder home loan bank  but those are larg tap out as anoth sourc of financ   we know that the monolin issu has sort of come back  and the challeng there are great   it is undoubt go to be lead to a lot more write down over the next coupl of quarter   on the other hand  as presid    governor    and some other have mention  there have been a few area that seem to have open up   the leverag loan market seem to have open up a bit   peopl seem to be get those leverag loan off their book   and not even at effect subsid financ rate   they were proud of get these off their june                 of     book befor  but they were do it by basic just make anoth loan  which effect  sn   t get them off the book   now it seem as though they are legi  abl to move this  and obvious that book is not grow   that book is shrink  of cours  one of the biggest challeng is in hous  and i see the shock of some of the reset from the nontradit mortgag continu through         we   re see veri signific increas in delinqu and foreclosur  not onli in the subprim space but also in the adjust rate space general   that   s both subprim and prime  although the level for prime are dramat lower   the increas are quit signific for prime arm  and that start to rais some challeng for the institut that didn   t do subprim but may still have a reason amount of prime arm on their book   heloc have been mention and the inabl to securit anyth that   s nonconform   we   ve seen veri littl benefit yet from the chang that allow freddi mac and fanni mae to rais those limit   also  as mani of you know  from my visit around the countri to your district  i see that condit in differ area are dramat differ  but in general a lot of market remain in veri difficult circumst   one of the largest mortgag lender in the countri said that  over the last coupl of month  their averag fico score on what they   ve been origin outsid the conform market has been       that   s astonish high   so that get back to presid     s comment about even with fico score in the stratospher   and they claim that   s an averag fico score  and they have been pull back on the heloc et cetera  on rise delinqu rate for credit card  i didn   t hear quit as bleak a view as governor   describ   i wouldn   t want to say a posit view   they seem to say that it is where they would have expect it to be in this part of a cycl with increas delinqu   one thing that they were see was a littl increas in payment  and so that may be one of the consequ of the s ulus check come   that peopl are use it to pay down some of their credit card debt   but june                 of     a big challeng that they have been see is the so call roll rate   that onc someon begin to go delinqu  they tend to roll right to full loss rather than get some recoveri   it suggest that  when peopl get into troubl  they are in fair deep troubl   all of this mean that the demand for capit is go to be veri high go forward at these institut as provis has to go up   you know  we   ve tap sovereign wealth fund  institut investor  and a lot of other   as governor   said  tap other sourc  encourag perhap privat equiti to come in  is someth that   s import   but how long are these guy will to invest when over the past nine month everi singl invest has seen a reduct rather than an increas in valu   i   m borrow a prop from presid     we have been go around and say     rais capit  you   re worth it       laughter   i hope the invest bank are go around to their sharehold and say that also   so far there   s not a lot of evid that they have been   i think in the long run they will  but we have to worri about that  this slow burn scenario is even more problemat in the context of what vice chairman   mention about some slow of foreign demand that i think may be come and in the context of a fair amount of increas in interest rate that may be come in a lot of these countri  you   re go to be see some credit tighten global  as i think a number of peopl have mention   it is more like  unless there   s a major shock  to be more on the tighten side go forward   this make it more difficult to deal with some of the issu in the    higher inflat expect    altern scenario that was in the  book becaus  when you have this financi fragil  it   s harder perhap to rais interest rate as quick or as much as you would like becaus of the concern about what might happen in the financi market  on inflat  i think much like presid  n and a number of other   it depend on which particular seri you look at   it is hard to say that thing have realli becom unmoor  but i think june                 of     there   s a lot more uncertainti in the mind of both the public and the market particip about where inflat may go   that   s particular problemat when you have the like increas in the actual number come that the  book is forecast for the next quarter or so  and in that context  deal with some of the challeng is more difficult   but we   ll talk about that more tomorrow  on the project  i think it is import that we continu to increas transpar over  e   we structur what we did last  e to make it part of a process  and i think it make sens to period revisit whether we want to continu on that road   i veri much prefer a gradualist approach  in principl  to add year   or so   as the chairman said   but i think there   s a bit of a problem in do that becaus too much mean may be attribut to it   it may be too difficult to avoid say     well  we   re just do a target      if we add year   and year    even though there   s not a lot of inform content in year    i think it help to reduc the kind of shock valu of see that fifth year out there   now  that   s potenti a negat becaus  in some sens  we want to provid more inform that way   but given the fragil condit  as vice chairman   mention  i don   t think that we want to generat a debat on inflat target  employ target  and other thing like that particular right now   so mayb have a gradualist approach  by which we just extend thing to year   and year    which is seen as a natur outgrowth  wouldn   t be as much of a shock   not that i think it would be shock  but i think it might rais as mani concern and as much of a debat and distract us from the key issu that we have befor us   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   well  we have seen recent data that actual have been stronger than expect   also as  e goe on  there seem to be a lower probabl of financi meltdown and these advers feedback loop that we   ve all been discuss   but i don   t june                 of     think we want to becom too sanguin about the current data becaus some veri negat thing are go on that might tell us that this is just veri temporari stuff   in particular  it   s realli remark how weak consum sen ent is   there is also a huge hit from energi price  and it   s go to get wors   one thing in the  book is that the veri low margin that we   ve had in refin are go to increas  so we   re go to see gasolin price that are well over       a gallon  accord to the kind of number you   re come out with  and that is go to be a major contractionari hit to household spend   luckili i don   t drive much anymor   i   m down to less than     mile a year right now   so mayb that is okay  but unfortun i   ll get back to drive more in the futur  in ani case  i do think that what the  book has done is reason in term of chang the forecast   they have a stronger first half  but the longer run forecast  particular regard the output gap  is realli not veri differ  and i think that   s a reason forecast   my baselin is somewhat less op ist becaus i feel that the    delay credit recoveri    altern scenario was actual a nice one to put in this  book  and i was glad to see it becaus it is veri close to the way i am think about the situat right now   i think there   s go to be a much slower recoveri of financi market than was in the  book baselin becaus two thing have to occur for us to get back to normal underwrit   this  of cours   sn   t mean what we had befor  which did not have serious enough underwrit standard  but someth we think is realist given the kind of risk in the economi   financi institut have to have enough capit just to make loan   so there   s the direct effect that we think about   but also the securit market is clear veri impair   eventu it will come back  but it will need new busi model to solv the agenc issu that have led to all of the heartach that we   ve seen recent   when i think about how that is go to happen  i think the larg financi institut have to play a key role becaus you need somebodi who will origin these loan and then will have the incent to make sure that the june                 of     agenc problem are not sever   onli when that   s done can they be sold off  and that requir that there is recours  which requir that they have plenti of capit   of cours  it is a veri slow process for them to build up capit in the current environ   so given that situat  i think the idea that the financi market will be back to normal over the next year or two is a littl op ist  it   s go to take a long  e for this to get work out   so the bottom line scenario is one in which we   re go to have strong headwind for quit a  e  and that   s go to be import in term of our monetari polici stanc  when i think about inflat  as you know  i put a lot of emphasi on long run inflat expect and on expect about futur econom slack in the economi   at this point  i do not see a major chang and deterior in long run inflat expect   i   ll explain that in a second   i should emphas that i say that is true so far   but an issu is whether that will chang  and that   s go to be veri import in term of how we manag monetari polici   the first thing i look at when i think about long run inflat expect are  of cours  the survey of consum  as you know  i   ve alway been a littl skeptic of them  but i think that my view are veri similar to the one that presid   mention   i have a slight differ explan use behavior econom   behavior econom tell you that survey will rise a lot with what happen current and overreact and that   s exact what should happen becaus it   s a frame issu   you see veri high headlin inflat   you   re go to rais expect of inflat one year out   but it   s veri natur that you   re go to rais them for the longer term  and they   ll come back down when headlin inflat come down   so i realli am not as concern about the survey expect be a long run problem as long as inflat come back down   i think there are good indic that it will  given that headlin is so much higher than core and that core has actual stay veri stabl  june                 of     the other thing that i look at  and look at much more serious  are the survey of profession forecast  which have basic move up a bit but not veri much and have not gotten much out of the rang in which they have been in the past  and then inform from financi market  that is  inflat compens   again  that has not risen recent  and actual it   s better than it was at it peak   so i don   t see a huge problem there   what this tell me about the inflat forecast is   you know  i   m a   percent kind of guy on pce  and i   m still a   percent guy   that even though headlin inflat is veri elev  we   re go to see over the forecast period that inflat will come back down to around the   percent level both on the headlin and on the core   howev  though my baselin on this is that inflat will return to a level that  by the way  i am comfort with as an inflat object  i do veri much worri that inflat expect could be more fragil in the current environ   so it   s not that i think we have to do someth now   but we do have to be extrem vigil to see whether inflat expect are actual start to move in an undesir direct  and if so  we will have to take action   the challeng may be that we have to take action when unemploy is still rise  but what is key is that we have to be awar of that   my modal forecast is that it isn   t go to happen  but i think we have to be readi to deal with it and deal with it quick   as you  know  i   m not a believ in gradual in circumst such as we are in current  and i think this appli to deal not onli with financi disrupt but also current with inflat expect   we have to be will to move veri quick in that context  let me turn to the issu of long term project   you will not be veri surpris to know that  in fact  i   m a support of this   this committe has actual been well serv   even though it is not my normal person   as you know  i like to move fast on thing   we have move in an evolutionari process in term of communic  and i think that has work quit well for us  june                 of     this is just an obvious next step   our communic strategi in term of the long run project now has an import flaw in that we are not provid the inform that we intend to provid  and it need a fix   we now realiz that that   s the case   it   s particular relev concern inform about potenti output growth and the nairu   i do share the concern that presid   mention on these  and i have talk about this in mani speech   i think this can be handl by speech   in particular  by the chairman emphas these issu go forward   so i don   t see it as a huge problem  but it is someth that we have to deal with  in ani case  we need to clarifi what our project mean   we   re not provid inform that we should   we have to fix it  and there   s no reason not to   i think it   s a minor chang   i do not think that there will be much reaction by the market or in the polit sphere on this   i agre complet with governor kohn that  relat to the other problem that we are deal with  this is veri small potato  but i think it is good to show that we   re still stick to the basic thing that we need to stick to and that  in this veri complex environ  we can do the thing that need to be done on communic strategi   that argu that we should be do this and even do it right now   regard the issu that you rais about go more to the full monti on this kind of stuff  i do agre with vice chairman   that now is not the  e to do that   i should mention that i will be give a speech in which i will be advoc go to an explicit inflat object  but that   s becaus i   m leav the board  and i have to say what i think   but there   s an issu in term of what this committe should be do  and i am sympathet to vice chairman     s view that this is not what we should be do for the committe right now   on the other hand  i   m a free individu now   in go back to be a civilian  i can say what i want  in term of my prefer  i realli don   t feel strong   there are a lot of issu here   when i first thought about it  i prefer an option like   becaus i didn   t want to give the impress that june                 of     we   re great at forecast five year out  and i think that   s realli the strongest argument for it   but i do understand how we articul that is a littl t i  and i think that   s someth that we have to think about   it might be clearer to do someth along the line that presid bullard discuss  as argu it that way  but mayb we can do it in some other way   i think that   s exact whi the staff can have some extra work for themselv to think about the best way to describ this  but i think someth along the line of provid inform that we actual are put in our project right now  where we have a littl section that say     what are your long term assumpt     and we put them down   somehow we need to convey that inform to the public   then the question is  what   s the best way to do that   you can have all the wonder argument that we have over the statement each period   we   ll get someth like that go  and i think we   ll figur it out   thank you
thank you  and thank you all   first  on the long term project  i think there   s consensus that we should just go ahead and have a trial run   the staff should review the transcript and make gold out of straw there   we should consult with the subcommitte  and we should think about mayb even a coupl of altern   mayb we could tri a coupl of altern way of do it in octob   so let   s go ahead and do someth along those line and keep think about how best to do it  let me first  as i usual do  tri to summar the discuss around the tabl  and i   ll add some comment of my own   begin with the summari  the incom data were stronger than expect  notabl for consum spend but for some other compon as well   as a result  econom growth in the second quarter  though not robust  was like posit  continu the pattern of weak but posit growth sinc the fourth quarter of        howev  to the extent that strength in consumpt was transitori or due primarili to fiscal s ulus  some of the growth in the june                 of     second quarter may have been borrow from the second half   particip general saw growth continu at a slow pace the rest of the year and improv in        there was  howev  some diverg of view  with some expect a longer period of slow growth  recent number on retail sale suggest that the consum is hold up better than expect  consum financ may be better than fear  and the fiscal s ulus may alreadi be have an effect   howev  as mani have note  there are substanti drag on consumpt go forward  includ fall wealth and incom  credit constraint  and the recent rise in energi price  sen ent has also fallen notic further   weaker consumpt may  thus  restrain growth later this year  particular after the effect of the s ulus wane   labor market continu to soften but at a relat moder pace   the peak in unemploy is project to be between     percent and   percent   that   s what i general heard around the tabl   prospect for hous continu weak  with fall price  high inventori  and weak demand   some saw a possibl bottom form but note that the recoveri of this sector is still some way off   as has been the case for a while  busi are quit cautious  note econom uncertainti and surg input cost  with one or two mention of tighter credit  although that was not a domin theme today   real export continu to grow and are partial offset weaker domest demand  especi in the case of manufactur  financi condit have been mix sinc the last meet  although the improv from march have larg been maintain and the risk of system crisi may have reced to some degre   fund market are general do better   the concern about credit loss have led the stock price of bank  includ region bank and invest bank  to fall sharpli   capit rais continu  though at less favor term and with perhap declin avail   as the economi continu weak and hous contract further  more credit loss for bank may well be in store  ad to financi market stress and reduc the avail of new credit   progress in the june                 of     financi market is like to be slow as the deleverag process will take a while   stock price in general are also lower   financi condit in the hous market remain import downsid risk to growth  with the spurt in oil price ad to those risk   uncertainti about the growth prospect are great   howev  tail risk may have moder somewhat  read on core inflat have remain relat moder   howev  the sharp rise in oil price and some other commod price  in part reflect flood in the midwest  is like to lead to veri high level of headlin inflat over the next few month   gas and food price have becom perhap the most import econom issu for consum  and firm are feel ever increas cost pressur   moreov  inflat pressur are global   there are increas report of firm be abl to pass through these cost  which could lead to an increas in core inflat   on the other hand  slack may restrain core inflat increas   measur of longer term inflat expect have been up a bit on net sinc april  depend to some extent on the measur chosen   nomin wage growth is still slow   particip debat how much comfort to take from slow wage growth  some argu that  by the  e wage reflect higher inflat expect  it would be too late   most saw inflat risk as now to the upsid  with the primari concern be the possibl that inflat expect could rise further as headlin inflat rise and more cost are pass through   that   s my veri  veri quick summari   if anyon has ani comment  i   d be happi to hear them  if not  let me just say a coupl of word on my own view here   this may come as a surpris to some of you  but i am not a fine tuner   i think that the object of the feder reserv ought to be to avoid a veri bad outcom  and so my concern are primarili with tail risk on both side of our mandat   i think that the evid of the last month or so provid a bit of reassur  on both the real side and the financi side  that the tail risk on the growth side of the mandat have june                 of     moder somewhat   that be said  i think they remain and are still signific   in particular  as i mention in the summari  i am at this point still suspici of the strength that we saw in the second quarter   if we look at the fundament for consumpt   includ wealth  incom  employ  and energi price   and look at the plung in sen ent  which is at remark low level  i think there   s a veri good chanc that consum will weaken go forward and bring the rest of the economi along with them   in addit  of cours  hous remain extrem uncertain  we are at best some distanc from stabil in that market   even when residenti construct begin to stabil  we   ll still see continu declin in hous price  which will affect consum spend and  import  will affect financi market as well as the valu of mortgag  with respect to financi market  i agre certain that the crisi atmospher that we saw in march has reced mark  but i do not yet rule out the possibl of a system event   we saw in the intermeet period that we have consider concern about lehman brother  for exampl  we watch with some concern the consumm of the bank of america   countrywid merger  we worri about a bank in the midwest   other region bank are under various kind of stress  we   re see problem with the financi guarantor  with the mortgag insur   so i think that those kind of risk are still there  and we need to be veri care in observ them   moreov  even if system risk have fade  we still have the eye of the storm phenomenon   we may now be between the period of the write down of the subprim loan and the period in which the credit loss associ with the slowdown in the economi begin to hit in a big way and we see sever problem at bank  particular contract in credit extens  so i   m not yet persuad that the tail risk are gone   i think it would be veri valuabl to have some more data  some more observ  to see how the financi market and the economi are proceed   but i want to say that i do agre that the develop in financi market and the june                 of     surpris strong data in the second quarter should lead us to feel somewhat better   i think we should take a littl credit for our various effort to support both the financi system and the economi  now  what about tail risk on the other side   on inflat   the increas in oil price that we   ve seen in the past six week is obvious veri  veri bad news   i think that the combin of the commod price increas and what we   re go to see as veri ugli headlin inflat number is begin to generat a tail risk on that side of the mandat as well  and i am becom concern about that   inde  i think that it   s now appropri that we begin  as some of us alreadi have  to move rhetor toward acknowledg that risk and agre that it may be at the point where it even exceed the risk that we see on the growth side  although i think we   re veri uncertain about that  now  the concern i have is the follow  which is that there has been a lot of talk about polici action   i don   t think that a    basi point or even a    basi point move  if it   s not view as be the start of a continu increas  is go to do veri much on the inflat side  frank   we had a good test of that over the intermeet period   part becaus of our rhetor and for other reason  the dollar strengthen   the two year rate rose    or    basi point  and oil price went up       i do not think that with a small chang in our stanc we can do anyth about commod price  and frank  it   s commod price that you   re hear about from your board member and from peopl you talk to   it   s the real chang in the relat price of those commod that is pain and the real chang in the term of trade come through the dollar which is pain  and i don   t think we can do veri much about those in the short term   our object  of cours  as everyon has note  is to prevent that from becom a sustain and persist sourc of inflat  june                 of     so the problem then is that a small amount of movement will not solv the problem   a small to moder movement  howev  might creat some serious financi strain given the fragil of the system   i think what we need to do is to decid when we reach that tip point  there will be a tip point at which we   re suffici confid that the system is stabil and that we can begin to turn in a serious way to the inflat concern   a partial one step  unless it signal a longer term tighten program  could give us the worst of both world   we will just have to make the judgment about when we have reach the point of have to switch from our previous approach of support the economi and financi system to an approach that is aim more at contain inflat   it   s go to be a veri difficult and delic situat  but i want to express again my agreement with those of you who are worri about inflat and my belief that the  e might be relat soon   but it   s go to be a veri  veri delic decis and one that we have to make with great concern and consider  a littl anticlimact  i would like to say just a coupl of word about the     s becaus they keep come up and i do think that these comparison are a bit mislead   first  in the current episod  commod price   particular oil price   are basic most or almost all the inflat that we   re see   that was not the case in the      s   in particular  inflat rose consider befor the first oil price shock in        pce inflat was   percent in       which prompt the wage    price control  of cours  which is an episod we   re all familiar with  and in       befor the oil shock  averag hour earn were grow between   and   percent   there was alreadi a serious inflat problem befor the oil price shock came   henc  credibl was alreadi damag at the  e of the oil price shock   that is not the case here  second  the movement in wage and core inflat follow the oil price shock in the     s was veri strike   from the  e of the oil price shock right befor the second quarter of june                 of          until the first quarter of       total inflat rose a littl over   percentag point  reflect the quadrupl of oil price   dure the same period  core inflat rose more than   percentag point   in other word  core inflat respond almost one for one to total inflat   moreov  averag hour earn rose more than   percentag point  and product and cost compens rose     percentag point in that year and a half   so there was a veri strong sensit of expect and pass through to these commod price shock   obvious  we   ve been see oil price increas sinc       and they have not yet shown anyth like that effect on core inflat or on wage  the final observ i   d make about the     s is that we shouldn   t forget that  even in that veri bad situat with veri poor anchor inflat expect  the slow of the economi did do someth to reduc inflat   in particular  core inflat fell     percentag point dure      follow the           recess   so while we cannot do much about oil price  i do think that there is some hope that weak in the economi is go to provid some restraint on core inflat  which of cours will generat a more stabl total inflat rate if and when commod price stabil   so i   ve been veri all over the map here   i apolog   i tri to organ my thought in the meet  my bottom line is that i think the tail risk on the growth and financi side have moder  i do think  howev  that they remain signific   we cannot ignor them   i   m also becom concern about the inflat side  and i think our rhetor  our statement  and our bodi languag at this point need to reflect that concern   we need to begin to prepar ourselv to respond through polici to the inflat risk  but we need to pick our moment  and we cannot be halfheart   when the  e come  we need to make that decis and move that way becaus a halfheart approach is go to give us the worst of both world   it   s go to give us financi stress without ani benefit june                 of     on inflat   so we have a veri difficult problem here  and we are go to have to work togeth cooper to achiev what we want to achiev  the last thing i   d like to say is on communic   just talk about communic follow this meet  i   d like to advis everyon  includ myself  to lean  not to lurch   that is  we are move toward more concern about inflat  but we still have concern about econom growth and financi market   we should show that shift in emphasi as we talk to the public  but we should not give the impress that inflat is the entir stori or that we have somehow decid that growth and financi problem are behind us  becaus they are not   so if we can convey that in a suffici subtl way  i think we will prepar the market for the ul  movement that we   re go to have to make  again  i veri much appreci your insight and your attent today   we have a dinner at       and for that reason i think we should probabl bring this to a close   we   ll start tomorrow morn with     s present of the polici option   the statement is essenti the same as the bluebook   s   there won   t be ani surpris there   so we   ll begin with that first thing in the morn   thank you   meet recess  june                 of     june            morn session
good morn  everybodi  particip   good morn
we have two major item this morn   we   ll first complet the discuss of polici action and the statement  and in the second part of the meet  we   ll discuss supervis of invest bank and some relat polici issu   over lunch  if  e permit  we   d like to hear la  blanchard talk about congression develop  and we   ll have a chanc to ask question there as well   so without further ado  let me turn to   to introduc the polici discuss
thank you  mr  chairman   i will begin by refer to the draft announc languag in tabl    includ in the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      as chairman bernank note ye day  this version is onli slight revis from the version discuss in the bluebook   rather than keep you in suspens  i will note now that the revis is simpli to strike the phrase    near term    from altern b  paragraph     turn first to altern a  the committe would eas polici    basi point at this meet and would issu a statement similar to the one publish after the april fomc meet   the second paragraph would indic that econom activ has remain weak in recent month   it would recogn that consum spend appear to have firm but would go on to mention other aspect of econom perform that remain weak   the paragraph on inflat would cite the recent further increas in energi price but would also note the stabil of core inflat   it would again express the committe   s expect for inflat to moder  part reflect a level off of energi price  but would acknowledg that uncertainti about the inflat outlook remain high   as in april  the final paragraph would be silent on the balanc of risk and on the like path of polici   for most of you  your baselin outlook would seem to provid littl support for select of altern a at this meet   as was note ye day  most of you condit your project on a path for polici that begin to tilt up either immedi or some  in the next few quarter   with such a polici path  the central tendenc of your project point to a gradual pickup in econom growth and a fair prompt drop in total inflat as energi and other commod price level out but onli a gradual declin in core inflat  which reflect the moder amount of econom slack that you forese over the next few year   as was illustr in one of    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     june                 of     the op  control simul present in the bluebook  a case can be made for altern a if you agre with the staff baselin outlook and favor aim for   percent inflat over the longer term   one of the es  polici rule present in the bluebook also suggest modest further eas  but again that prescript reli on the staff   s forecast rather than on your general stronger near term outlook   but given the modal outlook of most member of the committe  ani case for eas at this meet would seem to be best motiv by persist concern about the downsid risk to growth that mani of you again cite in your forecast submiss  the    recess    simul in the  book provid one plausibl scenario for the realiz of such risk and suggest that the fund rate might need to be lower to     percent   under altern b  the committe would leav the stanc of polici unchang at this meet   the statement would note that econom activ continu to expand and  as in altern a  would mention the firm of consum spend   it would cite the same factor that could restrain econom growth that were referenc in april and would add the rise in energi price to the list   the inflat paragraph would again convey the committe   s anticip that inflat will moder but would elid the explan for that expect and would refer high uncertainti about inflat prospect   the final paragraph would indic that the downsid risk to growth appear to have diminish somewhat and that the upsid risk to inflat and inflat expect have increas   as i note previous  we have suggest that the phrase    near term    be struck as the committe   s focus presum is on longer term inflat   the refer to risk to both growth and inflat would be consist with the concern that you express in your forecast submiss   the statement propos for altern b seem general in line with market expect  and an announc along these line is unlik to provok much market reaction   by point to reduc risk to growth and increas risk to inflat while not explicit state that the inflat risk predomin  the committe would like be seen as suggest that it next polici move could be toward firm but also that such a move probabl was not immin   a polici approach along the line of altern b seem general consist with the project that mani of you provid for this round   although most particip condit their project on a steeper polici path than the one in the  book  mani also appear to assum that the firm process would not commenc until later this year or in        a decis to stand pat at this meet might be motiv import by your sens that the risk in both direct around your baselin project are substanti   while stay your hand today might risk a further upcreep in inflat expect  you might also be concern that a polici firm now  given that financi market are still fragil  would risk have outsiz market effect with advers implic for an economi that remain weak   as a result  you may see benefit to allow more  e for financi market to recuper and more  e for inform on the outlook to accumul befor take polici action  hold the fund rate at   percent at this meet would be consist with the june                  of     committe   s past behavior as captur by the es  outcom base rule present in the bluebook   under altern c  the final column  the committe would firm polici    basi point at this meet   in the statement  the paragraph on real activ would be ident to that for altern b   howev  the third paragraph would provid the motiv for the action by emphas that overal inflat has been elev  that energi price have risen further  and that inflat expect have risen further  no assess of the balanc of risk would be provid in the final paragraph  thus avoid a suggest that the firm signal a sequenc of further rate increas  nonetheless  with market particip current see onli a small chanc of a rate increas at this meet  an announc along the line of altern c would like prompt a consider jump in short  and intermedi term market interest rate   although most of your forecast appear to assum that polici firm would begin later this year or earli next year  some of you explicit assum an earlier start to polici tighten   member might believ that firm at this meet is warrant part by evid of some reduct in downsid risk to growth   recent spend data suggest that econom activ has a bit more forward momentum than previous perceiv  reduc the odd on recess  the modest improv in financi market condit point to some reduct in downsid risk  and the feder reserv   s special liquid facil appear to have been success in reduc the odd of negat tail event and sever advers feedback loop   thus member might see it as appropri now to begin to revers some of the committe   s past polici action to the extent that those action were seen as motiv by downsid risk that have now diminish   also  near term firm might be motiv by the further increas in inflat pressur and risk result from the continu upward march of energi and some other commod price   final  with inflat expect continu to show some sign of move up  a firm of polici at this  e might be view as a  e shot across the bow that could be help in restrain such expect   i thought that it might be help to conclud by review two exhibit from the medium term strategi section of the bluebook  start with the op  polici simul that are reproduc in exhibit     the simul under these exhibit are base on the frb us model after adjust it to line up with the  book forecast and extens   as usual  these simul assum that you aim to minim the sum of squar deviat of inflat from target  squar deviat of the unemploy rate from the nairu  and squar chang in the nomin fund rate   two key point can be drawn from these simul   first  whether polici firm should begin sooner or later may depend part on your longer run inflat object   as shown by the black line in the top right hand panel  if your object for the longer run is to get back to a   percent inflat rate  these simul suggest that you can hold the fund rate steadi or even eas slight june                  of     further befor begin to firm in        this polici path produc a somewhat fa  declin in the output gap and thus somewhat slower disinfl than in the  book and extens   in contrast  the simul shown in the left hand column suggest that pursuit of a     percent inflat object would involv polici firm begin quit soon   in general  the polici path describ by mani of you in your forecast submiss seem to fall between these two scenario  appar reflect your sens that aggreg demand growth could be a bit stronger and inflat pressur a bit more intens than project by the staff as well as your dissatisfact with a path for inflat that is as shallow as that for the scenario with a   percent inflat object   the second point underscor by these simul is that  even though the near term path for the unemploy rate is a bit lower than in april  reflect the recent indic of somewhat greater strength in aggreg demand  the medium term outlook involv larger and more persist slack than foreseen in april under either inflat goal   despit that greater slack  as shown in the bottom two panel  core inflat under both inflat object run     to     percentag point higher over the next four year than in the april simul   that  of cours  is the fundament natur of a negat suppli shock   policymak are forc to accept some combin of greater econom slack and higher inflat dure a period of transit to a lower output path and  presum  to an unchang long run inflat rate   that same point was made in a bluebook box and in a staff paper on this subject   turn to your final exhibit  i would like to note that  in respons to the comment of some member at recent fomc meet  the r  exhibit in the bluebook has been augment to includ two addit measur of the real feder fund rate   line    in the tabl at the bottom show a measur of the real feder fund rate that use lag headlin inflat as a proxi for expect inflat   by contrast  our standard measur  shown on line     employ lag core inflat as the proxi   line    show a measur base on the staff   s project of headlin inflat   both of these new measur  at minus     percent  are consider lower than the current valu of the standard measur  minus     percent   i want to emphas  first  that these addit measur should not be compar direct with the r  measur shown in line   through   of the tabl becaus the valu of those measur are in part a function of the proxi use for expect inflat   for exampl  the r  valu that would be consist with the  book project and the actual real fund rate base on the lag four quarter averag of headlin inflat is minus     percent   moreov  even if we redefin the  book consist measur of r  to use lag headlin inflat  the impli     percentag point gap between the actual and the es  equilibrium real rate would not necessarili impli that you should quick rais the nomin fund rate by more than    percentag point   if  like the staff  you think it like that headlin inflat will moder substanti later this year  then it follow that a gradual firm of polici in nomin term would be consist with a substanti rise in the june                  of     real fund rate on this measur over  e   inde  in the staff   s view  the averag valu of the real feder fund rate over the next few year on ani measur is a bit abov the correspond valu of r   and consequ the trajectori of the real fund rate on ani measur would be consist with protract slack and declin inflat over the next sever year   of cours  you may not agre with the staff about under trend for price and real activ and  henc  about the valu of r    even if you do agre  you may be dissatisfi with the project trajectori for key variabl such as output  employ  and inflat   such consider illustr whi no es  of r  can be a complet guid to polici   that complet my prepar remark
thank you   are there question for     presid
thank     for includ these two new line of the real feder fund rate   as i remark ye day  one use of the figur is to look back and judg the degre of accommod relat to other histor episod   my understand is that the  book forecast of headlin inflat four quarter ahead is higher now than it was in       when the black line in your exhibit   last hit it lowest point   my understand is that  if you drew that black line use the equival of line     the  book   s forecast for overal inflat  the trough in      would lie around zero  and we would now be at minus
unfortun  presid    i haven   t made that comput  so i can   t confirm that
okay   just a comment then
just a quick question   when you do this base on the  book project for headlin inflat  how far forward are you go with headlin inflat
well  in ani given quarter  it   s four quarter ahead
four quarter ahead
ani other question
it might be help if you would circul your remark about the new exhibit   and it implic after the meet   that was veri help   but i just want to clarifi one thing   could you just repeat what you said   look forward under ani of these basic measur  where do you expect the real fed fund rate to be in relat to r
the actual real feder fund rate is abov r  under ani measur   so in other word  our outlook is the same   these are just differ yardstick for assess our basic view of the stanc of polici
if there are no further question  whi don   t we begin our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to start by say that i agre with your comment ye day about how we should proceed with the committe approach and think veri collabor about the polici and delic strategi that we   re face   although we disagre on a number of the element of the outlook  i think that bring everyth togeth is a veri import part of this  i have fulli endors fund rate cut that we have taken so far in larg part as insur against tail risk to growth   i think that polici last summer was much too restrict given what we were face and that  along the way  a lot of these cut have been motiv by tail risk to growth  the fund rate at   percent is pretti ampl insur to my mind   more so given the improv in the outlook for growth that we   ve seen as second quarter growth has been mark up so much and even more so given the inflat risk that we   re face  the risk to inflat expect  and the potenti veri low real interest rate that we might be look at  depend on the measur   if june                  of     we had the opportun to recalibr thing a bit  i probabl would prefer someth more like a     percent fed fund rate to be posit against the differ risk that we   re face  but i understand that we   re at   percent  and no chang seem like the right move for today  i do have a few concern about the way we   re think about this  more in the line of risk  one is that  as we take insur against tail risk  we   re posit the fund rate against an event that we think is not the most like and is negat compar with where we are   unless and until that event happen  polici is somewhat accommod becaus it hasn   t happen  and we   re think that it is closer to where it ought to be if that should happen   unless you think that we haven   t taken out insur  then i think that we have more accommod than we might like  the second concern is whether it is possibl to be more precis about what we mean by this tail risk   i mean  it   s realli a catch all   nobodi is veri comfort with all of this   what are the marker that we could look at for improv if we could quantifi this somehow   is it that financi market should be function better   i think sure that is the case   is there a way that we could describ that   i   m sure we   ll disagre on mani element of this   labor market improv   we should expect that  if the labor market   better than we were think  then that would tend to bol  consumpt spend a bit better in the face of all the shock that we   re look at   so the extent to which the labor market  sn   t continu to deterior  at least in line with some of the recess scenario and the tail risk scenario that we were think about  is a potenti marker  as we keep push out our expect that the economi is go to weaken   and we   ve done this a number of  e   and if we   re look at the third quarter be revis up   and i agre that we   re face a lot of risk there   but if we start mark that one up  i think that   s a marker that we have to be concern about   obvious  if oil price and commod price were to june                  of     declin and free up purchas power for consum  that would help out  too   so these are just some of the thing that come to mind   is there a way to think about the detail a littl better  with a bit less of a swag  anoth risk relat to financi market   here i   m think about the realli influenti work of your  in       on nonmonetari influenc on the great depress   a lot of the action that we have taken are defens against those type of issu  right   in the     s  when the economi was do veri bad and bank were fail   i   m tell this to you  and you   ve describ it to everyon   then the knock on effect was that the bank weren   t there anymor and import resourc for evalu credit were lost  and so it was more expens and veri difficult to do   we have some of that go on now  right   we   ve move from the bank make mortgag and hold them to the    origin to distribut    model   those resourc have been dispers  and now that securit market is close   i heard that veri clear ye day   those import resourc aren   t there to origin mortgag  so if we get to the point that buyer are will to purchas these hous  that could be a concern  what happen if there   s a true impair to the financi capit stock  and real resourc aren   t there anymor to help out with this   we   re probabl look at a realloc of resourc from that sector of the financi market either back to bank or to somewher els   but as we see those resourc realloc and as we think about unemploy be higher  we can talk ourselv into think that a lot of slack is in the economi when  in fact  there may not be so much slack   at some point it may be slack  and at other  e it won   t be  until those resourc are realloc most effici   i think this could reduc potenti growth rate and have structur element to it  not just cyclic element   so there   s not a slam dunk for this   there is just a risk that an element of that is play out throughout this  and other factor are superimpos on that  june                  of     but it   s someth that i worri about   in a robust type of polici develop  i think we should be consid thing like that   it   s just the case that  in the current situat that we   re look at  there might be a limit role for monetari polici to repair real capit stock  anoth concern is that any  we   ve engag in substanti risk manag polici  there has alway been difficulti in take them back   that   s part of the delic strategi that you are refer to  i think   that   s how i heard it   so we have to be veri care   there   s a lot of art to this clear  but it would be good if we could offer a few more bright line about how we   ll approach that   still  i certain agre   i think we need to seek consensus   it   s our role to rais these issu and then come to the best judgment   so i   m quit comfort with no chang today   i   m quit comfort with the languag in altern b  although in the third paragraph we say     howev  in light of the continu increas in the price of energi     and i think it would be better if we didn   t say    continu      i think it   s enough to say    the increas      in part  i don   t know if this is a marker that  if price level out  we   d still be comfort with the inflat risk   i think that there will be a lag effect of all the veri larg increas that we   ve seen for oil as they work their way through  if price just level out  we still have risk to inflat expect   so i prefer take that out  thank you  mr  chairman
a two hander  mr  chairman
presid    so you are argu that the re intermedi process is go to rais the nairu   i thought that the nairu depend on the structur of the labor market  job match  and stuff like that  so i didn   t quit understand the connect
i   m allud  without understand or work out  to a sector shift model of unemploy and how that search process could be more difficult   you   re just take resourc that over some period took a while to alloc to the financi sector and now they have to be realloc somewher els
thank you  mr  chairman   recogn  as i do  where we   re come from and it danger  i think more recent data suggest that the downsid risk to growth have diminish  and in my judgment the current stanc of polici is much more accommod than necessari to address these risk   i continu to believ that the two most recent polici action of this committe were more than suffici  and we realli need to think about revers them sooner rather than later  inflat risk have risen  and we have seen eros in longer term inflat expect   as i note in my previous remark on the outlook  if we do not begin to remov polici accommod soon  i think we risk have to tighten polici more aggress in the futur to reestablish our credibl  a coupl of thing   it struck me in look at some of the major economi besid the unit state   the european union  japan  and china   if you look at the real interest rate  they   re low   i mean  they are   percent or less or negat   so this is a lot of s ulus come into the world economi   and to make my point again  i don   t think you can have a sustain recoveri with a sustain inflationari environ  which we   re in danger of encount if we continu on this path  over the past sever week  market have signific alter their expect fund rate path to remov polici accommod  and therefor  i don   t know that do someth today would be that big a surpris   the current fund rate path built into the market rate is closer to what june                  of     i believ is desir to maintain price stabil over the long run  but i would prefer move somewhat fa      percent by the end of this year and perhap    percent by the end of         thus  in my view  we should begin the process of remov monetari polici accommod by increas the fed fund rate target by    basi point at this meet   i think this action would perhap be somewhat unexpect  and i recogn that there is some risk that market would react by move the fund rate path up more dramat than some might desir   howev  take this action would move us beyond mere talk about inflationari risk and would help us contain inflat expect by reaffirm our commit to maintain price stabil   i think it would quick have a posit effect on the economi as these expect begin to shift   now  assum that   s not the major view today  i would then encourag us to set the stage in our languag for stronger action come in the futur   that is an import issu especi  as you mention ye day  in term of remark that we might make follow this meet  in speech and so forth  final  let me just say that i think polici is current accommod  perhap veri accommod   the insur polici taken out earlier this year to guard against the tail risk of spillov of the financi distress to activ is less necessari  perhap far less necessari  and it is potenti even harm to the effort of maintain price stabil   therefor  i encourag action sooner rather than later   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the growth outlook has improv over the last two month  but the inflat pictur has not   if anyth  it has deterior   i think it   s clear  as presid hoenig argu  that we should be tighten polici soon   the extent to which we brought the fund rate down was predic on downsid risk and the notion that we could revers cours june                  of     rapid   as downsid risk now look much less like  i just don   t see how an argument that   percent was the appropri fund rate in april   not also impli that a higher fund rate would be appropri now   take back some of that s ulus at this meet  howev  is probabl inconsist with the commit impli by the committe   s tradit interest rate smooth behavior   so i   m will to stand pat today with the fund rate  the  e of such move is go to present us with some troubl go forward  though  even if we avoid outright recess  as now seem probabl  the unemploy rate is like to keep rise for a  e   but wait isn   t go to make it easier for us  in ani event  becaus there   s a likelihood of the fourth quarter   s show a slowdown when the s ulus wear off   but inflat is go to increas in the near term as well   at least that seem like  and hold rate down while that happen and while inflat expect are alreadi fair elev seem aw riski to me  i can understand the need for some convict when we rais rate   when we began cut rate aggress in januari  there were some signific uncertainti in the inflat outlook  though   i hope we don   t set ani higher a threshold of convict for rate increas than we set for rate cut   look back at          and this is strict in hindsight  one can argu that we er by wait too long to revers cours  and i   ve heard you yourself make that argument  mr  chairman  so the logic of risk manag work in both direct   i think we need to keep that in mind
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b with the propos word   given the forecast and the risk around it  our next move on the fund rate is like to be up  and the question is when   assum that the data on growth and inflat come in rough as i and the  book expect  i would envis begin to remov polici accommod toward the june                  of     end of this year  similar to the assumpt in the  book   as i mention  i   m not veri confid that the outlook for growth and employ has improv as much as the  book assum   i   m concern that household and firm are in a python squeez of an intensifi credit crunch and a continu declin in hous wealth as well as pressur from surg food and energi price   i think the economi has shown resili so far  and that   s reassur  but i don   t think it   s assur for the futur   the aggress polici action that we have put in place sinc januari are actual work to cushion the blow  and that   s part of the reason that we haven   t seen a greater unravel so far  i mention ye day that  with respect to inflat  the behavior of both core inflat and wage thus far make me op ist that headlin inflat will come down if commod price final level off   but i think there   s no doubt that the risk with respect to inflat are not symmetr at this point  and they have definit increas   i still see inflat expect as reason well anchor  but there   s no doubt that a wage   price spiral could develop  and deal with it would be a veri difficult and veri pain problem for the committe   so while i feel that we are essenti credibl now  i wouldn   t want to take absolut for grant that this is someth that we can count on go forward  at this point  the feder fund rate remain well below the recommend of most version of the taylor rule   i have view this as appropri  not larg as insur against downsid risk but simpli in refect of the unusu sever pressur from collaps wealth and tight credit and financi constraint   but it   seem to me to be appropri go forward to at least take out some insur against the develop of a wage   price spiral mental  and that could take the form of gradual remov that discrep from what  for exampl  a taylor rule june                  of     recommend   but befor we begin to do that  it   seem to me that we should wait to get a somewhat clearer pictur of where the real side is go
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in my view the economi is evolv in a way that suggest that we need to take back sooner rather than later some of the insur we put in place against downsid tail risk   i base this view on sever point   first  econom activ remain weak   i don   t disput that   the data sinc our last meet have been better than expect   the  book forecast as well as most privat sector forecast have been revis up   so although downsid risk remain  the tail risk of a signific recess like outcom for the economi  though it has not vanish  has certain diminish   second  financi market indic suggest that market function  though not back to normal  has certain improv somewhat in recent month  demand for fed liquid from the primari dealer has fallen   primari credit borrow general is down   now  although we may wish to keep our liquid facil for now as a backstop  the extra accommod that we have built into monetari polici may no longer be need or even appropri at this point   the real economi and financi function have improv sinc our last meet  but the inflat outlook has worsen  as we have been hear   headlin inflat is up  expect of various kind are elev   upsid risk to core inflat has increas  as the  book has said   as i said ye day  these upsid risk stem not onli from the potenti pass through of energi price but also  in my view  from the fact that we   re run a veri accommod polici despit rise inflat  in fact  i believ that polici has actual becom more accommod sinc the meet at the end of april   first  the nomin fund rate has been at a constant level  but expect of inflat have risen   so  in fact  the real fund rate has actual declin sinc our last meet as june                  of     inflat has risen   second  real rate of interest more broad have been gradual drift up sinc late march or earli april   the tip rate  the real interest rate  have been drift up by  depend on which term you look at  anywher from    basi point to    basi point   so as the real rate on risk free secur have risen  which may be appropri given the fact that prospect for the real economi have improv modest  the real fund rate has been declin   as a consequ  whatev you think about the level of the fed fund rate  we have becom more accommod sinc the last meet  as i   ve argu befor in this committe  op  monetari polici in a broad class of model suggest that you get taylor rule like rule but that the fund rate follow the real interest rate as it move around   op  polici call for follow the real rate   i argu that was the case and appropri as real rate fell in the context of a weaken economi   it was import that polici match those declin in the real rate  which i think it did   it   s a coher polici  but it also mean that as real rate begin to rise  as we have been see  polici need to adjust to those real rate rise   now  of cours  a lot of judgment is requir in this type of polici   there are smooth issu   real rate could be quit volatil   there   s debat about which real rate you want to be look at   i understand that   but i don   t think there   s ani question that the object should be to match those movement in the real rate  and we should be think about it in those term  long term inflat expect have been volatil but have move within a reason defin rang over the last period  and i   m comfort somewhat by that   but as i have said  i believ that inflat expect are fragil   at the veri least  the anchor is drag  and if we continu to maintain a real fund rate well below zero with rise inflat well abov our goal  i do not think we can continu to assum and trust that expect will remain well anchor  june                  of     we   ve done a good job with our word so far  but with the shift from downsid risk to growth to upsid risk to inflat  we need to take action to ensur that price stabil remain a credibl object of this committe   if the economi and financi market continu to evolv as they have over the last coupl of month  that  e may be soon   we must take back some of the insur we put on   not do so soon risk have to respond more aggress later on  which i believ will be much more difficult for the committe to do   in fact  smaller move sooner will help with our credibl in the marketplac and will help anchor those expect as we wait for more data and for the economi to strengthen  in this regard  i think we are fortun that market particip react to the incom data by appreci tighten their polici expect   thus  a move to rais rate is unlik to catch them off guard   moreov  i don   t think that we should disabus them of such polici expect  some might argu that an increas in polici expect is a negat develop   i would disagre   i think that it reflect rise expect of a somewhat stronger economi and concern about inflat   as the chairman said  we should resist ani eros  ani rise in longer term inflat expect   now  as i said  the  e of such a move is a judgment call  and i expect that my view will differ from those of some of my colleagu  particular sinc i had my fed fund rate path rise to    percent by the end of         so let me turn to languag  in the rational in paragraph    i have onli one suggest   i think that we should acknowledg that the function of financi market  while not back to normal  has improv   so instead of say    financi market remain under consider stress     which we have said for some  e  perhap it might be easi to say just that the financi market remain under stress  leav out    consider      that acknowledg the fact that there   s some improv but that stress is still there   final  in paragraph    i am pleas that the revis make more explicit that june                  of     the upsid risk to inflat and inflat expect have increas and that the downsid risk to growth remain but are diminish   i was go to suggest that we strike    near term     but   beat me to the punch there   so i approv of that chang   i think that   s veri good   in altern b  i would prefer that we add some of the languag from the chairman   s recent speech to paragraph     i think it would be a stronger messag that the committe will take action to ensur that inflat expect do not becom unhing  and it would also convey that both part of our dual mandat  price stabil and econom growth  are at risk should inflat expect becom unhing  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the action and languag of altern b      s strike of    near term    is fine with me   this is a tough situat  as we all remark ye day   commod price are at the center of the problem that we find ourselv in   in my view  we didn   t caus the rise in commod price   we may have contribut a littl around the edg  but whatev we contribut was a necessari byproduct of what we need to do to cope with what was happen to the u s  economi  and we can   t revers the rise in relat price without tremend cost to the u s  economi   or even the rise in headlin inflat  we couldn   t undo that without put a huge amount of slack in the economi to forc down wage  sticki price  et cetera  and that would not be appropri  i think the classic respons that we   ve all been talk about is to take a temporari increas in inflat and in unemploy that facilit the relat price chang that need to happen  concentr on second round effect  and make sure those increas are temporari   i think that   s inadvert what we   ve fallen into here   given the hous and financi shock  the   percent fed fund rate of altern b is consist for now with continu along the path of the temporari june                  of     increas in inflat and unemploy   unlik mani of you  i don   t see the current rate as extraordinarili accommod  given what els has happen in financi market   there is no insur in the staff forecast  right   the  book forecast has zero insur in it   my own forecast was a littl stronger than the  book   s   i think all of our were a littl stronger than the  book   s  but even if i mark up r  by    point or   point  that   s not a huge amount of insur in the circumst that we   re face   i note that no one sit around this tabl predict a declin in the unemploy rate over the balanc of the year  so everybodi has     percent or higher unemploy rate predict by the end of the year   the staff think that the current     percent is a littl too high   so they are expect the unemploy rate to come down in the next month or two   given this  we   re all expect the unemploy rate to rise over the balanc of the year   i would think  given the lag in polici  that if you thought polici was huge accommod  you   d see some declin in the unemploy rate over the next six  seven  or eight month   i think our own forecast suggest that some insur might be here  but not the amount that i   m hear some of you talk about   i don   t see the consist there  my own view is that there   s probabl a littl insur in it  and it   s appropri for now   i agre that the next move in interest rate is more like to be up than down   i assum  like presid    that it would be at the end of this year or at the begin of next year   the rise unemploy that we all expect should help damp inflat and inflat expect and make it veri hard to pass through all these cost increas that we   re hear from busi that they want to pass through and certain make it hard for wage and cost pressur to rise  so i agre with everyon els that the weight in the two tail has shift   there   s less weight in the downsid risk tail for output and more weight in the upsid risk tail for inflat   the statement   a veri nice job of say that explicit  and i think that we just need to await june                  of     incom data and inform about inflat expect  cost  and whatnot to see when the appropri  e to move will be   becaus i don   t think there   s a tremend amount of insur in there  i think we can afford to be a littl patient and data depend here   thank you  mr  chairman
presid pianalto   oh sorri  presid
governor kohn  a question  or a comment  about interest rate   a lot of our discuss has been center on how accommod we think polici is and how we interpret it in the current environ   if i want to quantifi the magnitud a bit  at least the way i think about it  even if i believ that the economi is weak enough so that the appropri equilibrium real rate of interest is zero  we have inflat run somewher north of   percent   that would suggest a nomin fund rate of about   percent as oppos to   percent   so rough speak  i would interpret that to say that we have rough     basi point of extra accommod built into our fed fund rate relat to what   and that   s assum an equilibrium real rate of zero  which might even be low   so if i   m think about it that way  could you clarifi how we should quantifi it in some way
it   s veri difficult   we don   t know what inflat expect are   we   re all use proxi  as came forth veri strong at the cape cod confer where we both were  presid     we don   t even understand veri well how expect are form  and i think what we   re look for is how peopl perceiv the cost of capit to financ purchas   so we   re wonder whether this low interest rate is caus them to bring purchas forward from the futur to the present to induc them to buy thing  capit good  right   that   s the interest rate we   re realli look at   the perceiv cost of credit to folk   and i   m not sure that subtract ani rate of inflat is the way to get that   obvious  the cost of credit for hous is perceiv as huge high june                  of     right now   the cost of credit for automobil is perceiv as huge high for reason that perhap aren   t relat to monetari polici   i don   t think we see a surg in purchas of capit equip that would suggest that busi perceiv the cost of credit to be veri negat   so i think  becaus we don   t understand inflat expect and can   t measur them  you have to look for a lot of differ thing around the edg to confirm what peopl perceiv the real rate to be   i just don   t see a lot of inform that suggest that peopl perceiv the real rate to be veri negat and that it is influenc how they manag their purchas of good and servic over  e
thank you   i guess just to say it more simpli  all the rate that have determin behavior   for exampl  mortgag rate  auto rate  or corpor bond rate   are higher than a year ago   now  unless there has been a major chang in long term inflat expect  which the tip data don   t suggest  there don   t seem to be indic  as far as interest rate that are relev to peopl   s spend decis  that there has been a signific reduct  someon els had a comment   governor
it   s direct on this point   it seem that in the situat we   re in  with veri elev spread in libor  there are almost no contract in the real market that are relat direct to fed fund   it   s usual through three month libor  and we know that the spread is now rough    or    basi point higher than it use to be   it use to be about    basi point  and now it   s around      for me that   s one rough proxi in how i think about this   that the way  in which our action are be translat into market price is somewhat differ from the way it was when the spread were lower
presid   will back presid   up though
this is like pro wrestl    laughter
just a brief observ   spread alway rise in recess   we alway lower real rate in recess   so to say that the fact that spread have risen by itself  sn   t make this an except circumst
the magnitud is somewhat greater  though
for some  not for other   corpor bond spread aren   t as high
presid pianalto  we apolog
thank you  mr  chairman   i support keep the fed fund rate target at it current level and the languag in altern b   i see some hope sign that stress in financi market has diminish as has the threat of a sharp recess   despit these recent sign  i expect that the growth momentum in the economi will build onli slowli   moreov  i continu to worri that the residenti real estat market could deterior even more than i had put in my baselin project   nevertheless  i am somewhat more comfort with the prospect for econom activ than i was in april  at the same  e  i can   t easili dismiss the recent behavior of energi and some other commod price   i found the bluebook   s supplement analysi on oil price  inflat expect  and monetari polici to be veri use in think about the dilemma that we face  the fact that oil price have risen so sharpli and have been so persist highlight the risk surround the downward project that i have for core inflat   without some evid of less inflationari pressur i don   t believ that the fed fund rate can be kept at it current level for veri long   but while i do believ that the next polici action will be a rate hike  the potenti for the recoveri to sputter make me cautious about embark on an upward trajectori for the fed fund june                  of     rate just yet   i believ that the languag in altern b convey the right sens of direct for the fed fund rate path  with the right amount of caution   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   u s  econom data have been stronger than expect dure the intermeet period   the earlier  veri aggress move in januari and march taken by the fomc were view in part as insur against the possibl of a veri serious downturn brought on by financi market turmoil   that veri serious downturn has not materi   tail risk has diminish signific   this mean that this committe has put too much econom s ulus on the tabl and must think about way to remov it go forward  failur to do so will creat a signific inflat problem on top of problem in hous and financi market   slack might be help  as mention by governor kohn  but those effect are small compar with expect effect   i think it is too earli to tighten at this meet  therefor  i am support altern b with the languag propos by presid     but the committe has to think care about how and when to embark on a path for interest rate that will set us up to achiev price stabil in a reason  e frame   my sens is that this will requir more aggress tighten of polici than current envis in staff simul  financi market problem have been describ here as a slow burn  and i think that may well be an apt descript   mani firm in this sector took on too much risk and  in retrospect  had poor busi model   i expect that this will take a long  e to unwind   despit this  the system risk compon of the situat has diminish consider   system risk is in part a function of the degre of surpris in the failur of a financi institut that was perceiv to be in good health   sure by now few market particip would be surpris to encount the failur of certain institut   failur  should they occur  can be handl in an order way  june                  of     certain investor would lose out in such an event  to be sure  but my sens is that the panic element that would be associ with system risk would not be present   i believ that we should start to downweight system risk concern substanti go forward becaus it is no longer credibl to say that market particip are surpris to learn of problem at certain financi institut   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   well  first of all  i believ that polici is well posit for now from a coupl of perspect   for the next quarter or two  i think there is still some potenti for signific disappoint in term of econom growth   but onli for a quarter or two   beyond that  a pickup in real activ appear pretti like   that is  base on what i know now  further reduct in the feder fund rate shouldn   t be requir for the economi to improv next year and beyond  and we do have the liquid facil avail should strain in financi market threaten to intensifi   polici is also well posit for now from a second perspect   name  that the fed fund futur curv have price in an increas in the fund rate begin in the late summer or the fall   i think that this is appropri becaus i think we are go to find that we will want to and have to start move to contain inflat expect   precis when to move may turn out to be a difficult call  but i would like to see futur price to anticip such action on our part   as inde they are at the moment  that bring me to the recommend and the languag   i think the strategi express in the bluebook associ with altern b is fine for now  and so i favor altern b   the languag in altern b is okay as well  although i would endors presid     s recommend to drop    consider    from the descript of financi strain   the other thing i would point out is that the bluebook say that  at least in the staff   s judgment  the languag june                  of     associ with b might push back expect for the onset of polici tighten   i am read from page      it is not that i am anxious to tighten necessarili as earli as possibl  but i would rather not push those expect back at this point   so if that assess is correct  it might be advis to find a way to address that issu   i don   t feel all that strong about it  but i think we could  if we want  take the sentenc in paragraph   that   s in red  drop three word   the first word    although     a word at the end of the phrase    remain     and then    they      so you would just say     downsid risk to growth appear to have diminish somewhat     which i think is true   it  sn   t suggest that we are sanguin about growth  although i suppos it could be read that way  but i am a littl concern about the way we might chang expect base on the bluebook commentari
you have your strunk and white style manual with you  i can see    laughter   thank you  presid  n   presid
i support altern b   at this  e  there are signific downsid risk to the economi and financi market  as the collater damag from the hous problem work through the economi and financi institut   at the same  e  continu increas in oil and food price rais the risk that some part of these suppli shock will be incorpor into inflat expect   in the absenc of more compel evid about which of these two risk will domin  i would favor remain on hold at this meet   i hope that the economi pick up in the second half of this year and that the financi market stabil so polici can becom less accommod  but it is not clear that this will be the outcom   while the inflat outlook has been affect by continu energi shock  the futur path of oil price remain uncertain  and recent histori has mani instanc in which oil shock are short live and have littl effect on longer run inflat expect   until we have more clariti on the path of the june                  of     economi and inflat  polici should remain on hold  and our languag should be consist with that
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i also prefer the fed fund rate recommend and languag of altern b   it captur the delicaci   i think that word was use ye day   of the current tradeoff and lean fair heavili rhetor against inflat and inflat expect   i note that inflat and inflat expect are mention in both paragraph   and   use the languag     uncertainti       remain high    and    risk       have increas      i think this constitut consider stress on the serious of our commit to address inflat and expect  and it is a complet statement and will serv to condit the market   as   said  it suggest that firm later in the year could occur  and i believ that is appropri   i would like to give the medicin that we have appli to resolv the situat and the financi market a littl more  e to work   i am in accord with governor kohn   s think of s ulus or accommod in term of the cost of borrow to real borrow   individu and busi   and  therefor  we realli have not seen a proportion improv in the cost of capit  notwithstand such a strong reduct in the fed fund rate  so as of now  i would expect to support a revers a littl later in the year   i also think there is enough ambigu current that give the situat a littl more  e to clarifi would be help   core inflat has not risen dramat  wherea headlin has  and it is headlin that the public is react to   measur of expect  such as they are  seem to suggest that short term expect have risen more than long term  so there realli hasn   t been a clear breakout of long term   it may be true that it would be too late if we saw that breakout  but i think we can afford to wait for a greater preponder of evid to accumul over the next few week june                  of     befor consid a revers   so i support  as i said  altern b and the languag of altern b
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i listen veri care to what was said around the tabl ye day  and i especi listen veri care to you   you made a veri good and interest point about the differ from the     s   i would add that there are signific differ from the     s   we didn   t have the internet in the     s   we were not global in the     s  if you were sell oil into the market  you sold to three buyer   the ten countri known as we n europ  the unit state  and japan   wherea now you have sever billion peopl more to sell to   anoth differ is that the transmiss mechan were not as fluid  which get me to a question  realli  with which i am wrestl constant   befor  a cyclic slowdown would lead to a lessen in price pressur   i am not so sure that   s correct if we are talk about a cyclic slowdown in the unit state   we alreadi have wage go up signific in the largest factori in the world  which is china  where we sourc a great deal   so there is wage   price inflat  but there are enorm demand pull forc that are quit differ from what we had befor  i am a littl concern   and i say this with not onli respect but humil at have less train   governor kohn  when you say that we might toler a    temporari increas in inflat      if you open the new york  e this morn  you would have seen that dow chemic rais price    percent after just rais them    percent   in one month   by the way  i notic that these littl bottl of water have gotten smaller   this will be a visin bottl at the next meet    laughter   what goe into this   the plastic   here   s the point   mani micro make a macro   micro busi oper are not go to toler temporari increas in june                  of     inflat   they are go to act on them   i worri about that enorm  particular given the fact that they are global and they sell to a global market   we can be vic  by that  now  i may have over analog ye day   you teas me after the meet   although i like     s analog of the python   one of my tutor at st      s had a python name julius squeezer  by the way    laughter   just to kill that refer  i feel a bit squeez here at the tabl  you mention ye day  mr  chairman  three thing that caught my ear   obvious  we need to strive to avoid bad outcom   second  we need to decid when we   re at the tip point   we need to pick our moment  as you said   third  you also said that we need to lean and not lurch   i listen veri care just now to presid    who was most eloqu in his present   i happen to agre with him in term of where i think we should be  ye day i said i thought there were three way to deal with our current predica now that the tail risk have shift   one is to hope it will cure itself   i don   t believ that is go to happen becaus of the way micro oper oper   the second is to treat it rhetor  and i think that the languag in altern b is quit good  if that is the way you wish to go   but i don   t think it is go to get ani easier  as was mention earlier at this tabl   i am not sure that thing will get easier by august   we then get into an elect season  which i think still condit somewhat our think   i think it is import to take a shot across the bow   i think we have to put some substanc behind our word   as i said befor  and i know you know  i like to be like   i don   t like to be alon   but i am go to vote for altern c   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me say just a few thing   first  to state the obvious   there are risk on all side of these decis   second  i will tri to wade into the debat briefli on this accommod point   my own view is that polici is accommod   the degre of that is whi we are have this debat   i think about our degre of accommod as a function both of our target fed fund rate and what the financi market do with it  by which i don   t mean just what the expect fed fund target are out in the futur but the transmiss mechan   the degre of accommod  as we think about our decis now and in the next sever month  will depend more on financi market develop than  frank  the decis that we end up make on the target  and it is veri hard for us to judg the direct of these market   as much as we have talk about tail risk on the financi market side and the real economi side be diminish  i think all of us would say that there is a real chanc that this will be a long  hot summer   it is hard to know what the credit channel are go to do with our target feder fund rate   it is not obvious to me that we should tri to perfect offset the chang in financi market develop by contempl chang in the feder fund rate now  what i think most like is that we won   t be as certain as we would like to be regard growth risk and we won   t be as certain as we would like to be regard financi market develop befor we have to begin a postur of remov polici accommod   so with all those caveat and a view that polici remain more accommod than we can allow it to be for too long  i will support altern b and think that we have to remain veri open mind  veri nimbl  in our task of remov polici accommod  in term of presid     s suggest on    consider     i think the reason for the debat over use that word is in my own view that these market are still under consider stress  but the trend from the last statement to this statement is that they are under less june                  of     consider stress   therein lie the difficulti in word this in the statement   if we do remov    consider     it wouldn   t surpris me that when we next meet we will say     boy  it seem as though stress is up   wonder if we should put it back in      i don   t feel strong  other than i don   t like the idea of remov it now if we think that there   s a chanc that the trend  which are veri tenuous  turn around   so i think i would favor the languag that you have written   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   obvious  as we have all discuss  we are face enorm challeng from the continu strength in price and price chang in energi and raw materi   now  some of those are relat price chang that we don   t have the tool to address direct   recent  we have seen wheat come down as australia has been abl to replant  and it seem that thing are go to come back   corn has gone up  as we heard from a number of peopl around the tabl  becaus of the challeng there   we don   t have the tool to address that direct  but obvious  when so mani of these commod price and energi price are go up  that lead to concern about where both headlin inflat and core inflat are go  so we definit do have to be veri mind of that  i think the type of approach that we are take in altern b is a reason one   given the challeng that we are face right now with the fragil in the financi market   the continu smolder of those ember  with still chanc that they could reignit and caus us a great deal of difficulti   it seem sensibl to me to be rough where we are now in term of polici but to be signal that we understand that challeng are come from various sourc that could lead to inflat pressur and that we need to be readi to offset those  june                  of     in term of how accommod monetari polici is  i think actual it would be worthwhil   and mayb at the end of this i might pose a question to     to look at libor   oi spread and how much they typic go up dure recessionari period   i know that other risk spread typic go up  but my understand is that those typic don   t go up as much  sinc so mani contract are base off the one month and three month libor  that    basi point suggest that at least now we might want to take that into account in think about where monetari polici stand relat to other  e when we would have had a fund rate at rough this level  in term of the languag  i share governor     s view on the use or lack of use of the word    consider      i think presid  n   s suggest   this is alway a veri danger and difficult game   would actual push the market further than they are becaus i agre that broad the path that they are see in the futur is a reason one for them to see   this languag would rough keep it there   take out the acknowledg of downsid risk to growth remain would make me concern becaus     i certain see those as still be there and     i think that would push the market further to think that this is a signal that next  e we are go to do it  and i don   t think we are quit there yet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i do support altern b and the current languag in the statement   i have no problem with that   i think it convey what we need to convey   although i think that the next move is veri like to be up and it mayb should be done quit soon  i would argu that we still need to have a lot of flexibl and to think in term of have a lot of flexibl in where we may have to head in the futur   i want to argu along those line and outlin whi i think that is the case  june                  of     the first issu is someth that the chairman mention ye day  about which i felt veri strong   in fact  i meant to say it  but as alway the chairman say thing better than i could in this context   that there realli is still a veri serious possibl that the shoe could drop in the financi market   the chairman mention a set of institut that we have to be concern about  and although there has been some improv in term of the stress that the financi market are under  i don   t think we are out of the wood yet   we are like to be  but we have to be readi to recogn that thing could go south   so that   s one issu   the second issu is that the recent posit data we have seen are  again  veri tenuous to me   i   m hope that they indic that thing are go in the right direct   but a bunch of thing make me veri nervous  which i mention ye day   how consum react in hous crise  consum sen ent  and the big problem that is go to occur when peopl have to face veri high price of food and energi  which hit their pocketbook veri direct   so  again  that could be quit contractionari   the good news that we have seen recent might revers veri quick   the third issu is that i think the headwind could be veri substanti in the futur  that this cleanup will take a long  e  and in that case we could have veri slow and subpar growth that could widen output gap more than the  book and most particip here are expect  so i do not consid the current stanc of monetari polici to be over s ul   for me it is just about right and veri much along the line of what i think would be op  polici  of cours  my view relat not onli to the real economi   i also think that inflat expect  as far as i can tell so far  are reason well contain   there is veri littl movement in the measur of inflat expect that i pay most attent to   that argu that our stanc is about right   i would also veri strong argu that i do not think that we have taken out a lot of insur   i have argu that befor   we have move less gradual  which i think is veri june                  of     benefici  and i would commend the committe in that regard   but we move in line with what the forecast have been tell us op  polici would be  and i think that is quit import  howev  here is whi i think we need to have flexibl in the other direct   if you think about a risk manag approach  it should not be focus just on tail risk to econom growth  which has been our most major concern becaus of the financi disrupt   it equal impli that  symmetr  we should be just as worri about tail risk to inflat  particular to long run inflat expect  which i think are the key driver of under inflat  which is what monetari polici can particular deal with   here we have a situat in which we have hit the perfect storm of shock becaus of the huge suppli shock and there are much more serious upsid risk and tail risk in term of long run inflat expect   so i realli do worri that with long run inflat expect and  therefor  under inflat we are in a more fragil situat and that we have to be veri cogniz of that in term of what we do in the futur  the bottom line is that we may have to move veri quick to rais rate if ani of sever thing happen   one is that headwind are not as serious as i think they are like to be   there is certain a veri serious possibl that thing could be better than i expect   i would not be unhappi  so i would not get depress  about that   realli more depress would be if inflat expect start to look as though they were get more unanchor   particular  i would worri much more about what happen in term of inflat compens and the survey of profession forecast  pay some attent to consum survey but put a lot less weight on them   if the canari start to look as though it is keel over  we have to move veri quick  and so i am go to watch that canari veri  veri care
befor the python get it   laughter
befor the python get it   i think anoth consider is veri import   i have to commend you on the bluebook this  e   it just had some great box   laughter   it would be nicer if they had a littl color to them   as a textbook author  i think they could have been a littl ritzier and have had a littl color  but they were great box   in particular  a veri import box was the one on the op  reaction to oil price shock   one thing that come out veri strong from that box is that if your credibl is weak on commit to price stabil and contain inflat expect  you would have to tighten more to restor that credibl and get to a polici that would produc better outcom   so here is an issu that  with these suppli shock potenti caus a problem for long run inflat expect  we actual may have to react more quick and more aggress than we otherwis would   this is an issu that i have been concern about in term of communic strategi   about how we better anchor long run inflat expect  so my bottom line is that i support altern b   i would like to keep the languag the way it is current  which i think work quit well   but i do think that  go forward  we should not lock ourselv into what our polici is go to be  in either direct   we need to preserv flexibl becaus we could be veri surpris  although i think that the signal we have made that we are more concern about inflat risk is absolut appropri   we have to make clear that we will do whatev it take  includ rais interest rate when unemploy is rise  if we feel that long run inflat expect and inflat are not remain under control
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to say at the begin that i think the way you frame your remark ye day had perfect pitch and balanc  and it is realli import that we not get ahead of ourselv in take too much comfort from the june                  of     fact that the first half was not as bad as we thought and think that the risk on the growth front are definit behind us   the improv in financi market that mani of you spoke of is not as signific as we think or hope  we have had a lot of fals dawn over this period   a lot of what you see as improv is the simpl result of the exist of our facil in the impli sens that peopl infer from our action that we are go to protect peopl from a level of distress that we probabl have no desir  will  or abil to actual do   it is sort of like wake up in the hospit and have them say     you are not dead yet  but we are not sure you   re go to live      it is not as good an improv  and there has been a materi eros over the past four week   it is veri unlik that you will have a substanti improv in overal confid in market  a durabl improv in market function  and a substanti reduct in those spread until there is more clariti about the like path of the economi go forward  hous price in particular  and therefor the cash flow associ with the huge amount of credit that was extend over the past five year  again  it is go to be veri hard for us to have a better feel for the balanc of risk on growth front and the financi sector until we think we see sign ahead of some signific deceler in the rate of declin of hous price  if not some actual bottom   on the basi of everyth we know  that is still sever quarter ahead   mayb it is go to surpris us on the upsid and mayb we are go to see a big improv in hous demand  but i think that the sens of a bottom look to be sever quarter ahead of us still  i would say that the risk are still acut   sure  the market are a littl more confid that we are go to success avoid a system financi crisi  but i wouldn   t take too much comfort from that   i think it is also plausibl that oil will be at      or      over the next six month or so   there is some materi probabl that the set of challeng on that front is go june                  of     to get wors   so all that is just in favor of a fair amount of care and caution now  given the scale of the uncertainti out there and how fat the tail risk are on both side of our mandat go forward  i like  and fulli support  the languag in altern b   i would not   as you might sens from my comment   take out the word    consider    from the character of stress   i am pretti comfort with the framework laid out here  and  more import  mr  chairman  with the broad balanc and strategi that you outlin ye day
thank you veri much   in april  we signal that  follow our aggress rate action and our other effort to support financi market  it was go to be a  e to paus and to assess the effect of our action   that was not that long ago  and i think it is appropri to continu our watch wait for just a bit longer  i talk ye day about the balanc of tail risk as oppos to the balanc of risk   i think that  although the tail risk on the growth and financi side have moder somewhat  they are still quit substanti   i agre with the vice chairman on that point   they aris from two separ but relat sourc   the first is that  notwithstand the stronger than expect perform in the second quarter  i think there is an excel chanc that we will still see a recessionari dynam with the associ strong movement in employ and product  second   again as the vice chairman mention   i do not agre that system risk has gone away   i think it is in abey   there is perhap  if anyth  excess confid in the abil of the fed to prevent a crisi situat from metastas   even if we don   t have a failur of a major firm  we still have the possibl of a signific advers feedback loop as credit condit worsen and bank come under addit pressur   so if i could tri to think about this   i don   t want to say    mathemat      a lot of our discuss has implicit suggest that june                  of     there has been a linear model  which is that we are just tri to balanc on the scale this risk against that risk   again  if you are worri about prevent bad outcom  you have to worri more about nonlinear or discontinu chang   i think that  at this point  we still have signific risk of a nonlinear  discontinu chang in the financi market or in the real economi  tail risk have risen for inflat   there is no question about it   i take what has been said around the tabl extrem serious  and i am quit anxious about it  i have to conced   if i were make a comparison of tail risk to tail risk  i still think that the inflat tail risk have not yet reach the level of the concern i have about the financi crisi   in particular  some import indic   such as wage  inflat expect  and core inflat   have not yet signal a major shift   that be said  i do think we need to acknowledg the relat chang in those risk  and we need to begin to prepar the market for the normal that is go to have to come  both presid   and presid  n talk about the rhetor aspect of our polici and the effect on polici expect  and i think we are all in agreement that word mean noth unless they are eventu back up by action   on the other hand  action may be better if they are preced by word  if you will   we do need to begin to prepar the market and to communic clear so that peopl will know what   s come and that the system will be better abl to deal with that  if i thought for sure that we were go to begin renorm veri soon  i would propos do it today   whi wait   but i think enough uncertainti and enough risk are on both side that there is some benefit from wait just a bit longer to see  first  how the financi market evolv and  second  whether we continu this stronger than expect growth pattern or june                  of     whether we begin to see a more recessionari type of pattern   in particular  between now and the next meet  we have two employ report  a lot of other relev inform  and a lot of insight from the financi market   at the same  e  on the inflat side  we will see how commod price evolv  whether we have ani kind of relief from what we saw in the last intermeet period  how the dollar behav  and how inflat expect behav   all those thing will give us a better sens of where we are and how we should proceed  so i think we should tri to be nimbl   we should tri to respond to the inform as it come in   we should be focus particular on tail risk   i think we should begin to move  or should maintain  market expect toward tighten   presid    i think i have to note for the record that i don   t think we should let polit consider affect our decis in ani way  and i am not concern about that   i think we are all prepar to do what is necessari   i don   t know what we are go to do in the next meet or the meet after that   but my expect now is that  as other have mention  we will begin normal interest rate relat soon  and we should  if possibl  begin to prepar the market for that  for today  as i have indic  i recommend no chang in the feder fund rate target and altern b for the statement   i think altern b captur the fact pretti well on the whole  i won   t go into it  but i think the inflat paragraph is a littl more hawkish   it drop the discuss of a level out of commod price   it  sn   t refer to core inflat  which we have taken befor as sort of a reassur element   i   m disappoint that presid   is go to vote against his own languag in altern b  paragraph    which we have adopt and which i think is a veri good express of the risk
i appreci the adopt of the languag   i think it is much better
i think presid  n   s suggest is interest   i am a littl worri that it might go just a bit too far in suggest that we have discount the downsid risk   i am struggl with the    consider    in altern b  paragraph     i have sort of heard two for and two against   i don   t know if other have a view   it is a bit riski to chang  given how quick thing can move   but if other would like to express a view  i think yet a third thing that we could do would be to say     financi market  though somewhat improv recent  remain under consider stress      that might be a way to address it     anyon have ani thought on that word   ani concern   presid
i thought vice chairman     s character of market was pretti good  but it is compat with your suggest
if we look back and tri to recalibr at each meet whether thing are get better or thing are get wors  we would regret each zig and each zag   so i would just say that we have a suit of facil in place   they are in place today  they are except signific in term of a chang in polici   they are there becaus we think they are play an import role in help facilit the necessari process of repair market et cetera   if we were go to take them back tomorrow or dial them back substanti  then i would be will to ration and explain that part of the judgment is that we think thing are improv materi   i just feel as though the risk is too high
i think the vice chairman rais an interact that i hadn   t thought of  which is that our facil are exist under the premis of unusu and exig circumst  and we don   t realli want to undercut that   presid

thank you  mr  chairman   we   re now in the handout   whi don   t we start on page    and i   ll give you an overview of where we are head this morn  at least from my section   first i   ll talk a bit about the object and the approach of our monitor program   then i   ll talk about how we   re focus primarili  but not exclus  on four invest bank and where our focus is there  i   ll say a few word about the extent of usag of our section    facil   again  the pdcf is primarili our focus  but for the sake of complet  i   ll also discuss and provid some highlight on tslf usag by the primari dealer   then i   ll close by just highlight near term issu that we   re address or deal with      the materi use by messr  angulo  alvarez  and parkinson are append to this transcript  appendix     june                  of     on page    in term of the object of our monitor program  we   re veri cogniz that our effort are tie close to our section       author in the establish of the primari dealer credit facil   our effort   not stem from our general supervisori examin author   we   re veri clear on that   we have two key object   the first is the abil to exercis inform judgment about the capit and liquid posit of the primari dealer that have access to the pdcf  second and just as import  we   re aim to  in shorthand  mitig the moral hazard that accompani the creation of the pdcf in particular   so we will make sure that the pdcf   not undermin the incent for the primari dealer and the firm that own them to manag capit and liquid more conserv   on page    in term of our approach  our focus is on the firm that own primari dealer that are not affili with financi hold compani   that   s primarili  but not exclus  the four largest invest bank   i   ll touch at the end of my present on sever other primari dealer with which we   ve had interact of late   our effort   includ an on site presenc  but that is limit to examin at each of the four largest invest bank   we also have a small off site staff  which includ staff member from our research group  our market group  our legal group  and bank supervis   we are in direct contact with the manag of these firm   we are obtain inform direct from the firm as well as from the sec  and of cours  we are communic and coordin close with the sec   it   s import to point out  howev  that we   re not engag in tradit bank supervis   our scope is fair narrow   we   re not conduct examin  and we   re not provid or issu examin report back to the firm   therefor  we are make assess  i would say  without the normal rang or normal complement of supervisori protect that we   re accustom to   to be frank  that carri with it some risk and some vulner for us   i   ll touch on that at the end of my present as well   our current focus is limit or narrowli focus on capit  as well as liquid  which i   ll get into in a moment   so let   s turn to page     page   give us a view of the leverag of the four invest bank   i should note that it may be a bit confus at first glanc   leverag is typic express as a multipl   we   ve convert that into ratio becaus bank supervisor tend to look at ratio   so bear that in mind   invest bank leverag   tend to be cyclic   this graph pick up realli the latter half of the last cycl  so i can oral give you some perspect   if this graph had move back to the left  in approxim      to      you would have seen the invest bank deleverag in respons to the russian default and the ltcm crisi in the third quarter of        so we would see leverag come down between then and        in          leverag was essenti flat  and then this graph pick up the increas leverag from      to the end of        as you can see       mark the cyclic low point in the ratio  or high point in leverag as a multipl   sinc then  the firm have been deleverag   right now they are clu  around   percent  with the trajectori  i hope  still up  and we may have someth to say about that
art  could you defin    leverag    in this pictur
this is gross leverag  so it is just equiti   in this case  a ratio of equiti over total asset   a veri blunt measur   page   give us a more current view   in the left hand panel is the tier   capit ratio for the four largest secur firm   as i think you know  the sec has made a decis to use and hold invest bank to a basel ii ratio that   s consist with how the bank supervisor appli it   to date  the firm have not disclos those ratio  that begin this quarter  the second quarter   for goldman  lehman  and morgan stanley  that quarter end may           so we show the es  ratio there  these were not in their earn releas  although they were pick up by some of the analyst in their confer call   so these number are seep out there  merril report on a bank cycl  june     so they have not yet releas their tier   capit ratio   a coupl of takeaway from the left side of this page   first  the quarter has not end  but merril was obvious low compar with it peer   they do have the benefit of see and be awar of where their peer have come out  so we shall see if merril take some action in the near term to bol  capit   the second point is that the invest bank ratio look fair high compar with where the commerci bank tier   capit ratio would be   there are a coupl of reason for that   first  the asset of the invest bank are concentr in the trade book  so there are two issu there   those asset tend to have a lower credit charg   the other issu  which we have to do more work on  is that we need to understand better the model methodolog and the model approv that the sec has given these firm to comput tier   capit   that could be a signific factor as well   so at first blush they look veri healthi  veri high  but i think it will take more analysi to get beneath those   the right hand side of page   give anoth way of look at capit   what we call an    frbni adjust leverag ratio      what we   re tri to do here is to have anoth way of put invest bank and commerci bank on a somewhat similar foot   so in term of the numer  we use tangibl equiti for two reason  first  it   s a higher form of equiti capit  perhap the highest form   second and just as import  it avoid current differ between how invest bank and commerci bank calcul tier   capit   right now there   s a grandfath period in which the secur firm are allow to carri a higher portion of subordin debt in tier   capit   it   not appli to bank hold compani   this put them on more of an equival basi in term of the numer   the deal is the same with the denomin   again  we   re tri to make allow for the differ in busi model   so here we subtract from the denomin secur financ asset   these are revers repo and secur borrow   of cours  these are collater by cash and thus are relat low risk asset   so by make those two adjust  we have a somewhat compar view   the takeaway here is that they don   t look too far apart   they are not dissimilar   at least at this point in the cycl   june                  of     whi don   t we move now to page    to liquid   i have a pictur of liquid  but not a full pictur   this show the trend in parent compani liquid pool   this is unencumb cash or high qualiti secur at the parent compani of the four invest bank   as you can see  the trend has been increas sinc the middl of march   the general trend has been to increas   this  of cours  tell us onli half the stori becaus one want to know what that pool is held against   so  let   s turn to page    and i can talk a bit about how we   re tri to look at and assess this   we   ve been engag with the sec and have enter into an approach in tri to assess liquid at the four invest bank   when we first start this endeavor back in late march  the first thing we did was to go back to the firm and to say     show us what would happen to liquid if you experienc a bear stearn  full run kind of scenario   for that exercis we want to know what asset you have elig for the pdcf   we want to know how bad and how dark it would get      that exercis was pretti demand   no one would have pass the test   we look at that and ask whether a full run on the institut was an appropri way to look at it or an appropri standard to hold them to   so we came up with anoth scenario that we put back to the firm   we basic said     listen  we want you to do a stress analysi for us   look at someth that   s pretti sever but short of a full bear stearn scenario   look out over thirti day   by the way  you have no access to the pdcf  let   s see how that look      we   re in the process of do that right now   the tabl on the left give you an idea of some of the thing that we   re look at and how we   ve ask the firm to provid the inform to us   basic there are sever bucket      their unsecur and secur fund      what come on the balanc sheet under stress  either general market stress or firm specif stress  and     the impact from oper cash flow toward the bottom   those are the combin of liquid claim that they would face under stress   the last piec is the addit fund from affili or unaffili bank line along with  obvious  the liquid pool  which we have separ   basic  we   re engag in an exercis in which we compar and converg assumpt   we   ve had multipl discuss with each of the four firm  tri to understand where their assumpt differ and tri to converg those   we then construct  or are in the process of construct  a cash flow analysi   again  we are relat their cash need under stress  given these assumpt  to their avail liquid pool plus the unaffili or affili bank line that can be drawn   the driver here  obvious  are go to be the mix and term of secur fund  which is go to be a big driver in term of the liquid need  as well as some of the oper cash flow assumpt that firm make in look at a stress scenario   we are fair close to pull togeth inform with which we can construct an analysi  go back to the firm  share with them our assess of where they are  and give them a chanc to explain to us how we were spot on or where we may have miss certain thing   but those convers will happen in the near futur   so that   s basic what we   re do in term of liquid   it has been an interest exercis   i think that there is no simpl way to look at liquid but that this is the best way to do so  june                  of     let   s turn to page     i have just a few word about the use of both the pdcf and the tslf   i have graph later on the tslf   a graph of the pdcf usag would be kind of bore   it would show bear stearn as far and away the domin borrow  actual i think bill   convey to you ye day that monday was their last night of borrow under the pdcf   so bear stearn is now out   until veri recent there were three other that i   ll call chronic user of the pdcf   first  we had cantor  i   ll say a few word about that   they start borrow in late march  initi      million to      million   they stabil in mid april at about      million  we saw that borrow come in everi night   member of the team here spent one afternoon at cantor at the end of april   we ask them for some inform in advanc   we spent a good chunk of  e with them   we came away not be comfort with the number or the size of their borrow in relat to the firm   s capit   we then consult with our colleagu in both the legal and market group   we ask cantor to submit a plan to wean itself from the pdcf and to submit that to us in write   we then follow up with a friend letter from mr    and mr  baxter ask for a littl more inform and a littl more specif   they got the point   they start to bring that down in accord with the schedul they gave to us   in fact  they end up wind down to zero in their borrow last week  ahead of schedul  and they obtain third parti financ   so that was the cantor stori   countrywid was a somewhat similar situat   they had been borrow from day   of the pdcf   initi they would ask us for    billion   they had borrow and stabil at about      million   our market group initi a convers with countrywid secur at the end of may   in short  we were uncomfort with  in essenc  provid bridg financ to the close of the acquisit by bank of america   we felt some vulner there   so our initi salvo or propos back to countrywid secur was that they need to wind down the use of section       facil by the end of june   both the pdcf and the tslf   they came back to us and in essenc said     well  couldn   t you just let us go into juli a bit becaus our merger is suppos to be approv today actual by the bank of america board  our legal day    our close is juli     we can transfer posit juli     what   s a coupl of day among friend      we had a littl negoti back and forth   we reach  i think  an agreement that was amen to all   they agre to wind down their use of the tslf   no new borrow   they could swing some of that into the pdcf   we would allow them to go until the close  juli    when they could transfer those posit   in return we got a littl extra margin   so  in effect  those borrow were be collater at a margin of rough   percent   we got an addit    percent  bring us to    percent  which will bring us through until juli     so i think all side are reason comfort there  and with friend persuas    and baxter seal the deal there   let me say a few word about barclay capit   we handl this a bit more inform   they start use the pdcf more in late march  at around    billion  they got to a peak of about    billion   both bank supervis and market had june                  of     convers with barclay  ask them to tell us a littl more about whi they were use this   what   s the rational   they had a consist stori   they would tell us that it was econom advantag for them to use that   they thought it was good   in one convers with our colleagu in the market group  one of the trader convey that barclay thought they need to support the tslf in much the same way that they support open market oper   our colleagu in market veri quick disabus them of that notion   after a coupl of convers  they got the messag   they eventu ceas borrow from the pdcf around the begin of june   so as of now  the onli outstand we have is with countrywid secur  and that should come to a close next week  knock on wood   again just for the sake of complet  on page    i   ll talk about the tslf usag   first  schedul    which is omo elig collater   as you can see among the primari dealer  merril has had the highest amount outstand   merril is  i guess  the tan line   the biggest user have been the commerci bank   deutsch bank is up top  a pretti consist user   then citigroup  the   line   which has also been a fair consist and heavi user   let   s turn to schedul    page      which is the less liquid collater   here among the primari dealer  lehman  the blue line  has been the most consist user  follow by merril lynch   as you can see  ub among the bank was clear far and away the biggest user  although within the past two week they have reduc their tslf borrow   so that   s  veri briefli  the top five   there   s again a bit of a mix here   but as you can see  the invest bank are not the biggest user of the tslf   let   s turn to page     and i   ll finish up here   i   ll just highlight a veri near term challeng that we face  and i think it will provid a nice transit to scott   s and pat   s portion of the brief   i don   t want to get too much into their section   but i think general we have an issu   i think that  the longer we stay on site with this effort  the reput risk to the feder reserv increas   as governor kohn testifi last week  we   re not examin  we are just veri narrowli focus   i think that messag was well receiv   at this  e  it   s not too problemat   but if someon is up on the hill six month or a year from now  i think it   s go to be veri difficult to say that we   re just do this liquid and capit thing   peopl are go to want to know a littl more about our judgment and how we made those judgment   as i said earli on  i think there   s some risk to make those judgment without have a littl more inform   so i think the t  for us is  if we have our tradit bank supervis model on the left and what we   re do right now on the right  we have to move this way  more to the left   by no mean should we be way over here   but i think we have to figur out how to get this way a littl more   with that  i will end my remark and pass to scott and then to pat
well  as you can tell from art   s present  there   s been a signific amount of inform share and collabor alreadi between the feder reserv and the sec   so we   ve taken this opportun simultan with what   s go on with the primari dealer to fashion a document that will lay out a framework for how this inform share and collabor will go forward  june                  of     we   ve made some pretti good progress on a document  but we   re still negoti   in fact  the chairman is negoti this afternoon with chairman cox   this is one in which the princip have been in  involv   the agreement as it is current structur realli has two part   the first part outlin plan for share inform between the two agenc   here i would divid the world into two piec   there are the consolid supervis entiti  cses   which are the four larg invest bank   goldman sach  morgan stanley  lehman brother  and merril lynch   we have agre to share inform and analysi of the financi condit  risk manag  intern control  capit  liquid  and fund resourc of those firm   the agreement is focus primarili on those area   so the financi condit  liquid  and risk manag of the firm   as you know  we have access inform from these compani in connect with our provid liquid through the pdcf and the tslf  so we   ll share that with the sec   similar  the sec  which is the primari regul for those and has access to much more inform  will share their inform with us  we   ve also agre to share inform and analysi on various financi market that these compani are in  involv in   in particular  the tri parti repo market and the interbank lend market   now  two bank hold compani particip in the sec   s cse program   citigroup and jpmorgan chase   we have agre to share with the sec the same type of financi and risk manag inform regard those two firm but onli to the extent that that inform affect the broker dealer that are control by those two firm   so we are not expect  nor is the sec expect us  to share inform that relat to the condit of the bank or the condit of the other nonbank portion of either of those two firm   just the part relat to their broker dealer   we have an interest here in the feder reserv in the financi condit of broker dealer that are not in the cse program   that would be ani broker dealer that   s in a bank hold compani regul by the feder reserv   our plan is to includ an inform share arrang regard those institut as well   more broad  the sec would provid us with inform on an ongo basi about the financi condit and risk manag  intern control  capit  liquid  and fund resourc of all broker dealer that are control by a bank hold compani   this would allow us access beyond what we   re current get  right now we   re get primarili focus report on the broker dealer  which are not alway the most inform document   so we   ll get more access   we also are expect to agre to provid similar kind of financi and risk manag inform to the sec  again to the extent that the inform affect the broker dealer   so we would not be routin provid inform about bank hold compani relat to the bank or relat to the nonbank oper that are not broker dealer   we also are expect to includ a provis that outlin sever exist agreement that we have for share inform regard some of the clear compani   dtc in particular   transfer agent  municip secur june                  of     dealer  and invest advis   this would simpli incorpor  without chang  the arrang we alreadi have   an essenti part of all this share of inform is that both agenc would agre to keep the inform confidenti   in addit  the sec is agre not to use our exam or supervisori inform  in particular ani opinion that we might have  in their enforc action or investig without the permiss of the feder reserv   the second part of the agreement  as we   re work through it  relat to supervisori expect for the four larg invest bank and for the primari dealer that have access to the pdcf and the tslf   there the current propos is that the two agenc would agre to collabor and coordin with each other in obtain access to the inform on the financi condit of these organ and in set supervisori expect concern the capit  liquid  risk manag  and fund for the cses and the primari dealer   we   d also collabor and coordin our communic to those entiti about supervisori expect  someth that   s alreadi begun with art and his group   the memorandum of understand  mou  is intend to serv as a bridg from the exist world to whatev brave new world the congress may put togeth   but it is not tie specif to the pdcf or the tslf and is intend to last beyond access to those facil   it also   not chang the legal author that either of the two agenc has   we continu to have full  unfett legal author over bank hold compani   they continu to have full  unfett author over the broker dealer   but we do agre to talk more  collabor more  and coordin more   as i mention  the mou is substanti work out   we are still  though  in negoti over a coupl of key point   our goal is to have it done this week  we hope with an announc at the end of the week or some  next week   we expect that the term of the mou will be made public   as soon as we have someth that   s concret enough  we   ll also send that around to you
thank   i   m just go to go over the last few page of the handout you have  page    through      page    is just a tabl remind you who the primari dealer are and provid some basic inform about their size  borrow activ  and regulatori status   as you probabl know  there are current    primari dealer  although as art mention we   re about to lose two of them   bear stearn and countrywid   an import point to note  which ran through scott   s present  is that although the invest bank   the four firm that are subject to consolid supervis by the sec under their cse program   are among the largest primari dealer  there are some veri larg bank affili dealer  includ not onli affili of u s  bank but also affili of german  swiss  british  and french bank   also  if you look at column    you   ll see   and these are data that we get from the two govern secur clear bank that facilit tri parti repo  jpmorgan chase and bank of new york   that it show that the invest bank are not  in fact  the largest borrow in the tri parti repo market   rather that distinct belong to deutsch bank  banc of america  and barclay   i think that   s signific becaus arguabl the biggest threat from bear   s bankruptci was the impact on the june                  of     avail of secur financ  especi from money fund and other high risk advers investor that provid tri parti financ to the dealer   so we have some veri larg borrow by those non   invest bank firm   column   and   provid some inform about how these firm are regul   essenti the legal entiti itself in everi case but one is a broker dealer regul by the sec  and in that case it   s a govern secur dealer regul by the treasuri but the sec realli   the enforc of those treasuri regul   final  all of these firm except one  cantor fitzgerald  which is an inter dealer broker  are subject to some form of consolid supervis by one or anoth consolid regul  although the regim can differ appreci   the ot has a regim for countrywid  i guess be a notabl exampl itself  quit differ from the one that we would appli   so with those fact in mind  turn to the next two page   i don   t intend to go through all these question  but what we   ve done here is set out some issu for discuss   basic there are two set  one relat to the futur of our liquid facil for the primari dealer and the other relat to the supervisori arrang through which we   re seek to mitig the moral hazard that those liquid facil creat   in each case  there are question about what to do under current law  until such  e as the congress may chang those law   then there are question about what legisl chang we might seek  particular if the congress show an inclin to legisl in this area   our purpos for this list of question is to s ul a discuss among you about these import issu and to provid you with an opportun to express ani preliminari view you may have   with that  i think we   d be pleas to answer question on ani of the three staff present  thank
question for our colleagu   presid
thank you   thank you  art  scott  and pat   for a veri forthcom present   two thing for you  art   first  on page   you present some inform about the detail of the stress test that you   re appli  and the tabl list various unsecur fund and secur fund from other sourc  and you have numer assumpt for the sever of stress  i take it that you appli those to the balanc sheet number and do some calcul to calcul the stress test
correct   we went back to the firm and ask them to give us the inform cut this way becaus it   s not readili avail from ani public inform that we have   we also ask them to give us  under a sever test scenario  what their assumpt was  june                  of     base on the submiss that we got from the four  which we converg and massag  we came out pretti close to these assumpt   we didn   t make these up
i was go to say that you essenti ask the question  what      sever    mean in your stress system
we left it somewhat in their hand  say that it   s go to be short of a full run
then you had some iter to get to an agre upon set of number for these
okay   now  you also said that you start your first iter by ask them to give you the result of a bear stearn failur scenario   what number   that correspond to on this tabl
you would have a lot higher number on secur fund   you would have the number come much closer to the illiquid      percent  and you would have a
well  wait   i   m sorri   i lost you there
under fix incom financ  for exampl  under the secur fund  there   s liquid and less liquid   those are    percent and    percent   those would have been approach     percent
so the sever  that   s how much of the money goe away
how much run   exact
okay   so do you have those number for bear   what they actual experienc
the sec is work on a post mortem   they have promis to share it with us when they   re done   they have folk   i wouldn   t say forens account   in there look at that  tri to piec togeth what happen   so we did not have the exact number
you didn   t have the exact number
but you knew rough what they were
thing move pretti quick at the end
i see   well  i was just interest in inform on exact how that transpir   if there   s a chanc that you could share with us that inform when you get it  that would be veri use   a second question for you   you note reput risk from be in on the supervisori basi  and i want just to probe as to how you think about that   what eventu would be riski for us
i guess a coupl   we   re say that we   re look at the capit posit   i think governor kohn was care to say in his tes oni that we   re look at capit in relat to near term earn prospect   that give us kind of a short window  but we know from examin bank that a capit number that   s report to you depend on how you   re carri your asset   we have not done ani work in tri to get behind  for exampl  the evalu on lehman   s commerci real estat portfolio   that   s a potenti vulner there   also  we have not realli look to a consolid assess of risk manag at these firm  someth we do in the bank supervis process   so we   re basic take the input  for lack of a better word  at face valu and not do our own work to tri to valid those   that   s what i was refer to in term of the risk to us   i think as long as we   re there  peopl expect us to be do a littl more than what we   ve been do to date
so it   s essenti the risk that  after the fact  mark are question  and they ask     you guy were in there   whi didn   t you            i understand that   thank  the third question is for pat   you talk about the repo market   my understand is that some supervisori work under the lfi  larg financi institut  umbrella is aim at condit in the repo market and mitig some risk there   you mention that it was obvious an import factor in bear   to what extent do you think pay interest on demand deposit would obviat the need for the huge volum of transact in the repo market and the extent to which that legisl prohibit could have contribut to the market structur and fragil that gave rise to what happen in bear
i can   t answer that  but that   s a good question   i mean  the basic problem here is that you have a tremend demand for invest that have essenti the characterist of treasuri bill  but the suppli of treasuri bill isn   t near as larg as that demand come from money market mutual fund and from invest of cash collater on secur lend and other kind of secur financ   over  e  the marketplac has come up with synthet treasuri bill of various sort  but those short term invest have been creat outsid the bank system by and larg becaus the inabl to pay interest on demand deposit  sn   t allow them to be provid by the bank system   now  if that prohibit were remov  i think you would see bank offer thing that would be compet with overnight repo  overnight commerci paper  and other sort of thing that are outsid the bank system that are meet these need  in term of the effect on stabil  whether that leav us in a better place obvious would depend on how good a job we do of regul matur transform by the commerci bank system   an interest question there is   whenev i hear art give his present and look at june                  of     these stress test we   re appli to the invest bank  even under current condit  when they   re not offer overnight interest bear deposit   how well our bank would fare if we test them against these standard   but i think your observ and your question are good one
i mention that becaus it sound as though it would be worthwhil know if it   s import   sinc we   ve ask the congress twice now for permiss to pay interest and they   ve declin  and if this was a factor in the recent crisi  we might want to point that out to them as part of our legisl dialogu with them over the next coupl of month to tri to get them to do someth
thank you  mr  chairman   just a comment on presid     s question   i guess in the end it would depend on how big bear stearn   s balanc sheet would have been and whether pay interest on demand deposit at commerci bank would have somehow shrunk bear stearn   s balanc sheet and the secur fund that could then run   so it   s pretti complic   it   s not obvious to me whether it would have made bear stearn a smaller player and a less signific part of the market  but it   s interest     look as though he want to say     yes  it would
no   may i   you know  we think that the money fund financ about a quarter or a third of the stuff in tri parti   money fund have a uniqu type of liquid risk   so it is possibl  if the same set of asset were financ by bank  that becaus bank have a differ liquid risk the system would be more stabl   so you can mayb say  even with the same balanc sheet as invest bank and the same mix of illiquid stuff financ through that mechan  if the bank were the domin provid of liquid or it was provid through bank  that the system would be more stabl  and the broader protect that we design over the last june                  of     centuri to limit the risk of run on bank becaus of the risk to the system might have more power  insul us from a system where nonbank are larg   i think that   s the argument  it would be interest to know a bit about the polit on the hill of think about that legisl chang   it would probabl look a littl like the middl east  i suspect    laughter   that would be a huge chang in the relat return on differ type of financi busi that now would come with that   but it would be worth know a bit about the histori of that debat in the past and what the probabl is that we could get someth like that through
i also had a question  mr  chairman  and it   s on the pdcf   i find some tension in my own attitud here   your lean all over these peopl not to borrow help protect the board   s decis that this is unusu and exig  credit couldn   t otherwis be avail  and all of that   so it   s support of that   on the other hand  it sound realli like what we use to do with commerci bank all the  e and thought it creat stigma in the process   we don   t want you to borrow   if you come in and borrow  given that we don   t want you to borrow  you must realli be hurt to overcom art angulo   s or bill     s frown   so i think the more we do this  the less use this thing is as a backstop in some sens   i don   t know   i don   t have an easi answer as to how to resolv this tension
mr  chairman  may i   not to preempt art and scott   in this case   i complet agre   it is veri import not to undermin the valu of these liquid backstop by introduc stigma in their use until we get to the point at which we want to dial peopl back   but the decis or the action we took in the context of cantor and countrywid had a veri compel rational   it would have been irrespons for us  given the fact that over cantor we have no compar framework of supervis and that their exposur was veri larg relat to capit   in that context  we could do it without ani risk that we were go to stigmat june                  of     the use of the pdcf becaus it   s a uniqu thing   countrywid  as you know  had a slight differ but similar rational   it would have been imprud for us to have had a substanti amount of secur outstand  insuffici collater  in the event that the deal didn   t go through  becaus they were not viabl on their own without bank of america   s buy them   that was a necessari and prudent thing to do   i think also that the risk was veri limit that we introduc stigma to the facil   the barclay thing was more delic   we would not say to them     you can   t use the facil      we just ask some care question about what they were do and whi  becaus their pattern of use was so differ from everybodi els   s in that context   but i complet agre with your concern about that stuff   i think we must be veri care go forward that we don   t do thing that will alter this balanc
presid    you had someth
yes   about the general topic of stigma and lend at our facil  i think it would be a use agenda item for futur research  and it would be use for us to work at think care about this   stigma repres some inform revel to market particip attend on some act  whether it   s borrow from us or from someon els   the usual presumpt is that more inform is better   we talk as if stigma is a bad thing   so i   d want to see a model that lay out how the sens in which it   s a bad thing counteract the sens in which inform is usual a good thing   i   m realli curious about that   i think it   s someth we ought to think more care about
presid    did you have a comment
yes   i ask bill   ye day a question about what i had heard from the street   that they perceiv that stigma was attach to it   with this convers  it certain appear to me that i was hear them say that  at least from the invest bank    point of june                  of     view  they do feel that some stigma is alreadi attach to it  good or bad   now that i   ve heard this discuss  it is consist with what i was hear from those wall street firm
may i just interject one thing on this   vice chairman   make the import point that one issu is counterparti risk for cantor and countrywid  which was sort of separ   the other issu is  sinc this is permiss onli under section        that it can   t be a chronic sourc of fund and it can   t be part of their core fund plan   we want to make it clear to them that this is go to go away  and we want to be confid that they   re not depend on the pdcf as a sourc of fund   so i would distinguish between barclay come in occasion with barclay come in everi day  and that   s realli the point we were tri to make to them
it may be too fine a distinct  but we didn   t say    no    to anyon when they came in   when they came in and stay for a month and a half or two month  then we start to say    no
but these are veri differ   i   m sorri
go ahead   finish your sentenc
i was just go to say that it   s a veri delic balanc  we want this set of firm to get themselv to the point where  in the eye of the market  they have a more conserv mix of leverag  appropri measur  and fund risk so that they are less like  even in a pretti advers shock  to need to financ illiquid stuff with their central bank as a defens against that liquid pressur   we   re tri to do that without forc a level of deleverag that would be advers to our broader object of tri to get market back to some point where they   re function more normal   we   re not go to get that perfect   by definit  our facil by design should allow them to run with a mix of leverag and liquid risk that is abov what the market probabl now would permit   in the absenc of our facil  leverag and june                  of     liquid risk  if you measur it on a scale  would have to be lower in some sens   but that   s the purpos and the necessari complement of the facil  and it is a delic balanc  but just to come back to presid     s point  i don   t think that the stigma is the result of how we   re appli the discret we preserv for ourselv around use   it is realli the result of the fact that  particular if you   re at a point when you perceiv escal concern about your viabil  peopl don   t want to risk that their pattern of use  if disclos  would magnifi the concern  that   s realli what account for the care in use  particular as concern about viabil has been intensifi these last few week or so
if i could add just one more thing  i also think that the stigma  sn   t realli undercut the benefit of the pdcf as a backstop to these firm    financ   if the stigma realli undercut the benefit  then the stigma would be quit import   but i think that the pdcf is still a veri viabl backstop even with some stigma associ with it in the current environ
presid hoenig  did you have an intervent
yes   to follow up on governor kohn   s point  i think it   s import to our discuss go forward in term of how we view these firm  from commerci bank to invest bank and primari dealer  becaus we are lend under exig circumst to these institut under the primari dealer facil   therefor  they almost by necess should be concern about stigma if they were to continu to borrow through there   on the other hand  it   s import becaus the taf is a differ instrument and has differ implic go forward in how we think about it and whether we want stigma with that   i think about how and how broad we view differ financi institut  that is  invest bank   are they blend into commerci bank   what about beyond that   we are go to have discuss about other type of financi institut   should they not continu to be lent to onli under exig circumst june                  of     versus an ongo taf type of arrang   so i think there is stigma and probabl should be unless we are conclud that they   re more like bank than not like bank
we   re go to have a chanc  of cours  for everybodi to give their view   presid    did you have a question
i just want to get in on this point that governor kohn rais   i   m not uncomfort with our be parsimoni with the primari dealer credit facil   it is under unusu and exig circumst  and i think we need to be sure that they are unusu and exig circumst   that   s the reason it was creat  and i think we have to respect that   i   m just wonder  judg from the declin in the extent of the outstand and given what you describ  can we assum that there   s a lessen of unusu and exig circumst   that   s my question
i would defer to my colleagu in market  but i would just give one anecdot   over the past few week  in particular  when lehman announc it second quarter result  some observ in the market state that lehman might not have come through this period if the pdcf had not been there   they never drew on it   i think it   s an interest point   i think there may be some relev  some truth  to that   bill  you would have a better sens as to whether the market are back to normal or not
i don   t think they   re back to normal  and i also think veri strong that the amount of use of the primari dealer credit facil is not a guid to how import it is as a backstop for financi firm
that   s my point   that   s import
there were a number of peopl to whom we talk who said that the reason they stay with lehman dure this period of stress was that they knew that the primari june                  of     dealer credit facil was there as a backstop   so i have a high degre of confid that lehman would have been in great difficulti without it
just to make sure   it isn   t quit as awkward as it sound  i mean  it   s not clear   the test for us about whether or not these make sens is not fundament about whether the pdcf would save lehman from itself   i would just make the observ that we thought origin that you could look at the bid to cover and at the clear price in the auction facil as a measur of stress in market  and they would be a test by which you could see condit   i think it   s import to recogn that that   s not itself a particular use prism on stress today   independ of the specif circumst around lehman  the peopl who are fund tri parti balanc sheet  for better or wors  tell anybodi who listen that they   re do so signific becaus of the exist of this facil as a backstop   so the use is not a veri good measur of stress probabl becaus of the stigma around it and becaus we   re affect price anyway by the exist of these facil  we   re do as much as we can to improv the odd that these firm get to the point at which  in the eye of their short term secur or unsecur creditor  they look as though they can withstand a pretti larg shock in the futur without recours to our facil   but i don   t think we   re at the point yet where we can say that confid  not becaus they haven   t deleverag suffici or bought enough liquid   though there   s a bit of that still left   but becaus there   s so much uncertainti left still about the scale of pressur on balanc sheet  what that might do to the loss  what that might do to asset price go forward or to behavior   so this is just one man   s view  but i think a veri good  substant case base on what you can observ and what peopl say about behavior suggest that circumst are still so fragil that we could justifi the provis of these facil as a respons  sensibl act given our broader object
did you complet your question
yes  i did
i just have a coupl of question of fact   how big was bear stearn   s tri parti repo on the thursday that they start get into troubl   just to give a rough sens of scale   i know it   s not exact
about      billion
about      billion
it was a littl over      billion
it hadn   t run off that week
it was start to run off
okay   so rough      billion   the number seem to be in that rang   now  one of the reason that we   re worri about the tri parti repo was that the secur in that tri parti repo were veri illiquid   was bear stearn unusu in the amount of illiquid secur that were be financ   as we look down this list  is the natur of the tri parti repo across these differ parti similar or differ   you could have a tri parti repo with collater that would be easi to liquid  or you could have a tri parti repo with someth veri difficult so that the counterparti would have a difficult  e actual sell it into a distress market   from the work you all have been do  are there big differ or not
there are definit differ among dealer   i don   t have the bear stearn cut  but we did a cut recent  and there are veri clear differ among dealer   as we know  the share of less liquid asset be financ by tri parti has been grow over the last   june                  of     pick a number   five  seven year   the trend line is go like that  clear at a steeper or more pronounc rate than the growth in more liquid or more elig collater
so   i   m sorri   what percentag would that be   when you say it   s grow  is it now             or    percent
pat  do you have that
i have in front of me data from bank of new york  which facilit about two third of the repo   at bank of new york     percent of the collater is debt that   s settl through dtc   so that would be non govern  non agenc debt   and anoth   percent is equiti   so about    percent is non omo thing   the biggest chunk by far is agenc mbs   of cours  i think in extremi bear was have troubl financ even agenc debt  import given the illiquid that had develop in even the agenc debt market at that  e  which was the critic thing that made investor no longer will to provid financ for that kind of collater with a shaki counterparti
for bear stearn  we have one side of the transact look at the invest bank   on the other side of that transact  you have compani like fidel  schwab  and feder   so as we think about who pose system risk  we probabl want to think about both side   in term of a distress scenario  you have tri parti repo that are veri illiquid   the clear bank   not want to provid the cash   as a result they have to liquid  and you have compani like fidel  schwab  and feder have to break the buck  and they don   t have much capit to infus   so just as we think about system risk  as you   re look at these other organ  are there other peopl that you would add to that   i know for bear stearn that fidel  schwab  and feder play a veri larg role   were there other organ that we ought to be think about that would have the same kind of natur
well  the other big categori that we have been abl to identifi of entiti that are provid tri parti financ is the custodian bank that act as agent for secur lender   when someon lend out secur  they often take in cash collater   then they want to reinvest that collater  and the big bank custodian do that on their behalf and invest a portion of that cash in tri parti   interest  jpmorgan chase and bank of new york mellon are two of the big bank involv in that particular busi   so that   s anoth categori  i think mayb what you   re get at is about deal with the issu of the tri parti market per se   we have to be veri care in our approach to these issu becaus the situat is still veri fragil  and until we get out of this period of turmoil  we first want to do no harm there   but ani solut can   t be focus sole or even primarili on the clear bank and the way they process these transact  although that   s part of it   it also has to focus on the behavior of the borrow and the lender  and the borrow are basic all of these primari dealer and certain other big broker dealer   the lender are more divers  which make them more difficult to deal with   but i think there are certain question about whether they   re manag their risk effect   if you   re a money fund and you   re treat an overnight repo secur by illiquid collater as the equival of an overnight treasuri bill  there   s someth problemat about that in term of your own think about the situat you   d be in if  in fact  the borrow were unabl to repay
one last question   sorri for so mani question   the situat of lehman was kind of interest becaus you saw their stock price go down   talk to financi institut  both regul and unregul  in boston  a lot of peopl were evalu counterparti risk and decid whether or not they were go to start run befor the capit issu   did your measur of liquid pick up the amount of stress that was go on in the counterparti analysi be done  i assum  all over the countri   one of the condit for an institut   s access to the june                  of     discount window at a primari credit rate is that it not be rate a   or a     i know we   re not do bank exam  and i know we   re not look at all the element of the bank exam   how confid are we  if we were to do someth like that for lehman or for merril lynch  that we wouldn   t rate them a   or a
on the first question  yes  we were pick up the pressur on liquid  we saw some crack  but it never broke   there were some counterparti that were skittish  but we never saw the type of acceler withdraw or run that came to mark bear stearn   we were watch it veri close  and so were they   but basic it hung togeth   the second question is a veri difficult one   it goe back to the point i finish on  that we are somewhat vulner in make these assess without have a more robust process   one way to look at it in the near term  though   again  as best we can  look at capit   is the chart on page     if you look at lehman   with it capit rais  their tier   risk base capit would be      percent   there may be some rang around that   there are certain question about how accur bear   s capit was state   but as a rough measur  i think it would be difficult to say that lehman would be a   or a    look at it from a solvenc perspect   they   ve bol  liquid   as i said  it start to crack  but it never realli shatter
governor    did you have a question
not a question  just for the go round
whi don   t we then have an opportun for general comment on these issu   let me just give a bit of context   when we institut the pdcf and the tslf in march  about the  e of the bear stearn event  we stipul that they would be avail for up to six month   that date  mid septemb  is come closer   it   s my view  and i think other share it  that market remain fragil  and in the case of lehman  for exampl  the exist of the backup june                  of     was an import support in maintain the stabil of that institut   therefor  given the state of the market and given that i think we still face some system risk  i am quit inclin at this point to ask the board to extend the pdcf and the fomc to extend the tslf over year end  which is a difficult period   subject  of cours  to the continu find of unusu and exig circumst   if we do that  i would ask the board to consid that in a board meet  and depend on the comment today  if there   s suffici support  i would ask the fomc to do that in a notat vote later this month  now  if we make the announc that we   re go to at least provision extend these facil  i think it   s import that we do so in the context of explain that we have an exit strategi   in particular  we are work to strengthen supervisori oversight  market resili  and the overal regulatori structur so that there is understand and confid that we   re move forward in a way that will over  e make this unnecessari not onli in the short term but in the long term as well  there are sever part to the plan here   one  as scott alreadi describ  is the memorandum of understand with the sec  which will provid the basi for cooper and collabor in the medium term for our oversight of the invest bank   two  work with the sec  we   d like to push forward along the line that art was describ  go beyond where we are now  and begin to establish a set of supervisori expect regard what we expect to see for the invest bank and to make sure that we have greater confid in what we   re do and what they   re do   a third element that i think is import as we go forward is to tri to improv the financi infrastructur in a number of dimens   a lot of this work is alreadi take place at the feder reserv bank of new york  work with other regul and with the privat sector   it includ thing like improv the clear and settlement process for various kind of deriv june                  of     and improv risk manag of deriv posit and counterparti posit  for exampl   it would be import for us go forward to make sure that major institut can identifi their exposur to a given counterparti through deriv and other instrument and be abl to close out that counterparti in an effici and effect way   in addit  work is go on here at the board and in conjunct with new york on the tri parti repo market  tri to think of way that we can strengthen that   perhap  for exampl  by narrow the rang of collater that is normal accept and through other step  so the way i would envis this proceed would be   again  with your assent and subject to your comment   that we will announc within the next few day the mou agreement with the sec  which i would reemphas is not tie to the pdcf   that is  we would anticip that this relationship would continu even should we close those facil  on the ground that the moral hazard issu is still there  until such  e that there is further resolut by the congress   second  i   ll be give a speech at the fdic on juli    follow by tes oni on regulatori reform on juli     when secretari paulson and i and other will be lay out some broad principl  includ some of the issu of infrastructur  and will be discuss some of the longer term legisl issu   for exampl  the issu of how we should perhap normal or regular the resolut of a fail system import firm and  in so do  mayb defin more strict what the paramet are for fed lend and what our respons is in this kind of situat  so to summar  the mou is this week   there will be tes oni come up   presum after the monetari polici tes oni later this month  we would like  condit on your approv  to announc the extens of these facil condit on continu unusu and exig circumst   we would like to packag that with a seri of announc concern invest bank expect  infrastructur  and as part of this environ as we talk about this in june                  of     tes oni and so on  some of our thought about how we might go forward in term of statutori chang in the futur   what i   m tri to convey is that  although i think we need to extend these facil  we should do it in a context of increas clariti about how we are work to make them less and less necessari in the futur   so with that as context  let me just open the floor for ani comment that peopl might have   i have first presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the issu around the liquid facil and what supervisori apparatus we have wrap around primari dealer have to do with our have extend our lend reach   i think there   s now a substanti gap between our impli lend commit and the scope of our supervisori author   vice chairman   spoke veri eloqu about that earlier this month   i think it   s paramount that we close that gap in order to keep borrow from exploit the obvious lend commit and choos to leav themselv vulner to run and run like behavior   but this leav open the question of the extent of our lend reach and how we close that gap  and i think that that   s the most critic challeng for us in the year ahead  particular as we approach negoti with the congress  i   d like to share a coupl of thought on that broader question becaus the question pose to us sort of get at those   it   s import to start this from a peace  perspect  sort of a  eless perspect  and ask the question as if you were choos afresh a lend and regulatori polici that was go to last a long  e   if you imagin for the moment that whatev we announc and adopt would be perfect credibl and immedi view as credibl  i think you   d obvious choos to not have this gap   you   d obvious choos to have lend and regulatori polici that are mutual incent compat   so you   d want an adequ supervisori regim in place for ani institut that market particip believ we   ll lend to   convers  it mean that you would want market june                  of     particip to believ that we will constrain our lend to those institut for which we have an adequ supervisori regim in place  so then the question come up   how do you choos the boundari of our lend commit   i take it as self evid that our lend commit shouldn   t be open end and unlimit   we don   t want to supervis everi financi intermediari in the world or in the unit state  much less all individu  partnership  and corpor   but even limit ourselv to what   s call system import financi institut is go to be problemat as well   i take that phrase to mean ani institut whose failur could be cost or disrupt to mani other market particip   ani institut that choos to engag in matur transform to some extent face the potenti for run like behavior by the creditor   unless we impos draconian regul  market particip will alway have a virtual unlimit capac for creat financi arrang that run the risk of disrupt failur   so extend our lend reach to whatev institut that make itself system import just lead us down a path of ever more financi regul of an ever larger portion of the financi system   i think we   re go to have to set some boundari   i   d like to see them tighter rather than looser  and make them credibl is go to be the hard problem for us go forward  in do that  we   re go to face a classic  e consist problem   i take that as given  i   m not sure everyon els share that view  but i take it as obvious   inevit the exig of crisi manag are excruci  but i think there are  e when they conflict with our long run interest in the type of financi system that we would design from a peace    eless perspect  just the way short run concern about growth some  conflict with our long run interest in price stabil   but just as sustain monetari polici credibl some  requir resist the temptat to eas polici to s ul growth  sustain credibl lend limit is go to june                  of     some  requir not prevent a disrupt failur of an institut and not amelior the cost of financi distress   to put it anoth way  i think it would be a mistak to adapt our supervisori reach to a pure discretionari lend polici   we   re go to have to choos a polici and commit to it and then take hard action to make that credibl  from this point of view  i have a deep question about the question pose by the staff   they focus entir on primari dealer  and it  sn   t strike me that the fact that bear stearn was a primari dealer was what made us lend   it was the fact that it was more disrupt   i think it   s like that ani other institut that present the same threat of a disord resolut is go to be perceiv as benefit from our implicit lend support  whether or not they   re a primari dealer  unless we say someth otherwis  unless we draw a boundari  and unless we make that credibl  so  for exampl  other larg broker dealer  hedg fund  privat equiti firm  or insur compani could easili fail in a disrupt way   we need to think through whether we   re go to let that happen or whether we   re go to be forc to step in   at some point we   re go to have to choos to let someth disrupt happen  i think that ambigu about our lend limit would be a bad choic   market particip are go to form their own view about the likelihood of us lend   ani lack of clariti about the boundari is just go to lead some firm to test the boundari  and it   s not go to help us resist the temptat to lend beyond the boundari we want to establish   besid  mr  chairman  you   ve emphas the valu of de person and institution the conduct of monetari polici   it   s import that we strive for lend polici that isn   t critic depend on particular officehold  as i said  i   d favor fair tight limit on our lend commit  and you are probabl not surpris about that   i think we realli ought to maintain this section       hurdl at a fair high level  but the exit strategi make me nervous   craft this mou  a perman shift in our visibl june                  of     into and in our abil to protect the system from primari dealer  is just go to sustain the expect that have arisen sinc bear   which have been describ and referenc a coupl of  e and which you see in the fall in cds spread for those institut   and it is just realli hard to see how to put that geni back in the bottl and limit the extent to which we   re view as backstop them   but i think we ought to strive to make that somehow be view as unusu as possibl  more broad  my read of the histori of econom and financi intermedi is just my read   but i   m motiv broad by the sens that we   d be better serv in the long run with as small an extent of central bank lend commit as possibl   central bank credit is fiscal polici   it entangl us in polit   it risk compromis the independ of our monetari polici  you   ve heard me say this befor   expand our lend forc us to extend our regulatori reach  and that can   t be good for the financi system even though i trust our staff to do a veri good job of be as effici and effect as they can be   i   ve argu this befor   it   s not obvious on the evid that our financi system is terribl fragil apart from the volatil induc by uncertainti about govern and central bank polici   besid  i think that we should take serious the notion that some amount of financi instabl is undoubt op   as work by economist such as allen and gale has demonstr   those are the kind of consider that i think ought to guid our polici  final  mr  chairman  a word about process   at our last meet we discuss interest on reserv  a histor and consequenti decis for us   we had a brief packag of     plus page reflect substanti staff work   the committe veri much benefit from that   at an upcom meet we   re go to talk about inflat dynam  anoth consequenti topic   we   ve receiv somewhat less materi  even go back sever month  about financi market  their charact  june                  of     and the welfar econom of our intervent   i   d urg you to consid a special topic at some futur meet at which we explor the econom of financi stabil  sinc it is becom such a consequenti part of what we do   relat to that  i was happi to learn from art that an after action review by the sec was under way   becaus our role is differ from the sec   s  i   d like to suggest that mayb build on that or mayb in parallel to that we conduct our own after action review of the factor that went into how that event play out   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
thank you   i agre with you that we need to defin limit  but i think we have stronger tool than just our declar of pieti   i would just note that there are model   one good model is the fdicia model  for exampl  which lay out a whole set of criteria under which intervent can be taken and  if intervent is taken  has a set of rule   there are way through the legal structur to solv some of these problem without our necessarili have to make  e inconsist promis
i agre  and those are mechan for legisl tie our hand  and that ought to be high on the agenda
we   ll discuss those   yes  presid
on that point  i have been read a bit recent   it might be use in think about some of these issu about how we tie our hand and the mechan for do that  the imf went through an extraordinari studi effort dure the sovereign debt crisi and came up with some veri import mechan for how to chang the contract that were be written by sovereign countri so as to avoid the imf   s have to step in and look for other solut  which is  i think  along the same line   i don   t know whether or not there are thing from which to learn in parallel with that to think about how we approach that issu
i have three comment for the long term and three comment for the short term   for the long term  in the tradeoff between focus on market versus institut  to the extent that we can have standard product trade on exchang  we don   t need to spend as much  e with institut  and that take care of a lot of the counterparti risk   to the extent that the product have to be custom and done in dealer market  then we have counterparti risk and that becom an issu   so i applaud what the new york fed is do with the credit default swap market in think about a way to more systemat reduc counterparti risk   i wonder if we should more forc be tri to push it not onli to a clearinghous but also mayb to exchang trade   i know there is a tradeoff between standard product and nonstandard product  but if we can get thing to be more standard so that they can trade on an exchang  we won   t have to spend as much  e talk about some of the issu that we   ve been talk about   not just a credit default swap market has that characterist   so if we can push a number of area in which there   s counterparti risk into an exchang  then we can get out of the busi of focus on all the institut  the second point is that there   s a broader role for us as a hold compani supervisor  when i look at this list and look at countrywid  it   s not becaus they   re a primari dealer that i would be focus on them   it   s becaus they were    to    percent of the residenti mortgag market  they were a veri larg player   the ot has hold compani supervis over them   we ought to ask ourselv whether now is the  e to think about what organ we ought to have hold compani respons for   the ot has wamu and had countrywid   we ought to give some thought to that   now is the  e to think about whether or not that   s appropri and push for it if there are go to be legisl recommend   in term of broker dealer  i think the same thing appli   i don   t think that we should be the primari regul for these organ   but if june                  of     we   re go to be lend to them in exig circumst  have hold compani regulatori author   becom import  the third point is that  when you look at this list  there are a lot of foreign institut   one insight that we   ve gotten is that an organ as big as ub could potenti fail   that may not be someth that we thought was veri like nine month ago  but it is obvious more like now than we would have anticip   foreign organ can either establish themselv as a branch or have a domest hold compani   to the extent that foreign supervisor decid to wall off their organ around their geograph border and say that  if there is a problem  we   re not go to support institut that are in the unit state and you   re on your own  i think we need to revisit some of our rule on how much capit we expect foreign hold compani that are intermediari hold compani to hold   we might also want to think about  if there   s a lot of activ be done through a branch that has no capit support it  how concern we should be about that  should we be take action to make sure that  if the foreign parent decid that they are go to abandon the branch  we feel veri comfort with that outcom   given the list of the primari dealer  i think the number are fair larg  larger than they were for bear stearn  and that   s someth that we probabl should give a bit more thought to  on the short term issu  i certain think that we should extend the facil past the end of the year   that make perfect sens   a number of us have made the point that the market are still fragil   just the announc about lehman brother over the last month highlight that we   re not yet safe  and i think that it make perfect sens to extend through the end of the year becaus there could be an end of the year financ problem this year   second  narrow tri parti repo collater also make sens   but it has implic for what secur peopl hold  and some of those market may becom much more distress if we announc that they no longer can be part of a tri june                  of     parti repo   so we need to give some thought to whether there will be collater damag and to the unintend consequ from that   third  i agre with presid   that primari dealer wouldn   t be where i   d focus   i   d focus on system import   that would be key player and key market whose failur might caus a cascad of counterparti failur   i think we ought to start with that premis and which organ fit into that categori   some of them will be on the primari dealer list  but they are on the primari dealer list for a reason veri differ from the reason they are system import   so mayb distinguish between those two would be use
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  on the short term  i think extend through the end of the year is prudent and would support that   i would say that the possibl of it natur die off would be ideal   i would support that becaus it is    exig circumst      we should make that clear and work these peopl out of it as quick as possibl  on the longer term issu  i share the view of a lot of what presid   said   a coupl of thing   i   m veri uneasi about extend our lend and supervisori author to these institut on the basi of system risk   the bank industri has been under our umbrella  import around transact activ   that is  payment   and how import they are system   it   s clear  and a line is there   beyond that  it is size that   s system import   if we extend this and institution it becaus we   ve had this emerg and we   ve use section        then i have to ask what will happen when the next long term capit occur that   s larger  more complic  with a lot more interact that will affect the market global   what will we do   to what then will we extend ourselv in term of supervisori oversight  memo of understand  agreement for the group of hedg fund that aren   t regul  and so forth   so i think it   s import that we focus on the fact that this is an emerg and that we go back to june                  of        exig circumst    in the futur for these institut so that we have clear boundari on that  i think it has serv us well and will continu to serv us well   then we use our best judgment in exig circumst and veri spare   i think that   s a lot of what presid   said  so i won   t repeat everyth els  but those are the concern that i realli do have go forward
may i make a suggest
yes   you know  these are deep  consequenti question we face   this is a question on the economi  and we   re not go to resolv it today   i think it   s import that we recogn that we   re go to have to build some  e into our agenda   later this year probabl  certain earli next year   and get deeper into the basic question about what we are for in the futur   what amend to the feder reserv act  if ani  would we support   what would we resist   what mix of these thing   that   s import becaus we   re not go to do an adequ job of get ourselv on the tabl on those action today   we are go to need to be veri care that the stuff we   re do in the here and now  sn   t prejudic those decis long term   again  i think the packag that the chairman laid out and the strategi we have are pretti care design to mitig that risk   we   re tri to be veri care that we   re preserv full option  onc we get through this particular period  to go on ani of the path that are ahead in this context   of cours  this short term stuff is vulner to the risk   it look as though we   re prejud some of those choic  but i think we   re tri to be care not to do that   i just want to make the point that we   re all go to need a littl  e to think through this stuff  and we   re go to need some  e to come back and talk about the deeper polici question that we face in june                  of     this becaus they are veri consequenti   i have a lot of sympathi for all the concern that are on the other side of where we are today
i would veri much like to see us make that happen sooner rather than later just becaus of the forc of event take us forward
that   s right   becaus of tes oni and so on  we are go to have to at least enunci some broad principl  and that is whi this discuss is veri use   obvious  detail will be work out over a longer period   presid bullard
yes  i just have a few comment   in read through this memo and hear the present this morn  i think that these are fantast question   they deserv a lot of research and analysi   just to echo vice chairman    they cannot easili be answer in a forum like this one   what is happen is that we start out look at these question  which just spawn more and more question  so we end up with an even longer list of question   the short term strategi seem perfect reason  somehow tie to an exit strategi mayb next year   so i didn   t have ani problem with that as outlin by the chairman  when we get down to approach a more detail analysi of what we want to do overal  it bring up veri difficult question of what the op  regulatori environ is   i think that we all think the regulatori environ in the unit state is not op  right now  also  in a world of increas global  it is not so clear how you should set up your regulatori structur   this is a onc in a generat chanc to possibl reformul the regulatori structur   i wouldn   t hold my breath on that   i think the congress   not have a great record of deal with issu like this   these issu are complic  and it is veri hard to get agreement on them   but you would like to have a benchmark   i think that one is out there in the june                  of     econom literatur about what that environ should look like   that is what we could possibl work on over the next nine month or so  then i have anoth comment   when we are evalu these program  we have to think about whether these program have been effect and to what extent   how do we measur success   one of the comment earlier was that the mere exist of the program might be success in some sens   in a model  that is go to work   even if you take it out of exist  becaus the market know it   s there and you can put it back into exist in the futur  it will have exact the same effect   whether or not you have the program in place  the equilibrium is go to be the same in a lot of model  so the effect would still be there   if it is just the potenti of put the program in place that is consid success  then mayb it is not critic whether it is in place but price not to be use or whether it is actual taken out of exist temporarili
mr  chairman  i am in favor of keep these facil open through year end as you have suggest   i think that just the exist of the pdcf is import  which we talk about earlier  and your overal outlin of an approach  the topographi of that approach  is attract   the question i have is about   and you use the term      supervisori expect      i have a question for scott  and then a thought to follow up on   sinc  scott  no one ask you a question  i want to ask you a question
i was perfect content to get through this without ani question   laughter   but i am happi to answer anyth
in work up this mou  have you had ani interact with chairman frank or ani of his staff  get a sens of how they might react or what it   in term of their own expect
well  we have had a bit of interact on the senat side   the senat folk are veri interest in what we are do and whether this would preempt a congression action   chairman frank has been more sanguin about our do what is appropri to deal with the situat now   la  may speak to this more at the lunch  convers   but we are build on exist author   we are not expand beyond the exist framework   we are agre to collabor more  work togeth more  but we don   t gain ani legal or statutori author through this mou   we gain some admiss becaus we are stand next to the sec  we expect that the primari dealer and cses will be more will to talk with us becaus we are with the sec   but in the end  it depend on voluntari cooper by all
are you pick up ani signal in return  in this interact with the senat or elsewher  about what they might be think   are we pick up ani other signal that might be of concern
on the hous side  chairman frank is think of a model that is similar to what the treasuri blueprint outlin  where the feder reserv would be a system regul and have some author that go along with that   i think that on the senat side they are veri much in disarray   they want to visit this issu  but they haven   t figur out exact what point of view they want to have
i am a littl confus   you testifi in juli and then have a speech   you said that you and paulson will be speak   i think that is a veri import point   it is go to be a tough act becaus you don   t want to take anyth off the tabl  but you want to keep a lot june                  of     open and not show your hand   well  we don   t know what our hand is yet   you may  but i don   t think we have it as a group   so we can   t realli show our hand   anyway  i don   t know how this is go to be prepar  but i   m sure there are lot of feel around this tabl   this is the substanc that vice chairman   refer to earlier   these veri  veri import question  but you are go to have to show some leg dure that speech   obvious  this is a board issu  but with regard to the fomc  i would just ask that it be fair care vet
i was plan to do that
yes  sir   just for some suggest  for whatev they   re worth   thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   just a few point   with regard to the short term plan of extend the facil over the turn of the year and so forth   that is  the mou and the tes oni that goe with it   that is all fine with me   i don   t have ani problem with that  that sound sensibl under the circumst  a number of import point have alreadi been rais   i won   t reiter all of them  mayb the one that caught my attent most complet was presid     s point about credibl   whatev we go forward with obvious has to be seen as credibl  and as he point out  it is import that at some point  to limit our involv in support institut and market go forward  we may have to be prepar to let one larg institut fail   the reason  of cours  that we are veri concern about protect them over  e is the spillov effect   as i have said mani  e befor  where we need to concentr our effort   not necessarili exclus  but certain in part   is in devis way to limit spillov   that is all about june                  of     prepar   the analysi and so forth that goe with it   and it is all about communic   that is  put uninsur creditor on notic that the regim is in fact in the process of chang  now  have said that  i don   t mean to suggest that it is easi   i don   t mean to suggest that we will get it     percent correct   but if we don   t do those kind of thing  then statement about boundari aren   t like to be credibl   they are just go to be  well  you guy wish it were this way  but you have section        and we know it   s there  and we are go to act accord   so i think it is veri import  as we go forward with this  that we focus some attent exact on those area
thank you   presid
i will be veri brief  mr  chairman   i do want to say  with respect to the short term issu  that i fulli support the plan that you laid out   i certain favor keep these facil in place beyond septemb   even if their use diminish  i agre with the point that it  sn   t necessarili indic that they are not play a tremend import role   the ramp up of our oversight of these institut in the agreement with the sec is a veri import part of continu these facil  on the long run issu  it is a wonder list of question   i don   t know the answer to the question   i think we realli need to dig in veri rapid and do serious work on them   they are fundament   presid   rais a list of issu about this  the same one that have been veri much in my mind   what institut   it is not obvious to me that the right list of system import institut is the primari dealer   i think someon   mayb presid     rais the issu of countrywid  a huge mortgag compani   i certain worri last summer that it had creat system risk  and it is not just the primari dealer there   i also think there is an issu with respect to hedg fund  similar to those that aros with long term capit june                  of     manag   this rais veri troubl issu to me about our tri to identifi and take on supervis of all system import institut   this is a veri tough issu that i don   t know the answer to  but also  what is go on rais fundament issu about how we conduct consolid supervis   even if all the system import institut were primari dealer or mortgag compani within bank hold compani that current we do have umbrella supervis over  i am not at all convinc that the way we are carri out supervis now would have prevent a bear stearn type of episod within an institut that is current solid under our supervis   last summer i was pleas in some way that we had lost direct supervis of countrywid to the ot   but it might well have been in our domain   six month earlier it would have been   and it could have creat a system import problem if it had fail  so just the natur of how we carri out this fed lite approach  is that realli the right way   i see us as veri focus on process in our supervis of hold compani   we don   t do a lot of transact test   obvious  this rais veri fundament issu  even within our exist domain  about how we carri out comprehens umbrella supervis   i don   t have ani answer  but we clear need to get on it quick
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be veri brief   a lot of my view have been share alreadi   just to expand on presid     s comment   how we defin the right institut  the scope of this  i think that some of the question here are realli hard   it is my understand that the workgroup we talk about last  e are go to be work on some of these thing  and we need to get those well under way to help us defin these problem  on the longer term problem   vice chairman   made this point  and i just want to june                  of     reiter it   it is realli import in the short run that we not do thing that constrain our longer term option   it is a veri slipperi slope that the long run end up be transform into a seri of short term step  and by that almost inevit you end up in place you don   t want to be   so i just want to make sure that we stay abreast of that and not let that happen to us   that we find ourselv six month from now in a posit where  gee  we wish we hadn   t done that   so i just want to stress that again  i   m fine with extend the facil through the end of the year   i don   t have ani tremend problem with that  although i have alway been a littl puzzl by    unusu and exig circumst      what   that realli mean   how do we defin that   it would be a lot easier for me to think about when to take it off if i knew what the criteria were for put it on  it would be help to me  anyway  if we could work on defin those criteria a littl more rigor   i know there will be judgment involv in that at the end of the day   i don   t disagre with that   but it would help us to defin what we mean by that becaus it is go to be realli hard to defin what we mean by a    system import institut      i am not sure i know the answer to that   i think it is a veri difficult question   so i am okay on the short run  i will just reiter the other point that presid  n made about the issu of credibl and commit   you know  i have talk a lot about this over the last coupl of year regard monetari polici   it appli equal well in this framework   figur out way to implement our polici  whatev they may be  in both a  e consist and commit way  and defin those boundari and how we live up to them  is a realli hard problem   but i don   t think we can avoid deal with it  and it is go to be a critic piec of how we think about the longer term   i will just leav it at that
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support extend our lend facil to get through the year end fund problem   as mani other have alreadi said  i agre that we should undertak an evalu of the chang to our emerg liquid facil  i think it is import that we do it more broad and that we don   t do it in a piecem fashion  how the piec fit togeth matter great   ani extens of fed author to provid routin liquid support beyond insur bank should be someth that we consid as part of a comprehens regulatori and financi safeti net reform   my own view may be that i prefer a narrow lend facil than i think was envis in some of the document that we receiv  but i do think that the top prioriti is to have a well thought out  document plan for how we move forward   that will help us address some of the moral hazard issu that we have been concern about   i think it will avoid our have to creat ani new institut or new facil to respond to futur crise   i also think it will help better defin some of the boundari   thank you
thank you   presid
thank  mr  chairman   i have mayb a variat on governor     s comment of ye day   much has been said by mani  so i will tri not to take too much  e here   i think vice chairman     s admonit are correct  and i certain support them   i am quit support of extend through the year end  and the short term plan that the chairman laid out seem quit sensibl to me  i don   t have well inform or well thought out answer to the more detail question that were pose in advanc of the meet   i didn   t devot the  e to studi them in ani depth  so let me take refug in some sort of high level comment   a number of peopl around the tabl have been express overview type of comment   i see the touchston of all of this to be our june                  of     perceiv account for system risk and financi stabil   there may be  in the context of legisl  regul  and so forth  limit to that  but i think that we are larg perceiv as the most account parti   i have to ask myself  do we have a system today that is align with the realiti of the financi market   or  put in more vernacular term  do we have the right stuff to do what we need to do to take respons as best we can for financi stabil   my answer to that is    no      i don   t think we have the right stuff   i think the answer to that lie in work out the detail of what the right stuff is   but the realiti is that financi market are not bank centric ani longer  with the wide discuss shadow bank system  includ hedg fund  a complex that is not go to go away  intern integr that is not go to go away  veri  let   s just say  compel econom and financi reason for off balanc sheet treatment of various kind of thing  and on and on   we could make a long list of what that realiti is   to me  and i have been kind of dwell on this for some  e  that is a realiti that is like to continu  it may take a coupl of step back  but it will continu to develop along certain line   do we have a system that is align with it   the answer to that is    no      so if we can take care of the short term plan and then buy the  e over the next sever month to hammer out what we think is the best possibl think opposit that realiti  then that is what i believ we need to be do  so thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i will also tri to be brief  in spite of the larg number of question that were hand out   the short term should be quit easi   on the tactic issu  i agre with the suggest of extend the facil through year end   they seem to have work well   also  a number of veri interest and import initi are ongo as well on the cds over the counter market and tri parti repo  and those should help out as well  june                  of     on the longer term issu  i am veri happi to hear that you will be give a speech and tes oni on this  and i will be look forward to how you lay out those issu   obvious  there are larg scale chang in our regulatori environ that are be contempl   these happen onli everi now and then   it is an opportun to improv or to make a tremend mistak if we are not veri care   so i think it  obvious  requir a tremend amount of  e  peopl have talk about the various issu  so i won   t dwell on them   i think there have been a lot of veri good comment around the tabl and speech that have laid out the import issu that we are face   one that i am sure we will have to talk a bit more about is that we can   t think about this in a static environ   obvious  the market are veri dynam   as soon as we lay out a structur that will help out certain type of institut  then there is go to be an opportun to arbitrag that   we are presum talk about reduc earn of a number of institut  and so they will be seek those out   anoth way to character the big question   it is noth new   is how we maintain the incent for market disciplin   mani of the comment that presid  n and other made about how we think about prepar for possibl resolut will be veri import   so i am look forward to mani more discuss about this   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think i would just like to dig into some of the comment that presid   and presid   just made  just for a second  take a step back  and ask whi we are here have this convers   i know the  e is becaus we have this pdcf  but what happen was that the financi market evolv in such a way that simpli have a liquid backstop for commerci bank was not suffici to protect the economi from june                  of     system risk   i myself have been veri surpris   i will be veri open about this   at the persist  the extent  the depth  and the spread of this crisi and how long it went and what it cover   everi coupl of month  i thought it was about to be over  and then anoth wave would come   i think that we have learn someth about the financi system in the process  and we have learn that the regulatori structur and the liquid provis structur were not suffici to give the economi the protect it need from the new style of financi system  that is realli the background of whi we are here  not just becaus we made the loan or we set up the facil becaus we thought we need to do so to protect the system under the circumst  i complet support  mr  chairman  your suggest path forward for the near to intermedi term   i think that is the right way to go   i would say  relat to the two senat that i testifi in front of last week  that they were veri support of the memorandum of understand between the fed and the sec and particular support of the effort that the feder reserv bank of new york and the other regul are lead to strengthen the infrastructur of the otc deriv market   we didn   t get into tri parti repo  fortun  but i   m sure they would have been support of that  too  i think everybodi has rais veri good question about where  in this new financi system  you draw the boundari   what do you need to do   there are no easi answer here  and i look forward to come back to this   my go in posit is that our liquid facil outsid of commerci bank ought to be avail in system circumst  not in just ani circumst  and they ought to be avail at this point to just broker dealer or invest bank   i would hesit to get outsid that realm   those guy are alreadi regul  and so what we   re talk about is strengthen the regul   i think that we can strengthen the core of the june                  of     system to make it resili to thing happen outsid  but i am not total dug in on that   so i look forward to more discuss   it is go to be veri hard to draw the line and make it credibl   i agre  part this will be defin what we mean by    system     but i don   t think we will ever realli get to the point of have a bright line around that   it will alway need a great amount of judgment  combin with   as you said  mr  chairman   a process by which you make that decis  to help limit the moral hazard   crise are alway difficult   you get into a crisi  and the near term cost are much more palpabl than the long term cost that might be there   so it is alway hard to say    no      we have said    no    in the past on certain circumst   drexel is the obvious exampl   market were a littl stress   there was a littl disord   it was fine  but it was a veri differ circumst   i think that complet my remark   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make a few prefatori comment  and then tri to answer a coupl of the key question in the memo   first  a crisi is a terribl thing to wast   my sens is that we have an opportun here to do the right thing over the period to tri to get market disciplin   to     s point   back and vibrant and work countercycl with regulatori disciplin and capit standard   so this is an opportun   as we contempl our six month and a day problem  what do we do between septemb and year end   i agre with vice chairman     s comment that we need to keep option open  and i will make a propos in a moment for how to do that  second  the memo from the staff said that improv in financi market have result  import  from the avail of the special liquid facil  and i agre with that  but i wouldn   t give short shrift to the other thing that have been go on in the market that june                  of     have improv market function   i don   t think it is fair to say that we deserv a disproportion amount of credit for what has happen   we have seen a ton of capit rais  we have seen a lot of diversif of fund sourc   we have seen chang in durat by financi institut   we have seen improv disclosur and transpar   we have seen big write down   we have seen brutal chang in manag team   we have seen pair of busi line and improv risk manag   so it strike me that market disciplin is aliv and well   it was necessari for us to do what we did  but i think it hang way too much on our facil if we suggest that we are the onli thing that is keep the system togeth  as a final prefatori comment  the memo say that some investor have indic their willing to lend to primari dealer in recent month  and that has been condit on dealer    access to the pdcf   it strike me that prove too much   i am not sure that is a good thing   the concern we have late in the cycl  when we look back  includ that market disciplin broke down   in the short term  obvious  we want to see some of the money market mutual fund from presid     s neck of the wood hang in there with these institut so we don   t have a sort of panic come   but over the short to medium term  we want the guy in money market mutual fund to recogn that  when they are provid fund overnight  they are make an invest decis that has a risk   so i hesit to suggest that we want to do thing over the period that let them be complac   we want to do thing that make them veri focus on the decis they are make  now a bit to the key question that were ask in the memo   first  on liquid facil  on the question of the pdcf and it symmetri with the tslf  i like that notion of the balanc of have an auction and have one that is avail more regular   but we have to recogn that the pdcf  whether intend or not  has been stigmat   if lehman brother  when they were june                  of     on their darkest day  had answer the question differ  i dare say they might not be in exist   they were ask     have you access the pdcf      the answer was     absolut not      if their answer to that had been    yes     i suspect that they and we could have been in a veri differ circumst   so what   that prove   i think that prove that the exist of these facil matter   it keep institut in the game   the particular term matter less   but also  in extremi  access that facil  unlik the secur lend facil  caus lose a consider amount of control over one   s own fate   so i think we have to take that into consider  we have consider leverag over these institut at this  e   no matter what they and their lobbyist say  they want us to be their regul more than they can possibl contain themselv   most for our credibl and most for our balanc sheet   i worri that if we extend the pdcf as is by just punt it down the road some month  we will lose some of that leverag   so one idea  which i must say i haven   t explor as much as i probabl should  is extend the pdcf  not as is but by modifi it in a way that would make bagehot proud   by make it more expens  by widen the spread   now  there are other thing we could do in this short term extens that modifi it term   chang collater or chang haircut   but it strike me that price might be an interest way to say     listen  we aren   t pre judg outcom  but you can see from this move that we aren   t comfort with the status quo  and we are ask ourselv these veri hard question that we brought to bear      that could send an import signal  which i don   t think would be over disrupt to the market if we explain some of the rational for do it  let me turn  final  to the prudenti supervis question   i have a note here in answer to the first question     how do we limit moral hazard if we continu the facil      my bold june                  of     answer is    care     so i guess not much is there   on what principl should supervisori expect be base   i think art talk right about these differ regulatori framework for the big money center commerci bank and the invest bank   we   d be do ourselv a disservic over the period  mr  chairman  to take the regulatori regim that we have now had for a long  e for these big complex commerci bank and tri to put it on the invest bank  i   ll answer this the way i began   we have an opportun to start with a blank sheet of paper  with four institut over the period  and figur out how to be realli  realli good regul  build on the lesson that we have learn from our tradit supervis and regul function   i think that we would be make a mistak by say     we have a model  and let   s throw it on these guy      if we regul these four institut the way we have long been regul commerci bank with the occ and other  i think we won   t have maxim the best of regul   the goal would be to figur out how to regul these four right and then  frank  to export those lesson to what we have long been do to make regul better and stronger across this group   if it turn out that we do to goldman sach and morgan stanley what we have been do to citi and jpmorgan  as was suggest  we will find other peopl will be in the busi of invest bank  so we won   t have done terribl much to mitig system risk  final  on the question about the role for the congress   both in the medium term  mr  chairman  in the context of your speech and as we get toward the end of juli  when you announc some modif   if the fomc agre   about these facil and the pdcf  it is veri import that the congress be given serious respons for this   it has been veri easi for them to critic  on the one hand  and to whisper to us all their support  on the other   i think they need to be given veri import homework assign in term of what they can do  june                  of     some form of fdicia with invest bank might be one exampl   wrestl about these issu in term of regulatori organ strike me as veri consequenti   even if we could convinc ourselv that we have all the regulatori author to figur this out with our regul  we would be better off  when we are readi and we have the right answer in our own view  to bring it to the congress for final clariti and to get their imprimatur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i agre with a lot of what governor   said and a lot of what has been said befor   let me just take a slight differ tack answer the question that governor kohn rais   whi are we here   part of that is  becaus of the glass steagal act  we have this unusu structur in the unit state   other central bank can provid credit much more easili to a wide varieti of institut   we have a legaci that creat this separ  which isn   t as strong in most other countri   in continent europ  for exampl  you just don   t realli see this   then  we have built a regulatori regim that help to promot that   rememb  the discuss have been about market and the challeng in the market   well  i think our regulatori regim  not just in the unit state but throughout the world  help promot the disintermedi to promot greater relianc on the market   in certain way this is a veri good thing  but it creat exact the kind of problem and challeng that we are face now  i think we need to be mind of that and take that into account when we are think about what to do next in deal with these issu   think about market resili and market infrastructur is crucial  but we also have to be mind that  if we tri to get thing to migrat to the exchang  to clearinghous  et cetera  it is great for us as regul  and it is also use becaus the inform is much more central   but it also could creat market dynam  as june                  of     presid   said  that could lead to tri to get around that   then the riski stuff goe otc  the riski stuff is in new institut that we haven   t thought of yet   presid   mention some other institut   we can mention hedg fund and money market mutual fund  but in five year there may be institut that we haven   t even thought about   no matter what structur we set up  there would be way to tri to get around it   so we need to think about a regulatori regim that get the cost and benefit right to make the differ relev institut not bridl too much at be part of it and so to rethink the financi hold compani structur  if the invest bank had found the financi hold compani structur an amen one  then we wouldn   t be here either becaus we would have solv the glass steagal legaci problem   but we haven   t quit done that  so actual exact as governor   was say   and believ it or not  we didn   t coordin beforehand   i think that we should think about how to revis our general regulatori structur to get more institut under this umbrella  not have them find it scari  upset  or disturb but to see that we are do it in a reason cost   benefit way   i can see just in all the issu that we have been face regard some capit relief in particular circumst   so call       relief on particular type of transact  issu of what   s includ in the definit of a leverag ratio   i think it give us an opportun to rethink whi so mani institut find it oner and are so lack in desir to be part of this regim   obvious  there is some regulatori competit   presid    i think  brought that up   so we need to think of that as a whole   this is part of the homework assign that the congress need to think about   set up a reason fdicia like regim for a broader set of institut that would choos to come and be regul by the fed  june                  of     we have been talk about where the bright line are   but if we okay someon to be a financi hold compani  then they becom part of our regim in the exist structur   so the line aren   t complet care drawn   it realli is sort of a cost   benefit analysi if someon choos to appli   so we need to think about that care and about the cost and benefit of get peopl in becaus the long term dynam will be that peopl alway tri to get away from regul unless they see that there is some suffici benefit   be veri mind of that  both from the institut context and the broader context of the market  is veri import   thank you
oh  and i apolog   i fulli support go ahead with extend the facil past the year end   i would make sure that it   s a bit more than just immedi past year end and go some  e into februari so there are no question about year end
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i also strong support the short term strategi that was laid out by the chairman   i don   t see that we realli have an altern in that context   there are a lot of issu here   the realiti is that this is super complex  and we have a lot of work over the next year to be readi for the next administr  when all these issu are go to becom extrem relev  in general term  regard the long term issu  although we got here under exig circumst  in a financi disrupt  we might have gotten here anyway   the realiti is that there was a fundament chang in the way the financi system work   when bank are not so domin  the distinct between invest bank and commerci bank in term of the way the financi system work is realli much less   it would be nice to think that we could limit the june                  of     kind of lend facil that we have so that we didn   t have to worri about regul or supervis other institut  but i don   t think that is realist   the natur of the chang in the financi system mean that we extend the govern safeti net but it probabl would have been extend anyway   it was just unfortun that it had to happen in such a crisi atmospher  so i think we have to think veri hard about the issu of limit moral hazard in term of a much wider rang of institut  i am veri sympathet to the issu that presid  n rais  which is that we have to think about the kind of thing that we have thought about more in term of the bank industri  how do we actual set thing up so that it is easier for firm to fail and not be system   there are a smaller number of firm that we actual have to supervis and regul  and the realiti is that we have to think veri hard about how we   re go to extend regul and supervis to a wider rang of firm   we just can   t escap that   it would be nice to say that we could limit it  but we are not go to be abl to limit it except to the extent that we can think about some of these issu   but it is go to be a huge issu go forward  and we realli have to be readi to deal with the polit process  the way we are proceed make a lot of sens   it is not commit us in a way that creat a problem  but we have to be readi when this issu is dealt with   it will be one of the hottest issu that the next administr and the next congress will have to deal with   we have to be realli on point and to have posit veri care thought out  not just by the board but by the entir fomc and the entir system  so that we can have a unifi posit to make sure that crazi stuff  sn   t happen and that sensibl stuff     thank you
thank you   vice chairman
i obvious support the strategi laid out   i just want to underscor  particular in respons to governor     s comment  that this is in effect a condit extens  in the sens that we are be care to get ourselv more comfort with where these four firm in particular are on capit and liquid befor we announc an extens   we are tri to get clariti on the ongo supervisori relationship with the sec befor we announc an extens   we have alreadi gotten the    major dealer in the world to commit themselv to a path to improv the capac of the otc deriv infrastructur to withstand failur befor announc   we have alreadi begun to get the resourc held against default risk in the exist central counterparti higher  in satisfact of presid  n   s general admonit that we want the system better abl to withstand failur   i think we are just begin the delic process of take some of the air out of the vulner tri parti repo befor the extens is announc   so  in that sens  we have left ourselv in this strategi that the chairman laid out with a littl less vulner to the possibl impress that we would just willi nilli extend with no effort to make the system safer   we are not go to get far enough  we are not go to know what   s far enough   but i think we have a credibl plan to say     we took the initi  even in a moment of incred delicaci for deal with the system  to tri to get these institut and the system in a better capac to withstand the possibl of failur     in that sens it   s a defens and sensibl strategi  i realli don   t know what the right mix of boundari is on access to liquid in normal  e and in extremi and what mix of supervisori author condit with what type of resolut regim is op    i just don   t have a sens   i feel as though i know the broad tradeoff in it  but i don   t know what realli look ideal in term of the mix of those thing   you can make a pretti reason case for a whole bunch of varianc in that mix of thing   the june                  of     complic for us is that we won   t be abl to fulli control the outcom becaus it is go to requir legisl   part of the consequ of the system that we live with and part of the reason that we live with the system we have today is that policymak and regul don   t fulli control the outcom in term of the incent creat in the legisl for these kind of thing  so it will be difficult for us  but all we can do is focus on the merit  think through those ahead of everybodi els  and tri to have the best packag of suggest that we can  but just to come back to what we spent most of the last two day talk about  let   s not lose sight of the fact that we are in the middl of this still   it like has a long way to go   it is veri hard for us to know now what we are go to decid at the end was the most critic sourc of vulner and  therefor  what to do to fix it   we don   t know what the market is go to think the new equilibrium should be in term of the return on equiti across differ type of financi institut and model   anoth reason to be care as we tri to contain the risk in this crisi and make the system stronger in the near term is so that we don   t prejudg some of those longer term question   thank you
thank you   presid
i want to come back to one of governor     s comment  just probe it a littl further  becaus i was intrigu by his notion that in some way tri to wean ourselv from this he suggest that we rais the price   it occur to me in that same context  if we thought that had valu in some sens  anoth way we could do the transit is to cut back either the frequenc or the size of the tslf  as we sort of wean the market off access   announc both those thing in advanc might have some valu to us move forward   i want to hear other peopl   s thought and reaction
first  i complet agre that  onc we get to the point at which we believ the best polici is to dial this stuff back and transit to a world in which they don   t exist  we are go to want to look at a whole bunch of thing   chang term  chang the relat attract across the auction facil  think about size  and think about price   i think that will be veri import to do   it is veri unlik that the op  path is go to be that there is a cliff   one day they are there  and the next day they aren   t   so i complet agre with that  my own judgment is   but it may not be right  and it could chang over  e   that for the moment we want to have a clean  crisp signal   better to say that we are go to extend in the context of these broader initi to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter their term and relat attract   but we are go to have to think veri care over the fall  condit permit  and well ahead of whatev the new date is  what the desir exit strategi is in chang incent around use  howev  my basic sens is not now  not yet  part becaus of the complex of the signal you are send and the difficulti of how it will be interpret   we have done all this stuff in part becaus we are tri to address a complic mix of thing around incent  stigma  and that kind of thing   it is hard for us to predict what the effect would be   it purpos is to wean  but to do it now would make the messag a bit more complic   if the world is strong enough that you can wean them now  whi are you extend   so my basic sens is  absolut  we are go to have to figur it out by the transit  not quit yet but well ahead of februari    or whenev it is go to be
yes   i support governor     s suggest for rais the price   it is hard for me to believ that confid in ani of these institut depend materi on     basi point of the price   it is the access  the fund  that they would be abl to use to fund withdraw or flight by somebodi   i think it send the right signal that we view this as except   condit are certain differ than they were in march  when we design and implement it  and i think they are unlik in the fall to be anywher close to where they were on march      you might disagre  and we could alway chang thing between now and then  but i like the signal of withdraw the generos just a tad
rememb that we are do moral suasion as well   i mean  we are not realli allow invest bank to use this as a profit center   so i   m not quit sure what the margin effect would be on incent
but this would also place less weight on moral suasion to discourag and would use the price system a bit
it also might increas the stigma   it is a veri complic calcul
there are mani thing that i would love to do   i would like to make them pay for it and say that we are not go to extend it unless they pay for it   i would like to say that we are not go to extend it unless they pre fund some liquid facil for one of their littl counterparti   there are a million thing that i think would be good to do from an incent angl   but not at the same  e that we are tri to maxim the chanc that we get through this and have the flexibl to let monetari polici adjust to the chang amount of risk on the other side of the tail   so there are a million thing i think it would be cool to do  and we will have to do them   we will design them realli in a clever way june                  of     onc we are at the point where that is op   but i just don   t think that   s now   the risk is that it will undermin what we are tri to achiev with a fleet    make us feel better    benefit
thank you  mr  chairman   so just on behalf of the troublemak caucus   laughter  let me make a suggest   it  sn   t strike me as though the delta between vice chairman     s formul and what i proffer are that larg   that is  i think we collect agre that we need  as part of an extens of the facil  to ensur that there is a suit of facil and self help effort   tri parti repo  otc deriv  principl by you  and clariti on what the horizon look like   i guess the onli question is  at the  e that you solicit the notat vote and announc this   let   s say that is the second half of juli   how comfort are we at how that packag look to suggest that we are keep option open and that the signal we are send is not that this is a busi that we want to stay in forev   mayb in that context we will see what kind of progress we are make in truth on some of those infrastructur improv and in the narrat  so that we can revisit   i think mayb with some guidanc from    bill  and the staff   what the increment benefit are of a modest chang to the pdcf in that context   by the second half of juli  we might find that we are much more inform so as to weigh the benefit and cost of it
bill    did you have a comment
the real issu may be that the pdcf borrow may be de minimi   in that environ  it   s not realli clear what rais the price realli mean   it might even be confus to peopl if you rais the price at the  e the borrow was de minimi   so i think that is just one consider
okay   if there are no other press comment  thank you veri much for this discuss   i heard general support for the short term strategi  which mean  i hope  that if we do come to ask you for an extens of the tslf we can do it by notat vote without a videoconfer meet  unless thing chang  there clear is a lot of dissatisfact among all of us about the ad hoc natur of the way we had to deal with the crisi in march   we would all like much more clariti about our author  the limit of those author  and the match between our respons and our author  and  as we go forward  we will tri to get clarif on that   at the same  e  we also want to take step to tri to increas the resili of the system and reduc the risk that we will be in the same situat again in the futur  i will tri to vet my speech   i don   t want to overpromis   it has to be done over the fourth of juli weekend  so i expect everyon to be avail      for commentari    laughter  but i will general be talk about thing that we are do   i will talk onli in general term about some of the principl that we have discuss today about the need for clarif about how to resolv a troubl institut  how to set those limit  and so on   but i will tri to circul that  to the extent that it is feasibl  let   s see  our next meet is tuesday  august     you are invit to get lunch and come back to the tabl to hear la  blanchard   s updat on congression matter   if you have ani revis to your econom project  you have until      p m  tomorrow to send those in   and i want to thank   i haven   t done this   art  scott  pat  and all of their colleagu  who have been work veri hard on these issu  for their present and their hard work   the meet is adjourn  end of meet june                  of
