without object   messr  kohn and
thank you  mr  chairman     and i thought it best to begin with a discuss of the basic longer run approach to this question of how to reconfigur the system   s asset as the treasuri debt is paid down   then subsequ and separ we will go on to consider of specif choic the committe must             make at this meet concern the manag of the system   s portfolio for the period immedi ahead   as background for the first round of discuss  i will summar what i take to be the main issu in the background paper you receiv  lead to the question   and i pose for the committe at the end of our cover memo   after your discuss of these issu    will address short run strategi   as you can tell from both the physic and intellectu heft of the studi  these were major undertak that requir consider work and imagin   owe to space constraint we could fit onli one of the team leader from each paper at the tabl  but the other are sit behind me     and i want to thank the team leader  as well as all the other from around the feder reserv system who were on the team that prepar these paper  for their consider contribut   the team leader are avail to answer your question after my present and befor you   ve had a general discuss of the longer run issu   i think the first import point to highlight  evid in the paper you saw last fall from the team led by tom simpson  is that the issu cannot be put off for much longer   under a wide varieti of assumpt about the growth of the economi and the polit process  treasuri debt will be repaid over come year   even if the entir on budget surplus is use in tax cut and new spend  debt will be close to extinguish in    year under a fair conserv assumpt of       percent trend econom growth   meanwhil  the treasuri market will becom increas illiquid  ul  for rp as well as outright transact  especi consid that mani of these secur are held by investor who will be loath to give them up even at elev price premium   as the debt dwindl  the system will probabl want to be gradual reduc it relianc on it   this cours will be necessari to insur that some of our portfolio is in other more liquid asset and to be help to the treasuri in manag the paydown of debt and maintain liquid market segment as long as possibl   inde  if there is a public good aspect to the exist of a treasuri market  the system would be perform a public servic by run it portfolio down fa  than the treasuri was repay debt  depend in part on your short run decis  the need to make major chang in the system   s asset   not come immedi  as   will be discuss   but under most probabl scenario it aris soon enough to suggest the necess of continu the process of examin longer run altern               a second point appar in all the paper is that there are no easi  obvious solut to the problem of what asset to hold under this circumst   all option seem to have signific drawback   some peopl have propos continu to reli on treasuri secur  even as the debt is paid down  by acquir them through special arrang with the treasuri or the social secur trust fund   while the system would be abl to continu to hold risk free govern asset  such plan themselv do rais a number of question   they would transfer the problem of possibl accumul privat asset to anoth part of the govern that may not be as well equip to deal with it   they would leav the feder reserv with a portfolio of illiquid asset as the treasuri market disappear  and they would make the central bank depend on agreement with the rest of the govern for it asset   of cours  the altern of take on privat oblig rais other issu  includ those involv with potenti effect on privat credit alloc and the manag of risk and liquid in the system   s portfolio that were outlin in the paper on principl by chris cum and jack beeb   the import point rais in that paper and emphas in the note from   and me was the imposs of satisfi all the system s goal at onc  and henc the inevit of make tradeoff along a number of dimens of portfolio manag   a key tradeoff would be between minim the effect of system portfolio choic on relat asset price on the one hand  and minim risk and maxim liquid on the other   a broad diversifi portfolio  which includ credit to financi intermediari hold nonmarket asset  would have the greatest chanc of exert as littl influenc as possibl on privat credit decis   with such a portfolio  the system would have a low profil in each market and it would not be favor one type of asset over anoth   but the system would be acquir riskier and less liquid asset  and it would be assum the respons to manag those asset   as the paper on open market asset by sandi krieger and   madigan make clear  ventur into new market and asset will entail a number of manag challeng in addit to those involv with credit risk   these includ deal with new clear and settlement procedur and with new counterparti   at the other end of the spectrum  if the committe chose to concentr oper in a small subset of market that promis the least credit risk and the greatest liquid  for exampl those for gse secur or a  p  commerci paper  it would increas the odd on eventu affect relat asset price               the manag of liquid itself will offer a number of choic and complex   the system need a portfolio that can be adjust at the margin without affect market price  but not all asset in our portfolio need the same degre of liquid   some of the asset must be capabl of be increas or decreas in size on a given day or over just a few day to meet regular daili reserv need and the rare requir to add or drain substanti volum of reserv on an emerg basi   but a larg portion of the portfolio need never be adjust on short notic and can be roll over or ad to slowli without ever be run off or sold and henc can consist of veri illiquid asset   and there are various degre of requir adjust in between these two extrem  for exampl  to meet season currenc flow   liquid can be obtain by hold asset with activ secondari market  but some degre of liquid will also flow from have frequent matur of otherwis illiquid asset coupl with mean of expand or contract hold as need upon matur as  for exampl  in rp transact or discount window credit auction   the open market asset paper and the discount window paper by craig hakkio and   lang look at altern asset and techniqu to help to find opportun and tradeoff as the system move beyond treasuri secur   as both paper brought out  no one market or direct the system can go probabl is of suffici size or liquid to replac treasuri secur entir without have an import effect on relat asset price   both paper identifi some approach the committe might want to explor further as element in an overal strategi   taken togeth these paper rais some issu that we list in the form of question at the end of the   kohn paper  and i will repeat those question here in somewhat expand and modifi form   sever question revolv around diversif   should the system tri to identifi individu asset market in which it could oper with low risk  high liquid  and relat mute effect on asset price or should it move as a matter of strategi toward a fulli diversifi portfolio   there are individu market that would allow you consider scope to substitut for treasuri secur while maintain mani of the aspect of your current portfolio  diversif on the other hand would make clear that you place high weight on not favor one market or borrow over anoth   if the system move toward diversif  should it attempt to get there soon and direct  say through the use of mutual fund  or should it adopt an increment approach oper first in the most access market with the most easili adapt techniqu   as the system diversifi  to what extent should it reli on it own risk             manag and to what extent can it outsourc risk manag under the overal guidanc of the committe   whether you choos a fulli diversifi portfolio or not  anoth question is  what should be the relat role of temporari oper and perman addit to the portfolio   outright oper will tend to have a more direct impact on asset price and could involv the system in difficult choic about which asset or market to oper in   temporari oper have a number of attract attribut   they work through intermediari and to some extent the credit alloc decis can be left to the intermediari rather than the central bank   risk is reduc becaus the central bank look first to the intermediari for repay  can adjust haircut  and in the event of default can fall back on the final borrow whose paper has been use as collater for a discount window loan or purchas in an rp   and the liquid of temporari transact can be tailor to system need by have them matur frequent   but exclus or veri heavi relianc on rps or discount window loan may also distort the financi system by favor those intermediari with access  by potenti affect the liabil structur of the intermediari  and by indirect distort credit alloc by help those borrow that reli on the favor intermediari   if you decid to util a larg volum of temporari transact  a further question is  what proport should be rps transact in open market and what proport should be loan made at the discount window   rp market outsid those alreadi use by the feder reserv are for the most part rudimentari  though they are like to develop more if the feder reserv begin to use them   discount window loan could be made in size  but especi heavi use would requir more system resourc to be devot to collater manag   and it might rais some issu at the intersect of lend and supervis in addit to the potenti for skew credit alloc toward depositori and their custom   so how do you view the discount window altern and what addit inform do you requir to evalu them   more broad  are there ani particular avenu or procedur that look more promis than other and how should you proceed to explor them   final  the committe might want to address the question of how to involv the public in the ongo consider of these issu   the minut of this meet along with the chairman s upcom tes oni will cover this subject in one form or anoth  and the outcom of your short run decis may veri well also entail public discuss and comment     the committe see             other step that should be taken to advanc the public   s understand   that conclud my introductori remark  mr  chairman   as i note earlier  the studi   s author are besid me and behind me  i m surround by them   we d be happi to take question about ani of the individu studi or the overal summari
i would also suggest that we combin comment with question   member should not feel inhibit in their remark  think that all they should do at this point is to ask question   that s unlik to work in ani event  presid broaddus
i   d like to comment  mr  chairman   i want to make a pitch for tri to arrang with the treasuri a way for us to stay with invest in treasuri secur onli   it will take me a few minut to do this  but i ll tri to keep my remark as brief as i can   in my view this is a realli import issu that goe to the heart of our institut posit in the govern and also to our abil to conduct monetari polici effect over the longer run  i would begin my remark by suggest that we think about how fortun we have been over the year to be abl to pursu a    treasuri onli    polici  or at least approxim treasuri onli  for so long   as the beeb cum studi recogn  a treasuri onli polici alon among the altern that are be consid and suggest on this issu satisfi all four principl that are laid out in that paper with respect to how we should guid our portfolio select   such a polici would allow us to maintain instrument independ  minim credit alloc and distort to relat price  maintain essenti liquid and credit qualiti  and provid appropri transpar and account              i would underscor the benefit of treasuri onli as follow   monetari polici basic determin the quantiti of the monetari base and as a byproduct the aggreg volum of feder reserv credit that we will extend   the beauti of treasuri onli  as i see it  is that it has allow the govern as a whole to implement monetari polici by essenti buy back interest bear govern debt and replac it with the liabil of the central bank   consequ  and this is the key point  neither the fed nor the govern as a whole for that matter has had to invest in ani privat asset to conduct monetari polici or to make the potenti veri difficult choic among privat asset that might have to be made if we consid these other altern  now  of cours  we face a situat where the outstand stock of treasuri debt may disappear   i think this present the fed with a huge problem becaus all of the altern approach avail to us  that is  the other asset that are be consid  will involv us to one degre or anoth in decis about alloc credit across particular sector of the privat economi   some of you may recal that at the march meet last year i argu that credit alloc would inevit embroil us over  e in polit charg decis that could undermin our independ and the effect of monetari polici   and i urg that befor we go down the path of these other altern we at least consid the possibl of persuad the fiscal author to continu to issu suffici govern debt to allow us to stay with the treasuri onli approach   i believ we still ought to do that and i ask you just to consid it  a treasuri onli option is sketch out briefli on page    of chris cum   s and jack beeb   s studi   let me briefli summar it   the idea is that even if continu surplus were to permit the treasuri to stop issu debt  the treasuri             would continu to issu debt for the fed to buy in order to replac matur debt alreadi on our balanc sheet and to provid for secular growth in the monetari base   note here  and i think this is an import point  that this debt would be costless to the treasuri sinc we would be remit to the treasuri the interest on the debt we would buy   the question of short term cyclic need for increas in the monetari base would still remain  and it might be that we would need to satisfi those need by purchas liquid  low risk privat asset in the form  say  of rps   but sinc the acquisit of privat asset in that case would be self revers and relat limit in size  it would involv the fed onli minim in credit alloc   i don t think it would rais the kind of issu and concern that a more fundament chang would  now  i know that when you first hear this propos it seem emin dismiss    laughter   a lot of question come up and a lot of object can be rais  and don has alreadi cite some of those   but let me address a coupl of them  the first question is   isn t this propos just a way for the fed to shift the burden of invest in privat asset  if we have to do that in this new world  from itself to the treasuri   well  this propos would respect the integr of the fiscal policymak process by leav all fiscal decis to the fiscal author  congress and the treasuri  which would protect the fed s independ   the key point here  though  is that the govern wouldn t have to accumul asset with the revenu it would get from sell secur to the fed   it would simpli be the revenu that the govern get from the seigniorag tax  that is  from the act of creat money  and i think that s an import point   the govern could use this revenu to perman reduc other tax or to increas expenditur   that cover one question               a second question  close relat to the first  is whether the govern as a whole shouldn t take advantag of the at least relat polit independ of the feder reserv to let us acquir the asset and make the choic among these privat asset   presum  we would be subject to less potenti polit interfer than other part of the govern   this question i think is more like to be ask by peopl who feel our independ is secur rather than by peopl like me who think it is inher fragil   in my view the answer to this question is the same as the answer to the first question   it is not necessari for the govern to acquir privat asset perman in order to conduct monetari polici   i doubt that mani peopl around this tabl would think it s a good idea  just on the face of it  for the govern to buy and hold privat asset   if not  then i believ we should be wari of let the fed be the instrument for do that   and that s one of the reason whi i think we need to adopt the treasuri onli propos serious  but what about some of the altern approach like expand use of the discount window discuss by craig hakkio and   lang in their paper  or the expand use of rps not onli for short term liquid purpos but to meet the secular need for increas in the base   let me make a few comment about each of those  with respect to discount window loan  at first blush that appear to be an attract altern   we have the author without seek new legisl to expand our use of the window in implement monetari polici   and in principl we could increas our discount window lend from the relat small amount that s on our book now to sever hundr billion dollar   presum  as i think craig   s and     s paper recogn  we would need to restrict our lend to bank with camel rate of                and     also  we probabl would want to limit our lend to ani particular bank to a prudent fraction of that bank s capit and we would want to back our loan with good collater   i think we could start out down this road success   but let s recogn that this would be a profound chang in the way we do thing   it would make the fed a major  continu creditor to hundr of depositori institut instead of an infrequ lender to particular institut   what worri me under this propos regim is  what do we do if a bank to which we have extend substanti credit get into serious troubl   in my view that would put us in a veri difficult situat  presum  we would want our portfolio to be public knowledg   i think transpar is essenti in establish account for our portfolio   it is hard for me to see that we would not be forc to make our portfolio transpar if we went in this direct   but in that situat if we pull a loan becaus of the deterior in a bank s condit  that action would signal public that the bank has signific difficulti  current we don t public camel rate  so this would be a fair radic chang in our supervisori approach to safeti and sound  hypothet  even if we didn t make the composit of our loan public  it seem inevit that if we pull a loan to a sizabl institut  the market would quick detect it   my real worri is that in such a situat we would be unwil to pull the loan   wors  troubl bank would tend to replac lost uninsur fund with discount window loan  which is what has happen histor   it has happen in today   s world   but sinc our loan would be back by much of a bank s good collater  this would great increas the exposur of the fdic  and potenti taxpay  to loss when a bank ul  fail               in sum  if we great expand our discount window lend  we will put ourselv even more in the middl of contenti issu surround the potenti resolut of the problem of a troubl bank   we ve had that happen histor   if we go to this kind of approach  i think we will have it in spade   the kind of difficulti we could encount in this regim would be bad enough in the case of an individu troubl bank  but they could be quit damag if we face ani kind of general bank crisi   i think it could threaten our independ and our abil to conduct monetari polici independ   so i believ that deal with our portfolio problem by expand discount window lend would be a mistak  let me turn now to rps and then i will be finish   i appreci your patienc  expand the use of rps would not rais some of the issu that expand discount window lend would rais   rps are self liquid  which would allow us to exit problem bank situat more quiet if they aris   and we could do rps on a wide varieti of asset with appropri haircut   so at first blush it look as if rps might be the way to go   but expand use of rps to support the secular growth in the monetari base is distinct differ from the use of rps to deal with the short run problem that i mention earlier   to use them in a long term way would still be problemat  i think  first  while rps would rais fewer obvious credit alloc issu than some of the other altern that are be consid  over  e there is a good chanc that polit pressur on the system would adjust to this chang   and we could find ourselv deal with polit problem in credit alloc issu with respect to rps as well as with some of the other altern that are on the tabl here   beyond this  though  there is one other less obvious but i think veri import problem with the rp              altern  name  that precis becaus of the desir properti of rps that i just list  they pay a relat low return   rememb that in this situat the return would be the govern   s revenu for money creation   so if we went to rps becaus of their nice properti from the fed   s standpoint  essenti we would be limit the govern   s revenu from money creation   in essenc  we would be use a larg part of this revenu to buy liquid servic and to protect ourselv  the fed  that is  from credit and price risk  therebi deni the rest of the govern the use of these fund for whatev other purpos it want to use them  this last point  in my view  is the answer to one other object mention in the studi to the treasuri onli propos   the concern was that becaus the treasuri would be do us a favor in some sens by allow us to continu with the treasuri onli approach  they would demand some sort of quid pro quo   now  if it were understood that perhap arguabl the most feasibl altern to treasuri onli  name the rp altern  would be cost to the govern  then it would be in the narrow budgetari interest of the fiscal author to prefer that we stay with the treasuri onli approach   so in that instanc a quid pro quo wouldn   t be necessari   have said that  i recogn that argu this point and get it across to other elsewher in the govern would be challeng   but in my mind it   s a valid point and i think we should tri to make it  well  that is basic my argument and i appreci your patienc   let me list quick the four main point i ve tri to make   first  there is no need for the fed or the govern to acquir privat asset  except mayb temporarili  to implement monetari polici   second  i believ it is feasibl for the fed to follow a treasuri onli polici with              the cooper of the treasuri even if the treasuri has no other reason to issu debt  third  it wouldn   t cost the govern anyth to provid debt for the fed to buy  final  with respect to the rp altern  the govern would forgo revenu if the fed held a portfolio of veri safe and liquid but low yield privat rps   so from that perspect it would be in the interest of the fiscal author to cooper with the fed in a treasuri onli approach   i know that push this propos is a hard idea to get use to   but look at the disadvantag and problem associ with the other altern  i find the argument for at least tri to do that compel   and i hope we will consid do it   thank you
in your scheme  what   the treasuri do with our payment to them for their debt
they  of cours  would be pay interest to us and we simpli would be turn around and pay it back to them
the issu basic is that they have to invest the proceed from our purchas in someth els
as i see it  they first sell their secur in the market  we buy them in the market  they are not sell direct to us   so that would be the form in which they would take the fund
it  sn t matter how it   s done
they take in revenu and it could be use for whatev purpos they want
but the issu  in the context we   re talk about  is that if the debt to the public is down to zero  they have to accumul privat asset
may i answer that pleas
i m sorri to interrupt  i know this is unusu   the revenu for money creation could be regard as basic the result  on a secular basi  of the grow demand for real currenc balanc that the public want to hold   if one regard the revenu for money creation  which is some  call seigniorag  as a tax flow just like ani other tax that the govern receiv on a year basi
money is fungibl  i understand that   it s not that i object to what presid broaddus is say  i m just ask a question   there are two regim  one in which we accumul privat sector asset and one in which we don t   in the regim that you re suggest there is doubl entri bookkeep   my question is   what appear on the asset side of the u s  govern s balanc sheet  sinc by hypothesi we are stipul that there is zero debt to the public  it mean the treasuri can t pay off debt   therefor  if they hold a liabil  they must hold an asset  what is the asset
well  the asset in the short run is probabl some privat asset   but over  e adjust could be made that would take that off the book
the onli way to do that is to run a govern deficit  spend it
they can basic rebat it as a tax refund immedi or
that s right
those are the two altern
the govern would not accumul privat asset  the fund would just flow right through
that s right
the govern never acquir debt   it just rebat it right back to the public instantan
yes  but then that alter the view that we re in surplus  sever   right
that   s right  there is no surplus
one could argu that it is better from our point of view to have the credit alloc process be in the hand of the feder govern than in the hand of the feder reserv   but it is difficult to get around the fact that there is an alloc process go on in the consolid monetari author system  given the account process   what is it about that statement that   s not true
the main issu is that we can provid the public
let me stipul someth veri import  which is that the govern balanc in term of deficit surplus is the same in the two regim   the onli differ is who is hold which asset   if you consolid the feder reserv into the system  then there is a uniqu solut   the onli issu occur when you disassoci the feder reserv from the author   if you   re assum a unifi budget  obvious  that   creat a chang in the balanc sheet   i   m onli say that in this context if we don   t purchas  or through rps acquir  privat instrument  somebodi els has to   there   s no way of get around that
that   s certain true given your assumpt about the rest of the govern   s fiscal posit   presid broaddus   s point is that no one in the govern need to acquir privat asset to implement monetari polici
nobodi disagre with you on that
okay   then if one of our goal is to minim privat asset acquir by the govern  we could make that understood by the rest of the govern  in which case they would do with the money what governor   is say   tax
mean  lower their surplus and refund
think of it as a    money rain    everi day
excus my interject   i thought i had a veri quick question with a simpl answer   i didn   t mean to get into this   the vice chair has preemptiv right
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make a quick comment on the issu we just discuss befor i go into what i had intend to say   as long as the busi cycl exist  i think there will be  e when the govern will and should be in surplus   and there are  e when the govern will and probabl should be in deficit   i hope that  sn   t brand me as a keynesian  which certain i   m not  but i think that   s how the account work   there will be  e  therefor  as your tes oni last week indic extrem well  when some entiti in the govern will be accumul asset   for the feder reserv to say    not us     and then plan to have a particular palsi relationship with the treasuri in order to avoid that              entiti be the feder reserv  i think is ill advis public polici   i doubt that it would be a veri good idea to encourag the invidi notion of social secur or ani other part of the u s  govern be in the busi of hold privat asset  there would be the temptat  and human would sure succumb to temptat as they have sinc the fall of adam  for polit meddl in the privat sector   i think we should avoid that in ani way that we possibl can  let me direct myself now to some of the question that don rais   one involv the relat merit of a high diversifi portfolio versus a portfolio whose princip attract would be a greater degre of liquid   i think that dichotomi is base in it extrem on the notion that our hold of market asset are of such a size that if we have a larg posit in a more diversifi group of asset  we would realli be move the market and  therefor  have a slight but still signific effect on the relat price of asset   i believ the degre to which we have a relat small portion of a diversifi but liquid portfolio make that dichotomi less than complet   so i think we need to studi this more   how much can we diversifi the portfolio and still keep it liquid   how do we achiev both goal   to me the size of our hold is the key to answer that question  as regard the balanc between outright transact and rps  i think we   ve had it about right over  e   when we have a perman need to add to reserv  we do it through outright purchas   the question is  outright purchas of what   thus far the experi we   ve had on the tradeoff between outright transact and rps indic that the process is work veri well  and therefor it should be a guid to how we would continu to oper in the futur               as for the use of the discount window for monetari polici purpos  it seem to me that we should look at the present situat and differenti between two aspect of the feder reserv   s respons   one is our primari respons  which is monetari polici   anoth  although not the onli other  is our respons for the safeti and sound of the financi system  particular the commerci bank system  given our role as bank supervisor   that   s especi true sinc the passag of the gramm leach bliley bill  which give us even broader respons as umbrella supervisor of financi hold compani  let me note one of the good thing about the present system  especi if we could attain governor     s goal of move the discount rate to a penalti rate   a penalti rate would be much more consist with the way the discount rate should be use than it is now  where by histor accid it is below the fed fund rate   use the discount window with a penalti rate is veri consist with the feder reserv   s approach to bank supervis   and that approach is that we expect banker to be good banker   we reward them for be good banker by allow them to do certain thing if they   re well capit   and we punish them rather sever  includ by formal action  if they   re not such good banker   i speak with consider experi  have been the risk manag and the financi manag of a larg bank hold compani  when i say that if liquid is readili avail at the discount window  it would be easi  even in a well manag bank  to succumb to the temptat to borrow   now  the fact that there is a temptat   not mean that everi bank has to be a sinner   there is temptat in the world and there are high virtuous peopl  mayb even saint   but again  human natur be what it is  i think there would be a tendenc for the              avail of the discount window at a relat low discount rate to interfer with sound manag of bank   bank might engag in less sound asset and liabil manag practic and less sound liquid manag   that   s not a conclus  it   s a question   if we  the committe and the board togeth  decid to move forward and serious consid the use of the discount window as an instrument of monetari polici to ani meaning degre  then i think we would have to expand the scope of the question we   ve been ask   and one question to includ would be this issu of the tradeoff between two of our respons   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i   d like to say that these paper were realli outstand and advanc our think along quit some distanc   i have some specif reaction to point rais in the paper and some broad reaction to the question that don ask   let me start by say that i certain do agre with the principl outlin in the beeb cum paper   of those  maintain our independ is the most import principl  i agre with al broaddus on that   in addit  we should do all we can not to subsid a sector of the economi or individu institut  but have said that and have read these paper  whatev our decis  some asset class or set of institut will benefit from our action   we know that   it is a matter of tradeoff  as bill   said   sinc some segment of the privat sector will be a beneficiari rather than the u s  govern  as is now the case  i think the decis   have serious implic for our independ   in addit  we may direct or              indirect end up affect relat asset valu and the alloc of credit across institut and sector of the economi  so  given the guid principl  how to proceed in choos the asset composit of the system   s balanc sheet is the primari issu   for me there are three implic to these principl and i want to mention them quick and then go into a littl more detail   first  i think we should conduct outright purchas of u s  govern secur for as long as possibl  i total agre with that   second  i think we should avoid outright purchas of ani privat sector secur   i am concern that put on our balanc sheet an asset issu by an ul  privat sector borrow would compromis our independ in that we would appear to be subsid a particular sector or institut   current the u s  govern is the most import ul  borrow on our balanc sheet   a third point is that we should deal with strong financi intermediari rather than with ul  privat sector borrow   financi intermediari put some      space     if i can use that term  between the ul  borrow and us   and basic i would prefer have secur on our balanc sheet that are issu by financi intermediari rather than secur issu by ul  privat sector borrow   by use intermediari we are one step remov from alloc credit  these view have implic that would lead me to the follow increment strategi   first  i   d increas our self impos limit on our hold of treasuri secur   i recogn that these limit were origin impos in order to minim the likelihood that we would affect relat asset price   but given my strong prefer that we hold treasuri secur rather than anyth els  i would accept that we may affect              some asset valu  that   s part of the tradeoff   second  i   d consid outright purchas of gnma mortgag back secur   gnma secur are back by the full faith and credit of the u s  govern  and i would avoid outright purchas of fanni mae and freddi mac   third  i   d begin the process necessari to implement the acf  the auction process for loan   with the acf we would be deal with strong financi intermediari   also the acf is similar to an rp in that the loan rate is determin in an open market auction   unlik an rp the asset on our balanc sheet is a loan to a strong depositori institut  not the actual secur use in the rp   and final  the acf would allow financi market  e to develop the benchmark secur on their own without our indirect influenc their decis   i realiz that we may in fact have problem institut  but i don   t think we would be trigger the public knowledg of that  that   s all public disclos now   it   s part of market disciplin   most of those have written agreement   i don   t think we will be trigger public disclosur of problem credit situat if we have to redirect our lend from asset involv problem credit  and fourth  i would continu to use rps as we do current  that is  as a mean to hit our intend fed fund rate target on a daili basi   i would not use rps to increas the size of our portfolio  i   d use the auction for that   use rps as a primari mean to increas the size of our portfolio would perman put privat asset on our balanc sheet  contrari to our principl  so in tri to see how we would move toward a process  and not to dismiss al broaddus   s propos becaus i think it   s interest  this is the increment approach i would follow   i believ it would allow us to achiev an order transit  as the              govern retir it debt  in a way that is most consist with the four principl that have been set forth   thank you for the  e
let me just say that i think we ought to stipul that the veri exist of a central bank  in and of itself  affect market
that is  as the central bank  we are a financi intermediari   and  although we   re not veri larg  as the vice chair point out  we do by the veri act of intermedi chang the level of interest rate  even though we probabl don   t chang the spread between privat and public secur in ani signific way  but i do think the crucial issu is the one rais by the vice chair  how signific is it  i say that becaus we   re all in general agreement  at least i suspect we are  that we wish to minim the impact we have on the privat sector   i think it   s crucial import to understand this  and i just want to make sure that we don   t start off with the presumpt that what we   re do right now is have zero effect   the mere exist of this institut has had an extraordinari impact
our goal in a sens is to tri to get through this transit without shock the system as we move toward hold differ type of asset   that   s whi i prefer this increment approach  which take us through a seri of asset that we might hold while increas  to the extent that is feasibl  the amount of our current hold   i think the acf is one avenu to a long term solut  although i recogn that the acf rais issu that need to be dealt with   but i   d hate to move toward complet relianc on rps or toward hold a particular type of agenc secur that would have a more narrow impact for the particular market or institut involv
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to start by reinforc tom hoenig   s comment and congratul the author of all of these studi  this is a subject that is almost total neglect in the academ literatur  as far as i know  and i note that there aren   t veri mani footnot refer   i think it   s import that we publish these paper as soon as we possibl can becaus we ought to get some academ discuss go   there are a lot of good mind out there and we ought to reli on their help  we may get some further insight   moreov  it would assist us in the discuss over the next few year of how to deal with this issu   so i would hope we could publish these paper  second  i think we all understand that the govern might chang it under fiscal polici so that this problem no longer exist   in fact  it   s not that difficult to imagin a combin of spend increas  tax cut  and a littl reduct in the long run growth es  such that this problem might not be with us    month from now   that is possibl   but for our discuss around the tabl today we ought to assum that it is go to exist   and  therefor  as much as i respect al broaddus    thought on this issu  if the under govern surplus continu and the govern debt disappear  some part of the feder establish is go to end up own some asset other than treasuri   so i think we should take that as the point of departur for the discuss  i would also rais a point that has not been mention but is veri worthwhil to think about   and that is that if the govern  the feder establish as a whole  end up as a creditor  what we do may set a pattern for what other part of the              govern do   one such exampl is social secur  where there is a go to be a larg block of asset  at least on paper  sit in the trust fund   so we need to consid that what we do may therefor have much greater influenc than just on our own situat  we   re go to be look to as an exampl for how to handl this issu for the govern more general   and that make it an even more serious issu for us  i think  my own think about this to date is that insofar as possibl we should reli on asset that carri the full faith and credit of government entiti and  of cours  that has been true with our focus on treasuri secur in the past   we have not talk veri much about state and local secur   the fiscal affair of the feder and state govern are thorough entangl alreadi becaus of the larg scale feder grant to state and municip   thus  my own prefer would be that we consid veri serious adopt a principl that our primari asset must carri the full faith and credit of a govern  which might be a state govern   that principl would have the advantag  i think  of be relat easi to understand and veri defens   and to my mind it   s a far better principl than one that say feder versus everyth els   becaus if the principl is feder versus other thing  we   re go to get into the gse question  which i think we ought to avoid   in my view it would be much  much better if we could accumul asset in the form of claim on state govern rather than claim on gses
there   s a limit to that  unfortun
i know there   s a limit becaus there is onli a finit amount of such asset in that market as well   nevertheless  it might be suffici in size  at least for a  e  for us to do what we might need to do   and it seem to me that it would be a better principl               as i understand the current project  assum some fiscal adjust this year  let   s say  that don   t elimin the problem  essenti the problem accumul to a maximum at about the  e when fund flow in the social secur system turn and the outlay exceed the incom revenu   that   s some  in the neighborhood of      to      depend on the number of peopl take retir at a certain age and that sort of thing   so the interv until then is general the period of maximum vulner or difficulti for us   onc the social secur system is sell off asset  our problem will becom a good bit easier  i think   and it could well be that with some fiscal adjust we could accumul some claim on state govern that would get us past the most difficult period   at ani rate  i would focus attent there to begin with  as the first resort  it also seem to me use to think about our portfolio  as i believ we are  as have a relat stabl  perman part and a trade  temporari  or whatev we want to call it  part that meet the cyclic and season need of the open market portfolio   i think the perman part of our hold could go into state govern secur  secur that carri the full faith and credit of a govern   they don   t have good secondari market  but they don   t realli need to for this purpos anyway   for the temporari part of the portfolio i think we   d want to be sure to use sever differ approach and diversifi  becaus we don   t know exact how this might work out   the two logic place to emphas for some expans in our short term hold would be the discount window and rps   but go entir one way or the other  i think  put us at an undu risk  should the approach we select turn out to have some problem that we              don   t forese or some problem that we know are there but turn out to be bigger than we now forese   thank you
thank you   let me also begin by compliment the staff on a veri excel set of paper   let me note  too  that i begin with a quit open mind   my view are like to chang sever  e today as well as over  e as we talk about this  what i want to do is to offer perhap a still differ perspect  so as to get a lot of differ idea on the tabl  i have been think a littl along the line of what presid pool discuss  in term of a multipl part strategi with two or three compon to it   the first compon involv option for provid for the secular growth of reserv and currenc  what we might call the perman part of the portfolio   the way i think about this is that i want to emphas the diversif principl here rather than liquid becaus this isn   t the part of the portfolio that we would be buy and sell   these asset are go to be accumul gradual and held  when i begin to think about the diversif notion  it encourag me to take the broadest possibl approach so that we have the smallest impact on individu market and the least possibl of affect credit alloc and relat interest rate   so  as oppos to start with state and local govern debt  i actual exclud that market becaus it is so small that we   d have to buy up the whole market to make even a dent   i took a much more radic approach   i ask myself what market we could oper in that would give us the opportun to be the least intrus and the most diversifi  with the least credit alloc effect   the answer  of cours  i   m sorri to say  is the equiti              market  which are valu at about     trillion   so we   d have a veri tini percent stake in that market   how would we do it   i would say that we could add to that the corpor bond market and the mortgag back secur market and focus on a strategi that is rule base and index focus   it would be veri difficult and veri challeng   but it would give us the opportun to have a      billion compon  or someth in that rang  that is just a piec of america    laughter   so  i throw that out on the tabl  actual  i purpos did not includ in that portfolio some of the more liquid asset becaus those are go to be part of my second compon  which is the short run portfolio or the liquid portfolio   these asset would be use for carri out the normal monetari polici stabil effort and for those occas that requir temporari inject or withdraw of liquid   we also have to be prepar for an occasion episod involv veri larg liquid increas or decreas  and that   s a particular challeng  for the second portfolio  to me the natur place to expand is in repurchas agreement and i   d do that by broaden the rang of accept collater   the staff has suggest extend the author for mortgag back secur and consid municip and foreign sovereign debt   that seem sensibl  but that   s not the direct i would have suggest   i would have thought immedi of commerci paper and high grade corpor debt becaus what i want to do is to ration the oper in agenc debt and mortgag back secur  and i   d do so by make sure that we also accept rps with collater against a broader rang of privat asset   and we can view those agenc as just anoth exampl of high grade privat asset               there are some other possibl as well besid rps   one would be buy and sell money market mutual fund share   we could also have a portfolio of gse bill and commerci paper  for exampl  that is shorter term like our treasuri bill portfolio   it would allow us to oper  to buy and sell  in that area depend upon the liquid and size of those market  a third compon of my think was an intermedi portfolio that would be use for meet season need when there are swing that are somewhat predict but can be sizabl   that would provid a complement to both our perman portfolio and our liquid portfolio   there i found the acf facil quit attract  but i   m not think about it as      to      billion in size   that   s a size where it becom problemat or could becom problemat for reason that some have alreadi suggest  i   m envis someth on the order of     to     billion   it has to have an averag size of about that amount so it could be run down if necessari  or built up  but never becom too sizabl a part of the portfolio  i also agre that we need an increment strategi here   we want to put off as long as possibl move into this veri broad diversifi portfolio becaus it rais so mani challeng   an infrastructur is requir  which is expens to put in place  and it subject us to polit risk as well   so the transit step do suggest that we should begin to think more about broaden the rang of collater for rps   we should also begin to consid  and even experi with  auction of discount window credit  moreov  we should continu to studi and evalu option and procedur  should we want to move ahead with broader diversif of the portfolio
thank you  mr  chairman   i actual find it veri difficult to address this issu in less than about a week and a half
tri to keep it down to a week  would you pleas    laughter
i also want to thank the peopl who put togeth the studi   there   s a lot of materi and some of it is close to my heart   it was veri well done  in my view  let me tri to restrict my comment at this moment to two point that seem central to this whole issu   those two point are the question of risk in the fed   s portfolio and the role of the discount window  notwithstand presid broaddus    perspect  i think the fed will have to accept the fact that asset other than treasuri are go to be part of it portfolio   that be the case  those asset are go to carri credit risk or counterparti risk  or both  the key is for the fed to ensur that appropri risk monitor and risk manag system are in place to deal with this type of risk in the soma portfolio   as you all know  this concept is not new   the financi sector as a whole has been build risk manag system in the last   to    year to monitor and manag it risk  and it   s also not new to the feder reserv system itself   we alreadi have in place a process develop by the subcommitte on credit  reserv  and risk manag  scrrm  for the system   s discount window borrow  and i think we would need to set up someth to monitor aggress what we do in regard to credit and counterparti risk  it   s rather straightforward to extend the type of risk manag procedur that alreadi exist on wall street and to a certain extent here at the fed   nevertheless  we should              rememb that the fed can and should impos high qualiti standard on it counterparti and on the asset it place in it portfolio so that in practic  on an oper level  the risk exposur can be set at a veri low level  hold asid for the moment the issu of whether we should oper in certain specif asset categori  the qualiti equival that seem sensibl to me are the top two grade or rate  whether we   re use camel or moodi   s rate   do outright transact in such asset is accept to me in principl  but rps do have addit secur   they have two main creditor and they also allow us to be somewhat more distant from individu issu   mortgag back secur have some attract for the same reason   they involv the back of more than one parti and  therefor  are in some sens more secur and less subject   rps and mortgag back secur are also attract becaus they don   t involv direct purchas of debt of individu firm and institut   and i think rps are less like to convey a sens of the fed   s imprimatur on ani institut or ani gse   i think in practic that   s where we are go to have to go  so we should probabl just face up to that  turn to the second issu  the discount window  i think the notion of a non administ credit facil is a nonstart   by contrast  the auction credit facil may be a use way for the fed to provid part of the base  in the perman portfolio peopl have been talk about  with an ongo cycl of credit advanc through an auction process   that would give us the base on which we can conduct standard open market oper on a daili basi   i think it might be use to start a small acf program as anoth discount window facil soon so that we can work on the mechan of how to              do it   whether we   re talk about an eventu size of      billion or     to     billion  i   d start off with    billion  get the mechan of it work  and see how it goe  there are number of reason whi i think this actual seem logic   first  depositori institut are in some sens competitor for direct market borrow and for the gses that we will implicit be support as we go into non treasuri debt   so expand the way we provid credit to the depositori institut as we expand the use of other debt instrument in the open market seem to me to help level the play field  i believ it   s a use way to proceed   if rps and or outright hold of differ type of debt are go to be among the altern we have for replac treasuri  then perhap we will need some way of broaden the fed   s capabl to provid credit to the depositori institut as well   anoth element that hasn   t been mention that i find rather intrigu is that it will also help to level the play field within the bank sector itself   larg and small bank can in fact enter the market to obtain fund  so this is go to be pro competit   mani in the bank communiti talk about the need for a fund base  and this would give smaller institut an opportun to particip through standard procedur at their local fed in a manner that would in fact increas their capabl to compet with the larger institut  at the end of the day  the acf is noth more than an altern mechan for provid fund   becaus it happen not to be a secur  we think about it as differ  but in mani respect through the acf we   re provid fund in much the same way we would with commerci paper or repo or ani of the other instrument we   ve discuss   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i believ this is an extraordinarili import discuss for us to be have   even if we didn   t have the prospect of treasuri surplus and the pay down of treasuri debt as the event forc us to consid this matter  in my view it is some  use to step back and think strateg about the asset side of our balanc sheet   the week befor last  our bank held a two day session  what we call a strateg plan exercis  to set goal and object for the next five year  as all the reserv bank regular do   at about the same  e i was wade through the     odd page of these soma studi and i was struck dure those two day of our plan exercis by how the focus of all the discuss was on the liabil side of our balanc sheet   peopl think veri care about that in the reserv bank  and they are good at it   they think about the ach  about analog and digit check system  fedwir  and on and on   we pay an enorm amount of attent to the liabil side and virtual zero to the asset side of our balanc sheet  probabl appropri so becaus veri few peopl in the reserv bank actual would be abl to add much to the discuss about the asset side of our balanc sheet  those individu who can are the one who particip in these studi  and i thought they did a tremend amount of veri valuabl work   but in the end  it   s onli this group that can think strateg about the asset side of our balanc sheet   to think strateg mean you first have to have some sort of a vision and some idea about the futur beyond the immedi  e horizon   right or wrong  you have to identifi possibl  assign probabl  and reflect on what you would be happi about or not happi about at a point out there in the futur   these day the point in the futur i like to encourag our peopl to focus on is our    th anniversari in decemb of        in my              view it   s not too earli to start think about that centenni celebr   governor    onc he is reconfirm  will be the first governor whose term run into the feder reserv   s second centuri   i won   t be around  but other peopl will be who ought to be focus on the vision of what this institut will look like at that  e  well  to return to the issu at hand  the treasuri   s general account is one of the item on the liabil side of the reserv bank balanc sheet   it   s an import element of the servic we provid the treasuri as it fiscal agent   it   s a big element in what     as part of what i view as defens oper  the temporari inject and withdraw of reserv necessit by fluctuat in the treasuri   s account   it actual is not on the liabil side of the monetari base  becaus the monetari base is a consolid of the account of the twelv feder reserv bank togeth with the treasuri   s monetari account   so it come as a negat sourc compon on the asset side of the balanc sheet   everyth els on the liabil side of our balanc sheet is either currenc or fund of those entiti that have a settlement account with us   now  have a settlement account with us is an extraordinarili import principl to preserv both for depositori institut and for other financi intermediari or government entiti   this consolid of the reserv bank    account and the treasuri   s monetari account  outsid money or high power money  is link to a financi system that import depend on the concept of insid money  those payment mechan through the institut that have settlement with us   that lead me to some principl about the option we should be will to consid  what i would view as veri low risk option relat to item we hold on the asset side               when i start read through all of this materi  my first reaction was  and one of the chairman   s first comment brought me back to it   let   s get an exempt from doubl entri bookkeep becaus none of the other option look attract   but that would take legisl and i   m not at all in favor of legisl   i would prefer that the fed have no author to lend to california util compani  whatev other might think   debt of state and local govern give me great paus becaus of that kind of concern  if our was a close economi  have no intern dimens  then a treasuri onli polici on the asset side of the balanc sheet  if feasibl  is what i think i would want   and on the liabil side of our balanc sheet would be either balanc of our domest depositori institut or currenc that u s  resid hold   but that   s not the realiti  and that   s not the world we are in   so we are go to have to think about some altern down the road that are beyond our own border as an institut   but link item on the asset side of the balanc sheet to one that are on the liabil side of the balanc sheet is an extrem import principl  and we shouldn   t stray veri far from it  monet is a term that appli onli proper to domest debt of the central govern   the reason is that the revenu from that monet debt  which is our liabil and is noninterest bear debt for the govern sector  goe back to the feder govern as we  in a sens  cancel interest bear debt   monet  sn   t realli appli  at least not in my mind in the most use sens of that term  onc we start think beyond u s  treasuri   but the other thing on our balanc sheet on the liabil side are the account of financi institut   i don   t know which institut              those are go to be in the futur   we broaden the scope in recent decad to those that have a settlement account with us  and that may chang over  e   but whoever they are  they are the onli institut to whom we should consid lend   if we have to stray beyond a treasuri onli polici  we ought to lend onli to those that are creat insid money out of our outsid money   and that mean no gses  sorri  toni  we can   t go that rout   but we should onli lend to entiti that have a settlement account with us becaus that is the basi of the monetari control mechan  ul  settl through us   that   lead me uncomfort into the foreign arena and the consider that our liabil are increas use by other around the world   have asset on our balanc sheet that are claim on tax author in other part of the world that use our liabil at least  sn   t violat my principl on what i think we ought to be will to consid hold as earn asset   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   i must admit that i   m still tri to digest this materi and our result discuss   but let me just state a few of my thought and prefer at the moment  to me the most promis altern are the discount window altern  particular the acf   a combin of practic and other consider go into that assess   one is  if i understand the materi  that it wouldn   t requir legisl  two  the infrastructur is alreadi in place  although obvious it would have to be scale up and may have to becom more sophist over  e   but it   s not as if it would be brand new   third  it seem to me that we would still be leav a lot of the initi with the privat sector   certain with the acf  we   d be set the volum with the auction              but the privat sector would still have the option of choos how els they wish to fund themselv   and clear we would not be get involv with the ul  borrow  that would be up to the financi intermediari to whom we were lend   so we would be one step remov  it seem to me  from that taint of credit alloc although  obvious  one might argu that we were favor financi intermediari of a particular kind at the expens of some other  depend on who has access to the acf  nevertheless  i see a lot of promis there in address mani of the issu that we confront  i would also be relat comfort look care at expand the collater we would take on rps   the final observ i would make is that as we start consid a wider rang of instrument in which we might oper over  e  whether rps or asset for what we might think of as a more perman part of the portfolio  i would be veri uncomfort get anywher near equiti   if we were to get into that arena  that   s the place i would expect polit pressur to aris   if equiti market were not perform as somebodi hope  the    incent    to lean on the fed to do someth about it could becom signific in my judgment   so i would prefer  if we start to consid a wider rang of instrument  that we not look that wide
thank you   i   ve been mark down point as the discuss has gone along  and i initi put my name on the list when al broaddus spoke  but a number of other issu have arisen as well   first  i agre with bill pool that this is an import issu   it has not been thought about much  and if there is some way              to put out some materi  mayb not these precis paper  but some version thereof  for public discuss among academ  i believ that   s a good idea  one thing we might do today is to elimin nonstart   my first candid for a nonstart would be the suggest brought up by my friend  al broaddus  and let me tri to say whi    laughter
are you talk about your ex friend   laughter
we   ve disagre befor and no doubt we will again   as i understand the pictur here  and i must say that i haven   t realli focus on some of these issu befor now  we have grow currenc need   if we were to back them by growth in our hold of treasuri oblig  that would either put the treasuri in the busi of rise asset accumul or  if we retain doubl entri bookkeep  grow give back   and by do that i think we would have abolish fiscal polici  becaus at that point the govern would not be abl to accumul or decumul asset   and in addit to the cyclic point that bill made earlier  i would say that fiscal polici has been a veri use polici tool   the govern has done some save in the      s and that has been one of the sourc of the capit deepen product chang that we often applaud   so to use this problem to abolish fiscal polici seem to me wors than shoot a cannon with a mous  or howev that express goe    laughter
you mean shoot a mous with a cannon
sure   it   s shoot a mous with a cannon
i ask the secretariat not to make that alter   laughter   you got it right the first  e
meanwhil  back at the ranch   there   s also a point don rais earli in his comment that i think is import  which is that we have a dwindl suppli of treasuri secur and what is the social valu of that   is it better to have that dwindl suppli of secur in the system portfolio or is it better to have the privat sector hold them   i think it   s better to have them with the privat sector   so there is good reason in my view to get start on think about this even befor we actual have to  becaus the suppli of treasuri secur is diminish  let me say a quick word on the discount facil   i   ve been push for the lombard  as all of you know   after read the staff document  i think i like the acf even better   but i also believ  and i   ve confirm this with the author of the studi  that there is no reason whi the lombard and the acf could not coexist   we   re go to have to do some think about how to restructur the whole discount facil  and mayb this is a good opportun for do that   one aspect of that  which is allud to in the studi but is not dealt with direct  is the role of the board of director of all of your reserv bank   in my discuss about the discount window  i have discov that view vari wide across the system regard the role of these director   if we were to reformul the discount facil and have an acf or a lombard type facil along with it  then the role of the board of director would becom more clear   and the letter that the board of the reserv bank write to us would relat to their view on overal monetari polici  as oppos to a particular facil for which there were       loan made in        i think that would involv a huge social benefit and would be a benefit              within the system as well  and i see that as a veri posit develop   the role of the board of director would becom far more import  not less import  last  i would like to support gari  n in his feel that our get into the equiti market scare me a lot   i   d rather do almost anyth than that   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s good to have heard such divers opinion in this discuss becaus i  like sever other peopl  have read this materi and re read it and have had differ thought at differ point in  e   so it   s realli a plus to have a wide rang discuss about some of these issu   i also want to compliment the author of the paper   the studi in total compris the most complet discuss that i   ve seen in my experi at the feder reserv of the kind of issu that go into shape the asset side of our balanc sheet   the materi from this studi have been  and will continu to be  use in keep me up to speed in term of the asset side of the soma balanc sheet and various market in this countri   and i  too  hope we can share with our own staff some portion of this materi  if not with the public  becaus in my view it   s extrem import and valuabl for them to understand these matter as well  i start from the premis that we need to think about the short run and then the long run  as oppos to the long run befor the short run  which is the way this discuss has been set up   i know there   s a problem in the futur and that we realli need to focus on how to deal with it   but i also feel that in the shorter run  say from now to       this may not be as big an issu as some of the model would suggest   there may in fact be way that we can continu our oper more or less as normal through the middl of              the decad   we could do that  possibl  by extend the author   has to oper in mortgag back secur  by extend the collater that we take under exist legisl  and by increas a bit our use of rps and the gse market  i rais the dread word gse   is that a word or is it an acronym   i have had my difficulti in think about gses  mayb for longer than a lot of peopl at this tabl  i work in this area when we chang our entir book entri system in the earli      s sole becaus we could not deal with the number of new secur issu  cusip  relat to mortgag back secur   i had peopl come into my offic at the new york fed tell me how we should redesign our system total and complet so that we could have six or seven tranch of ever more complic secur   we had to convinc the gses that they need to provid inform to let the public know what the real risk were in those secur   i continu to think that the use of the book entri wire is a major subsid to the gses   but put that asid  the gses are what they are   the treasuri  or more general the govern  creat them   in a sens they   re a govern problem   in my view expand our use  but not tremend  of gses in rp transact  not as outright purchas  and continu to add gnmas  which after all have the full faith and credit of the govern  is a good short term strategi   all other thing equal  we shouldn   t be so hesit to talk about that and consid do it  as for the long run  a lot of peopl talk about outright purchas and the rollov of temporari addit to the portfolio   i think  as somebodi els mention  that a way to view what we   re acquir is not just as temporari or perman hold but in term of gradat of liquid or illiquid   i am attract to the idea  for those secur we own outright  of have some layer or buffer between us and the secur              themselv   i am not at all convinc that ani risk manag process we   ve develop in the system to date  or could develop or pay peopl to administ  would be anyth like the risk manag and asset manag process that exist in the privat sector   one or more of these paper mention the possibl of outsourc the manag of a wide diversifi portfolio   i would agre with gari that equiti are a littl scari  but let   s say the diversifi portfolio is compris of corpor debt and other kind of instrument   i would be veri hesit to believ that we could develop the infrastructur necessari to manag a huge and vari portfolio of differ kind of secur that the system own outright   i think that skill would be veri expens for us to develop and maintain  it exist in the privat sector and that function could be outsourc   one point that nobodi has mention is that if we   re go to have wide diversifi hold of outright purchas in the long run  we might think about outsourc the manag of it to some kind of fund   i don   t know what fund could do that and i don   t know how they would work  but some more thought along those line seem worthwhil  as for move from outright hold to more liquid  less perman hold i  too  am attract to the acf idea  not as a be all and end all  and not in amount of      to      billion but in smaller amount that are auction base   and i agre with toni santomero in that i don   t see a big differ between auction deposit and do repurchas agreement on secur   i know the lawyer will jump all over that interpret  but as a practic matter i don   t see a huge differ   and at the margin  for the intermedi tranch of secur that have a bit longer term but are not perman hold  i think the acf has a lot of appeal   in my view we could readili manag the              risk part of it  the haircut  in contrast to my concern about our abil to manag the risk of a wide diversifi portfolio held on an outright basi  on how larg to make the repo pool  the veri short term part of the portfolio  i   m not sure that the way we   ve handl that histor isn   t the right way to do it   i don   t see ani major problem with have a bigger share of temporari ownership  though the manag function at the desk would probabl be a bit more intens   but use repurchas agreement  keep them veri temporari  have big haircut or whatev size they need to be  and have a littl      space     to use presid hoenig   s term  between us and the borrow strike me as the way to manag the short run part of the portfolio   that seem appropri for the asset we need to buy and sell in order to deal with temporari need to inject or subtract liquid from the market   that conclud my comment
thank you  mr  chairman   as     often say  at this point of the go around everyth has been said   so i   ll tri not to repeat it all just for the sake of ad weight to the argument   befor i proceed  i also would like to commend the staff for these terrif paper  first  i want to associ myself with those who would like to go to whatev length we can to avoid direct acquir privat sector asset   in my view  that   s not the prefer way to go   that have been said  there are onli a few asset market  main mortgag and certain agenc debt  that are suffici deep to accommod the type of oper the desk has to do   i would agre with tom hoenig   s suggest that gnmas seem to offer a reason attract altern               contrari to cathi   s comment just now  i   m a littl uncomfort with expand our involv with agenc such as freddi mac and fanni mae   to me they rais some issu that we ought to think long and hard about   i  too  would be comfort with continu to use rps and expand their use in the way we have discuss in the past   i think the argument about the two parti natur of those arrang are well taken  i also am reason attract to the acf discount window facil   it has some desir attribut   i   m not as concern as the author of some of the paper about the baggag that come with that   at least as far as monitor the financi institut  i think we have a fair robust system in place for track and understand the health of our financi institut  in connect with that  mr  chairman  you start this discuss by invit question as well as comment and i have a question about the degre to which we bump into the home loan bank    lend program with the type of lend that may be involv in the acf facil   that may be essenti a polit question   but i wasn   t sure that i got from my staff a sens of just how much the acf would put us head to head with the home loan bank  i   d make two other point   one is  as we   ve talk through the various altern this morn  that some signific account issu and question have surfac concern the adequaci of the system   s capit and surplus  which need to be address as we move to a differ kind of risk profil for our asset   at some point that need more discuss  though mayb those are implement issu   and final  i appreci the point that some peopl made that this problem may go away or be              substanti less awesom a year or two from now than it appear to be at the moment  howev  we ought to be care not to take littl increment step along the way and end up some place that we don   t want to be   we ought to have thought about the endgam  at least in term of where we   re go  as we start down this path   we should be sure that we   re go to be comfort with where we will come out   thank you  mr  chairman
incident  on the endgam point  i think it   s well worthwhil to stipul that treasuri are not gone forev  that this is an interim period  as presid pool mention   there is a critic point when we will be run veri substanti unifi budget deficit and treasuri issu are go to be come back in huge volum   we should recogn that what we   re talk about is an interim period becaus i assum that we   re all of the view that treasuri have been an extraordinarili valuabl instrument and that when they reemerg we will move back to them   so the notion here is that we   re talk about a    year window or some  efram of that natur   in fact  i would say it will be less than that  in the sens that we   re prepar for a window that is like to close on us some  in      or      under exist forecast and reopen about    year later    so it   s not a perman structur issu  and we ought to rememb that when we   re contempl the various tool we might use   it is a decad long phenomenon  not someth that is chisel in stone   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   first  let me add my congratul to the peopl who wrote the paper   i thought it was a fine job  mr  chairman  i think this last point you made is veri import   we should keep this in perspect as we make our comment and as we plan what we   re go to              do   i don   t have firm view on mani of the issu that have been rais  but i do on some   i   d like to mention both the one i don   t feel strong about and the one i do  your comment lead me to feel that we should be emphas a diversifi approach in what we do go forward  and i think of diversif in two way   one is in term of the percentag of our portfolio and the other relat to our influenc in the market for ani individu secur   that   s anoth aspect of diversif   it   s similar  i think  to the liquid issu we   ve talk about here   the paper were written from the standpoint that as we enter a market  we reduc the liquid of that type of secur in the market   actual  i believ it cut the other way as well   if we enter a market for a specif secur  it would encourag other to issu more of those secur becaus the central bank is in that market   so i think the liquid may increas as well  as long as the suppli is elast  clear  i would prefer the use of govern secur onli  as we all would  when we start go beyond that  i think gnmas are a good first step   but person i would not want to go forward in fanni mae and freddi mac issu for the reason that have been discuss in the press  relat to give those agenc preferenti treatment in the marketplac  of the area that i   m encourag about for diversif  one is the broader use of rps   we are all familiar with them and i think we know their advantag  so i won   t list the latter   second  i believ we should look at the discount window option veri care   it   have promis   i believ presid   is correct in say that we should consid it in a broader perspect  tie in with our supervis and regul activ as well   in my view the govern issu are manag there   and i tend to              be drawn toward the acf approach  that clear seem worth examin much more care   anoth area is the foreign secur that jerri jordan mention   i view that as a promis area   they are use by other central bank in their open market oper   we   re not talk about foreign exchang oper  so i think that arena has promis and is someth we should look at more care  on privat secur  person i would draw a line in the sand on those   i would not want the system to be invest in privat equiti   my concern about this goe back    year when i was in the labor depart and was co chair with the treasuri depart someth call the pension benefit guarante corpor  pbgc   which insur pension and the asset come into the govern   the question when it was be set up was what to do with these invest   of cours  the staff of the pbgc want to invest in privat secur to get a higher return for the insur fund and  be young and nave  i thought that sound like a veri good idea  as we got into discuss of this with the treasuri i soon realiz that the problem would be insurmount   that would inevit lead to govern influenc in the marketplac  and the polit pressur would be so enorm that mischief would be inevit   so i would draw a line in the sand that would keep the feder govern  both the treasuri depart and the feder reserv  out of that busi  i do want to make a comment about transpar in this process    and i think this is import   bill pool said it would be good to get academ input into this   to me the issu is more than just get these paper out in the public domain   i think we should be veri open and transpar about what we   re studi as a central bank   don and   mention that they want to consult with select member of the congress               their staff  and peopl in the market   onc we start do that a lot of rumor are go to circul   those rumor could affect the market for the categori of secur that will be discuss  and that would be veri unfortun   so there is a practic reason for open up this discuss and i don   t see ani reason not to be transpar about what we   re do   we are break new ground here and we could get a lot of help input from academ and other who are knowledg about these area   and even though we   re talk about a period of ten year  we do have some  e befor we need to make decis   in my view it would be veri desir to get input from other and i think it would help our credibl as well  in term of next step  i would contempl ask the peopl who   ve work on these paper to come back with some concret propos in the area we would want to studi in more depth   i   d also want to discuss how we should make the public awar of what we   re do and be open to input from peopl from outsid the system as well
thank you   presid parri
thank you  mr  chairman   mani of the point that michael   made are similar to those i   d like to make   i   d start by say that the materi certain provid a lot for us to digest and i would assum that we   re just begin the dialogu on a lot of these issu   also  i feel as though we probabl would benefit by have other besid those in this room examin some of these issu   so the propos made by bill pool and variant of it are intrigu  let me make a coupl of point   these are not uniqu  but they do reflect where i am at the present  e on this issu   first of all  for the near term i certain think that relianc on treasuri to the greatest extent possibl is desir   that lead              me to suggest that we ought to have a discuss of our self impos limit on hold treasuri or at least assur ourselv that the limit we have in effect at the present  e are the one that we want to retain go forward  i also am intrigu by the idea of consid outright purchas of gnmas  although they certain involv some technic complic associ with mortgag repay and so forth that would have to be address   i   m not in favor of expand our use of other gse oblig   with regard to our rps  i think there is room for expand the collater we accept   i would say  though  and this is veri differ from presid     s view  that i   m a littl concern and would like to hear more about use foreign collater   that would expos us to sovereign risk and would  i assum  put us in the delic posit of have to choos which countri to sanction  so to speak  and i   m not sure i understand how that process would be accomplish  final  i find the acf propos intrigu   i   m not sure to what extent the acf could be use product  but it   s someth that we ought to look at a littl more close becaus there probabl is a role that it could play   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve learn an enorm amount from the paper  and i appreci that   i also want to say that i   ve learn an enorm amount from the comment that have been made around the tabl here today by so mani differ peopl  i have to confess that i   m still have troubl get over an acut state of denial    laughter   to me the way we have been oper  through the exclus use of              treasuri  is just so overwhelm the best way to do it that i find myself have a terribl  e be attract to ani of the various altern on the tabl  one thing that we haven   t pursu in talk about the altern is the concept you introduc  mr  chairman  about this be an interim problem   that rais quick the question of how big a problem we might face and for how long   i   m not sure we have thought about this in that context  or at least i haven   t   i was view these altern as basic involv an approach that would be carri forward more or less indefinit into the futur   but becaus i feel so strong about tri to stay with what we have been do  if at all possibl  i believ we ought to give al broaddus    idea a serious look   there may be fundament flaw in it  i certain haven   t thought it through so i don   t know   but if it would help us to get through an interim problem  then we ought to tri to see if it is an approach that should be pursu  i also strong suspect  even given the presum sanctiti of the social secur trust fund and the way it asset will increas and then decreas  that the polit institut down the street are suffici invent that they may veri well find way to make this problem go away   so it may not becom an issu that we need to worri about at all   nevertheless  we should look at the problem and altern solut   we must do that  and it is right for us to do that  i don   t have a set of solut to propos   i have not tri to come up with that   the one that have been made around the tabl are all veri good and all have strong point   i would like to make one negat point  it has been made befor  but i feel quit strong about it   and that is that when we do new thing  if at all possibl we should tri veri hard to avoid put in place oper that are go to have an impact on the              market   invest in equiti would be the worst   but almost anyth we do is liabl to have an impact on the market  and we must give veri  veri close attent to tri to avoid that or at least minim it   i say that becaus onc this institut put it imprimatur on ani one of these market and begin to put money into it  i believ the impact we will have on that market will go well beyond the amount of dollar that we may be invest in it   if we do enter market and begin to distort their perform  i think it   s a veri  veri short step from there to distort the op  invest flow across the economi   and if that start  it   s a veri short step from there to distort the social distribut of asset that are appropri across our economi and across our societi   my concern  if it   s fair to talk in term as broad and grandios as that  is that this begin to take us well beyond our role and even beyond the scope of the problem we   re tri to solv here   so i would be extrem care about what we do becaus it impact will rippl across the economi  well beyond the direct way that we can accur identifi and that these studi inde have alreadi accur identifi
thank you   ani further comment on this round
i want to make an addit comment becaus i found veri interest the point that you  governor   and bill pool rais about an interim period of   to    year  or howev long it might be   i   m think of that in combin with the greater potenti now than  say  this  e last year  that some social secur fund will be invest in privat asset   it may not happen this year or next year  but that could well be given serious consider by this administr and the congress   the social secur trust fund hold onli nonmarket secur   is there              a way in which those nonmarket secur could be acquir by us as part of our perman portfolio and the cash then use by social secur to do some invest under whatev guidelin are set up in the legisl that chang how social secur work
i think it   s best in this context to think of the social secur trust fund as nonexist   it   s an intra government transfer
yes  i realiz that
that   s the best way to look at it in term of al broaddus    suggest   let   s take just two exampl of rps on the asset side  rps limit to privat rp secur or rps involv onli govern secur   what we   d realli be do  if we leav fiscal polici alon  is shift the asset from one govern sector to the other   in other word  we would be swap our rps with the social secur administr or the u s  treasuri  it  sn   t matter which one  and in do that effect we would end up with u s  treasuri on the asset side of our balanc sheet and they would end up with the privat secur
in my view it   s use to think of these altern not in a flow sens but in a balanc sheet sens and the swap of asset  most of what we have discuss around the tabl today is best judg in that manner   i think the strong point in al broaddus    argument is that it   s better for the treasuri depart than for us to be make the polit judgment   it would probabl be better if neither of us were to make them  but that is the sort of thing that i think we have to worri about
could i pose anoth question on this point   i don   t recal the number but  even though this is an interim problem  it   s my impress that it is a huge interim problem
that is  the asset accumul would be someth on the order of    trillion as i rememb the number   isn   t that right
it will depend  obvious  on how quick and to what extent the surplus is fritter away   and there are physic limit to spend it or refund it in tax if onli becaus we   re go to get congression gridlock that will prevent that   but at the moment  if we take our structur product number even remot serious  it is veri difficult to get around the fact that not onli will we see growth in the surplus  but substanti growth   it   s the on budget surplus that realli take off
right   and aren   t we talk about asset rise  even under moder assumpt  to someth like    trillion
if we think in term of the problem start in       the govern is go to start to accumul asset then even though there is still some debt on the book   if we talk about a unifi budget surplus in current servic of about      to      billion annual  then depend on how mani year beyond that we want to think about  it could build up to an incred number   now  that   s not go to happen
that will be taken off the tabl   but you   re quit right that the potenti amount is quit substanti
so  it   s not like one of these interim problem that we deal with from may to juli  is it    laughter   this is a veri signific problem   while we ought to recogn that it may be over some day  we need to treat it as a real concern that we have to worri about for the long run
yes   and jerri jordan   s view that just go through this exercis is of extraordinari valu in and of itself is not besid the point either   we may never implement ani of these option  but i bet we will find that this discuss and the work involv in it has been quit valuabl to our understand of the way the system function and how it should best be manag    al
mr  chairman  i have a coupl of quick comment   first      summar my main concern about this a lot more eloqu than i did  and i want to associ myself with his remark   second  one other point occur to me dure the discuss   while this may be an interim problem  and we don   t know the magnitud of it  you indic that onc it   s over  the presumpt is that we would go back to invest onli in treasuri   i would just caution that if we go down these other road over a period of seven or eight or nine year  it may not be that easi to extric ourselv
that   s a veri good point and one we should think about
that goe to the issu of the endgam   in my view the endgam need to be a posit where we somehow maintain our independ   that   s              realli what this is all about to me   as for the argument that we need to share the burden with the rest of the govern  i think there   s a lot of public support for the fed to be as insul from the polit process as we can be in order to conduct monetari polici of a high qualiti   so as a practic matter  i   m not sure that that argument would necessarili be veri difficult to deal with
just one point   our strategi need to take into account the strategi of the feder govern becaus the govern itself is go to be develop an asset alloc strategi as part of this process
i think that   s a veri import point   we can not be make our judgment independ of what the congress and the administr are do   presid pool
i have one comment and one request   my comment is that if we have a portfolio of privat secur  there may be aspect of manag the credit risk that would differ for us relat to a privat portfolio   when we   ve look at the issu of manag those risk  it has been discuss primarili as if we were a larg mutual fund invest in bond or someth like that   some element of our oper may differ from those of a privat manag portfolio   for exampl  we might want to stay with a buy and hold strategi   onc we decid to buy a secur we might not want to sell it  wherea a privat portfolio manag might want to sell it   i don   t know precis what the risk manag differ might be but i   m think about issu like that
i thought you were rais the issu of whether we would foreclos on home mortgag    laughter
we may not have a choic if there is a default   in ani event  there may be some differ   what would we do if we end up in bankruptci court as a claimant   that   s a more realist exampl  if we have debentur in the portfolio other than home mortgag  second  my request   can we at least downgrad the secur classif of these studi to class iii so that the staff at all the reserv bank could look at these materi   that   s a request for the power that be to consid
well  whi don   t we turn that question over to the power that be    laughter
who would that be
coffe is avail   i think we   ve had a quit extraordinari discuss so far       will have the floor when we return   coffe break
let me make a correct or clarif of my earlier statement regard my general es  of when the unifi budget surplus will go to zero and then turn negat   i said the period of surplus is like to be    year or more   let me just tell you what we know becaus i forgot to rais an issu relat to this  if we look at the cbo data themselv and use the midpoint of those project  the budget is in surplus out to        the likelihood that that will actual occur is  frank  quit small   so i   ve temper my view as to how long we will be engag in the accumul of privat asset   a    year period  say  from       which is the pro forma es   so to speak  seem to me a gross exagger becaus the unwilling  polit  to allow that to occur strike me as overwhelm               nevertheless  the notion that the period is go to be  say     year is more a polit judgment than an econom one   it is conceiv that the period may actual be longer than that   and the point that governor   made is import  name that the size of the problem  and not onli how long it will last  is also a concern   that the size is larg enough to warrant our attent is critic   have gone through all of this work to studi the problem and continu to do so   not in ani way lead to a presumpt that if the situat onli last    year we can get through it easili   in other word  it is possibl that a sever problem may never emerg but it   s quit conceiv that it will  especi if we look at these cbo number   rememb that the cbo number are not radic  there   s a good case to be made that they are too low   so we have a veri wide rang of possibl here   for the purpos of manag the feder reserv portfolio  we have to make the presumpt that the problem could be much larger  though i tend to agre with governor   that it   s like to be smaller rather than larger   but we can   t behav that way until we see that materi
thank you  mr  chairman   effect  i   ll just be recap the discuss and recommend on possibl near term approach present on page   through   of the memo that don and i sent to the committe   i have some prepar remark and i   m go to tri to respond to a few of the issu member rais that relat to this topic   i   m go to be discuss what i think of as the immedi challeng of oper over the next year or two  a differ kind of interim than the chairman was talk about   in my person view  that   s the  e horizon  two or even three year  befor we could implement ani of the longer term altern that are like to be pursu  whether they involv legisl or even the acf   on the acf issu  let me just digress a moment   the idea of start small is  of cours  a prudent way to begin   an open auction would be a challeng becaus the big bank are not like to be among the bidder   the bidder will probabl be the small bank in the countri who don   t have access to fund market   so to make the              auction work at all  we realli have to contempl an electron auction process connect thousand of bank   and that mean a nontrivi it project  it seem to me   so in the next coupl of year we face an immedi challeng   there are realli two constraint here   one involv our self impos limit on our hold of treasuri secur and the declin suppli of treasuri   the other is the self impos constraint of tri to keep our rp book small   i   d like to talk first about the limit on our treasuri acquisit that we set last juli  under those limit we still have a net author to purchas     billion  so these limit are not go to be bind tomorrow   on the forecast we   re work with  that carri us for anoth two or three year  rough speak  given the relat modest growth in currenc we expect to occur   but at present we   re danc as fast as we can to tri to redistribut our hold more smooth across the entir yield curv to prevent our pace of accumul of treasuri from disrupt the market   a coupl of sensibl peopl in the market have remind me that we  the feder reserv system and it oper  are fli right under the radar  the treasuri is take all the critic for it buyback and it reduct of suppli that is shrink the liquid of the market   but we are there also drain the suppli  and just becaus we do it clever  sn   t mean that a lot of peopl in the bond market don   t know it   s our oper that over  e are work progress to reduc the liquid of the market   when we think about the altern of rais the limit on our acquisit of individu treasuri secur  which is of cours at the committe   s discret  that   s realli a question of how quick the committe want to be a parti to erod the liquid of the market in which we oper   that   s not a free good   yes  buy more treasuri solv our asset accumul problem for now  but the veri act of do so diminish the liquid of the market on which we reli   in effect  recent we have been set the pace of outright purchas of treasuri at a rate that we think will not disrupt the market  we adjust it gradual in an effort to keep out of the way of the treasuri   s buyback oper  it   s sort of an intramur courtesi  and we alter the size of our    day repo book to meet our reserv need   as i said earlier  the rp book function as the residu in that respect   befor the buildup associ with reserv need at year end  we had about     billion of    day rps outstand   i   ll be discuss that in more detail later in my market report   at year end      we had rough      billion in rps outstand against a mix of treasuri and agenc debt and              mortgag back collater to match the substanti buildup in currenc in circul as a result of y k   let me remind you that we have been take freddi mac and fanni mae straight debt as a part of our repo oper for year  what we ad that was novel for y k was mortgag back secur guarante by freddi mac and fanni mae as well as by ginni mae   the fact that we began take mortgag back secur appear to have reduc the financ rate in that market by a basi point or so  someth in that neighborhood   no one i   ve talk to in the dealer communiti  though  think that the growth of our rp book to      billion  with mortgag back secur as a compon  actual affect financ rate at all   that is a veri big market   the fact that we enter that market gave a certain someth to it  but the size of our presenc in that veri larg market didn   t realli play a role  neither our move into the market at the end of      nor roll out of it in        let   s suppos we allow the repo book to grow a bit and combin that approach with measur purchas of treasuri under our limit structur  perhap period revisit the limit themselv  but for the moment take them as given   under that scenario  we in all likelihood would be abl to meet our reserv need for the next three or four year  or mayb even longer  depend on the rapid of treasuri paydown   don and i certain understand how some member feel about our accept freddi and fanni mortgag back secur as well as straight debt   and that is the genesi of our effort to put a self impos constraint on the rp book   under like scenario of near term treasuri paydown  notwithstand polit event  move to a treasuri onli rp book would be a rather abrupt act on our part   it would be confus and possibl disrupt to the market   and in my person opinion just do that could risk make an overt polit issu of our asset select   given the committe member    discomfort with the status quo  don and i recommend that the committe signal it intent to move in the direct of diversifi the book of rp collater   a first step would be to instruct the staff to explor the feasibl of ad tax exempt state and municip secur and foreign sovereign secur to the pool of collater accept for rps   this would involv discuss with congression staff and market particip  as     note   but as don said in his open remark  it is fulli our intent that this subject would be rais in the chairman   s upcom tes oni  and certain in the              minut of this meet  to be releas in march  befor we would talk to anyon direct   move in the direct of diversif would tend to dilut the special status that freddi and fanni oblig are now perceiv to have   as for rps against foreign sovereign secur  let me repeat that we envis do dollar rps against them  we would put out dollar and take in foreign sovereign secur  again  those are veri big market   there   s a tabl in the madigan krieger paper that show the size of various market   we need to think about tri to find pond in which we will be a small fish  which is not easi   and that is the huge attract of the foreign sovereign market   given the uncertainti in the fiscal outlook  i thought it would be help to find a way to muddl through for the next few year without depart signific from our current mode of oper   as i note earlier  continu to purchas treasuri secur at a measur pace and allow the book of term rps to grow to fill the gap could meet reserv need for the forese futur   therefor  don and i are ask the committe to extend the desk   s temporari author to oper in mortgag back secur   more specif  we ask that the committe extend for one year the temporari suspens of paragraph   through   of the guidelin for the conduct of system oper in agenc issu  we also request the committe   s author to explor the feasibl of ad tax exempt and foreign sovereign secur to the pool of accept rp collater   so that   s our propos   what we   d like to do now is to have an open discuss of these matter   on the agenda you   ll see that we are ask for a vote of the committe on three propos   one is the veri technic issu of chang the date in the author for domest open market oper   the second is the vote on the guidelin for oper in agenc issu   and the third is the vote to renew three foreign currenc document  the author for foreign currenc oper  the foreign currenc direct  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper  without amend   befor we proceed with those vote  howev  the committe may wish to discuss these propos or ask question of don and me or other staff
question   how will you determin which foreign secur will be accept as rp collater   what is go to be the criterion for that
let me make a coupl of point   first  that   s someth we would explor in our feasibl studi  and that   s whi we   re not realli ask you to author it yet   second  i would remind the committe that last fall we offer  and you agre and the treasuri has agre  to chang our invest pattern in foreign currenc reserv  particular in the euro area   we had been in german instrument onli and we knew that was not sustain   so we   ve come up with a mix of credit criteria that would allow us to have a repo book against most euro area sovereign nation  and we have develop even tougher credit criteria for outright purchas  which under present condit would make onli the secur of germani and franc elig for the outright portfolio   we are current discuss with the treasuri our view that it   s  e to put out the announc about that so we can begin convers with market particip and be transpar about it befor we actual make those invest   so i think we have a fair disciplin set of credit criteria for invest in a foreign portfolio for a  e   i admit that it would not be for all  e but i think we could follow that model   eventu i   m sure we will be caught in a difficult line draw exercis  which is no doubt what your question is drive at  and i don   t deni that
similar  what about the criteria for municip
the categori of municip that we are abl to purchas under statut is rather narrow  as the paper have made clear   it involv issu of veri short matur   i think we could also choos to set credit criteria or perhap limit ourselv to state sovereign  so we would not be open ourselv up to the whole market   but to come up with some object criteria i think we   d have to go through an exercis similar to the one we have done with respect to the foreign rp book
would you look at the liquid of individu state market
in this case we   re talk about rps  so we know the under instrument themselv may be illiquid   the question is whether we can get the clear bank and the dealer to make them part of the pool of collater that goe into the asset they pledg in an rp with us   what is modest promis about both foreign sovereign and municip secur is that the clear bank are set up to do them  though onli a tini amount is be done now   nevertheless  that   s a big hurdl in term of technolog   we probabl wouldn   t have a liquid criterion for the asset but we might want to place limit on the amount of ani one state   s secur we take for fear that if we had to liquid  we would have to worri about how much we were tri to sell
relat to it size
relat to it size   but we wouldn   t take much comfort from think that some segment of that market are liquid   none of those secur is liquid
would the light have to work in that state    laughter
i guess that depend on whether you   re from texa or california
histor  how much have we seen in fail rps   have we ever run into a fail rp ourselv where the counterparti default
i don   t believ so   i   m sure that at the  e of drexel it cross our collect mind and we worri about it   but i don   t recal a fail rp in my  e
sandi was here at the  e of drexel
i don   t think we   ve ever had a fail repo
has anybodi had a failur
back in the      s and      s there were problem in the rp market  such as peopl pledg the same secur sever  e  but none involv the feder reserv   a few law were chang and peopl went to jail
that   s serious  but it has noth to do with the rp market   that   s more the feloni market
a question   part of the rational for bring in the municip and the foreign sovereign secur was that the author to oper in those instrument was avail under exist law   that would give us the ad flexibl to make it through a reason period as we entertain more challeng option   but you also note that in part this strategi was a way of dilut the special status of fanni mae and freddi mac secur   it seem to me that it   just the opposit   what it say is that we oper onli in collater that is govern sponsor
i don   t agre that it   just the opposit   to make a correct  i believ the deposit account we hold for the gses are author by statut  so that   s not a veri use break point   i know there are all kind of legal issu surround the gses that we don   t realli want to get into   but signal to the market that what this committe want to do is to diversifi it asset mix certain move peopl   s think away from the notion that agenc issu  those of fanni and freddi in particular  are go to be the asset of choic   and that   s an issu on the mind and even the lip of some peopl in the market   they are question whether agenc issu are go to be our asset of choic as treasuri issu declin   i think the foreign sovereign              market are big enough and deep enough to dissip the percept that we are somehow go to becom depend on freddi mac and fanni mae secur
i will simpli reiter that it seem to me to reinforc the status of those entiti as a govern relat
governor    i want to be clear   i certain share the view you express in your earlier remark about the prefer of a clean sheet of paper as well as the longer term hypothesi that presid pool offer that if we are in freddi and fanni oblig  whi not commerci paper and corpor bond   i   m look at what to do without a chang in statut   so i share some of the view you express
and don  i understand whi you want to diversifi into the foreign sovereign and whi you dislik fanni mae becom the benchmark and so forth  but let me ask you to specul a bit further   the market would be inform as to whi we were do this and i wonder if there would be a polit backlash in the sens of our favor foreign sovereign over domest secur   that whole issu could come back and bite us in a sens  as we tri to move into that market   is there a risk or even a likelihood that we might have to deal with that type of critic
don and i both may want to comment on that   i certain would agre with you that it   s a risk   i think that our eye would be close if we didn   t see that as a risk   we are in a rather awkward posit   if we are too  n in the view that we should onli be monet our own govern   s debt  i think that pose question about our consist  given the eager with which we   ve encourag foreign sovereign to monet u s  treasuri   there are      billion worth of them in              custodi at the new york fed   other central bank seem to consid it reason to hold our treasuri in a perman way as asset on their balanc sheet   in mani countri in the world it is not view as a sign of central bank virtu to becom a captiv financ agenc for one   s own treasuri   the bundesbank has felt veri strong about that sinc the second world war  they have tri to avoid take on that role   so in a broad world view i think there are a number of point that could be brought to the tabl to explain whi this is a reason thing to do and whi reason central banker might do it   other central bank do it now  as our studi   s background paper indic   but i don   t want to ignor the risk that there would be some question   i think keep this activ in the rp area and not purchas foreign secur outright is clear an element in tri to address that concern   but i certain wouldn   t deni that that   s an issu
and it certain explain whi we want to studi state and municip at the same  e
that was one reason whi we suggest that this simpli be explor  to test a bit and see what the reaction might be and whether we could explain it in a way that would be fulli understood
we certain wouldn   t go forward if we ran into signific negat respons   but it depend on how it   s explain
it   point out how care it has to be explain not onli to our most sever critic but also to those who immedi grasp it and understand it
inde   it   s an issu we   re get into with full awar of the implic of the central bank tread in area where we have not been befor   presid jordan
i   m probabl go to need to ask a follow up question to my first question becaus i think i can guess the answer to the first one   suppos the committe accept part or all of your    b    propos of pour rp dollar into foreign debt  with or without municip  but did not accept the first part of the propos to reauthor the temporari author to accept mortgag back secur   what would be the problem associ with that
we would stop take mortgag back secur  includ those guarante by ginni mae  and we would then be includ in our repo book freddi and fanni straight debt   there is an aspect of that which may look as if we   re give an even greater prefer to freddi and fanni debt than we are to issu back by the full faith and credit of the unit state   that is the awkward part of how we were oper befor the fall of        i regret that we were in that posit  it   s someth we should have understood better   it was a slight awkward place to be and that would be the consequ of the scenario you outlin
now consid the possibl that you will find the notion of oper in foreign sovereign rps polit accept   suppos it   s a good enough market to be abl to do substanti amount and it is work to meet all of your need and the committe   s intent down the road is not onli to seek author to oper in mortgag back secur but in gses as well   how difficult   that becom
that   s a difficult polit issu on which i would prefer that other  perhap those who live in this district  comment   as a market matter  i don   t view it as a major challeng  given a reason  e period to work it all out
okay   well  from a committe process standpoint  often on issu like this we have found that onc we start do someth  the burden of proof on those who think it is not a good idea and want to stop do it is quit formid   it some  serv our purpos  if we can get a consensus on our object down the road  to revers that burden and say we will stop unless somebodi prove that we should continu becaus the benefit outweigh the cost
let me see if i read you clear   i don   t want to put word in your mouth  but i want to be sure i understand   you   re envis go forward with foreign sovereign and municip secur as a part of the rp book  put asid the issu of volum  and set a forward date for get out of fanni and freddi straight debt and mortgag back secur in the rp book  right
yes  that   s condit on your find the foreign sovereign satisfactori for your purpos
i think that   s in the feasibl set   that would be an option to consid   i   m not sure we know enough now to determin whether it is feasibl and  therefor  whether we would want to set that forward date now   that   s part of the exploratori natur of the author we   re look for in    b
let   s alway emphas when we   re talk about foreign collater that it   s still a dollar rp   there is no exchang rate risk involv               if we were to run an exchang rate risk  that   s a wholli differ ball game   governor
i have a coupl of question      my first may be similar to what presid hoenig was ask   just this morn we had a discuss about the long term   by do this explor of option for the short term  do you see risk that in some sens you might be front run the committe and creat a market expect that in fact the potenti long term solut is veri much in a particular direct   given what i heard this morn  where almost no option seem to be off the tabl  i   m a littl concern that we may be creat a presumpt either at the desk or in the market that this is our prefer long term solut   in some sens the exploratori process could be view as a cat   s paw in lead the market toward that assumpt  how do you think you can manag that
i don   t like the metaphor of either a cat   s paw or front run veri much  governor     i don   t think we   re do either one   clear  as don and i have both said  it is our prefer and intent to have the initi discuss of this be put forward through the chairman   s tes oni and the committe   s minut  in which you have a lot more input than i on how it is style and state   i think there are way to introduc this that make clear both the tentat natur of what we   re do and the fact that we are explor a lot of option   i think that   s someth well within our abil to convey
let me ask you two factual question   the chairman just said that there is no effect exchang rate risk involv   on page   of your memo  one of the thing you say is that the margin need to protect against both the price risk and              the exchang rate risk  even for dollar rps against foreign govern  is uncertain   if we go down this path  how much exchang rate risk is there realli   is it zero   i assum it can be made manag
it could be made almost zero
it can be made effect zero with daili adjust of the margin  which is how we would do it   the way i have thought of it is that we would in all likelihood be accept a rather low rate of return on our rps of foreign sovereign becaus deal with the system will be relat unattract from the perspect of dealer who have those secur in inventori   we will have to be margin for both the exchang rate risk and the under price risk   i would note  howev  that both the bank of england and the swiss nation bank seem to have gotten around that problem and have found way to make this work for them
one sens i would like to convey is that if we do this and the issu of exchang rate risk come up  i would prefer to give up some return in order to minim the exchang rate risk
that   s how we   ve thought of it
okay   my other concern is somewhat of an oper question   in term of the short term aspect of this  if there are clear issu  settlement issu  and custodi issu  is it your percept that those who run those kind of infrastructur oper could easili get through the clear  settlement  and custodi concern   the thought behind my question is that this will effect be creat a much larger intermarket in some secur and rps than had exist befor
i think it   s in the feasibl set   i don   t know how much softwar engin would have to go into it  but it   s someth that sever central bank have set up   we might have to use a broader set of custodian   we current are reli on chase and bank of new york   we might well end up use euroclear and some of the european base clear organ to make this work and that might be rather complic   there would be legal issu if euroclear is our custodian for the foreign sovereign repo pool   nevertheless  in my view it   s not just feasibl but practic  though i don   t know how much  e it will take to make prepar to enter that market
i support your recommend in    b    and i would even support a propos to expand the set of instrument avail to the desk becaus i think it   s import that you have the flexibl to oper as necessari in market as they evolv   in practic  howev  i believ we need to be care about move into sovereign debt becaus it is in fact a chang for us  no matter how we cut it  and it is a substant chang   i   m much less concern about the mortgag portfolio for the reason just indic  that the rps are set up in such a way that we can protect our posit rather easili in a veri thick  rich market   i don   t have ani object to sovereign debt if you   re go to appli the criteria religi  but it involv cross a line that is not a minor one   the fact that other central bank do it may not be suffici reason for explain whi we have not in the past nor whi we sudden would be will to do so tomorrow   so  to go in that direct i think is a substant matter
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support     s propos to explor the possibl of transact in municip and foreign govern secur  recogn that support his propos is not say that we   re ul  go to approv them for our portfolio   i say that becaus there are polici as well as oper consider that we at least have to think about and feel comfort with befor we actual do that   also  i assum we would be oper in them onli on a repo basi  the other point i want to mention goe back to my comment earlier on govern sponsor agenc   i recogn that there is a lot of polit concern about our hold issu of those agenc   but with repo we   re talk about short term addit or subtract of liquid   and in that regard one of our primari consider ought to be which market make the most sens for us to oper in  where we can suppli or contract liquid most easili without have a major market impact   the market for foreign secur is certain one  if we can resolv the mechan of do repo in those secur   but the market for u s  govern agenc is right behind it in term of size and depth  the number of player  the mechan  oper support  and so forth   to me our biggest subsidi with regard to the govern sponsor agenc is not that we particip in this huge market at the margin to suppli and contract liquid but that we are the name fiscal agenc for them  they maintain account on our book and they use all of our facil to issu their secur and we provid them with intra daili liquid over the book entri wire   to me that   s the subsidi we provid  not a subsidi in the market
if we were to go into foreign sovereign debt in a substanti way  to build on toni   s point that it would involv such a big chang  do you worri at all about the possibl of polit pressur be brought to bear with respect to the alloc of our hold across countri   might we in some circumst be under pressur for polit reason to do rps with govern whose credit is a bit fray around the edg
let me be care in my answer   we do rps with our counterparti and they pledg a mix of collater that they have in inventori   we can set the credit criteria of what we   ll accept   we work long and hard on the criteria for the invest of our foreign currenc reserv  which i discuss with you last fall  in order to make those as object and bulletproof as possibl   those criteria had noth to do with gdp weight or polit resourc or which countri were big in europ and which were small   so  if we have clear articul object criteria for what we will take as collater and adher to that  i think it would be manag   and we   re onli talk about repo  so it would be a question of what the dealer have in inventori  which chang from day to day  and not make outright purchas   i don   t want to deni the concern you   re address  but i think we   ve defin a seri of condit that make it manag
i think it   s import to emphas that these are transact with counterparti   our primari call is against the credit of the counterparti and the collater is a realli secondari issu   one can view that collater as a debentur against the counterparti   if we emphas the collater  i think we could run into the problem that al broaddus is talk about   the collater has to be view as a wholli              secondari question and the word    haircut    should appear everi  e we mention collater  sever   yes
ani other further question or comment     would you now rais the individu item on which you would like a vote
yes  thank you
let me just state befor we proceed that it is my understand that the general counsel is satisfi with the natur of the request that are be made in this regard   go ahead
in my memo of januari   th to the committe i indic the three propos on which i   d be ask you to vote   the first one  i hope  involv no controversi   i   d like the committe to renew for one year the author for domest open market oper  substitut    busi day for the refer to    calendar day  with my apolog for bother you with this   with that amend  as explain in my memo  i   d ask for a vote to reauthor the domest author
would somebodi like to move that request

without object  that is approv
thank you   the second vote is on the guidelin for the conduct of system oper in feder agenc issu  which we   ve just been discuss   i   d like to ask the committe to extend the temporari suspens of              paragraph   through   of these guidelin for one year  until the committe   s first schedul meet in

without object  so order
thank you   the third vote  mr  chairman  is on the author for foreign currenc oper  the foreign currenc direct  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper   as explain on the second page of my memo  i ask the committe to reaffirm those document as they stand
is there discuss
mr  chairman  i   d like to comment on the author for foreign currenc oper   i wrote out a few note  which i   m go to read  i spoke in some detail at our octob meet about foreign exchang market intervent   i continu to oppos intervent and want to discuss briefli some consider beyond the econom one i took up in octob  let me be clear that i am not talk about intervent in emerg circumst   the chairman must have author to interven in crisi situat  such as those that might aris if a presid is assassin or a war break out  or if ani of a wide rang of unpredict but terribl serious event should occur   my remark appli              to circumst in which intervent might be debat for day or even week in advanc  our practic and institut of intervent date from an era in which the fomc genuin believ that intervent was a use tool of econom polici   my sens of current view around this tabl is that no one want to make a strong case for intervent and that some member are veri much oppos to it   ani intervent today  then  must be for fundament non econom purpos  polit purpos  broad defin  but not partisan polit purpos  the feder reserv   s reput and independ depend on the public   s view us as total non partisan and as exercis our best judgment on sound econom polici   we are now in a situat  if i read committe member    view correct  in which we are will to interven on occas even though we do not believ that do so is sound econom polici   how do we justifi action we believ do not repres sound econom polici   should we be in a posit in which we must decid when to say    yes    and when to say    no    to the treasuri on intervent  when the ground are inher non econom   i think not  moreov  our intervent resourc aris from the feder reserv   s power to creat money   by interven at the behest of the treasuri  we augment treasuri resourc beyond those appropri by congress   someday  someon in congress will make an issu of that  and we will not in good conscienc be abl to claim that we have interven becaus we believ that intervent repres sound econom polici   i believ that we risk our good reput by interven with fund congress is not will              to appropri direct   congress could  after all  increas the size of the exchang stabil fund at ani  e  anoth issu that troubl me great is that when the unit state interven at the request of a foreign govern or foreign central bank we have no assur that the intervent plan will be close held in confid  we have no control over the process   we are at risk that intervent plan will be disclos prematur and that other will trade against us  so call    front run      should we ever face a verifi case of front run against our intervent  all hell would  and should  break loos in congress   i believ veri strong that intervent  if ani  should be sole for purpos of u s  econom polici and should be control by the unit state   the front run risk is one we should not take  especi given that the benefit of intervent are so problemat in the first place  i understand that intervent polici are to be review joint by the feder reserv and the treasuri   subject to this review  i can vote to support the current foreign currenc author   howev  i think some discuss of these issu befor that review  either now or at a futur fomc meet  would be use so that the view of the fomc as a bodi could be regist in the review process
i think there   s fair general agreement around this tabl on the principl that you stipul   you may recal that i said at an earlier  e that the proper sequenc here is for me to talk to the senior treasuri offici of the new administr when they are readi to listen  which should be within the next few week   what i would like to do when this issu aris is to discuss it with the appropri treasuri offici  obvious the secretari of the treasuri and his undersecretari  and              communic our view   subsequ  i would report back to this committe   if we find that there are signific differ of view  we can debat the issu at that  e and take a specif committe posit   it may turn out to be moot   until i am abl to rais these issu with the new offici at treasuri i   d suggest that we hold off on our discuss   i will come back and report to the committe on the view of the treasuri and then we can proceed to have the debat and discuss you are request   is that satisfactori
yes  thank you
thank you   that was veri help  so i can be brief   will your discuss includ the wareh facil
i think all aspect of this are on the tabl
i am not current a member of the committe so i won   t get a vote this  e around  but it   s comfort to know these discuss will be take place befor this issu is on our agenda again   with a new administr  i think this is an especi opportun  e  and one we shouldn   t miss  to discuss the subject of intervent and find out where we stand
mr  chairman  i assum that we would be better off to have you go into those discuss with the author for foreign currenc oper in place  which mean we should renew the author today
i think so
if  as a result of your convers there is some reason to chang it  we can do so later
i think that   s implicit in the propos that presid pool made  yes   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  just to clarifi   on the request to explor secur of foreign sovereign for repo  one option we   re consid  when you say as we go forward we will give context to this  do you intend that we would have a broader discuss of this whole topic   in other word  here is one solut for the short term  there are other long term solut under discuss  so will we provid a full context and not rais expect that we   re look at foreign sovereign as our solut for expand the depth of the market
okay  thank you
do you need a motion for the foreign currenc instrument
i do inde
is there a second
without object  so be it   when do you want to break for lunch
lunch is avail
i think we are probabl at an ideal point to break for lunch and to congratul ourselv on what in my view has been one of the most success delib session this committe has had in a veri long  e   lunch recess
let   s take a few minut for don kohn to give us his impress of how we should move forward after this morn   s discuss
thank you  mr  chairman   i think there are a coupl of avenu on which to proceed forward from here    for the veri short run  of cours  you have author   and me to explor with appropri individu in the polit process and financi market the possibl of do rps against foreign sovereign and elig tax exempt secur   so  obvious  we will begin that process  also  a coupl of you rais the issu of whether we couldn   t buy some gnmas  and the desk will take a look at that question   as the krieger madigan paper made clear  there are complic with have them on our balanc sheet becaus of the prepay risk   but we need to explor that avenu to see whether it can buy us a littl more  e with an oblig that carri the full faith and credit of the unit state govern   we would not undertak ani of these endeavor  particular initi discuss with anyon outsid the system  befor we begin the dialogu with the public in an offici way   as an initi step we would plan to includ at least a brief summari of this morn   s discuss  or the point and question rais  in the chairman   s upcom tes oni on februari   th   that would be one way of get the issu out on the tabl public   and  of cours  the minut for this meet will come out in about seven week and they presum would have a somewhat more complet summari of              the issu you have discuss   so those two vehicl will be an offici way of get this subject out in the public domain  we will also take a look at the paper with a view to whether they can be publish  perhap with a littl clean up here and there   we would have to look care at them     and i deliber did not suggest editori chang or review them from the perspect that they would be publish becaus we felt everyth need to be on the tabl for the committe   so  we would need to go back over them to see what might be sensit   it will take a littl while  but i think we can get the paper  or someth that resembl these paper  publish  and that will also further the dialogu   so  for the short run one of the primari issu is the public dialogu  which we can work on in sever dimens  with academia  with the street  and with the polit process   that was a rather clear instruct from the committe  there was also some coalesc of view about a few other avenu to pursu   mani of you found the acf worth further explor  so i think we need to continu that work   we have to figur out how it could be implement in a practic way   we also need to look care at the object or concern that were list in the paper and at some that presid   note with respect to the intersect of the lend and the supervisori function
the feder home loan bank lend program is a major exist competitor for the acf   i   d be curious to see how we would view the constraint or opportun that would aris if the acf and the home loan bank lend facil exist concurr
the studi point out that to a certain extent the acf would replac home loan bank advanc  not an entir bad consequ
an entir good consequ if it were true  but i don   t
i do believ that there may be lesson to be learn from the experi of the home loan bank
you mean that if you give out free money  nobodi will take it    laughter
yes  the effect of that free money on the behavior of the depositori institut receiv it would give us some insight into the issu that presid   rais in that regard
it is the veri activ market of that facil by the home loan bank that make me worri about the effect it has on how well peopl manag their depositori institut
yes   so the acf ought to get a veri care look both in term of lesson to be learn and also practic   if we were to go forward with it  we would have to address the point that   rais about organ an auction and the concern that sever of you rais about risk manag issu and control the collater  anoth issu that mani of you talk about was the expans of the rang of collater elig in rp oper   of cours  the short run expedi that   and i have propos would do that to a small extent   anyth els would requir a chang in the law   but i believ there was enough support around the tabl for expand the pool of accept rp collater that  even with the caveat that it would requir a chang in              law  it ought to be one of the first area we explor   we would do that concurr with the studi of the acf and some of these other option   if a chang in the law is necessari  we ought to know what we want to do and how we want to do it in case we decid to seek legisl  we should also review the transcript of this morn   s discuss to learn more about the longer term vision a number of you articul  where you thought we should end up in five or ten year   we ought to be do our other more practic studi relat to possibl adjust in the shorter term in the context of where you think we need to go in the longer run   so  on a separ track  i   d like to winnow through this morn   s commentari to see whether we can narrow down our longer run goal to perhap three or four altern   and in that regard  i think al broaddus   s suggest warrant a closer look   clear  everybodi is uncomfort with move system asset into non treasuri oblig   if there is a way we could stay in treasuri secur where the cost do not outweigh the benefit  we ought to make sure we   ve explor that opportun   marvin goodfriend is certain that he can convinc me over a coupl of beer that this is a good idea  so i   ll probabl take him up on that   i don   t know how mani beer it will take    laughter  so  i think that   s where we are  mr  chairman   to sum up  we will pursu a few avenu immedi  includ the initi of the public dialogu  the possibl of do rps against foreign sovereign and municip secur  and the gnma question   in the short run we also will look at the practic oper consider relat to the acf and the expans of rp collater   and we will continu to work on              the longer run vision of where the committe may want to go in the  efram of the next five to ten year
when would you contempl an action forc event begin to emerg   what  efram for leisur discuss do we have
well  we would expect to move forward on some of this work over the next six month  have the public dialogu and assess the foreign sovereign and municip secur option   start that dialogu in and of itself will spark a lot of debat  so that will be a use step in the right direct   in our memo we indic  and   reiter in his comment today  that we can go along for sever year  even without increas our relianc on gses  particular if purchas of foreign sovereign in some volum turn out to be a feasibl altern  befor we   d be absolut forc to do someth   but  of cours  well befor that sever year  we probabl would want to be propos legisl remedi to congress  given the lag between go to congress and get legisl enact   also  we   re go to be look veri care at implement the acf   but as a first guess  i think we   ve got anoth year or so  probabl more  befor we would have to start implement ani of these altern or go to congress for enabl legisl  so long as these interim step work out for us   is that a fair assess of the  efram
yes   also  sever member of the committe mention the near term polit uncertainti relat to spend and tax measur under consider  a year from now we may have budget propos from this administr that will provid a clearer pictur of when those initi might have an impact  in a year or two              or three after that   so by then you may feel that a shorter list of option would need to be explor on an expedit basi for that  e horizon
don  it was fair late in the morn when the chairman articul the concept that this problem may turn out to be an interim one   it could be revers and go back the other way   to me there is a fair probabl that if we view this whole episod in that context  it may chang the way we look at some of the altern  of cours  how big the problem will be and how long it will last are issu with veri wide paramet right now   at ani rate  i would suggest that you look at this from that point of view and see how it might influenc where we might want to go rather than think of it as an open end matter
right   that   s one reason whi explor the acf and the rp collater issu has a lot of appeal
let me rais one question   i   ve been push for a lombard facil  as you know   i take it that the sens of the meet is that if we do that  it would be at best a handmaiden to the acf   is it the committe   s view that we ought to see where we are on the acf first and perhap take up the issu of the lombard facil at some futur  e or should the lombard facil be taken up as a part of the acf studi and not have it on a separ track   what is the sens of the committe on this issu
i   m not a member of the committe  but i   d like to speak for the desk and it role in conduct open market oper   the lombard facil would make adjust credit more use and increas it use  and that would be a help aspect of manag reserv in the bank system   i may be an outlier  but by rais              the price i think we actual would reduc the stigma of borrow and encourag it use  that is counterintuit but in this situat  given the stigma histor associ with borrow at the discount window  i think it might work   so  i would hope that discuss of the acf would not postpon thorough deliber of the lombard facil idea you   ve been pursu   that   s not a statement regard where you might feel comfort move the rate  which is a matter that the board would have to decid
how do you coordin a lombard facil with an auction
they   re just differ tool
if you had a daili auction  you couldn   t have a lombard on top of it  could you
sure you could
the european do
yes  the lombard facil is for borrow at the end of the day
in other word  it couldn   t be an auction at the end of the day
no  it   s not an auction  it   s discount window borrow
in those countri that have both auction and lombard facil  the swiss  for exampl  the lombard rate is defin as x basi point over the auction rate   so it move constant with the auction rate
i was go to make the point that when we talk about repo  cash is the other side of a secur repo   there is littl differ between auction              repo and auction deposit   it   s just look at the process from the other side   rps would be done in the morn when all the other auction activ occur   that might involv a broader rang of financi institut and a broader rang of collater  but that   s a morn activ   fill the gap is what happen in the even at whatev rate   and whatev we call it  and it is total differ
let me interject to avoid a misconcept   in all likelihood we would institut a next day settlement for an auction among the       or so depositori institut that might be elig to particip   such an auction may not even be in the realm of possibl for adjust today   s reserv  wherea the discount window is realli about let the bank system settl on a same day basi
that was the basic reason
i share     s view that if the lombard rate  or whatev we call it  were abov the fed fund rate  which is where it ought to be   institut would be much more like to use the window
in other word  it   s like peopl who buy luxuri car   they can afford it    laughter
exact   i was a cfo in the heyday of bank worri about go to the window   i can   t tell you how mani bank had somebodi assign to kick the comput from  e to  e so it would stop work and the bank could pretend that it didn   t know it reserv posit
i   m still wonder what we ought to do about discuss the lombard facil   should we take it up on a separ track or consid it with the              acf as one of the option   in a way i   d like to see it tie to the acf   it is part of a whole packag
but i think the acf is key to a differ problem   the lombard is conceptu separ and it might even confus matter to tie it with the acf
so should i keep push    laughter
thank you   i have a question on the veri short term for   and one on the longer horizon for don      base on our experi in april of the last two year  what is the order of magnitud of the challeng you are expect this april
the treasuri keep tell us that they will have enough capac in the tt l system and i keep worri that they won   t   but i don   t have a good handl on that   sandi  do you want to comment
last year was not terribl   they manag their cash better  this year probabl won   t be aw  but i doubt that they will have enough capac  capac is like to fall rather than rise as a result of a number of other develop
i know that problem onli come up onc a year  but it appear to have becom a big challeng
it can be
on the longer term  i   m glad you   re go to be think about the vision for the futur and would ask whether you plan to includ in that some issu relat to the liabil side of the balanc sheet and to other institut              arrang   twenti year ago we began implement a new regim  mandat by legisl  with regard to the structur of reserv requir  the balanc that must be held with us   the system has evolv into one that can be thought of as compris a fortnight posit balanc  base on a number of criteria  and an overnight     hour non negat balanc   we have in a sens a two tier reserv requir system impos on certain type or class of deposit liabil   if one think out veri far into the futur  a lot of nomenclatur we use is not terribl use with regard to how we determin what is a deposit  what is a transact deposit  and what is or is not a clear balanc  in various place around the world these concept are evolv into a differ kind of structur   if we contempl a long enough period     year or more  we might envis an opportun for legisl  on these asset side issu or for whatev reason   to which we may want to attach some desir chang on the liabil side   it might give us the opportun to evolv toward a differ system wherebi the liabil of those institut that have an account with us are subject to a liabil on our account balanc sheet at some specifi frequenc   i would like to imagin that we could move toward non negat hour balanc at some  e in the futur   the technolog is go to be there   but the daylight overdraft and the overnight overdraft problem are part of the structur framework where chang could address my concern about ned   s nacf  if i knew what was go to happen on that side  then i could get a lot more comfort with his concept of nacf   but the nacf as it is  without do some of these other thing  has too mani uncertainti in term of how it might be game by depositori institut to allow me to feel comfort with it right now   but i could get comfort if i knew of enough other chang we were go to implement
i think there   s a potenti problem of overload the system by tri to do too mani thing at the same  e   one issu we   ve been tackl involv tri to pay interest on reserv
which i   m oppos to but
we   ve been unsuccess in do that and i don   t think we   re like to be success   we can take a look at this idea to see if perhap someth on that side is worth explor   but i would hesit to commit to a major studi about reserv requir and the clear balanc system when we   re tri to work on these other project at the same  e   howev  if the committe and the board think there are issu to be explor there  we should find the resourc to do it
i   ll pay for the fourth beer and marvin can convinc you
let me just clarifi someth   are we look at the acf or the nacf
the nacf is more or less off the tabl  right
that was my understand  yes
okay  i was a littl confus on that
first i want to respond briefli to jerri jordan and support what don said   if it   s onli a question of a few beer and pretzel  then i   d be support of look at both side of the balanc sheet   if it involv anyth more than that  i would suggest that we stay focus at this stage onli on the one side of it               i   m assum that implicit in what i heard you say is that you   re go to come back by when  midyear  to tri to give us some sens of your view about the short term option
right  certain on the short run issu we would have to come back to you and we will provid an updat on where we are on these longer term effort as well   it need to be fewer than eight month befor the committe is next appris of what the staff is do in this area   in addit  we will keep you inform about our plan as we winnow them down and we will come back to consult on where you think we ought to be go
in my view your agenda list is exact right   one request i would make is that you not think about the acf process in a manner that is over complic   at the end of the day we   re talk about the potenti of an occasion auction that is routin offer  it could be onc a month  for a block of fund that would provid a base   it  sn   t have to be elabor   it  sn   t have to be daili   it  sn   t have to be complic even with       bidder   i believ we can actual get where we want to go in a rather straightforward manner just by deal with the question at hand  which is   is there a way to make some fund avail in the financi sector by mean of the acf
is everybodi finish with this discuss   we can now go back to the usual meet agenda
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the familiar packag of chart with a class ii peach cover      the first chart depict current and forward deposit rate   u s  rate declin sharpli follow the committe   s januari  rd reduct of the fed fund target rate by    basi point   but the chang in expect has been notic less for rate    month out than for rate in the next six month   the current   month rate  the solid red line  fell by about    basi point in the coupl of day immedi after the announc  and is now    basi point below it level in late decemb  the   month forward rate is now rough    basi point below where it was at year end wherea the   month forward rate  after initi fall by about    basi point from it late decemb level  is now back up to where it was just befor the year end   in fact  though you can   t quit see it on this chart  the   month forward   month rate is a coupl of basi point abov the   month forward rate  show some reduc expect of eas that may have been price in further out in the calendar   euro rate fell modest in sympathi with dollar rate after the committe   s action earlier this month   howev  the   month forward euro rate is now back to where it end last year   rate in japan have been grind lower in light of the deterior outlook for the japanes economi  which   will be discuss   turn to the second page  i   ve includ a new set of chart that provid a differ indic of financi condit   the top panel depict two year govern yield for sever countri less their central bank   s short term polici rate   now  these involv slight differ matur in the differ countri as explain in the bottom footnot  but it give some sens of the invers of the short end of the yield curv between veri short term rate and the two year rate   in the bottom panel  the same concept is depict but with the substitut of the swap rate for the govern yield  and thus the differ between the top panel  where we use german govern yield and the bottom panel which has the euro area swap rate                                  a copi of the chart is append to this transcript    appendix    in the top panel you can see that in the unit kingdom  the unit state  and canada the two year note first move below the              short term polici rate last summer   in contrast  against the two year swap rate shown in the bottom panel  the invers realli onli began later in the year  around mid novemb   the import question one could tri to answer is the extent to which a consist in the movement toward an invert short end reflect an independ but parallel firm of condit in each countri or the influenc of dollar interest rate and u s  financi condit on other market   i don   t think it   s necessari to tri to resolv that debat  it may never be possibl to resolv it   instead  if we recogn this spread as an indic of monetari tight  it is clear that condit were rather tight by the end of last year and have onli eas a littl sinc then in a number of market   turn to page    the top panel show chang in the g   trade weight currenc sinc novemb  st  use the bank of england   s indic   while there has been a lot of talk about dollar weak  you can see there that the yen is down by    percent and that the euro is up by about   percent  though off it peak   but the dollar is not much chang  at least through last friday   s close  although it may be off a bit today   the bottom panel depict the differenti that i show you last  e between dollar and euro    and    year swap rate   sinc your action on the  rd of januari  the   year differenti has narrow consider and notic  through    basi point  and now stand just around    basi point   on the other hand  the    year differenti has widen from about    basi point at the begin of the month to rough    basi point or thereabout now   in the   year area it   s relat easi to see that the market place a greater likelihood on eas by the fed than by the ecb go forward  and that would be an explan for the narrow of the   year differenti   the widen of the differenti in the    year area seem most to have come on our side of the equat  it show the swap yield move in sympathi with treasuri rate  i   ll discuss that on the next page   the chart on page   are four snapshot of yield curv on date of committe meet or polici action sinc novemb and as of last friday  januari   th   if you compar friday   s rate  shown in the lower right hand panel  with those at the upper right on the day of the decemb   th fomc meet  you can see that at the short end rate on all four of these yield curv are notic lower  at the long end  howev  the industri indic are slight lower and the swap and treasuri rate are slight higher   i   d be care on my analysi here and begin by say that this is a fair brief              period from which to draw ani particular profound conclus  but i think the corpor yield have declin modest on a combin of factor  reduc issuanc and a margin increas in risk appetit relat to late decemb when the market was fair risk avers  as investor have begun to reach for yield   the modest rise in u s  treasuri and swap yield reflect the other side of that   i see some return of risk appetit  which has shift investor out of the long end of the treasuri curv into the short end  where they were look for a bit of a ralli  and also into higher yield corpor secur   also  compar with where rate were  certain in novemb decemb  expect of a reduc volum of treasuri buyback and shift in the outlook for fiscal polici  given the heighten prospect for tax cut  may be influenc this slight backup in the long end   there may also be some shift in inflat expect  but i think we have to be care here   while the    year tip spread has widen from it level of about     basi point in late decemb to around         basi point now  that onli brought the spread back it level in late novemb  which was still    basi point below where it was in earli novemb   so  there   s probabl more nois in the posit in these market than in the under data from these period   all in all  i   d put a littl more weight on the short term posit stori than on the unwind of the extrem risk avers we had at year end   turn to the next page  the unwind of the risk avers was somewhat more short live in the commerci paper market  the top panel are compar to the one i includ last month on    day and    day commerci paper spread   the bottom panel provid detail on the level of    day and    day commerci paper rate   the bold red line in the top panel show the extraordinari extent to which the spread of a  p  to a  p  widen out this year compar with the previous four year   the combin of cross the calendar year end date and the committe   s rate cut at the start of the year clear gave a jolt to the commerci paper market  and peopl felt a lot better about thing  but by the middl of januari the worsen condit in the california energi area becam appar   so i think the deterior in the outlook for the util remind the market about the deterior outlook for earn more general and contribut to this return to a pictur of extrem risk avers in the commerci paper market                turn to domest oper  on the top of the next page is a panel similar to the one i   ve shown you befor   the orang line and dot indic the drain in reserv sinc earli octob from the impact of chang in autonom factor   the   line show how much more has been drain by net treasuri redempt  compar the actual with the dash orang line  our project  show that currenc grew more than we had project for the turn of the year period  and reflow realli didn   t get us back to the level we had project   the pace of the reflow was about what we were forecast  but from a much higher level that  sn   t seem to be come down as fast as we had expect   in the bottom panel you can see how we   ve manag the relationship between    day rps and our shorter term rps   we   re work down the book of    day rps from the     billion held at year end  and we now have about     billion   turn to the last page of my packet  i thought i   d discuss briefli the extend reserv outlook through the first half of this year   work down from the top of the page  on a mainten period averag basi  we expect from now until the end of june  and these are rough forecast  the net impact from factor movement  most currenc  to drain about    billion   and the impact of anticip net redempt by the treasuri should drain anoth     billion  that   s probabl a low end es  but one that   s rather complic to forecast  for a total drain of about     billion   below that i   ve shown two exampl of how we might proceed if we tri to reduc the term rp book   case    a    depict the impact of reduc term rps to zero on a mainten period averag basi  the number i   ve been talk about here   in that scenario we would have drain of anoth     billion and would face reserv need of     billion   if we put the term rp book to zero  that would impli     billion in outright purchas of treasuri secur   if we were think of work the rp book down to about     billion  shown as case    b     that would impli outright treasuri purchas of about     billion from now to midyear   my own comfort zone is closer to the latter scenario  and that   s the approach i would intend to pursu  i   d like to note again that the net redempt es  may be low and that we could face a challeng of higher net redempt   there is a lot of uncertainti about the treasuri   s issuanc pattern   mr  chairman  we had no foreign exchang intervent oper to report   i   d be happi to answer ani question  and i   ll need a ratif of the desk   s domest oper
question   yes  presid
just bear with me   this might be a dumb question  but whi are we focus on reduc the amount of term rps
i am focus on it as the residu   it s not a dumb question  cathi   i probabl didn t make myself clear  so let me tri to do that   in      and prior year we purchas treasuri secur outright to meet the growth in under factor  and repo were use simpli to deal with short term fluctuat   as i tri to explain this morn  we have shift our approach mark in the past two year   we now purchas treasuri outright at a pace that  were it much fa   could result in our be a disturb to the market   that is my concern   i can t put a fine point on it  but i work this out with bob elsass  who head our govern secur staff   we look at the schedul of the treasuri s buyback and it issuanc of various secur   we look at our pace of accumul and tri to assess it effect on the treasuri market  in      we purchas     billion in the first half of the year and that put us on pace for an all  e record accumul of rough     billion that year   and by all account we were push the market   i d like to tri to step back from that pace of accumul   now  even     billion of outright treasuri purchas in the first half of this year and anoth     billion in the second half will result in a record break amount again this year   i d like to correct ani misimpress member of the committe may have   the number i cite are gross accumul  not net  of treasuri bought on an outright basi   i m onli tell the committe that i would prefer to continu to run a term repo book of around     billion and take the risk that the repo book might grow a              bit more  say  to     billion  if net treasuri debt redempt run fa    i   m just tri to spell out for the committe what we are plan to do
i got your messag of concern about outright purchas  mayb it s the terminolog that   s not sink into my head   you are make the distinct between term rps and outright   is that right
yes  and shorter term rps  five day  three day  two day
so you are concern about the amount of outright but you also want to reduc the amount of long term repo
my prefer would be not to reduc the book of long term rps   i m tell the committe that i do not plan to reduc it to zero
but you are plan to reduc it from     billion to     billion
on just a pure mainten period averag basi  yes  we are go to move into the area of     billion   forgiv me  cathi  it s my lack of clariti  there is a risk that redempt will be higher or that some reserv factor will grow fa  than project   if that happen  we could have a larger rp book between now and june   that s whi even if we get it down to     billion  it might at some point have to go back up to     billion or even     billion if other factor alter our reserv need
basic you re say  ceteri paribus  that you are more or less go with case    b
case    b    is what we ll be aim at   that is what i m say  my apolog
the key is that the term rp is the residu   that s his fudg factor
i realiz that   i just wonder whi he was so intent on reduc that residu   whi not let that residu be what it need to be
when the committe discuss this topic a year ago at the februari fomc meet and again in march some member express concern about a larg repo book against a mix pool of collater   i m tri to run a middl ground between those concern  which i understand  and
mayb i don t understand what was behind the author we approv earlier today   we extend  albeit just for anoth year  the same author we gave you for two year run   that is  you were author basic to go along the same track you ve been on and to explor diversif  not with an idea of reduc the amount of rps you ve been do  but rather ad to the pool of collater that you can use to expand your hold of rps   that  sn t say to me that you would like to cut your term rps in half   i know i m not get this
i think you ve express it veri well  cathi   i m suggest that take the longer term rp book down to     billion is a target but that fa  growth in reserv factor or higher treasuri redempt would tend to push it back up toward     billion  though i don t know quit how much   so the    fudg factor    is     billion to     billion
it   s ceteri paribus  in other word
you plan to be at     billion but you want to have the leeway to keep it where it is
all right  i understand
may i come in on this point   if i m hear you right  cathi  you re ask whi he  sn   t take it down not to     billion but to     billion or     billion  right
i m wonder whi he want to take it down   i think he s tell me that he s take it down so he has the leeway to take it back up again
we don t need to be driven by habit   but after y k we had a term rp book of      billion   we were abl to wind that down to about     billion  given the pace of outright accumul we were comfort with   that s where we were last august
the book then grew to about     billion at year end and we re in the process of get that level back down
that level  though  may be higher than     billion  as i see it
i understand final   i m sorri
no apolog requir
i move approv of the domest oper  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  vice chair   without object they are approv   let s move on to the staff report           son  and larri    an awesom trio
we will be refer to the packag of materi you ve receiv  entitl    staff present on the econom outlook         as you know from the  book  we are expect a sharp deceler of product in the first half of       as shown in line   of the tabl in your first exhibit   this pattern reflect  in part  a pronounc drag on real gdp from inventori invest  line    as firm seek to bring their stock into better align with sale   but it also reflect a notabl slow in the pace of final demand   in particular  as shown on line   of the tabl  privat domest final purchas are project to rise at onli a     percent pace in the first half of this year  with both consumpt  line    and busi invest in equip and softwar  line    relat weak   a number of forc seem to come togeth in the latter part of last year to damp the growth of aggreg demand   among these were the rise in energi price  wane wealth effect  and the earlier tighten of monetari polici   in addit  domest product was curb by the strength of the dollar   as i will discuss short  mani of these restrain influenc turn more favor fair soon in our project and begin to provid support to econom activ  moreov  the drag from the inventori adjust abat after midyear   reflect these influenc  real gdp growth is expect to pick up in the second half of this year and to grow at close to potenti next year   with real gdp rise at a rate slower than that of potenti  especi this year  the unemploy rate rise   by the end of       the jobless rate is project to reach     percent and unemploy then rise a bit further in        the widen slack                             a copi of    materi for staff present on the econom outlook    is append to this transcript    appendix                   in labor and product market and a drop off in energi price reduc inflat this year and next to around       percent  when measur in term of the pce price index   your next chart summar some of the key background factor of our forecast   for our baselin project  we have assum a    basi point cut in the fund rate at this meet and then a flat fund rate through        our other financi assumpt includ a near term declin in the stock market with a level out thereaft   this impli a fall wealth incom ratio through the end of the project period   long term corpor interest rate remain near current level and risk spread on corpor bond  which alreadi are high by histor standard  stay elev  reflect our financi assumpt and the project for activ here and abroad  we expect the foreign exchang valu of the dollar to declin moder   fiscal polici also is assum to be s ul next year   and final  price of oil and natur gas are expect to reced over the next two year  consist with quot in the futur market   the next chart look at the question   what has been happen to some of the high frequenc indic of activ  and how   their current behavior compar with the         recess   as you can see  mani of the high frequenc data seri that we follow have turn sour recent   the process seem to have been kick off by a weaken demand for consum durabl good  auto as well as other big ticket item  and for capit good  the upper two panel of the chart    compar the recent experi with the shade area  the declin in the consum sector are on a par with those seen in          while the drop in capit good order is steeper   the result cutback in product have been widespread   the middl left panel show a diffus index of three month chang in manufactur industri product   you can see that sinc the middl of last year the preponder of manufactur industri have been cut product   inde  the recent pattern of this index look increas similar to what happen in       accompani the reduct in product has been a spate of layoff and an upward climb in initi claim for unemploy insur   the actual layoff that have occur  and the fear of more to come  have taken a dramat toll on consum confid  the lower left panel show the michigan survey   s index of consum sen ent   and  as you can see on the tabl we distribut at the lunch break  the confer board   s expect index  which was releas this morn  also fell sharpli in januari                 one bright spot in all of this gloom is the hous sector  where activ measur such as permit for singl famili unit  after reced in earli       have stabil more or less in recent month at a fair high level  this stand in sharp contrast to the plung dure        in addit  anecdot report on consum activ in januari suggest that spend steadi or perhap turn up   your next chart address the question   what are the near term dynam of our forecast   it is clear that the extent of the weak in final demand that emerg in the latter part of      came as a surpris to mani busi   as a result  buildup of inventori were widespread across manufactur   the most well public has been the accumul of light motor vehicl  and the product adjust in that sector recent have been quit deep  the upper two panel   a similar stori of excess inventori can be told for other manufactur as well  the middl left panel  busi in some industri  such as construct suppli and industri materi  alreadi have cut product dramat  and their inventori should be brought into better balanc fair soon  howev  the reduct in output for mani of the industri within the machineri and equip categori have been relat small thus far  and further declin in the next few month are like befor the overal factori stock overhang is work off   so  what keep thing from build on themselv and the economi from collaps into recess    as i will discuss short  we think the fundament determin of final demand are sound  consequ  we see the current situat as one in which product is fluctuat around a compar well maintain final sale path in order to bring actual and desir inventori into better balanc   in our forecast this adjust occur veri prompt  we expect manufactur to slash product at a       percent annual rate in the current quarter  and factori output is project to edg up onli slight next quarter   as shown on line   of the tabl at the lower left  the sharp drop in factori product account for the bulk of the near term movement in real gdp   the lower right panel translat this into more familiar nipa term   the dark bar show the growth rate of final sale and the red bar show the growth rate of the stock of inventori   in our project  the stock of nonfarm inventori is virtual unchang dure the first half of this year  while final sale grow moder  as a result  we expect the bulk of the inventori overhang to be work off by the middl of this year   it is this rapid respons by manufactur that help check a broader and deeper unwind of activ   but an import risk to the forecast  and one that we               explor in the    recess    altern in part   of the  book  is that the abrupt of the product cut and the recent torrent of layoff announc  such as ye day   s from daimler chrysler   might lead to a sever break in consum and busi confid  that in turn could caus a sizabl contract of final sale  with all the attend multipli and acceler effect on gdp   in the context of our baselin forecast  howev  one might ask  what are the fundament forc support the expect reacceler of aggreg demand   that question is address in chart     the first fundament is monetari polici   the upper left panel show the effect of chang in the real fund rate on gdp growth sinc the third quarter of       as es  by the board   s frb us econometr model   as you can see  the model suggest that the rate hike initi in mid      damp gdp growth consider dure        the move taken on januari   of this year  along with the further eas action assum in our forecast  should begin to eas some of the earlier restraint in the next few month   the degre of restraint progress lessen through most of        the assum chang in discretionari fiscal polici  as measur by our fiscal impetus indic  also are project to boost aggreg demand  ad about a quarter of a percentag point to gdp growth next year  accord to the frb us model   in term of the compon of gdp  we think the fundament for both busi invest and consum spend will be support   look at invest first  the actual and assum eas of monetari polici and the ongo descent in the relat price of busi equip are expect to lead to further declin in the user cost of capit  the middl left panel   moreov  the bank system is vast more sound than it was a decad ago  and we don   t see much in the way of financi headwind that would imped fund for worthi project   consequ  we are project an acceler in capit spend later this year and anoth sizabl pickup next year   for the consum sector  activ should be boost by the project drop in energi price   the lower left panel show a rough back of the envelop es  of the direct effect of chang in oil and natur gas price on the growth rate of real pce   as you can see  after the first quarter of       the depress effect of last year   s energi spike begin to unwind and the expect declin in those price then contribut to pce growth   last  but certain not least  a critic fundament factor support activ is our belief that multifactor product and               overal structur labor product are still grow rapid   dave will talk about our product project short   suffic it to say  howev  that the effect of this assumpt permeat the forecast  for one  the rapid growth of structur product is reflect in a strong expans of perman incom  and  after the economi pass through the current inventori correct  in actual incom as well   inde  as you can see in the lower right panel  we expect befor tax real person incom to rise       percent next year  about the same as in      and        this  of cours  is an import forc support consumpt growth throughout the project period   dave will now continu our present
as larri has just note  our expect that the growth of structur labor product will be well maintain over the next few year is a key element support aggreg demand dure the project period  while at the same  e also help to limit inflat pressur   the upper panel of your next chart lay out the detail of the suppli side of our project   as can be seen on line    we expect growth of potenti gdp to remain abov   percent over the project period   the slight downward tilt to the growth of potenti result from a somewhat diminish contribut from the pace of capit deepen between      and       line     the weak that we are project for invest spend in come quarter   caus the growth of capit servic  shown in the middl left panel  to tail off a bit from it recent rate of increas   but with the level of invest have reach such lofti height in recent year  we continu to anticip that the growth of capit servic will remain elev over the next two year   we also expect the growth of structur multifactor product to remain at a       percent annual pace over the next coupl of year   as can be seen in the middl right panel  there has been a dramat improv in the growth of structur mfp over the past decad  an acceler of more than   percentag point   at first blush  it may appear ambiti to project that all of this recent pickup can be sustain go forward   but as can be seen by the red line  the acceler of the past decad has lift the growth of multifactor product to a pace onli just a littl abov the averag of the past one hundr year   consequ  we don   t view our product forecast as be an especi long stretch                 our relat op ist outlook receiv support from the perform of output per hour in the second half of last year   the lower left panel plot the growth in nonfarm busi output decompos into the growth of hour  the red shade area  and the growth of output per hour  the gray shade area   the speed and magnitud of the adjust of hour growth is quit noteworthi  and it result in product gain be well maintain in the second half despit the sharp slow of output growth   this certain  sn   t settl the issu of how much of the gain in product that we have seen in recent year is cyclic and how much is structur   but it is the first shred of evid on the point and bol  the case for structur improv   as shown to the right  we don   t think labor product will escap entir unscath from the sharp slowdown that we are project for activ   we anticip growth of product to slip below   percent in the first half of the year  befor rebound to around trend over the remaind of the project period   turn to your next chart  the upper left panel depict the gdp gap   with the growth of potenti output remain relat robust  the slowdown in real gdp that occur over the second half of last year and that is project to intensifi in the first half of this year lead output to dip below potenti in        the unemploy rate  shown at the right  is expect to rise sharpli in come month  reach       percent by midyear and       percent by the fourth quarter   the middl left panel place this project rise in the jobless rate in a cyclic context  an issu that was rais at the last meet  in the chart i have plot the maximum and minimum rise in the unemploy rate around postwar cyclic low point in the seri  i have also includ our forecast  the black dash line  use the fourth quarter of last year as the refer point   although we are not project what would convent be classifi as a recess when view in term of real gdp growth  the expect slowdown in activ produc an increas in the unemploy rate that is similar to a mild recess   in our forecast  both the level and the chang in labor market tight hold down nomin wage demand as the year progress   moreov  there is littl evid that chang in inflat expect  shown to the right  will be exert ani pressur on wage demand   both the michigan survey and the philadelphia fed survey show some pickup between      and      but most recent have been move sideway   all told  we are project that hour labor compens  measur by both the eci  the black                line in the lower left panel  and nonfarm busi compens  the red line  should deceler from the pace seen last year   the increas in actual unit labor cost  shown in the first column of the lower right panel  is expect to move up this year owe to the cyclic slow in product that i mention earlier   but adjust for that cyclic slowdown in product  trend unit labor cost  the measur we have found to have the most predict content for price  should slow gradual over the project period   in addit to subdu labor cost pressur go forward  there are a few other factor  highlight in your next exhibit  that eventu should help restrain price inflat   as can be seen in the upper left panel  core intermedi materi price  the black line  alreadi have soften in respons to the drop in capac util that has accompani the slowdown in the industri sector   and we anticip veri small increas in materi price go forward  as you know  energi price have domin movement in headlin inflat over the past year  and we see some consider further upward pressur earli this year   but as larri note  we expect energi price to declin later in the year  in line with the expect regist in futur market   with respect to petroleum base product  the upper right panel  we are expect a resumpt of declin in gasolin and fuel oil price by earli spring  by contrast  the upward trajectori for the retail price of natur gas is expect to steepen further over the next few month befor retreat later this year   asid from a near term jump in consum electr price associ with the rate increas that went into effect in california this month  we don   t expect a great deal of price action here  at least relat to the other sector of the energi market   the middl right panel summar these influenc in term of their direct effect on pce price inflat  the black bar  and an es  of their indirect effect on pce inflat  the red bar  through the price of energi consum good and servic   taken togeth  we expect the direct effect of energi price to subtract about     percentag point from total pce price inflat this year  after a larg posit contribut last year   owe to lag in pass through  the indirect effect remain a small  though diminish  upward influenc on inflat this year   by next year  both the direct and indirect effect should help to hold down overal price inflat   larg reflect these energi develop  we are expect both total pce price inflat and total cpi inflat                 shown in the tabl at the lower left  to be head down this year  becaus energi price have a larger weight in the cpi than in the pce price measur  the deceler is more pronounc for the cpi   in general  we are expect core consum price to move a bit lower over the project period   as we have note on a number of occas  we believ that the core pce  shown as the black line in the lower right panel  has probabl underst the pickup in inflat over the past coupl of year becaus of it inclus of imput servic charg  which are statist construct of the bea rather than measur price   those imput price have risen at an unusu slow pace recent  and in our forecast we project the increas in those price to return closer to histor norm this year  if this come to pass  then an uptick in core pce inflat could obscur for a  e the downward trend that we expect to becom appar in the market base measur  the red line  and for that matter in the core cpi   your next two chart focus on some implic of the product risk in our project  risk that we discuss in the  book and bluebook   both the buoyanc of aggreg demand and the relat subdu perform of inflat in our forecast depend import on our analysi of structur product   as we consid those influenc on the economi that could lead the current slowdown to becom a much more protract period of poor econom perform  disappoint on product seem to hold the greatest potenti for damag   there have been a few straw in the wind that could make one nervous   as seen in the upper left panel  comput price fell last year at about half the rate of the      to      period   we think most of that slower declin was associ with the strong demand and capac problem for compon that exist earli in the year  more recent price again have begun drop more rapid  at a pace consist with our forecast   but we can not rule out some diminut in the pace of technic progress here   long term earn expect  anoth indirect indic  shown in the upper right panel  have tip down over the past few month   but as you can see  there have been a few declin in that seri amidst the general upward trend of the past six year   final  the return to capit  the middl panel  has level out of late  and we are forecast some declin over the next two year   for the reason that i outlin earlier  we do not believ that these indic are yet point to a signific inflect point in product growth   we project growth in labor product over               the next five year  the black line in the lower panel  to remain near   percent   but recogn this as a risk to our project  we consid the consequ of growth in labor product return to the       percent pace of the two decad prior to       under this scenario  one could view the recent technolog wave as have play out   in effect  we may have reach the top of the s  curv  which with a healthi dose of imagin you can see in the lower panel as the shallow extens of product shown in red   the consequ of such a product disappoint are compar to the  book baselin in your next chart   in order to show someth approach a worst case scenario  we have assum in the simul that econom agent recogn the full extent of their misjudg about product earli this year   this precipit a sharp    percent drop in the stock market   the growth of real gdp under the assumpt of an unchang real feder fund rate  the red line in the chart to the right  is consider lower than in the baselin  the black line   with the demand side effect weigh heavili on the economi when the real interest rate is held constant  the meager gain in real gdp fall short of even the reduc growth of potenti  and there is a steadi rise in the unemploy rate  the middl left panel   despit the higher unemploy rate  for the next four year there is no favor feedback to price inflat  shown at the right  becaus of the boost to unit labor cost impli by the slower product growth  profit  the lower left panel  are hammer by that pickup in labor cost   in these circumst  the taylor rule call for a steadi reduct in the nomin feder fund rate   most of this declin reflect the drop in the equilibrium feder fund rate that follow from the slower growth of product   this is  in essenc  the mirror imag of the rise in the equilibrium rate in recent year that occur as product acceler   return to the blue line in the upper panel  the gradual reduct in the fund rate cushion the drop in the stock market and provid some boost to the growth of real gdp   as a result  the unemploy rate  the middl left  is lower than when the real fund rate is held unchang   howev  that lower path for the unemploy rate is accompani by higher price inflat than occur when the real fund rate is held constant  relat to the baselin project  the economi experi both higher unemploy and higher price inflat   all in all  these would be unpleas and difficult circumst for monetari polici                 i should hasten to add that these simul can onli sketch the broad forc that would be oper on the economi should product fall short of expect   the model can not determin how long it would actual take privat agent to learn about the slowdown and whether the process would be abrupt  as assum in this scenario  or more gradual   the model also can not address the consequ of these develop for consum and busi confid  which could play a central role in determin the depth and durat of ani accompani downturn in activ   nor   it captur ani special psycholog effect on foreign investor that might aris should our recent stellar perform fade   we certain do not see such an outcom as like   inde  there is a reason chanc that the acceler in product will continu rather than level out as in our forecast   but these exercis point to some issu that will warrant close scrutini in the come month and suggest the continu import of suppli side develop to your conduct of polici in the period ahead     will now continu our present
the fundament challeng we face in put togeth the foreign outlook this  e was to assess the net effect of spillov from the slow of u s  real output growth and the intern factor that had led to robust

given the length of our present  you may be wonder whether this is a brief or a hostag take   laughter   so i   ll tri to be merci brief   the final chart present your project for        sinc juli  your forecast for nomin and real gdp have been revis down  as has your forecast for pce price inflat   the unemploy rate project for the fourth quarter of this year has been adjust up a bit   relat to the staff project  the central tendenc of your project show stronger growth of real gdp and somewhat higher price inflat                 mr  chairman  that   complet our present
whi didn   t you show the juli staff forecast so we could see how wrong that was
it must have been just an oversight on my part   laughter
you ran out of ink   that was a veri interest present and quit thorough   question for our colleagu
i have a question about the project inventori adjust in this first quarter of        it is veri sharp  of cours   i was just wonder if that   s in line with histor experi or if you see some chang in the structur of the economi that is caus it to be as sharp as you have project in this quarter
it   s probabl on about the same scale relat to what   s go on in term of final demand and so on   it   s a touch sharper and fa  than histor  there   s no doubt about that   and that is base on our judgment that there have been chang in the flexibl of busi  both in term of their labor input and their suppli chain manag system  to adapt to unexpect chang in final demand that lead to these excess inventori   so  yes  we have factor in some chang in the speed of the adjust  it   s not a massiv chang  but it has been inform our decis
you indic that growth in japan is go to remain low  you also note that japan is probabl go to record it fourth consecut year of consum price deflat   that is such a poor outcom for japan   do you think this is like to caus them to shift in some way their polit approach to econom polici
i   ve given up hope that anyth will caus them to shift in some way their polit approach   there is an increas intens debat go on yet again in japan  spark in part by the fact that the yen has move so much over the last month or so   and offici of the bank of japan on the one hand and the ministri of financ on the other are somewhat at odd again  which i think is never a realli construct develop   the sourc of my greatest pessim is that the debat continu to be about the symptom as oppos to the caus of their difficulti   and the remedi that are be propos continu to be about the symptom as oppos to the caus   they distract everybodi concern from realli attack the fundament problem   now  the board   s staff didn   t get over excit about the strength that appear in q  last year and that appear to be there even through the first half   so we were not over disappoint by the outcom in the second half becaus that   s how we saw the situat   but other did see the strength in the first half as the light at the end of the tunnel   and the bank of japan often point to that develop as the light at the end of the tunnel   so it   s possibl that they will reach a point where they are in fact disappoint enough that someth will happen   if the economi actual slip back into negat gdp growth that could do it   but at the moment i think the most like outcom is that it won   t actual slow that far  assum that the u s  problem don   t becom ani greater than character by our baselin forecast   and therefor the polit will to attack the real problem will gain no more energi than it has now
it   s call a hedg
it sound rather pessimist
i think she   s absolut right on that
they   ve lost their financi intermedi becaus they onli have bank
and the bank system with all the input of taxpay money continu to deterior   if they can   t respond to that  i don   t know what is go to make them respond   it   s just scari   presid jordan
thank you   i   m follow up on       s question about inventori   i want to tie it togeth with your assumpt and what you know about import becaus they are big swing factor quarter to quarter  both compar to the decemb  book project versus now and also go forward   i can imagin a scenario where the overhang of inventori can be tie veri close to import good and so we would not expect to see much of an adjust in inventori of domest produc good   so i   m wonder what you assum or what you know about that
well  let me talk a littl about what we know   we know that much of the inventori overhang initi began in domest produc auto   we know the physic size of that overhang   so  that clear is one sector where we could say that the excess inventori has been in domest produc good and where we can set asid the import issu   anoth place where we have seen major imbal begin to develop and adjust take place is in construct materi and suppli  much of which is domest produc although not entir so   we obvious import some lumber and other construct suppli   but a great deal of that adjust also  and we can tell that from industri product  has been in domest               industri   anoth area where we   ve seen overhang is in materi   those good have a broader rang of sourc of suppli   clear  some of the overhang in steel has been in import steel   but we know also that a lot of it must have been domest produc becaus we can see the product adjust take place  for exampl  this morn   s data on the most recent week number for steel product indic that it was down again this past week   so we know that a lot of it has been on the domest side   i   ll defer to   to speak about what we know from the import side
i don   t know a lot of detail sinc we onli have trade data through novemb and we think some of the biggest shock might have come after that  import of consum good and some industri suppli actual held up in novemb but we   re expect them to fall off and join the crowd in the decemb data  which we will not get for anoth two and a half week or so   to be honest  i don   t know much more than that from the import data
the one sector you didn   t mention is retail   veri larg retail compani headquart in cincinnati and columbus are tell us that    percent or more of their stock is import and that the aisl are full of good and no custom
we do have some export data from other countri   it   s clear that there have been sharp reaction and that some of this correct will take the form of a big drop in import in decemb and januari   that will be the transmiss mechan to some of these countri   inde  i think that   s to be expect   we did see some declin in mani categori of import in the novemb data but not  for exampl  in consum good where i had expect to see it on the ground that some of the first declin in final sale had come in that sector
do we have custom receipt for decemb yet
not that i   m awar   i don   t think it   s complet   i have not seen ani
i   m talk about the data that we previous use to tri to es  import   it didn   t work all that well
no  it didn   t work well   there were appl and orang problem in tri to use those data and we had to be care   those data have not been routin use for some  e now
the reason i rais the issu is that if someth veri dramat was go on in decemb  even that terribl seri is like to show it
yes  that might show it   i will ask whether that seri  have fallen into disreput  nonetheless exist so that we might look at it
presid jordan  i   d also note that our gdp forecast in some sens take account of what we see happen to industri product  which is domest product   we saw such a sharp contract in manufactur activ in decemb  and in part just on the basi of what we know about auto  that we would expect anoth signific contract in januari   so we believ the domest side product data are alreadi lead us off to a veri weak start to the quarter
you have forecast a fair sharp recoveri in the second half of the year after we get through with the inventori correct   i believ a lot of that hing on your assumpt first  that product hang in there and second  that that get factor into peopl   s perman incom expect and their consumpt behavior                do you have ani troubl squar that with these plummet measur of consum confid   if peopl were realli all that perman incom orient  would consum confid be drop the way it is
that s a good question   i can see how the confid survey  becaus the question are ask in term of one   s expect about what will happen to the economi  could be plung and yet peopl   s view with regard to their own person situat and their individu longer run incom prospect could be well maintain   so implicit in our think  although we don   t write it down this way explicit  is the view that onc we get past this inventori correct  and the layoff announc slow down and so forth  peopl   s expect about the longer run prospect for the economi will start to go back up again   we don   t envis a sever confid break that is long last   but that   s clear a risk to the forecast  and it   s the reason we includ an altern simul in part i of the  book with a greater near term loss of confid
i   d say it   s a serious concern becaus we have consumpt slow down rather dramat but not declin  and one could look at those consum survey and certain be more pessimist   a coupl of small factor held us back from be even more pessimist about the near term consumpt outlook  one was that we were hear from the auto maker that auto sale through the first    day of januari  while suggest no under improv from the decemb figur onc an allow was made for a bump up in fleet sale  were not continu to fall off steepli   anoth was the admit shaki week indic that we see on consum               spend in the mitsubishi index and the  son red book  which also were tend to tell someth of a stabil stori  at least through the first half of januari
the figur out this morn was also support of that view
yes  it was still up       percent for the first three week of januari over decemb   but i   d say there are veri signific risk in this area   the chart we   ve shown you on consum sen ent certain are disturb
do we have ani evid that consum confid index at the point when they are taken are a coincid or a lead indic of consum spend
well  the seri that larri has plot in his chart  which is the michigan expect index  is actual a part of the lead indic   so there is some evid in that index that expect tend to lead overal activ   in term of the predict content of the confid measur for consumpt  they tend to be more coincid than lead  but there   s still a bit of predict content for the month ahead
one would certain think that there   d be veri littl predict content   when peopl get gloomi they don   t go to the store   it   s not as if they say     well  i won   t go to the store tomorrow
actual   fuhrer  who is here today  has done a lot of the staff   s work on this   as we   ve note mani  e befor  the one seri that seem to have a bit of predict power is the one about unemploy expect
mr  chairman  at our bank we   ve run a lot of regress over the year on these consum sen ent survey to see whether they   re lead indic  it has been our experi that it   s veri hard to get ani predict power out of them
the way an economi come back in this context  even with consum attitud deterior  provid that final demand is not fall veri rapid  is for product to move suffici below the level of consumpt so that the rate of inventori liquid is veri larg   the mere fact that there is a zero out there  that the inventori chang could be zero somewher down the road  requir that the rate of chang must slow down   but what that mean is that product then must rise to a point closer to the consumpt level   and the turnaround in product creat increas incom  so the dynam don   t requir a chang in psycholog   it   s the veri arithmet of the rate of liquid and the gap between product and consumpt that ul  creat these v shape curv   i rememb when we went through the      recess that there was one thing i found realli fascin   at the bottom of the      recess  the onli forecast that had ani credibl at all was for econom activ to keep go straight down   and it couldn   t becaus the rate of inventori liquid at that  e was at it maximum  so the inventori situat stabil and the whole economi eventu began to turn around  histor that is a typic phenomenon   if what you have in your project is right  name a sharp first quarter liquid  that seem as a best es  to be in process  presid pool
i want to thank the staff for prepar the altern simul that has a monetari polici assumpt that more or less approxim the read from               the fed fund futur market   could you help me to understand that by explain longer  term interest rate in that forecast relat to the baselin and how that feed into certain sector  especi hous and busi fix invest
sure   we don   t call that the    full pool    simul   it   s the    partial pool    simul  if i may put it that way   in that simul the onli addit financi market variabl that we put into the model was the path for the fund rate taken from fed fund futur and eurodollar futur   we allow the model then to take that on board in term of forecast long term interest rate   those rate come down in that simul and provid some s ulus to the interest sensit compon of spend and in addit have a littl effect on the exchang rate as well   so  in essenc  this  sn   t fulli incorpor the market base variabl that you had suggest we at least take a look at   we plan to do that at some point   we   re still work on it
as i understand it  in the baselin forecast you have long term interest rate remain about where they are  which is the onli ration forecast of long term interest rate anyway   i say that becaus if you had an expect major chang  you   d have big capit gain and loss that should not exist in the marketplac in a predict fashion   so it may realli be that what is sensibl here is to leav long rate about where they are  which is what you   ve done in this altern simul  and just chang the shorter rate
at our last board meet in new york our director were less than kind or fulli complimentari about our forecast skill  and other than tri to stick up for my colleagu i didn   t have a veri good answer for them                do we have a process around the system of ask  given that in our forecast we all miss this sharp drop off in the third and fourth quarter  what we have learn from the experi that would enhanc our likelihood of at least get it better the next  e
we don   t have a formal process of a forecast pool comparison across the system   i do like to think that we are in touch with the staff at the reserv bank  especi at the bank that prepar formal forecast  and compar note  certain the research program of the system is intend to address those issu  though with a consider lag   so at this point i guess i   d have to say that we do so onli veri inform   obvious  we are alway engag in the process of evalu our forecast and tri to understand what went wrong   hope we learn someth from that but the increment are small
i think we collect wonder whether the new economi  or whatev element in it prove durabl  has chang the dynam of the way thing work  we are just too close to it at this point to judg  but we will keep ask that question
i think part of the answer is the new economi  we can   t explain it all in term of the new economi becaus the model reflect the histori of all previous period   i can   t speak for the model that we use formal either at the board or at the bank  but i can speak for my model  which i ran for mani year and whose structur has veri much in common with what we use here   what happen in retrospect is alway the same   the problem with how we forecast is that we have a larg quantiti of histor data and we fit a model  which becaus of the limit of our techniqu requir that we use constant coeffici to captur the various relationship               throughout the  e period   what you will find is that unless you shock these model extraordinarili  you will never forecast a recess  the reason is that the coeffici are constant throughout the period   and sinc the economi in general tend to gravit toward equilibrium  the model  becaus it is pick up most of it observ from non recess period  is go to act in such a manner that if demand fall  interest rate immedi fall   that creat a resurg in demand that prevent the recessionari forc from develop fulli   we find anomali  such as the fact that in the last three recess we had oil shock  which arguabl were signific in affect the subsequ recess  although it   s a small sampl   yet if we take the structur of the model  either today or back then  none of them would have forecast a recess  i think what is wrong with our model is the assumpt that a singl structur for both the expans phase and the contract phase is the appropri way to captur the dynam of the economi in the model   if we had enough recess so that we had two separ system of model we could argu that the coeffici in the recess model are differ and that when we go from expans to contract the coeffici chang and we get a sharp discontinu   there is no way to forecast when that   s go to happen except by luck   i   m not say that there is no one who forecast it   i   m basic say that it is a random event   there are those who look back and say    i forecast the recess     and i   m say it was good luck becaus that   s what it was
i made the comment to my director that certain last septemb  octob  and novemb i was talk a lot to peopl who               said that the economi was go to hell   but everi month of everi quarter i   m talk to peopl who say that the economi is go to hell  so that  sn   t help me a whole lot
and that   s the sourc of the argument that the stock market has forecast seven of the last three recess   peopl   s memori are remark select in these sort of period   in ani event  i would conclud that we don   t have the capac actual to forecast a recess   moreov  i would argu that a recess evid is increas becom a differ breed of anim than an expans   someth differ happen   psycholog is a crucial issu   when the economi is in an expans phase  we have uncertainti but not fear   and peopl take action  they do thing   put an economi in a psycholog of fear  and nobodi is interest in whether earn growth is   percent or    percent   they just want out   you may rememb  for exampl  back in      when riskless off the run govern secur were    basi point or so abov the on the run issu  which meant that peopl were essenti say     i want to get out  i don   t care whether it   s good  bad  or indiffer  just get me out      they want to be liquid  mean they want to be in cash   and that is not a movement along a simpl linear continuum from certainti to the psycholog of uncertainti  or even to consider uncertainti but with a willing to commit to a certain degre   it   s almost a move from ration to irrat   so i would say to your director that we may not have been abl to forecast this  but neither have they   and it will be the same the next  e   write it on a slip of paper  so i don   t have to repeat myself   i can say     here   s what i said the last  e      i don   t know what we can do about it   i think all we can do is calcul the probabl that that may happen   in other word  as we get closer to the point where the fabric of the economi is in danger of               tear  we can say that the chanc that it will happen are greater  but that   s the best we can do   we can onli creat what is essenti a probabilist type of view   it is conceiv  and i suspect it is the case  that the new technolog have made everyth move fa    but i don   t think that has chang the fundament natur of the difficult problem   i don   t know whether i   m do violenc to what the staff would think about our model  further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   presid parri

thank you veri much  mr  chairman   there   s not a lot to say about the new england economi that i haven   t said at the past sever meet   all the avail data suggest that the region economi continu to grow  albeit more slowli  with tight labor market and price that are rise more rapid than elsewher in the countri   but the vast major of these data are backward look and do not captur the grow sens of region uncertainti that we hear from our busi contact and that we see in the confid indic   busi and consum confid in fact turn sharpli downward in the region in decemb  with the falloff concentr larg               in respond    view about futur condit   howev  the level of the indic remain in posit territori relat to earlier year  these indic are in harmoni with quit a few of the anecdot report we   ve receiv   our contact in manufactur  particular supplier to the auto industri  have seen sharp declin in activ   product is return to level that would have been consid quit good five year ago  but it is sharpli lower than at this  e last year  and that downward adjust is pain   not all manufactur have been negat affect   some firm report doubl digit gain in sale or order  especi for comput relat  medic  and electr power equip and for non automot transport  though the doubl digit pace was a bit below that report earlier  contact also were concern about rise input cost  especi energi price and the high cost of financ for all but the most high rate firm   inde  the steep decreas in busi confid in decemb in massachusett was attribut larg to tighter credit term and other rise cost  i have to say that at our meet in decemb i was taken aback by how differ new england seem to be from other region  particular those in the center of the countri   we   ve expend some effort dure the interim period to determin whether new england realli is differ or whether it seem differ becaus we   re miss someth   as i note on the negat side  like the rest of the countri  we do now see clear evid of a manufactur slowdown  especi in auto relat industri   high end home are not be built as frequent  although there are still quit a few under construct   commerci real estat contact in boston suggest that the spring like will show littl in the way of new demand   and we have seen quit a               soften of tax revenu in massachusett  particular in novemb  which is the latest month for which data are avail   but we see continu area of strength as well  servic and construct employ continu to grow and we hear report that layoff at dot com  in manufactur  and elsewher have made find scarc labor easier  moreov  we   ve had more than one report that focus on the threat to a slow but still solid pictur of an excess of fear  uncertainti  and doubt  as well as press coverag of recess possibl   thus  i tend to believ that the new england economi may be a bit stronger still than the nation as a whole  though the situat bear care monitor  as i look at the nation scene  i   m also struck by how fast relat good condit have deterior  even sinc mid decemb   my thought are somewhat along the line of what bill   was talk about befor in term of the fallibl of forecast   it is true that downward spiral happen quick   wit the summer of      as an exampl   also  in mani of the postwar recess fed polici continu to tighten even after the recess had begun  either becaus inflat was a particular problem or becaus recognit of the deterior state of the overal economi was slow to occur  or some combin of those factor  so  i find myself ask three question  are we now in a recess   how long will the downturn  or whatev we call it  last   and what is the right polici respons  first  are we in a recess now   our bank   s academ advisori council met last week  and jim stock and ray fair discuss their model base answer to this question while paul samuelson and other base their view on insight gain from long experi   the consensus was that the probabl that we are now in a recess is onli               about    to    percent   and council member were clear of the view that our polici option are not great limit by the threat of inflat   they also share a concern that the fed may be place too much emphasi on the econom impact of movement in stock market   this assess of a relat low probabl that a recess is current under way is similar to the  book s and our own forecast   we expect the first quarter of      to be quit slow or even slight negat  with a pickup after that  but i   ve also come to the view that whether or not we   re in a recess right now is probabl irrelev   last year at this  e real gdp was grow at a pace of near   percent and privat domest final demand was rise at a rate of about   percent   if the  book or we are at all right about the first quarter of       real gdp growth will be zero or close to it  and growth in privat domest final demand will be about       percent   the averag drop in gdp from peak to trough over the nine postwar recess was onli about       percentag point   so even if it turn out that we   re not in a recess  it sure feel as if we are  second  how soon will the downturn be over   the  book and our bank s forecast suggest a slow first half and a pickup by the second half of the year   that would be a veri short downturn  at least in postwar histori  despit the fact that the peak to trough gdp drop would be fair larg   there are sever reason whi this is the case and whi this period may not be seen as a recess in the full of  e   first  inflat is not a problem  so the amount of earlier polici tighten and it  e are not now work to great exacerb and extend a slowdown   the fiscal situat is good both nation and local  so govern spend can be a sourc of support   there is an inventori overhang but it seem small relat to earlier period   construct spend               has not been overdon in this expans and the bank sector remain a sourc of strength   final  major foreign economi  inde the world in general  are in basic good shape  japan notwithstand  and can provid some support as well   thus  while the slowdown has been sharp  there is reason to believ it will be short  third  what is the appropri polici respons   that   s obvious a topic for discuss later  but i think a coupl of observ are relev now   i   m struck by the absenc of upsid risk in all of the  book scenario   inflat rise onli veri modest abov   percent even with     basi point of extra polici eas  and unemploy jump about   percentag point even in the strongest scenario   with this rang of possibl  we should definit move decis now and be prepar to do so at the next meet and mayb thereaft   but i remain a bit skeptic about all of these one side scenario   for one thing  there   s a small but increas probabl that fiscal impetus in the form of a tax cut will be larger and come sooner than we would have expect even quit recent   i don   t debat that a veri sharp slowdown seem to be in the work  but i believ there are negat consequ to think that the upsid risk has total vanish
thank you  mr  chairman   in the tenth district  econom growth has slow further sinc our last meet   manufactur and even some area of homebuild are experienc outright declin in activ while other sector general are grow at a slower pace   as far as we can tell  for the district   s economi as a whole growth is still posit and labor market are still relat tight but far less so than they were just a month ago   moreov  with all the layoff announc and talk about the               slow economi  consum clear are becom uneasi   in our survey of district contact  busi are show more caution  they are wait to see how the economi fare befor they make ani major decis   employ edg down last month and  in a departur from prior experi  last month   s slowdown in job growth was due more to weak in demand than to the lack of qualifi labor that we   ve talk about in the past   a lot of the job loss in decemb were in manufactur and construct  and these are also the sector about which we have been hear the most report of declin activ late   and we are hear of extend layoff at our local auto manufactur plant   we   ve also been get a steadi flow of layoff announc from other area as well  which could limit job growth in the next coupl of month   retail sale have been sluggish   despit heavi discount  sale in decemb and earli januari were up onli modest over a year ago   mani of our contact said uneas about the economi was caus consum to put off purchas  especi of big ticket item such as auto  on a more posit note  some area in commerci construct did hold steadi   work continu on a number of larg project  and commerci space is still in relat short suppli in most of our citi   a few contact express concern about overbuild in the retail market  but otherwis market seem to be in general balanc  of cours  energi activ remain a sourc of strength in our region  expand as fast as firm can find equip and worker   the district   s rig count climb further last month and is now at an   year high   in our district inflationari pressur remain relat subdu and may even have eas slight sinc our last meet   onli a few of our busi contact report abov normal wage increas  less than in the past month   retail price also appear to have edg down last month due to some heavi               discount   to be sure  some manufactur have been hit hard by higher input cost  especi for natur gas   howev  they are not find it ani easier to pass those cost on than befor  let me turn to my comment on the nation economi   i think recent event have confirm our concern  or my concern at least  that the economi might slow more dramat than desir or than thought like onli a month ago   incom data on econom activ suggest that the slow continu and  like the board s staff  i have mark down my outlook for near term growth   but also like the staff  over the longer run i still remain confid about the under resili of our economi  current  though  we are in a cyclic slowdown   weak in the economi is like to be broad base   consumpt  especi durabl good expenditur  and busi fix invest continu to soften   residenti hous should tread water  i suspect  as low mortgag rate help to prop up demand   but inventori invest  as we   ve alreadi note  is soften notic   incom inflat data confirm a trend of moder inflat pressur   given that the economi is slow  that energi price increas are show some sign of unwind  and that inflat expect remain well anchor  inflat could eas some  this project econom weak and moder inflat outlook suggest to me that a    basi point reduct in the fed fund rate might be appropri for us to consid   in my view  the current feder fund rate continu to repres a tight polici  the issu is not just whether we   re in a recess but whether polici is tight  and i think it is   a    basi point reduct would take us toward a more neutral polici and would reflect prudenc   i would suggest  as i have befor  that it is in the earli stage of a               polici shift that we can be more aggress in our rate action   as we get to lower rate level  we should be more cautious about ani chang or hold the rate constant to assess the situat   it is at  e like the present that i think we can  and probabl should  act a littl more bold  let me also take a minut to talk about the risk   as i   ve said  i think the longer term outlook is for a pickup in econom growth as we get into the second half of the year   but there are import risk to this forecast   first  i think invest could declin further   softer aggreg demand has a depress effect on busi fix invest and futur busi spend   in light of weaken financi balanc sheet and past spend level  busi fix invest may be particular vulner  second  consum debt servic level remain relat high and asset valu have soften   these factor and the low save rate  along with declin consum confid and slower employ growth  could undermin consum spend and the economi   s growth   and final  the foreign sector continu to embodi some risk  with our larg current account deficit and perhap a slow in econom growth elsewher  i believ there are some risk in that area as well   these are the kind of factor that we need to have in mind today as we consid our polici action in the next part of this meet   thank you

i was refer to that cartoon of a few year ago   it had a chicken with your head on it and it came off
certain the downsid risk have increas  perhap even sinc januari  rd  particular on the intern front   in recent week we   ve seen sign of slower growth abroad  with lead indic in mani of our key trade partner move in the wrong direct   this could be the first  e in a long  e that all of the world   s major economi are slow sharpli at the same  e  at the begin of a new monetari polici cycl  which is where we are now  the need for decis action is usual clearer and stronger than it will be later in the cycl   further eas is clear need now   we have littl to lose in make it substanti  later on  sever month from now  the risk of one eas too mani will be much higher   one reason for front load the eas is to get the addit s ulus into the pipelin as soon as possibl while it is clear need   anoth corollari reason to do it now is to reduc the need for a larg move later when it might prove to be the one move too mani   if the last move in this cycl turn out to be a mistak  let it be a small mistak   a third reason for front load polici was recent illustr by one of my colleagu   he is furnish a hous and was about to do some heavi duti shop for               furnitur   but a promin furnitur store in dalla announc in the middl of januari that it will be have a big sale in februari  so my colleagu is now wait on the sidelin and save his money for the sale   a like tax cut in the next few month may alreadi have some potenti spender on the sidelin   the near term damag will onli be magnifi if we also give peopl a reason to wait for the monetari polici eas that they and we expect will be necessari eventu   anoth    point cut at this meet would go far toward nip in the bud our recess or banana or whatev we want to call it

thank you  mr  chairman   overal  the district economi has evolv recent larg as has the nation economi  as best i can judg   consum spend was lacklust both dure the holiday season and sinc then  and sale promot and discount have been intens   employ gain have decreas and labor market condit appear to be a littl less tight than they were earlier  although i don   t want to exagger that   in the servic sector today in our district it seem easier to get a job than to get servic    laughter   the manufactur sector is clear in difficulti   the mine sector is weak and natur resourc for the most part  outsid of the energi sector  are struggl   and anecdot  most come from our banker  suggest that higher energi price are great stress both household and busi  the banker expect delinqu rate to rise   they are see some plant shutdown as a consequ of the higher energi price and seem to expect more of that                not all is negat  there are a coupl of region bright spot   mayb the most obvious and distinct one is commerci construct activ  which is quit strong  residenti construct activ also has held up well  as far as the nation economi is concern  i   m in general agreement with the contour of the  book forecast   but i serious doubt that we will avert a recess   i say that for sever reason   one is my sens of the inventori situat   the other is my experi with the type of consum spend forecast in the  book  as i look back over the data for the postwar period  we   ve seen consum spend as soft as depict in the staff s outlook for the next four quarter onli in recessionari period   of cours  consum spend is onli part of the economi and histor pattern aren   t alway repeat  but that pattern of consumpt expenditur realli rais a flag in my mind   i recal that back in      we at the minneapoli fed had prepar intern a forecast with a veri similar pattern of consum spend  a type of pattern we typic see in recess  although we weren   t forecast a recess   one of our economist observ that if we got that path of consum spend  we were go to get a recess   he turn out to be right   so it seem to me that the probabl of recess at this point is uncomfort high

mr  chairman  as elsewher in the countri  econom activ in our district has soften somewhat   it soften quit mark in decemb and appar somewhat further in januari  although we have a few hint of some level out in district activ in januari   and i gather that bal or   s economi has been look stronger over the last coupl of day  especi for the bar and the t shirt shop    laughter   otherwis  though  our contact in the retail sector report weak sale in both month   one of our director is the recent retir ceo of the hecht   s depart store chain in this region   he indic that decemb was the roughest month for retail in a decad  though he did say that sale were a littl better than               expect in januari   i   m not sure what was expect  but in general the retail pictur is weak  with perhap some level out this month  as elsewher  manufactur activ in our region  and manufactur is a big part of the econom base in the southern part of our district  is veri weak  with paper  furnitur  and textil especi hard hit   of cours  the textil industri is in the midst of a longer term structur shift  but the current situat certain isn   t help   there has been an increas incid of layoff at factori and laid off worker are have more difficulti find substitut employ now than they were earlier   one modest encourag report from the manufactur sector  at least in our region  is that the rate of declin seem to be diminish   it was less pronounc in januari than in decemb  which i guess hold out a bit of hope that busi firm are make some progress on the inventori correct and might be a littl further down that road than is general believ at this point  labor market overal remain tight  although not as tight as they were  they   re still remark tight   a long  e friend and busi contact ask me the other day if i rememb the jobless recoveri of the earli part of the decad   i said i did  and he said     well  we   re now in a full employ recess       laughter  with respect to the nation economi  it   s hard not to be impress by the weak data that have come in sinc our decemb meet   we have a slew of discourag report from the manufactur sector   the index of three month chang in industri product  for exampl  hit it lowest level sinc decemb        that suggest weak that extend well beyond the motor vehicl industri   and  as other peopl have note  household and busi confid has clear weaken               dramat   it   s alway difficult to understand a sharp deterior in confid such as this   i think part of it may be that whenev the fed act to restrain the economi after a period of unsustain strong growth  the public and the market see an actual declin in econom activ   there   s alway a lot of nervous until peopl get some sens that it   s begin to bottom out   and i don   t think we   re there yet  with inflat appar well contain  at least for now  i think we can reason eas further at this meet without materi endang our longer term credibl   i do believ that we should exercis some caution in do this  so i would endors the point that you made  cathi   and i would add one other point  which is that virtual all postwar recess in the unit state have been preced by a sharp deceler in money growth  occas by ongo tighten of monetari polici  and that   s not the situat right now  i   d like to make one final comment  mr  chairman   let me prefac this by say that i   m not tri to put inflat target back on the tabl  i lost that one last month and i recogn that   but i do worri that we may lose someth with the demis of our explicit consider of the money suppli target at our januari and juli meet each year   that was alway a separ agenda item   and while i don   t think veri mani of us were give a lot of weight to the money suppli target per se  it was a nice occas to think strateg about monetari polici issu as oppos to the shorter run tactic issu on which we normal focus   person  i found these discuss veri use as the context for the shorter term tactic issu we had to deal with in the interven meet   and hope  mr  chairman  they were help to you in convey the sens of the committe   s view in your semiannu tes oni   i don   t               know what is go to happen tomorrow  but i would recommend that we consid reinstitut a separ agenda item involv some discuss of the longer term strateg issu  with mayb some longer term simul besid the one in the bluebook   thank you
i don   t know about the rest of our colleagu  but i get a chart on m  and m  everi week
so do i
so it   s not as though we   re not monitor it
i realli wasn   t think about the aggreg so much  although certain if we want to discuss money suppli trend  that   s fine with me   i m just talk about take a longer term look at where we   re head and mayb reaffirm our object   i have in mind the kind of discuss we had a few year ago when we were look at whether or not we should approach reduc inflat in an opportunist way or in a more deliber way   i hope we leav a place on our agenda for that kind of discuss
i think we tend to do that in ani event   take this morn s discuss  for exampl   it was an add on to a rather long agenda   we   re go to have short agenda at some point and we can put in an agenda item on strateg and other relat issu at that  e   vice chair
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district trail the nation economi in strengthen in the earli part of the     s and then grew a bit more slowli thereaft   appar justic prevail in the end becaus i think we have the most op ist district commentari so far today   the second               district   s economi has shown few sign of slow in recent week and there is littl indic of ani pickup in inflationari pressur  in the fourth quarter  privat sector job growth deceler somewhat in new jersey to a     percent annual pace but remain strong in new york state at     percent  weak in manufactur employ  of cours  is a lesser problem for us becaus so much of manufactur has long sinc left the district  but the bit of weak we saw in that area was offset by strong job gain in construct  busi servic  and financ  as a result  unemploy rate were littl chang   retail sale were report to be steadi in earli januari  and steep markdown of clearanc merchandis  especi cloth  help to keep inventori at satisfactori level   construct and real estat remain general strong with onli veri scatter sign of soften  main in the manhattan offic market  which is still veri  veri tight but slacken somewhat in the fourth quarter   avail rate have edg up   rent have stop rise but certain have not start to fall   and subleas activ has risen sharpli  larg in space given up by dot com compani that no longer exist   region purchas manag report steadi to stronger busi condit in decemb as well as increas widespread input price pressur   and final  local bank report weaken loan demand  some further tighten in credit standard  and an uptick in consum delinqu rate  against that background one might think  if one attend the same sort of parti that mani attend on the upper west side  the upper east side  lower manhattan  staten island  or elsewher  that everybodi seem op ist   of cours they are not  they are deep in the doldrum and predict that the end of the world is veri close upon us   that lead me to believ  even though we have essenti the same forecast for the               economi as in the  book  that we are experienc an inventori adjust   we expect it to be quick  deep  but rather short  end by the end of the second quarter   our forecast for the first quarter is not quit as weak as the  book s  but we certain agre that the latter is a definit possibl   we have the same view as the  book that the economi will snap back becaus of our belief in the persist of the ongo product improv   howev  i do think that busi confid is a veri consider downsid risk   i   m much more concern about that than i am about consum confid becaus i agre that consum confid tend to be a coincid indic by and larg   becaus of the real concern that i have about busi confid  a concern i have heard reflect around the tabl  it   seem to me that a definit addit eas action by the committe continu to be in order
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess it   s not surpris that the twelfth and the second district are do well  in contrast to our region   we ought to be view it as payback  e for the prosper we enjoy in the    s   it probabl will take long memori to rememb how good it onc was  i didn   t realli need to see the michigan survey of consum sen ent or the confer board s survey result to know that consum sen ent had deterior  that s becaus of an experi i had ye day morn when i got to the offic   befor i went to a brief with our economist  my secretari thought i ought to see her heat bill for the month of decemb and that of her elder aunt   the number were realli shock   novemb and decemb were the coldest month on record   combin that with the rise in energi price and it s clear that peopl are take a huge hit   so it   s not               surpris that confid is down  though we don   t realli have an answer to governor     s question about whether we are see a perman incom kind of effect  we   ll have to wait until it warm up and see how it thaw out      refer to the steel industri as bleak   that   s not what my contact are say                                             spent his career in the steel industri said steel is    an unpreced disast     which is wors than bleak   he said we should expect to see more bankruptci of integr steel compani  further consolid  some plant close  and sustain reduct in employ in the steel industri   i   ll come back in a minut to some structur issu about larg manufactur compani more general  a larg produc of plastic said that busi has fallen through the floor and is still fall   he s found anoth floor   after more than two year of continu over   auto assembl and part plant have no over  and have been announc layoff that they hope will be onli temporari   but it now look from the latest news in the last coupl of day that there will be some perman plant close in our district  possibl as the result of the weak in manufactur  retail report that for the first  e in sever year they had no troubl at all hire the season worker that they need   as a reflect of how much weaker the region is than the nation figur suggest  unemploy claim in decemb rose from        a year ago to over        this year  a    percent increas   my guess is that our increas in unemploy is go to be temporari   as soon as the benefit run out  mani peopl leav the workforc  or they head west or south                put a posit spin on all this  one director said that the dramat loosen of the region   s labor market mean that firm will be give smaller rais than they had earlier budget for this year   and no one is offer retent or recruit bonus  which were a big issu with everyon last year   anoth director said his firm is see more applic than open for the first  e in two year   as of last week  auto supplier said they now expect no pickup in order befor the fourth quarter   and we were told that just sinc the first of januari there has been a notic declin in order from both mexico and canada  a retail said the drop in sale in decemb was so sudden that he at first suspect that their comput were broken   he claim that the shake out in retail will be wors this year than in the         recess   everi divis of limit store had declin year over year same store sale  at hallmark store sale were down   percent year over year  after complain most of the last year about the difficulti of attract deposit  our banker report strong deposit growth in decemb and earli januari  which is consist with the nation figur we   re see   they also say that mortgag refinanc is boom again  and home equiti loan demand is veri strong  which might not be a good sign   one banker said it is common for homeown to take out addit equiti when they refin  reinforc what was suggest in some of the materi we were given   other comment by banker includ a rise trend of late payment and a rapid and serious deterior in their credit card debt  turn to more general remark about the region  i think we are now go to see what i view as a longer term declin in the old economi industri that had been the               strength in our part of the countri over recent year   i now believ that the right way to think about what we saw in the last few year in the behavior of these compani is that the healthi glow of a fever was mask a serious fundament ill   they didn   t deal with their problem and it   s go to be veri difficult for them to deal with them now  as we   re see in what the steel compani and their worker are ask for  when i talk to civic and govern leader in the region  they remind me of somebodi who run a retail establish and say that the custom aren   t come  the product aren   t sell  and our competit is kill us  so i guess we   ll have to rais our price   i say that becaus these politician want to tax anyth that move in order to subsid those part of the economi that are not move   they are scrambl to find ani and everi way to rais tax  main becaus popul and employ are declin and the revenu base is now start to declin   so sudden they   re desper for more revenu  let me turn to the nation economi   with regard to the remark about how difficult it is to forecast recess  and i certain agre with that  i d note that that is true also of forecast recoveri   when the economi turn  it is surpris how rapid and vigor it some  turn  as we have seen in the past  recess often have been associ with some unforeseen event  whether it was the gulf war of      or the near recess in the aftermath of the long term capit manag debacl  a develop that didn   t turn into a recess   but we are some  just as surpris by the vigor of an upturn  most recent in        if we go back to the fall of       in the forecast that we were look at and the blue chip forecast as well  nobodi foresaw the vigor of          so the surpris can come from both direct                underneath most forecast exercis there   s an inher philosophi about the natur of the market economi   a lot of model histor have been base on what i think of as older idea about econom activ   they tend to reflect the view that there is a natur tendenc for the economi to stagnat  for a decay process to take place as the old s ulus wear off in the absenc of new s ulus   the opposit view  of cours  is that the market economi is inher resili  that it tend to expand except when it get knock down for some reason or other   and as we know  over  e it has been knock down for a whole host of reason  some  even becaus of pervers econom polici  monetari or fiscal   i believ that one aspect of our job is to do no harm  not to be a part of the problem   and whether or not we need to be a part of the solut  in term of the s ulus  is a differ way of think about thing  like tom hoenig  given the current circumst  i think our polici recent has been more restrict than is appropri   and i come to that view with some difficulti   i read the yield curv and other thing as tell me that  but i don   t read the money number as tell me that   so i put a lot of weight on the staff s explan that mortgag refinanc or this and that are affect the money number and that by may or june m  growth is go to be down to   or   percent   if that  sn   t turn out to be true  i   m go to chang my assess about how restrict polici is  i agre with bob   on the general idea of front load polici chang  my view on this is symmetr  i mean it in both direct   at  e i m just as impati to move toward restraint as to move toward eas   but i recogn  given the extern pressur and the dynam  that it   s alway a lot easier to front load on the eas side than on the other side   while i would support the    earli    part of bob s               suggest  i do not agre with the    often    part   i would front load  move earli  and then paus
thank you  mr  chairman   at this point it   s unclear to me whether the present paus in econom growth will be a relat short inventori correct or a more serious downturn   but there   s plenti of evid that real output growth has stall  and even with the cut we made in the fund rate earlier this month  the rate still seem much too high in my view for today   s condit   i had prepar a long statement to persuad you all of this   at this point i think read that would be pile on  so let me just tick off the point and tri to get through them fair quick  one piec of evid is that in the face of rather pervas econom weak the real fund rate is current higher than it has been for most of the last seven year   a second point relat to the  book baselin forecast   last  e  as i saw the unemploy rate in the baselin forecast rise to   percent  i said that i didn   t think that did anyth for us in term of inflat credibl and that we should act to cut off some of the rise in unemploy   well  if i didn   t like   percent  i certain don   t like       percent   a third point is the taylor rule   general sinc i   ve been here  the taylor rule  becaus of the implicit output gap assumpt in it  has been tell us to rais the fund rate   now even the taylor rule has turn around and is tell us to lower the fund rate  more on the current number front   last  e we notic sever sourc of weak  the stock market  foreign real growth  auto sale  industri product  diffus indic  consum confid  and even the begin of a slowdown in high               tech invest spend   this  e all of those sourc of weak have been confirm and we have sever new develop   one is the veri negat tone of the beig book  which bob   mention earlier   anoth is the downward revis in the blue chip forecast  the averag anticip real growth for      is down from     percent in novemb to     percent in decemb   i don   t take that forecast liter becaus i think most of us would be delight if we got     percent real growth this year  but for a stodgi index that repres an averag of    forecast to be revis that much in one month seem rather remark to me   the same is true of the goldman sach forecast model  in which the predict probabl of a recess went from    percent in novemb to    percent in decemb  again  i think a remark chang in one month   the staff has cut it forecast for consumpt  invest  and final demand veri sharpli   the high frequenc chart that larri present earlier show  and this is an old fed term     disquiet similar    to an earlier period of recess   one could go on and on  but i think all of these indic of a slowdown on top of the earlier soft make a power case for reduc rate  this is all from a short term perspect   we should also be tri to find a polici path that work for the longer run   but for sever reason i think an earli fund rate cut satisfi this longer term test as well   for one  again without go through my whole list  most indic of inflat are fair quiescent right now and have been downgrad at least moder sinc our earlier meet   for anoth  as a number of peopl have said  if polici is out of equilibrium  as i think it is  to avoid instrument instabl we should make our big move back to the middl or even lean on one side earli in the process  not late   third  while i don   t want to steal his thunder  don is go               to take us through some strateg simul tomorrow and to me they further strengthen the case   i   ll let don explain all that tomorrow   this is an uncertain world  no indic is perfect  and model should onli be taken with a grain of salt   but it s hard to imagin that a reduct in the fund rate would be a mistak when so mani sign are point in one direct   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   follow the intellig lead of my colleagu  i also will truncat what i was go to say   i was go to begin by say that the circumst surround us seem fill with great uncertainti   but have listen to everybodi who has spoken thus far  in some sens i think the circumst surround us are fill with great unanim and certainti  name that we do have a risk of what some peopl euphemist have call a banana   i don   t think we are there yet
we   re on a slipperi slope
we may be on a banana peel   let me note some of the reason i think we   re not fulli there yet   first  most of the weak that we   ve seen clear is in manufactur  it has not yet spread broad into servic  but it   s broad and deep in manufactur   second  as we start or move toward the middl of this process of weak  the bank sector still seem to be relat strong  so that sector is unlik to add to our problem at this stage at least   a third reason  and other have mention this  is that the real estat market have been if anyth relat healthi  have said all of that  obvious i think the risk are primarili to the down side   we   ve alreadi had quit an exposit on consum confid   i  like other  am               quit surpris and concern about the veri rapid chang we have seen in that   and even if it is a coincid indic  it   not bode well for consum actual help to shore up the economi   and like bill    i would also put perhap more weight than other have on the state of busi confid   obvious  a great deal of the economi   s strength has been driven by invest behavior   in fact  the staff   s expect is that product will hold up  i presum that it is built into the forecast that we   ll get back to a situat where equip and softwar invest is posit as oppos to total flat   in this expans that kind of invest has been heavili financ by the market   the financ gap  as i   ve said befor  is quit larg by histor standard  and that mean that the tone in the financi market is realli quit import now   it is true that the market show a rebound to somewhat healthier condit after our januari  rd move  but as the staff present point out  the commerci paper market could be describ as anyth but healthi   and we also have from the senior loan offic  survey ongo evid that condit and standard with respect to loan for medium size and larger compani continu to be tight  other have rais the issu of strategi  so let me join in by comment on my general sens of what it should be   i think we   re face with two altern   one  which is bad but relat manag  is that associ with the baselin forecast   the other altern is far wors and perhap even less manag  in that case  it   strike me that the appropri approach to strategi is to be veri aggress up front  recogn that we have a chanc later to see exact how the medicin has gone down  if you will   i think it   s also import to rememb  and no one els has mention this  that we have a number of differ thing to say in our press statement in addit to our               decis on move the fed fund rate   and even if we move it down by    basi point today  have put in     basi point of eas within a month  it is far too earli to suggest that the balanc of risk is anyth other than to the down side   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in our perpetu journey along the economi   s mythic curv  we came to a sudden hairpin turn late in the fourth quarter of last year   with a quick and aggress maneuv  i believ we   ve stay on track  but this passag is leav us with a new landscap to negoti   to belabor the obvious  there is no doubt that we are now in a slowdown of potenti omin proport  and yet  as the  book recogn  this could still prove to be a growth paus   after all  we   ve seen such paus befor in this expans   and onc we get this worrisom inventori correct behind us  we might be off to the race again   inde  there is still a lot of strength in place especi in the huge servic sector of the economi   among other factor  the bank are still healthi and open for busi with rate much more attract than sever quarter ago   labor market are still tight  with unemploy still veri low   and recent retail and other anecdot evid has been more upbeat   the veri intens of the inventori correct under way hold promis that unless demand implod  and that   s an import caveat  that correct will soon run it cours   there   not seem to be much reason for a serious collaps and good reason to expect renew strength   but to me an earli return to veri strong growth also seem unlik  consid three of the major driver of the recent boom   the first is consum durabl   over the past twelv quarter  it growth was in the teen in five quarter and               in two of them it was well abov    percent   but that rate fell to minus   percent in the most recent quarter   furthermor  consum debt servic burden over this period rose to level that match the high of the late     s   it s hard to see a new boom veri soon in consum durabl  busi fix invest  anoth major driver  has trace much the same pattern   in the past twelv quarter it grew at annual rate in the teen in six of them  with growth in the first quarter of      at    percent   in the most recent quarter it was at or near zero   capac util has fallen substanti below it averag level   it s hard to see a new boom there soon  final  the stock market rose steadili from august      through march       with the s p     reach a price earn ratio in the mid   s   today that measur is still well over     match the previous high of        from that level it   s hard to see much room for anoth sustain rise in the market that would rekindl the wealth effect  in summari  mr  chairman  i believ we are at an import junctur   i   m op ist that the economi can and will soon be okay  but i see a clear and present danger in the veri short term   while this inventori correct run it cours  consum behavior may be the key   if the consum decid to go into hibern  the entir economi could easili follow in a self fulfil propheci   i hope we will aggress counter that possibl now and then see what emerg in the spring   fortun  the outlook for inflat seem to give us a comfort degre of room to maneuv   with two quarter of sub trend growth alreadi regist and the current quarter plus one to three more in prospect  the inflat outlook over the forecast period seem favor  thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   the trend of downward revis in the staff and privat sector consensus forecast  as well as in my own  has continu over the intermeet period   while they now point to near zero or even slight negat growth in the first quarter  there is yet no evid that the forecast for the near term have themselv stabil   there has been a lot of talk around the tabl of pessim regard the near term outlook  so i thought i   d focus my remark on the basi for some op  about the recoveri from this veri sharp slowdown  that op  is found on sever consider   first  i do believ that a period of below trend growth  which now seem inevit at least through the first half of this year and like a littl longer  will have benefici aspect in term of unwind some of the excess of the long period of robust growth   and i refer not onli to the probabl excess of output relat to potenti   i m talk about excess in equiti valuat in some sector  excess in term of a frenzi pace of invest that has produc over capac in some sector  and excess in term of leverag in both household and busi balanc sheet   now i admit that what i had in mind  or had hope for  was a much more gentl version of what i call a revers soft land in respons to our polici tighten   but the sharper version has the benefit of get the job done quick  allow the fed to eas as the process is under way  the second reason for op  is that i see  as the staff portray veri well in it present  a seri of reinforc develop in support of a project recoveri in the second half of this year and into        monetari polici will clear be support such a recoveri  with the combin dissip of the restrain effect of the earlier               tighten and the effect of the recent and prospect eas   the prospect of further declin in energi price remain good and the project depreci of the dollar is in my view plausibl   and perhap especi import is the assumpt that the under pace of product growth will remain high  if not as high as was earlier project   this suggest an accumul of profit invest opportun at the low rate of invest project through the first half of this year  set the foundat for sizabl increas in equip spend in the second half and into        last  but probabl not least among the forc that may support recoveri is that we will have fiscal s ulus   i suspect that the come fiscal s ulus may be underst in the  book  i would not be surpris to see the tax cut becom effect earlier and to be larger cumul or more front load  or both  than impli in the  book project  a third consider that support some op  is that the sharp of the declin in product that appear under way this quarter may reflect a veri front load inventori correct   perhap this will be an it version of the tradit inventori cycl  one that is sharper but also shorter than classic inventori correct  to achiev a balanc between the anxieti about the immedi weak and near term downsid risk versus the op  about a relat quick reviv and a move toward trend growth next year creat a real challeng for monetari polici   that s becaus of both the lag in the effect of monetari polici and the practic difficulti of rapid revers the direct of polici  especi from eas to restraint   the polici challeng is that there may be noth or littl we can do about the weak in the economi dure the period when it   s like to be most intens  name in the first half of                    and especi in the first quarter   but we can power reinforc the rebound that the staff project with onli slight addit eas  so the question we face today are how much insur we should buy against a sharper and more persist downturn and what degre of rebound we want to encourag on top of the forc i have mention abov   it   s relat easi to see the appropri of front load  so i don   t think the decis that we face at our meet tomorrow is that difficult   but i do believ we will face a challeng thereaft about how to continu
thank you veri much   have we heard from everybodi   no  presid pool has not yet comment
i didn   t know i was go to get the last word this afternoon  in the eighth district there is a sens of caution  but i think deep gloom would be the wrong term to use   peopl seem to feel that thing have flatten out   the bank system appear to be strong  there is some increas in problem loan but not larg number of default and delinqu   everybodi is awar of the twa bankruptci and there is a great deal of local support in st  loui for a quick reorgan in the bankruptci court   it appear that twa is go to be reorgan under the ownership of american airlin  with essenti no employ impact   my guess is that all will continu smooth on that front  i   ve been search to find the op  level of gloom becaus i think it is too easi to be all one side in assess the current situat   let me comment on a point that i don   t think has been mention   there is no question that decemb s weather was lousi   it was the coldest and snowiest decemb in mani  mani year   i think we need               to tri to sort out how much of what we are observ is an impact from day lost at work and day lost by retail and so forth in decemb  i have a sens that decemb s weather is not the primari stori  but let me give you a few number that i got from my up contact   domest airfreight last year through novemb  compar to the same    month period of the previous year  was up     percent   but in the month of novemb      as compar to novemb       it was down     percent  the same was true for intern traffic   in       year to date through novemb  intern airfreight was up        percent  but just compar novemb      to novemb of      it was up onli   percent   so novemb is the month when the downdraft realli hit and that predat the worst of the weather  howev  my contact at up and fedex both are project an upsw in the second half of      after a slow first half  which is consist with the pattern for the year that our forecast show   up is put a conting plan into place  howev   the compani has a work assumpt that busi in the year      will be up    percent over the previous year  but is develop a conting plan that assum busi will be up onli   percent   so up manag are knock   percentag point off their growth assumpt and make plan for what they will have to do if that scenario materi  my up contact say that his folk have survey their     major custom and those custom see weak busi in the near term but a pickup in the second half of the year   so  again  that fit with the pictur that we   ve develop  the onli other point i   d like to mention in term of the nation economi is that to a larg extent our sens about how these process work come from a long               experi with busi cycl fluctuat   histor  until the           recess  both long  and short term interest rate turn at the cycl peak or within plus or minus two month from the peak   this  e  long rate reach a peak  depend on exact which seri one look at  back in the spring of last year and have gone down quit a bit in recent month   al broaddus note that money growth at this point is well maintain  histor  there was a substanti cycl in money growth   we don   t have that this  e   past recess have alway involv residenti construct   typic we see big declin in hous   this  e hous start are hold up   so i think the prospect are that  yes  the economi is go to be weak   but i don   t believ that we have a fall  out of bed situat   we do need to respond  i   m not tri to say that we don t   but i think we want to be care that we don   t have a sens of more gloom than is justifi by what we know   i   m talk about the op  amount of gloom here
you did get the last word   we will recess until      a m  tomorrow morn   thank you  everybodi   meet recess                                  wednesday    morn session
mr  madigan
as background for this brief  i have distribut two chart from the bluebook in a packag entitl    materi for staff present on monetari polici altern        the baselin scenario  shown by the solid line in chart    use the key element of the staff   s view of the macroeconomi to extend the  book forecast through        under this baselin  and in contrast to those shown in bluebook in recent year  monetari condit are seen as alreadi relat close to those that  over  e  would fo  sustain econom growth   in effect  the real fund rate is now es  to be veri close to it long run equilibrium valu  the rate that eventu would result in no output gap and stabl inflat   the fomc is assum to reduc the nomin feder fund rate slight further  anoth    basi point at this meet  and then to hold that rate over the forecast period   as shown in the upper right hand panel  the real fund rate eas somewhat more over the balanc of this year becaus short term inflat expect  as proxi by four quarter inflat in the core pce shown in the lower panel  edg up a few tenth over        these lower real short rate help cushion the negat shock that the economi current is experienc   nonetheless  the unemploy rate  the middl panel  rise over the cours of this year to near       percent   still  core inflat declin onli veri gradual over the next few year becaus the effect nairu edg up over  e   this occur becaus the catch up of wage gain to previous product increas  as those increas level out  bring the restrain effect on inflat of the previous acceler in product to an end   the other scenario depict in chart   focus on two major suppli side uncertainti  the level of the nairu and prospect for product   the dot dash line assum  in contrast to the staff   s view  that the current   percent unemploy rate is sustain   the dot line portray the much less appeal possibl  discuss by dave   ye day  that product growth soon revert to it      to      averag of about       percent  rather than remain at the   percent rate of the baselin   in both case  monetari polici oper under a taylor rule would eas   but the                          a copi of     materi for staff present on monetari polici altern    is append to this transcript    appendix                   committe   s choic are consider more attract under the   percent nairu scenario than in the baselin or in the product slowdown scenario   here we have assum that the committe opt to take the windfal part in lower unemploy than in the baselin  the dot dash line in the middl panel  and part in lower inflat  the lower panel   with structur product continu to grow strong  the es  long run equilibrium real fund rate is about unchang from it rough   percent baselin level  but the actual real fund rate can run well below this valu for the next few year to fo  the spend consist with the higher sustain path of output   achiev that track for the real fund rate requir a consider reduct in the nomin fund rate  to near       percent by the end of next year  befor tighten after that   chart   shift the focus from the suppli side to the demand side of the economi   the dot dash line portray a situat in which final spend is temporarili weaker than in the baselin  push the economi into a recess this year   the taylor rule call for aggress eas  with the fund rate declin to       percent by the fourth quarter as unemploy rise steepli to about   percent   inflat  after initi edg higher becaus of weak in the dollar  eventu drop below the baselin  ul   though  with under product growth remain strong  the real fund rate need to be return to it es  long run equilibrium valu  a littl abov   percent   the dot line  by contrast  assum that the stall in output that is current evid is due entir to the desir of busi to adjust inventori rather than to persist weak in final demand  which rebound prompt in the second quarter   the upshot is a growth paus   in this case  the taylor rule  which look at the current output gap rather than the situat like to prevail in the futur  still call for an eas in the fund rate to       percent in the current quarter   it then revers cours fair quick as pressur on resourc remain intens and as polici need to adjust to the perman higher equilibrium real rate that result from stronger spend propens than in the baselin   even with the tighter polici  polici   not succeed complet in cap inflat near current level dure the simul period   market price suggest that investor see a differ econom outlook than the one portray in the baselin   in particular  futur quot now reveal expect that you will cut the fund rate to near       percent this year  befor begin to firm polici in       and longer term yield do not indic concern on the part of investor that such a polici cours will produc heighten inflationari pressur   appar  mani investor subscrib to some combin of the low nairu possibl explor on the previous chart and the potenti for appreci econom weak assum in chart                   market quot and survey suggest that investor  consist with this econom outlook  anticip that you will cut the fund rate by at least    basi point today  with a few appar see the possibl of a    basi point move  and state that the risk remain weight toward econom weak   consequ  the    basi point action of altern a  even if it were accompani by the anticip balanc of risk statement  would like lead to a sharp selloff in financi market   nonetheless  the committe may see benefit from this cours  especi if you think that market interest rate probabl exagger the degre of monetari eas that will ul  be consist with sustain growth and stabl inflat   take account of the usual lag in the effect of polici  the more accommod financi condit that would evolv from action now would have littl effect on near term weak as inventori are adjust   inde  the bulk of it effect may be felt when the weak has alreadi pass and when fiscal expans measur may just be come on line  with the combin potenti provid excess s ulus to spend   but  as was evid from your discuss ye day  mani committe member see good reason for choos the stronger     basi point action of altern a    even if you view the staff outlook as the most like outcom  mani of you clear put substanti weight on the possibl that the economi could turn out to be appreci weaker   such weak could be prompt by ani number of factor  such as deterior confid  on which you receiv anoth read ye day   but it could be exacerb by a substanti larger than expect negat respons in financi market to a more measur polici action  result in a substanti further pullback in risk take   that could involv a selloff in the stock market  a widen of spread in the open market  and addit stringenc in loan term and standard at financi intermediari   moreov  a sens that the staff may be too pessimist about the sustain degre of labor market tight would suggest that inflationari pressur go forward could remain relat subdu even with the ad s ulus from more aggress action at this meet and consequ stronger aggreg demand   this  and the fact that inflat expect evid have remain reason well anchor  may be seen as give the feder reserv scope for decis action to shore up spend and output  and even to front load such action to help safeguard against cumul weak   with regard to the balanc of risk sentenc  investor anticip that a    basi point move today would be accompani by a statement that the risk remain weight toward econom weak   such an assess would seem justifi  even after a    basi point reduct  by the lack of firm evid that growth has stabil  much less begun to rebound  and               by a sens that inflat pressur are more like to abat than intensifi if demand remain weak   a statement instead that risk were balanc would surpris market particip  who  as note  seem to be anticip near     basi point of further eas this year even after a     percentag point action today   market would probabl sell off in respons as price adjust to the prospect of a much flatter trajectori for the fund rate   if the fomc announc that it saw the risk as still weight toward weak  ani immedi reaction would probabl be mute  although it seem more like to be a bit negat than posit  given the perceiv possibl of a    basi point move today   there is a chanc that such a statement could condit market to ralli sharpli further in the event of appar weak econom data   the word of the announc could help make clear that  although the fomc might see the risk as still skew toward weak  it remain op ist about longer term prospect and recogn that consider s ulus was now in the pipelin   the chairman  of cours  also will have the opportun in the semiannu monetari polici tes oni to temper market percept should they evolv in a way inconsist with the committe   s object
question for     everyon is talk out  let me start by review what we discuss earlier just to give us a littl context   we experienc a remark surg in activ dure the first half of last year  part in respons to y k   we saw some extraordinari number   product number for some high tech industri were up    percent and more on a year over year basi  order were come in at a pace that caus order backlog to surg almost vertic upward   the acceler in activ was veri clear unsustain in term of ani plausibl longer term scenario  and henc it was by no mean a surpris to see a slowdown in growth   what we didn   t anticip was how fast that slowdown would be  in retrospect  what we have seen recent is an obvious deceler in busi invest in durabl equip and consum expenditur on durabl good   a prime exampl of unsustain growth in spend on the consum side was the rise in the number of car on the road at a pace that just could not be sustain   we were go to run out of park and highway space relat soon at the motor vehicl sale rate we               were experienc in the earli part of last year   the capit stock  especi in the high tech area  began to rise at an inordin rate   our es  of industri capac growth indic an extraordinari pickup in a number of the high tech area that could not realist be project to continu  as i have note befor  the demand for a broad rang of product in the high tech area may be doubl annual  but suppli has been increas even fa    as a consequ  the industri has experienc a glut that has erod prospect profit even though under demand has been move up at a veri rapid pace   a good part of what is go on in the high tech area clear fit that descript becaus there is no evid of which i   m awar to support a conclus that these technolog are approach a state of matur   to be sure  person comput have exhibit some element of the tail end of the    s    curv  but onc we get beyond person comput and some relat technolog  there   s noth in the high tech area that is even remot suggest of a matur process   i say that even though the internet consum market look like a dud in the sens that no one realli has been abl to find a high profit mean of use the internet in a busi to consum mode  what has happen  howev  is the emerg of extraordinari improv in the cost structur on busi to busi applic  with unit cost fall in a lot of area   not onli has the abil of busi firm to control their intern cost structur with respect to physic invest flow and inventori continu to improv  as we can see veri readili on the factori floor and in all sort of servic area  but it also has becom quit appar that more effici inter compani interact are have a quit measur effect on overal product   in that regard there is just no evid that we               are close to an inflect point in relat to an    s    curv   so  as best i can judg  we   re not look at the end of this high tech boom   what we are observ is a realli quit dramat intra long term cycl  if i am allow to choos simpl terminolog    laughter  the stock adjust that is now under way clear stem from soften final sale   we can see it in motor vehicl sale  in applianc  and in new order for all sort of capit equip   final sale have fallen at a pace that has been fa  than anybodi expect  i   ll get back to that in a moment  and inventori have back up veri quick  but becaus improv suppli chain manag and flexibl manufactur techniqu are in place  the respons in product has been veri quick and  as we   ve observ  quit pronounc   but while consumpt is fall fast  we have not yet seen  at least through the month of decemb  ani clear evid that inventori are be liquid   the rate of accumul has come down veri dramat  but the declin in product that we have observ has not been enough to move output below final sale   as a consequ  as best we can judg inventori of manufactur good  forward of the produc and in the distribut channel basic  are probabl at rough zero inventori chang as of decemb   the presumpt is that we are get some liquid in januari but that we are nowher near the tail end of this inventori adjust process   in other word  it   s not as though the liquid began in octob and will be over by februari   there   s no evid that that is the case   we do know that product and compani receipt are fall  but they have not fallen below the level of final sale  so more inventori adjust is ahead of us  what has to happen first is that the inventori sale ratio have to stabil  a process that is probabl under way now  and then those ratio have to fall to the level               consist with the downward trend in those ratio associ with the adopt of just in  e inventori practic   and inde the  book project an inventori trend that in effect accomplish that   one can argu that first  and second quarter inventori number may have to be redistribut in relat to the  book forecast  but at least at the end of the forecast period the  book has inventori sale ratio back down in line with where we would expect them to be on a just in  e basi  the inventori adjust appear to have been far fa  than we expect  princip as best i can judg  though we realli won   t know this except in retrospect  as a consequ of improv in inventori manag   obvious  we are observ the effect of the remark chang that have occur  for exampl  in the area of bar code scan in retail   some    year ago merchant still had to use paper record  store them  and reorder period   their current inventori were to a larg extent unknow until they shut down the store and took an inventori   even then they didn   t know precis what inventori they had until mayb week later   now busi know in real  e  and in an ever grow number of case there are internet or electron interfac system that in effect work off the bar code in the retail store to reorder from supplier   the supplier probabl see the data befor the vice presid of the retail establish see them  if the current inventori adjust process is inde move fast  then ani presumpt that the process will take as long as it did ten year ago  when the last signific cyclic contract occur  is probabl not go to hold up   i don   t know how fast the current inventori adjust is go to go  but it will sure be fa  than in the past   the danger is that while the adjust process is fa  and technolog has               augment it speed  human natur has chang not at all   and human natur respond negat to chang and uncertainti   as i mention ye day  when the economi is in an expans phase  which is still go on but slow down  increas uncertainti in and of itself rais risk and induc peopl to differenti among the risk they are will to take   and if the fabric of confid is broken becaus it is truli shot  the issu is never which among altern risk individu will choos   they don   t want to take ani risk  they don   t want to know about the differ level of risk  they want to be wholli liquid   and that  as i mention ye day  is the reason whi in the fall of      we found the extraordinari circumst where even riskless instrument  off the run treasuri instrument  were sell at    basi point abov those that were on the run  now  that has noth to do with the take of risk  it   s a sheer liquid fear respons  we are nowher near that point at this stage despit the fact that confid has deterior a great deal  albeit from veri high level   i trust no one has been rais the analog about fall off the proverbi    stori build    laughter   in ani event  what   s happen is understand   the adjust process is quicker  we do not seem to be experienc a signific acceler in final sale in januari   first of all  despit the drop in consum confid  chain store retail sale data do not look bad   they have risen from their decemb level  and last week   s data were basic not bad   as   mention ye day  the inform we are get from the auto compani indic that retail demand through the first    day of januari was about where it was on averag in decemb   but you will recal that decemb start off a lot better than the averag for the month   inde  when we question the automak on decemb   or thereabout  they came back with es  for the month               that were onli modest lower than sale in novemb   ten day later  the floor had fallen out of the motor vehicl market   so even though we don   t have    day motor vehicl sale anymor  my suspicion is that the    day sale would have been drop substanti dure decemb   januari sale thus far have been higher than they appar were in late decemb   now the actual publish number for januari is go to be higher basic becaus sizabl fleet sale  of which we have been appris on a confidenti basi  are be put into the number  presum for market purpos  that is go to exagger the extent of the turnaround unless sale in the last    day  for which we have no inform  fall on their face   rememb that in the motor vehicl busi the last    day account for far more than one third of the month   s sale   so while it   s quit possibl that thing could turn around  there is no evid yet that that is the case  i don   t know whether or not the hous sale figur have been publish
they are due out at       a m
the figur will be quit strong   now  have said that  of all the poor statist we have  the hous sale number win the prize everi year   they have the largest revis and often even the sign is not right   but at this particular stage  i am not inclin to look a gift hors in the mouth   i do think the proposit that final sale have not deterior in ani signific way in januari is at least consist with the fragmentari data that we have   and the clear weaken in product that we   re get in certain area of the economi in januari  although product is not fall on it face  is probabl an indic of the inventori liquid that is now under way                through all of this  as i have indic previous  there is littl evid of which i   m awar that long term profit expect have deterior to ani signific extent   inde  in term of the data that were shown to us ye day  es  by street analyst are off a bit for the long term but nowher near the extent to which the short term result are  i must say  howev  that coupl with all of this is a realli serious energi problem   it is not a season problem and it is not about to go away   the natur gas product problem is veri sever and is feed into the electr power area   we have a newli aggress opec  which is not go to make thing altogeth easi   the presumpt of an earli return to lower energi price just is not consist with anyth we can see out there   energi is a major player at this point   clear  as has occur everi  e in previous energi crise  it has sap consum purchas power   so over and abov the capit stock adjust that is bring final sale down  the drop in consum purchas power stem from both oil and natur gas develop is signific   and insofar as anyon can judg  the increas cash flow to domest oil and gas produc is not creat a degre of capit invest that is offset the declin in consumpt expenditur   so over and abov the so call    tax at the border     which is the result of rise price of import crude oil and which exert a full dollar for dollar drain  we presum are also get a net drain for domest produc energi in that incom is be shift to those whose propens to spend is lower than it is for those from whom purchas power is be taken  the profit margin declin owe to cost pressur from energi are quit signific   data that we have put togeth here indic that direct energi cost               account for about one fourth of the increas in unit cost of nonfinanci and nonenergi corpor in the second half of last year   of the remain three fourth  an unknown part doubtless reflect energi   s impact on final good sale  whose soften has led to a lower level of aggreg product and has tend to slow cyclic product   so the energi effect is clear a good deal more than one fourth if one is assess what caus the signific reduct in the total profit margin of nonfinanci corpor  exclud energi corpor  dure the third and fourth quarter  obvious  the margin of energi corpor went up  but the increas certain was far smaller than the declin that have been occur in the nonenergi sector  as a consequ  there is more to the overal econom outlook than just strict the question of an adjust process stem from capit stock correct  we have a real problem come in from left field   it is in a sens wholli unrel  although one can argu that a sizabl part of the problem is increas energi demand  which in turn is a function of the same technolog as those that are exert pressur on mani other part of the econom system   but whatev it is  it   s there  it   s import  and as far as i can see  it   s not go to go away for quit a while   we have put togeth a quarter energi account system for the corpor sector  and as far as i can guess the code were not written for the short term  they were written to last   i think we   ll be keep that system up to date for quit a while becaus i think energi is becom a major player in a number of the data that we tend to look at  in summari  we   ve got a veri rapid chang economi  one that still has a distanc to go on the down side   the key characterist at this stage is an inventori liquid process  which of necess alway end and some  induc a v shape               recoveri   the januari data and the continu leap in structur product growth both suggest that the v shape recoveri is the most like outcom   but after experienc this huge bubbl of specul activ and look at price earn ratio  which are not by ani mean depress  we can   t be sure that this expans will just slow down  then pop up  and continu the way it was   we may have a deeper problem face us here  though i grant it has a low probabl   i would feel a lot more comfort if a number of the specul element in the economi were now much reduc  if baa aaa spread were to come down to where they were a year or so ago  and if a lot of the skittish in the bank industri were not there   and i also wish that japan were do better becaus we can   t forget that it has the second largest economi in the world and it is in serious troubl   so far in japan all we   ve seen is a sluggish quarter by quarter perform that has not had ani repercuss   but hibern bear also look tranquil  some day that huge economi is go to wake up or realli go to sleep  and i don   t know which of those two is realli the most like outcom  all in all  i think what is involv here is a judgment about how this economi is evolv   to me the evid strong suggest that we are in an advanc high tech and just in  e inventori type of econom system  includ the capit good market where adjust happen far fa  becaus inform is so much more readili avail   if that is the case  sinc we are deal with mood swing that are root in an unchang human natur  then i think it follow that monetari polici must also compress itself into a narrow  efram   that mean we have to move fa   sooner  quicker  and complet the oper in a shorter period of  e   at least that   s what strike me are the implic for monetari polici of this new high tech environ                in that context  move by    basi point today  as a number of you have suggest  strike me as the right move along with retain the balanc of risk statement to the down side   i have been concern about the possibl that our move so fast in a month would suggest either a knowledg of fact that nobodi els know or that we are get scare   fortun  i guess  the market as a result of ye day   s consum confid index have now put someth like a    percent probabl that we   ll move    basi point   and in the preliminari draft of our press statement that i   ll read to you  if we choos    basi point  there is a general statement that product gain are hold up   the main purpos of that statement is to recogn the sever of the problem we have and the necess to act  while still indic that the under structur of the economi appear to remain substanti in place   that   s my reason for includ it   vice chair
mr  chairman  i fulli support your recommend and the reason for it   i think the onli possibl altern would be to eas even further  and in my view that would be veri unwis becaus it clear would give an indic that we do know someth that other peopl don   t know or that we   re scare  neither of which is the case   therefor  i think a    basi point eas with the balanc of risk statement toward weak is the appropri answer
i   m in agreement with your recommend  mr  chairman
presid  n
i fulli support the recommend   let me comment briefli   i remark ye day that i thought the probabl of recess was uncomfort high                but what i would say even more strong is that i recogn that i at least can   t forecast turn point   and while i would like to base polici go forward on a forecast  i have so littl confid in forecast how the economi will perform over the next two  three  or four quarter that i   m reluct to do that   so  in tri to get anoth perspect on polici  i   m think about real interest rate and the real feder fund rate   and it seem to me that the fund rate   need to be lower at this stage  certain by    basi point at least   i think that   s the appropri move now and i agre that a bias in the languag toward weak is appropri
mr  chairman  i certain support your recommend   i   d like to make just a brief comment about the lag in this process   i think it   s import to recogn that market interest rate have move ahead of our action in anticip of what we   re go to do   in explain this move  when we   re give speech and that kind of thing  we should emphas that a lot of eas has alreadi been reflect in the marketplac ahead of our action   for exampl  the two year constant matur rate move below   percent in octob  drop below       percent in earli decemb  and then by earli januari it was down to about       percent   so the market has move ahead of us and we have some eas alreadi in the pipelin  which clear show up in the hous number  as i mention ye day
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i also think that your analysi is absolut right in the sens that what we   re deal with is a high tech  high product economi that is slow veri quick   we do have to be               care becaus it could pick up again  but at this stage i think    basi point is absolut the right move and the balanc of risk statement toward weak is also correct
mr  chairman  i certain agre with your recommend  while we have remind ourselv over and over  includ in the comment you just made  that we can   t do anyth about the short term  i think we can shore up attitud and expect about what   s like to unfold   in the note i had written out on polici  my final point were relat to the statement that we make  which is where you end your remark   while i would agre that the market won   t be surpris by our action today  i was surpris after our last meet at how some busi leader and consum on the fring did have the sens that perhap thing were wors than they had thought   i believ that danger is still there  even given the expect in financi market   so i think we have to choos our word as care as we can and tri to elimin some of the fear that peopl might read into anoth    basi point move quit so soon   nevertheless  i certain agre with the recommend
mr  chairman  i enthusiast support your recommend  it seem to me that the financi market clear are expect a move of this magnitud and if we were not to move along these line  i think it could caus some problem
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend  i believ we   ve all been particular impress by the speed of this slowdown and i   m               hope that this action will help us to achiev a quick recoveri and to avoid move into a recess
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   ye day i may have violat bill pool   s rule about op  degre of gloom   in fact  i suppos i consid the high tech v shape recoveri the most like outcom   but i do think there is some probabl that we will see someth wors than that   i strong support your idea that in view of today   s economi we should be mind that polici should be front load and oper fa  and quicker   a part of me thought you might recommend go to altern a      which was a    basi point cut  and i   m not sure that you couldn   t have talk me into that   but i will go with this propos
i also agre with both part of your propos   whether one think like governor   that thing could well be wors  or like i do that fiscal s ulus might come earlier and be larger than expect and we could have a rebound sooner than anticip  front load polici right now seem to me the wisest cours   it seem appropri to get the s ulus in there  to get it impact sooner  so perhap it will improv whatev is go to happen   or    month from now    in think about the press statement  i had reflect on whether a balanc risk statement would work to solv the problem that presid   mention regard the possibl that the size of the cumul eas move over a month   s  e might feed into the pessimist psycholog about the econom outlook   i wonder whether a balanc risk statement might help calm thing   but after listen to the televis a bit this morn and see               the degre to which there were now expect in the market of an even bigger move  and not be abl to reconcil in my own mind the real risk with a balanc risk statement  i came around to your posit   so  i   m wholeheart in agreement with your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i also want to associ myself with presid guynn   s comment about the need to be care with regard to the psycholog associ with the word of our press statement
thank you   i support the    basi point move today and i think     basi point of eas in a four week period   achiev a signific degre of front load   it is earli and substanti   and i would support that even though i think the baselin forecast is the best project to go with   it   s the one i certain hope is correct   but the fund rate path that was coupl with the baselin forecast is not the one that we prefer   where that leav me is that if the baselin forecast   turn out to be the correct one  then we   re go to need to move the fund rate back up  perhap to where the staff say it is go to be two year henc   and it   s get difficult for me to imagin the path that we will have to follow if that forecast is right   i say that becaus the pressur for further cut at the march meet and especi at the may meet  if               we have a negat gdp number for this quarter and rise unemploy  is go to be huge   it will be a  e onc again when the market fulli expect us to move  when the analyst and everybodi els say we   re go to move  and we will have to disappoint them
we   ve done it befor   presid
i think we can wait and worri about that later   for the current circumst  i think your recommend is just right
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i believ that   s the right move for today but i complet concur with the remark of presid jordan   i think we have to exercis care in the expect that we encourag in the market about the certainti and the cumul size of the like amount of futur eas  particular in light of what i view as a still plausibl and sensibl baselin scenario in the  book  one point i would like to make is that i   ve alway look forward to these two day meet as an opportun to talk about some broader issu on the strategi of monetari polici   this morn  sn   t seem to be the  e to do that  given the natur of the discuss around the tabl   but i would hope  as we plan the agenda for futur two day meet  that we would allow  e for some comment that i would like to make about the appropri and direct of polici  how we monitor the monetari aggreg  and how we set inflat target and our rule packet   i   m alway amus that we start off from the inflat target that   taylor set but do so without ani communic from the committe to the staff about the inflat object committe               member might have   but i   ll save that topic for futur discuss and express my hope that futur agenda will allow more  e for such discuss
we can do that prior to the juli  if you   ll excus the express     humphrey hawkin    tes oni

vice chairman  do we now have your yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes permiss to have the board member meet in my offic
you certain do
i request that we have a temporari recess   meet recess
ani comment  concern  or otherwis about the draft press releas
mr  chairman  larri   and a coupl of other peopl have ask whi the st  loui discount rate chang is not effect today    the reason is that               the state of arkansa has some bank usuri ceil that are tie to the discount rate   as a practic matter  the chang in the discount rate can   t becom effect until the follow day   it has to do with arkansa law
so you will go with the new rate offici tomorrow
that   s correct   we can   t make it effect immedi
okay   is this press statement satisfactori to everybodi then
i think this is the first  e the press releas has made refer to when the discount rate chang is effect   this seem a bit ambigu becaus not all of the reserv bank are a part of it   i think it might be better not to includ the entir last sentenc
normal we do indic when it   s effect
some reserv bank are not in and it   s confus   is that what you   re say
actual  the sentenc can be modifi to say that the chang is effect in the district note and is effect for st  loui the next day   mayb that would be better
that   s probabl not a bad idea   in other word  the chang is effect for eight bank or
in those district the chang is effect immedi   in st  loui  the chang is effect tomorrow
is it necessari   it seem there is more detail than is necessari in this releas  sever   yes  in this releas  speaker      have we ever said this befor
we usual say this when st  loui is includ   i don   t have a strong feel about it
i would take it out
i think we could leav it out of this statement   you might have to explain it  but
you know  we don   t need it   we can say     in take the discount rate action  the feder reserv board approv request submit by the board of director of the feder reserv bank of new york  philadelphia  cleveland  atlanta  chicago  st  loui  minneapoli  dalla  and san francisco      period
i know our board of director have to vote on it  but the realiti is that we   ll all pass it this afternoon
not necessarili  speaker     it won   t be effect today in st  loui
for some it may be tomorrow
let   s just take it out   if peopl have question about it  we can answer them
bill    it matter to you if we announc when it   s effect in your district
well  to me the way to think about it is that the board accept the recommend from the st  loui bank but becaus of our peculiar situat as a standard practic the chang has to becom effect the follow day   but i don   t think we need to have that detail in the press statement
but it   s not import to you that we announc
what is import is just the fact that the board accept our recommend   that is what you did  and that   s all you have to say
that   s what   s usual done
that   s the oper point
the oper issu is that we accept the recommend of the chang you wish to implement  we have now complet our formal agenda   our next meet is schedul for march    and with that we can adjourn our fomc meet  end of meet
