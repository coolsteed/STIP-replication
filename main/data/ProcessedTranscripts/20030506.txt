who would like to move approv of the minut of march
approv without object   dino kos  you have the     floor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were distribut a short  e ago   sinc the last committe meet  market have been character by a mixtur of uncertainti about   among other thing   the outlook for the economi  residu geopolit risk  and sar   simultan  the degre of risk avers decreas and spread narrow  volatil declin or stay at low level  equiti ralli in most market  and a consist theme among investor was the search for yield   the top panel on the first page graph the u s  dollar three month libor deposit rate in black and the three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward in the dash red line   sinc your last meet  forward rate have trade in fair narrow rang  as market were push and pull with conflict news   the most weak econom data and a corpor earn season that  while unspectacular  did not come close to mani of the most dire expect in the market   forward curv and futur price are still price in anoth eas in polici at some point  though those same curv suggest that a tighten cycl will follow short thereaft   of cours  this pattern of expect lower rate to be follow by higher rate some month later has persist for quit some  e now   as shown in the middl two panel  two  and ten year treasuri yield also have move in a fair narrow rang   one factor that did not seem to affect price and yield was last week   s record refund announc   the treasuri will auction     billion of three   five   and ten year note in the next few day  with almost all of that bring in new cash   further  all forecast of futur deficit continu to rise  while analyst have comment about the risk that the increas suppli pose  those worri have not yet shown through to yield  though perhap they will in  e as the competit for fund increas  two possibl reason for the lack of reaction were cite   first  worri about futur suppli are alreadi reflect at the long end of the curv and henc part explain the steep of the curv  and second the decreas in recent quarter in privat sector issuanc is allow the treasuri to borrow what it need without bid up rate      the materi use by mr  kos are append to the transcript  appendix     the bottom panel graph the invest grade spread  which has continu to fall   if one exclud some veri larg issuer such as auto compani that have special stori surround them  the remaind of the index is trade near spring      level   swap spread  in fact  are alreadi back to those level   part of this narrow probabl is a correct from what are now view to have been extrem level in the autumn of       when corpor govern scare were peak   part of the narrow is simpli due to suppli and demand   inflow continu to come into bond fund and need to be invest   on the suppli side  although issuanc did tick up in late januari and februari  it fell again as the war approach  and it has stay low sinc then   dealer note that corpor are use free cash flow and what littl corpor issuanc there has been to repay debt and de lever their balanc sheet   this help to explain the credit qualiti improv  though it also impli that less is go into invest than would normal be the case   meanwhil on the demand side  investor have push out the matur and credit risk curv in the search for higher yield   the bottom right panel graph the narrow of high yield and emerg market spread   fund special in both asset class have had inflow  and with onli a limit suppli come to the market  the competit has been intens and spread have narrow sharpli   just to take one exampl  brazil issu a    billion five year global bond that was six  e oversubscrib   a week ago the bond was issu to yield      percent  and it has ralli in the week sinc then   it now yield     percent   the issu also includ a collect action claus  which did not appear to affect demand   the brazilian real  mexican peso  and south african rand were among the currenc that benefit from investor    search for higher yield currenc and asset market   consist with the narrow of spread and less risk avers in recent week  impli volatil have decreas or stay at relat low level   page   graph long term impli volatil on the s p      the two main exchang rate pair  and the ten year treasuri futur sinc januari        the better perform of u s  equiti market in recent week   the s p      for exampl  is up    percent   has coincid with the fall in impli vol   as shown in the top panel  which depict the s p     volatil index  that measur of equiti volatil is back to below the    percent level for the first  e sinc corpor govern worri heighten after the worldcom collaps   currenc volatil continu to trade in well worn rang  near the    percent level that has prevail for some  e   these volatil level have been maintain both dure the appreci of the dollar in the begin of the period and dure the more recent period of dollar depreci  the impli volatil in the ten year treasuri futur contract have continu to ebb in recent week to level observ in the first half of        part of that recent falloff in volatil may also be due to the declin in the mortgag banker associ   s refinanc index  as prepay have slow   that also may have lessen the demand for hedg by mortgag investor and corpor treasur   turn to europ  the top panel on page   graph the libor fix for euro three month deposit in black and the impli rate three  six  and nine month forward in     the forward rate continu to trade below the cash rate and market particip expect further eas from the ecb  as forecast for european growth are still be trim   in the middl panel  credit spread in the euro area continu to narrow as well   in particular  the lower end of the invest grade univers has outperform the rest   but unlik the case in the unit state  issuanc actual pick up earli this year  as shown in the chart at the bottom left  so suppli there is hold up   one possibl is that european compani are now go through some of the same dynam that u s  compani went through in      and       when they issu debt heavili in order to refin and restructur debt and to extend the term of matur commerci paper   in the foreign exchang market  the euro has continu to rise past     and is now at the     level against the dollar   it strongest level sinc februari       which was rough six week after the euro   s launch   investor shift asset into the euro area report includ central bank  japanes insur and pension compani  and european institut investor who have prefer to keep fund at home rather than move them oversea   although we don   t think of the euro as a high yield currenc per se  both short  and long term rate are meaning higher than those for the two g   counterpart currenc   turn to page    japanes market show no sign that the deflationari pressur in that countri are abat  the bank situat continu to post challeng for japanes policymak  and the recent declin in japanes stock have accentu those worri   the nikkei stock index fell below       dure the intermeet period for the first  e sinc        this has again rais talk in japanes polici circl about measur such as so call price keep oper to stem the declin in equiti price and henc conserv capit resourc of the bank and insur  unlik most other major equiti market  the nikkei did not ralli in mid march   that diverg from other equiti market is depict in the top panel   the s p and dax  to take just two exampl  came off their low rather sharpli  wherea the nikkei continu it steadi declin toward and then below the       level   today it is just abov that level   the japanes bond market also have been gloomi  as shown in the middl panel  the ten year yield is trade at about    or    basi point  and the yield on the twenti year bond is at    basi point   among benchmark issu  onli the thirti year yield  trade at      percent  has a posit integ befor the decim point  though not by veri much   the boj   s polici stanc has push investor out on the yield curv and to some degre into privat sector and foreign asset   the right middl panel show the recent narrow of privat sector spread in japan  which is not unlik the pattern observ in dollar and euro area fix incom market   but let me note three point of caution   first  as we know  compani in japan reli more on bank financ  bond market issuanc is low compar with both their u s  and european counterpart  second  the data are poor   but net new issuanc is probabl flat or perhap even negat in the lower rate segment  which would help to explain some of the spread compress   third  spread widen substanti in late      when some fund manag were face with larg loss  and the ensu liquid widen spread   especi for lower rate paper   those spread are onli now revert to the level we saw in the summer of        the noisi chart at the bottom left graph the topix bank sub index and the share price of the four major japanes bank  all of which are down substanti as the prospect for improv in their busi reced   mizuho  for exampl  report a     billion loss a week ago   iron  the spread on japanes bank debt have nevertheless narrow dure        the bottom right panel graph the spread for each of the four major bank between their five year senior debt and the five year jgb yield   i would make two point   first  all the spread have narrow and are converg  suggest littl in the way of differenti among the bank   or at least less than had been the case some month ago   second  these spread obvious repres veri low absolut yield   with the five year jgb yield itself at    basi point today  a spread of    basi point on sumitomo   s debt  for exampl  mean that the bank is abl to sell five year debt at    basi point   move to the next page  one of the star in the currenc market has been the canadian dollar   in recent trade session the canadian dollar has risen abov    cent and is now trade at it strongest level sinc        among the reason for the canadian dollar   s perform are canada   s strong econom perform  higher yield  less overcapac in canadian industri  a larg energi sector at a  e when price have general been high  and the bank of canada   s move to tighten monetari polici   canadian ten year yield are about   percentag point higher than those on compar u s  instrument  and at the short end  canadian interest rate are about   percentag point higher   the diverg in polici has also had a differ effect on the yield curv   the middl panel graph the two to ten year u s  treasuri curv in blue and the compar data for canada in red   while the u s  curv has been steep at between     to     basi point all year  the canadian curv has actual flatten by about    basi point and is current onli half as steep as the u s  curv   the world health organ   s decis to issu a travel advisori for toronto had period but onli transient effect on canadian market   the hong kong and chines market  on the other hand  had at  e a more pronounc reaction to sar relat news but perhap less than one might have expect given the sheer volum of coverag the stori receiv   at the bottom left in blue is a graph of the hong kong dollar  which is fix at     to the dollar  the one year forward rate move upward in mid  to late april to      but sinc then has eas back somewhat   at the bottom right  china   s spot exchang rate is depict in blue and the impli one year renminbi nondeliver forward rate in red   the discount on the renminbi has narrow somewhat  but all in all the reaction was fair modest  equiti in both hong kong and china  howev  did fall  although again perhap not as dramat as one might have expect   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the intermeet period   i will need a vote on domest oper   and i   d be happi to answer ani question
a collect action claus  cac  may be in the gazillion  new issuanc that follow the mexican and brazilian one  both of which appar requir veri littl if ani premium in the marketplac to obtain the cac   is there ani evid among emerg countri borrow that use of the cac will now spread signific   it obvious provid greater flexibl in negoti
i   m not an expert in that particular area   certain some of the stigma associ with the cac will be taken away   one of the concern that offici had worri about was that there would be some stigma associ with be first off the block with a cac  with mexico and brazil have move to includ cac  there may be less of a stigma so it may be easier to get them in   but i wouldn   t want to make a forecast that they will becom a routin part of such contract
may i make a comment   i think the general street talk in new york is that  sinc the mexican have been the most vehement oppos to cac  their go first was rather statesmanlik   especi sinc they didn   t pay anyth for includ the cac   the brazilian went next  but there   s a big question as to whether less high qualiti borrow would not have to pay a premium for the cac   i think the real answer is that we don   t know yet  though it   s clear the question
talk about brazilian debt as high qualiti is a bit of a chang
could i add one other point base on the work that i   ve done on this  two other countri have been mention in this regard  and one is korea  which for geopolit reason obvious is not go to go to the market ani  e soon   but they have been among the emerg market countri that were most support of the cac  so the expect is that when they come to market they will adopt the cac   the other countri that has been activ in these discuss is south africa  which had been a littl more negat about the cac  i think  but there were mani peopl who thought that  with the mexican have gone ahead  the resist in south africa might chang as well   so those two countri are one that need to be watch   but i think bill is certain right that it   s just not clear yet how all this is go to sort out
i have a question about the construct of one of the graph on page    at the bottom left you show the dollar valu of the euro issu   are those convert at the exchang rate of the month in question
i believ so  yes
if we look at juli        for exampl  the height of that bar is about the same as the previous bar  which i guess is for april         but in fact the dollar price of the euro was quit differ at those  e   so if you depict the valu in euro  the bar on the right hand side would not look quit so high relat to the other  right   that would mean that the most recent bar would be convert at       or       or someth like that
that   s true  yes
and the bar some  e back would be convert at       or someth like that   i don   t know exact   my memori of those rate is not that solid   but the point is
the swing are realli quit larg  though
oh  i know they are  i   m just say that it might be more use for our purpos not to plot the chang dollar price of the euro with the actual euro issuanc  present that in euro term might be a littl clearer for our purpos
yes  i think for us it was a question of data that were avail on short notic   but i think you   re right that that would be a better way of present it
further question for dino   i need a vote
move approv of domest oper
without object they are approv   dino  you want to discuss the canadian and mexican swap renew
yes   it   s may  which mean that it   s  e to take up the renew of those swap   they expir in mid decemb  but becaus of the six month notic that would have to be given if the committe chose not to renew them  this is the proper meet to vote on renew   i sent out a short memo on this last week  and my recommend is that the committe renew the nafa swap line with mexico and canada
move approv  speaker      second
approv has been move   all in favor say    aye     sever   aye
all oppos  say    no
we now move on to the econom situat   dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   there has clear been a narrow of uncertainti surround the outlook as well as a consider amount of good news for the economi sinc the march  book was complet   the success and expediti complet of the war in iraq has allevi some of the press concern that had been weigh on particip in the energi and financi market   inde  with opec product higher  remark littl damag to oil field in iraq and  as yet  few sign of negat polit spillov elsewher in the region  oil price have tumbl   the spot price of west texa intermedi crude oil is expect to averag about    per barrel lower in the current quarter than we had anticip in our previous forecast   in financi market  stock price began to move notic higher just as we were complet our march project   the lift of war relat uncertainti and the better than expect earn report for the first quarter boost equiti price about    percent abov the level assum in our last project   risk spread on corpor bond have narrow as well  especi for lower tier firm   household too seem to be feel better   consum confid has rebound in recent week  retrac much of the declin that had occur sinc last fall   final  one of the key upsid risk to the project that we had highlight earlier appear to have materi  as the defens spend impli by the recent enact supplement is consider more than we had incorpor in our previous project   so with all of that appar good news  our forecast might come as someth of a disappoint   we have revis down the growth of real gdp throughout       and the     percent increas project for the year is near    percentag point less than in the march  book   to be sure  greater s ulus from the factor that i just mention   produc more rapid growth next year   but even with the sharper pickup in activ that eventu develop in our forecast  the level of real gdp is lower and the gdp gap higher  on averag  in      than in our previous project   our princip motiv for this downward revis has been a fair steadi drumbeat of negat news on the real economi   to start  the spend data have been come in somewhat weaker than we had anticip in march   consumpt and invest taken togeth rose just     percent at an annual rate in the first quarter  more than   percentag point slower than in our last project   moreov  at least in the household sector  we aren   t enter the second quarter with much momentum   outsid of motor vehicl  consum spend has been relat flat in recent month   sale of new motor vehicl improv to      million unit at an annual rate in april  up from a    million unit pace in march   but that incent s ul increas was aim at allevi the inventori problem that had develop this winter  and the cutback in product schedul by the manufactur will continu to be a drag on aggreg activ in the current quarter   moreov  our busi contact in this industri report that the respons to the recent boost to incent has  if anyth  been disappoint   hous activ has not been as buoyant as we had expect   start and permit have had a softer tone  and we now expect a flatten out in this sector in come month instead of modest gain   busi spend also has present some downsid surpris   on net  the read on order and shipment of capit good in februari and march were below those anticip in our previous forecast   in the high tech area  outlay for communic equip have shown notabl strength of late  but comput spend is grow less vigor than we had expect   outsid of high tech  a project increas in current quarter equip spend   not appear suffici to revers a now larger es  declin in the first quarter   the mild negat innov in the spend data  taken by themselv  would not have justifi the size of the downward adjust that we have made to privat demand for the remaind of the year   our think about the under strength of the economi was more heavili influenc by the surpris weak recent read on the labor market and industri activ   privat payrol have been contract at an averag month rate of        sinc the turn of the year  and with initi claim for unemploy insur averag close to         in recent week  there are few sign that busi have  as yet  stop shed worker   moreov  the employ declin and the sharp drop in the workweek in april point to anoth contract in hour work this quarter   perhap this is more good news on product   and quit like it is   but i don   t think that   s the whole stori   we are now expect a declin in total industri product of    percent in april and a drop in the manufactur compon of about   percent   activ in the factori sector has general been contract sinc the fall   that weak pictur seem to line up veri well with negat read from purchas manag and the continu downbeat tenor of the report that we have receiv from busi contact   it is  of cours  possibl that we have overreact to the incom data   i should stress that we are still work with read on the economi that  for the most part  were taken befor or dure the war   we have interpret the greater weak in that inform as suggest that under activ has been softer than we had earlier es    but we can   t confid rule out that the war relat restraint on the economi were more intens than we have been allow for   beyond the read from commod and financi market  we still know veri littl about the postwar economi   in brief  we have receiv more favor read on consum confid and chain store sale and less favor read from initi claim   as i note at the outset  defens spend is one element of final demand that is like to be consider stronger than was anticip in our previous forecast  inde  our project increas in outlay for defens now account for more than half of the gdp growth that we are project for the current quarter   that made us nervous enough to canva our brother and si  in the forecast communiti  both insid and outsid govern   we got pretti much the same answer from everybodi     gee  that   s interest  we haven   t realli thought much about it yet     arm with that help guidanc  we tri our best to steer a balanc cours   to the upsid of our forecast  the cbo is es  notic higher defens spend for fiscal year      than we have incorpor in this forecast   with onli two quarter remain in the fiscal year  their figur impli some whop increas in q  and q    to the downsid  omb   s latest take on iraq relat defens spend is about as far below our forecast as cbo   s is abov   but even the omb figur is consist with a somewhat fa  spendout of recent enact budget author than was observ after the gulf war   the bottom line is that the confid interv around this featur of our forecast is veri wide   although our revis to privat and govern spend  on net  result in somewhat slower growth in real gdp  we continu to show growth pick up in the second half   the basic logic of that forecast remain the same as in the last  book   forc are in place that will work in concert to produc a pickup in real activ over the second half of this year   accommod monetari polici  anoth dose of fiscal s ulus  wane negat wealth effect  improv consum and busi confid  and lean inventori are the key ingredi in our forecast of reacceler in spend and product     remark to me after the last meet that presid     s descript of all the thing that had to go just right to get the staff forecast had made me sound a bit like the guy on the ed sullivan show who would come out and start spin ever greater number of plate on the end of stick   as more plate were ad to the mix  each one had to be spun with precis and speed to maintain the balanc of the entir delic construct   while i am reluct to endors this character of the forecast  i will admit that my arm have been get a bit tire wait for a big final    laughter   obvious  there remain serious risk to both the  e and magnitud of the acceler in real activ that we are project   the recent gain in equiti market and declin in risk spread could be signal that a stronger than expect rebound is in the of   as you know  we have made much of gloomi sen ent and heighten caution as factor that have retard busi spend over the past year or so   but it would be a mistak to equat caution on the part of busi with inact   in fact  they appear to have been hard at work   balanc sheet have been strengthen  aid import by an environ of low interest rate   firm have becom leaner through workforc reduct  reorgan  and more effect util of their exist capit stock   and with a few except  busi have kept inventori veri lean in relat to sale   these adjust could be set the stage for a more vigor expans ahead   but there also remain ampl ground for skeptic about the reacceler in activ that we are project to occur in the second half   we continu to believ that unusu forc have been hold back invest spend and that these forc will gradual dissip   it is possibl that this stori is just wrong   perhap invest has been weak becaus there are relat few profit invest project avail   in other word  perhap our model is misspecifi  and the recent pace of invest spend reflect fundament that are less favor than we recogn   in this case  the acceler in equip spend would like be less impress than anticip in our forecast   there are risk to household spend as well   as we discuss at the last meet  the person save rate remain well below it long run equilibrium   we have been comfort that household are make adjust to consumpt and save of about the size and on rough the  e line anticip by our model   still  we cannot rule out the possibl of a more abrupt upward movement in the save rate   associ perhap with heighten job insecur should the labor market remain in the doldrum   this too would produc a more mute pickup in activ than we are project   even if we have the basic element of the reacceler of real activ about right  consider uncertainti remain about the  e of the step up in growth  the process of repair and recoveri from the burst of the asset bubbl and the myriad other shock that have hit the economi in the past few year could take longer than we are anticip   at this point   e   matter   core consum price inflat has been move lower in recent quarter  and in our forecast most major measur are expect to move into a rang that encompass zero inflat  onc allow is made for like measur error   ani serious delay in the recoveri or shortfal in it magnitud would impli a larger output gap  at least for a  e  and by our analysi would result in an even lower inflat rate   as you know  for this round  we updat the calcul for the probabl of deflat that we present last decemb   becaus the baselin forecast for both output and inflat have been revis down sinc then  we now es  that the probabl of deflat   defin as core pce price inflat fall below    percent by the end of        has risen from about    percent to about    percent   i   d take these figur with a grain of salt  but it  sn   t take complex stochast simul to recogn that  with inflat this low  ani reason confid interv would includ a sizabl probabl that the aggreg price level could fall     will now continu our present
in construct our outlook for the rest of the world this  e  the task we face was basic the same one we confront each  book   we need to determin to what extent the inform we had receiv over the intermeet period was consist with our forecast in march and to what extent it repres unexpect develop that appropri requir some adjust to our project for this year and next   although the task was familiar and routin  the challeng was particular difficult this  e as so much of what has happen sinc your meet in march was driven by the extraordinari event in iraq   for the last three to four week  sinc the phase of major hostil in iraq wound down  global financi market appear to have respond to fundament econom news more than was the case earlier in the intermeet period   nevertheless  we have littl hard evid on develop in the real sector of foreign economi sinc the most acut geopolit risk substanti abat   develop in global oil market are the most straightforward to evalu  relat to our forecast in the march  book  we are now project the averag spot price for wti oil in the current quarter to be    lower   the same comparison for the fourth quarter of next year yield a differ of less than      thus event have larg pull forward in  e a reduct in world oil price that had been expect to occur but more slowli   the most direct effect of that chang is on the total cost of import oil for most countri  includ our own  and we have visibl reduc the u s  extern deficit this year and next year accord   for major u s  trade partner who are also oil export  such as mexico  we have incorpor a negat hit to their trade balanc and to their aggreg incom   the indirect effect of the lower path for global oil price are less straightforward  we judg that confid on the part of consum and busi abroad should be boost by the rapid fall in oil price and the consequ benefit to real dispos incom and busi cost   that differ should be greatest in the near term   to date we have limit evid on confid abroad sinc the end of hostil  and what we do have present a somewhat mix pictur   on balanc  we saw the lower oil price as a moder posit for consum and busi spend abroad  particular for the rest of this year   the foreign exchang valu of the dollar fluctuat somewhat wide in the day just befor and follow your march meet  most in respons to develop within iraq   sinc earli april  howev  the dollar has trend down on balanc and in term of the index of major foreign currenc has recent move below it march    low point   no doubt more by luck than ani forecast skill we might have  fluctuat of the dollar   euro rate left that pair about in line with the path we wrote down in march   we have adjust down the u s  dollar in term of the canadian dollar and the mexican peso   in contrast  we have adjust the dollar up in term of the yen   taken togeth  these chang impli a slight weaker level for the real valu of the dollar in term of our broad index of trade partner currenc  but the rate of chang from here through the end of the forecast period is project to be about the same as in our previous forecast   as in the unit state  stock price in most major foreign economi have ralli in recent week   equiti price are now up for the year in mani european market  the averag across europ repres by the dj euro stoxx price index is back to no net chang for the year  after reach a low of    percent below it late decemb level on march      stock price are up on balanc this year in major latin american emerg market countri also  includ mexico and brazil   for those countri  embi  spread on dollar bond rate are down substanti as well   we interpret these favor develop in financi market as consist with an improv in confid over  e and a strengthen of real gdp growth   for now we judg these develop to be in line with the pace of strengthen that we project in march but not a reason for revis upward our growth outlook for these countri   stock price in japan and emerg asia are the except to the general pictur of rise equiti valu   in japan  stock price touch new twenti year low on sever occas dure the intermeet period   although some price rebound near the end of the period  the major stock price index remain well below their valu at the start of this year   we attribut the downward trend in japanes stock price to the domest concern that continu to dog the japanes economi  plus some possibl spillov from rise tension with respect to north korea and the effect of sar on japan   s major trade partner in the region   the latest data have left us slight more op ist about the pace of econom activ in japan this year  but we do not detect ani evid that would call for a major revis to our outlook for econom activ in that countri   one new element in the global econom pictur sinc your march meet has been the emerg of sar as a major econom threat to most of the emerg asia region   even though we have no expertis in anticip the cours of the diseas  construct of the  book baselin forecast requir that we make a set of work assumpt about it implic for econom activ   as we report in the  book  we incorpor into the forecast the like consequ of sar base on the inform known at that  e   in larg part that involv limit the effect of sar primarili to key servic sector such as travel and entertain and posit that it advers effect would be felt main in the current quarter   we have ad some small posit payback later this year and in earli      as the lost travel and sale are partial recoup   this approach yield an es  of a downward revis to growth this year in develop asia that averag about     percentag point owe to the sar outbreak   base on the inform we have to date  we see the effect as largest for hong kong  somewhat less but still quit visibl for china and singapor  and much smaller for various other asian emerg market economi   the end product of our attempt to incorpor these various develop into the baselin forecast is a project for total foreign output growth of about   percent in the first half of this year     percentag point lower than we had in march   follow by growth of   percent in the second half of this year and about     percent next year   as is the case with the domest forecast  despit quit favor outcom of mani event relat to the iraqi conflict  we have revis down the path of foreign gdp   most of the downward revis is due to our es  of the near term effect of sar on global growth   the weaker project for u s  real output growth is a factor as well  particular for canada and mexico   the more favor oil price develop and some buoyanc in global financi market provid a small offset   that conclud our remark   we   d be happi to answer ani question
question for our colleagu   presid parri
i have a question about plant and equip spend   in the last forecast you indic that geopolit uncertainti and risk were like to be take a toll on busi    plan for equip and softwar spend   of cours  to some extent those concern have been resolv  but the forecast for plant and equip spend in the second half of the year has been revis down signific     that suggest that there are more fundament factor that have been at work for quit a few quarter in term of the weak in plant and equip spend
i   d say that in our last forecast the war relat uncertainti were just a part of what we saw as a much broader set of concern and uncertainti about the econom outlook that were help to hold back p e spend   so we hadn   t bet a lot on the end of the war be a major sourc of upward impetus to such spend   as i indic  in general the data have been a littl softer on the capit spend side  not dramat so but enough on the core compon   the non high tech  nontransport compon   that we just didn   t see sign that capit spend would move up as rapid as we had in the last forecast   second  some of the revis that we made to the second half of the year had less to do with the actual data we were see on the various spend categori and more with what we were see on the product and employ side   the latter in essenc suggest that overal demand was like to be weaker than we had anticip   for that reason we put in some reduct in our forecast of equip spend and also took some out of consumpt   it is our view that to date overal activ in the first half of this year is fundament softer than we had es  at the  e of the last forecast   we are start off at a lower base move forward  as i said in my remark  becaus we have lean on the employ and product data fair heavili  it   s possibl that we have overreact by still tri to disentangl what are and what aren   t war relat effect on the product and the employ side   it could be that those effect have been bigger and that we   re somehow misread that as an indic of fundament weak   but in general i   m comfort with the balanc of risk that we have in this forecast
one short follow up question   the acceler of equip and softwar spend in      is quit mark   is a signific portion of that due to the end of the favor tax treatment for equip and softwar
certain in the second and third quarter of next year we think we will see a relat larg pull forward of that spend   if one could look a littl beyond the      horizon in this forecast  we   d expect a bit of a pothol in activ in      in part becaus of that payback on the invest spend   but also we wouldn   t anticip as big a s ulus from even further cut in person incom tax
one of the shock that hit the economi  of cours  was the spate of corpor govern scandal   when we look at current risk spread and credit spread  they have narrow relat to their earli      level   i have two question on this      one  do you think we are past the major part of the fallout in financi market from these corpor govern scandal   second  do you think we are still see an impact from them on the real economi  or are we past that now
well  in our forecast we incorpor the view that the worst is past in this area   in fact we   d expect  with the gradual improv in the pace of growth go forward  that corpor spread would continu to narrow some over the next six quarter   in essenc  there   s an increas in profit and an improv in overal activ as well as some wane of these effect that togeth should result in further compress of spread  as for the extent to which the govern issu is have an effect  one certain hear lot of busi peopl talk about the effect that the uncertainti and liabil associ with corpor govern have had on their own activ and on their hesit to take certain action   i   m not quit sure how to interpret those comment  but we hear them often   so that would be anoth reason in our mind for this effect to last a littl longer and to fade more slowli over the project period   but that   s in effect tri to read the anecdot   i couldn   t tell you how mani tenth of a percentag point in equip spend we   ve incorpor for that effect  but i think the corpor govern issu are part of our overal stori of busi hesit  gloom  and uncertainti
we continu to hear some of those same stori
dave  you mention that there was a veri consider spread between the omb and the cbo forecast of defens expenditur in the second and third quarter   the big variabl in defens expenditur clear has to be the speed with which the armament that were use in iraq are restor   by this  e the defens depart would have had to place most of the order if the expenditur are go to be cost in the second and third quarter   this is a factual question  but i would assum that  given a differ between the cbo and the omb forecast  omb is more like to be right becaus they are part of the administr   you mention that the omb number were more aggress than your own forecast  i think
actual  the cbo number is abov our  and omb is below
ah  i had it backward   how much weaker would your forecast be if omb is correct
i   ll let mr     who has treasuri experi  address that question   i would just point out that  when we first start talk with omb on this  they were in the cbo camp and were well abov us   they have just in the last week or so shift toward this lower number
but that would add to my view that they call the defens depart and got the fact
that   s quit possibl
actual  they start out north of cbo on the advic of the defens depart   i   m not sure what they factor into their think that led them to bring their number down to below where the defens depart said it was go to be   it may be becaus their figur is    billion or so weaker than our for the fiscal year as a whole  which translat to     billion at an annual rate for the remain two quarter
and that is rough    percentag point on gdp growth
i think it   s fair to say that there is a lot of uncertainti about the like spendout pattern   we think we   ve begun to see some entrail of that spend in the daili treasuri statement for april   but get from the daili treasuri statement to the month treasuri statement  which form the basi for bea   s es   and get from april to the quarter as whole involv a lot of es    there is a lot of uncertainti in all of those step
get from the month treasuri statement to the actual deliveri  which is how defens spend is measur in the gdp  is an even greater hurdl
there they are guess   bea   not have partial payment or advanc payment data until quit a bit later   presid
dave  you refer to narrow credit spread  and presid   did as well  as a posit aspect of financi market   i   m wonder a littl about that   peopl tell me that some of the reduct in credit spread is due to the fact that there   s a lot of money out there chase veri few good deal   if one look at the continu pace of corpor downgrad and at the declin volum of corpor bond issuanc and c i loan  the question aris as to whether this is as favor an aspect of the financi market as we may be give it credit for   i   m wonder if credit spread might widen befor they start to narrow again
well  that   s alway a possibl   it   s our view  howev  that the basic health of the corpor balanc sheet has improv and has improv quit notic over the last year or so   we   ve seen a declin in default rate   we   ve certain seen a signific drop off in the interest share of cash flow  aid by a low interest rate environ   whatev the caus of this recent declin in spread  it obvious is reduc the cost of capit to busi   now  as i indic in my remark  if busi don   t have reason project avail then the declin in spread might not provid the s ulus to invest spend that we   re anticip   but we   re fair confid that it has been help to reduc the cost of capit  as for spread widen again  that is alway a possibl  as i said earlier   if there were ani signific doubt about the likelihood of a reason step up in the pace of activ and therefor some reemerg of concern about whether the improv in corpor health that have occur thus far can be sustain go forward  that could caus a rise in spread  that  in our view  obvious would be part of a veri bad patch for the economi go forward  howev  within the context of our forecast  we believ it   s quit reason to expect some further narrow of these spread  which are still high by histor standard
could i just follow up on that issu   unlik in the recess of the earli      s  this  e corpor bond and equiti took most of the hit in term of loss as oppos to bank loan   so it isn   t just the corpor govern scandal or the lack of confid in financi report that are involv but the fact that there were more loss in the market secur segment than in the previous period   i was interest in dino   s analysi  too  when in refer to his chart on s p     volatil he relat that volatil in some respect to the corpor govern issu   even so  i think we have to rememb that there were financi market loss that were separ from the corpor govern issu
absolut   there certain has been a veri signific strain that was relat to the fact that firm had invest in so mani project
which is a problem that seem to be behind us now
further question for our colleagu   presid pool
i have two quit differ question   in the  book there was a discuss of the differ pictur of the labor market provid by the payrol employ data and by the unemploy rate   the  book explan of this focus on the particip rate   but it look to me as though the diverg in the payrol and household employ seri is larger than we usual see   sinc the end of the recess  assum that occur at the end of      rough  payrol employ is down in total about   million  and household employ is up about     million or someth like that   i know these seri differ  but it seem to me that the gap is larger and more persist than usual   what can you tell us about that
the short answer is    not much    becaus these gap  as you know  widen out and come back in   you   re right that recent there has been a remark larg gap between the payrol and the household survey data   our reason for emphas particip in our analysi of the gap that have develop between the payrol and the household employ data is that we   re focus on the unemploy rate becaus of it implic for measur the slack in the labor market   movement in household employ have effect on both the numer and the denomin of the unemploy rate and therefor have less effect on the rate   what has realli surpris us is the extent to which the unemploy rate has stay relat low given the weak that we have seen in payrol employ   as we highlight in our present to the board ye day  we have some shred of evid to suggest that this develop is probabl relat to a broader discourag in the workforc than the    discourag worker    question in the survey would indic   as a consequ of that  while we   ve seen less of a run up in the unemploy rate dure this period of weak  we think we   re also like to see less of an improv in the unemploy rate onc econom growth realli begin to pick up
i guess the implic of what i   m say is that the behavior of the unemploy rate would not look quit so peculiar if you focus on household employ rather than payrol employ becaus such a big gap has open up there
the household survey is the one upon which the unemploy rate is base
i think it would be a mistak to focus on household employ as suggest that there is greater health in the overal labor market and the employ situat  everi survey taken of both household and busi about the avail of job or the avail of worker line up veri well with the weak that we   ve see in payrol employ   these read seem at odd with the strength that is be suggest by the household sector data
well  the strength in the household seri is not huge   it   s just that there has been a substanti gap between the two seri
my other question is
may i just interrupt   we had a popul census adjust  which was suppos to smooth out the household seri   but my recollect is that  in the actual publish data for household employ  the number take off veri sharpli at the  e when the adjust was made   i   ve been mean to ask  and i   m ask now    anybodi know whether we have a discontinu in the seri
well  there is a discontinu   but i don   t know whether or not it   s an import factor in explain this recent jump   i don   t know if larri has ani insight
i don   t think so   we   ll look into that issu
i ask becaus you gave me a chart that show hour work on a household basi and on a payrol basi   they parallel each other until veri late last year  and then all of a sudden the household hour  which are in a sens a measur of employ  jump up sharpli   that struck me as just not credibl econom
i don   t have a good answer for you   we   ll have to look into it
my other question is realli quit differ   the forecast depend not insignific on the analysi relat to the macroeconom of fiscal polici   of cours  there   s a veri old debat about that   on the tax side particular  one view obvious is that tax cut don   t do much of anyth for short run activ   can you talk a littl more about the confid interv around the es  of the effect of fiscal polici   there are two issu   one is what kind of tax bill we might get   the other is  given some assumpt about the macro effect of that over the next eighteen month or so  what sort of confid interv do you put around that   certain over the year a posit has emerg that say those effect are vanish small
the fiscal packag that we   ve incorpor on the tax side is one that has all the element of the presid   s program with the except of the dividend tax relief  that would be consist rough with the      billion packag in aggreg size be discuss by the senat  not the      billion packag be discuss by the hous
that   s a total over ten year
that   s over ten year   but we have incorpor in our forecast the passag of that bill  and we have it effect on dispos incom start in octob of this year  so it give a fair good pop to dispos incom start in the fourth quarter and into earli next year   it is an import factor   from the polit gridlock simul in the  book  you can get a sens of how import the fiscal packag is in our forecast   we   d expect someth closer to   percent gdp growth next year instead of    percent if polit gridlock materi  in term of the effect of the fiscal packag on the economi  it is certain the case that the staff   s forecast   not assum so call ricardian behavior on the part of household   we think that dispos incom is go to show up in consum spend   for some household that are liquid constrain  it will provid an immedi boost to spend   for other household that are more forward look  some of this involv a pull forward of a tax cut that was alreadi plan   one would expect  therefor  a littl less impetus to spend than might otherwis occur from that acceler in the  e   but even that  in a present discount valu sens  is an improv in perman incom   so those tax cut contribut  and contribut import  to the growth in overal activ   if we took that fiscal s ulus out of this forecast   or altern  if we assum that it happen but has no effect   there would be a more mute improv in overal activ   we   d have a forecast with the unemploy rate still run at rough   percent through the end of next year  which is in essenc no improv
on the other hand  it would affect interest rate  so you wouldn   t have that effect
there would be some offset through lower long term interest rate if the packag did not pass   and we   d get a littl crowd in on the invest side   that featur  by the way  is incorpor in the model simul that do have a forward look element to them
i think it   s also mute becaus mani of the element that are contempl in the      billion packag are mere acceler and so by their natur are essenti temporari measur   accord  they don   t caus bond market to anticip a substanti worsen of the long term deficit pictur
by the same token  in the consumpt area there are transitori effect as well
further question   if not  who would like to start our roundtabl   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district remain sluggish   although the overal busi view is negat  i   m hear margin better report than i did in march   at least part of this chang in tone reflect the fact that mani of our contact were expect greater war relat destruct than actual materi  airlin ticket sale did fall sharpli becaus of the war and the sar outbreak   howev  unit airlin report that demand has rebound in the last few week  and they expect the trend to continu   their domest and transatlant book have return to earli march level  book for asia also have improv  after declin near    percent follow the sar outbreak   we poll our director and other contact regard sar  and with the except of the airlin most expect a minim and manag effect in the near term   but if sar is not contain  they thought it could harm new busi and product develop down the road  our retail and casual dine contact feel that consum have becom more upbeat   that has yet to show through  howev  to actual spend   as we know  light vehicl sale rebound in march and held up in april   on the one hand  the big three were reliev that the war didn   t over depress demand   on the other hand  their april result were weaker than they expect given the sweeten incent   interest  and a sign that the market has becom even more competit  some of the big foreign namepl have begun offer zero percent financ for the first  e  outsid of auto  district manufactur remain weak   but here again report tend to be slight   and i emphas slight   more upbeat than befor the war   one industri analyst told us that rebuild iraq will help to absorb the glut of use heavi equip   some equip produc have alreadi seen a jump in price quot from the middl east   a major produc of airport equip    ramp  cart  generat  and so forth   note that order  primarili from intern airlin  had increas last quarter   that was the first improv in over a year  our contact report that more firm are final decid to replac older equip   but in term of capit expans  firm continu to delay move forward even though mani have spend plan in place with contract negoti and cash on hand   appar they are still concern about cost contain   a project that use to requir three signatur now requir six   busi also remain reluct to hire   both of the nation temporari help firm that we speak with remain disappoint about their bill hour   their busi is clear weaker than dure the recoveri period follow the         recess   we receiv the preliminari calcul for manpow   s third quarter hire plan survey  and the index fell from    to    which is the lowest level sinc        howev  the survey was complet just befor the begin of the war so that was obvious a period of great uncertainti   these data are confidenti and the compani has told us it won   t be releas them until june     which is later than normal  turn to the nation outlook  the spars data on the postwar economi are mix   the april employ report  unemploy insur claim  and the inform from our temporari help contact indic that labor demand remain weak   on the plus side  consum confid has rebound despit the weak job market  oil price are down  stock price are up  and equiti price volatil and credit spread have fallen   of cours the big question remain whether busi spend will final pick up now that the burden of geopolit uncertainti is substanti reduc  it   s hard to be op ist about the near term   hire plan are still on hold  and excess capac continu to top the list of concern in mani firm   nevertheless  it   s certain plausibl to expect the busi sector to generat more growth as we move through the year   the anecdot report provid at least modest support for the scenario in which capit spend and hire gradual strengthen   moreov the fundament  particular the under trend in product  are strong enough to support the eventu pickup in growth  in general we agre with the  book that the project for this year  if realiz  would still leav the economi with larg gap in resourc use as we enter       which is a concern   furthermor  core inflat  which is now low  will probabl head lower   of cours  lower inflat would rais the real fed fund rate   that would not be a problem for the economi if it were solid in recoveri  but higher real rate would be a concern if the current weak is expect to continu into the second half of this year   in the latter scenario we would probabl want to eas polici   i can see either of the two scenario unfold   at this point i think it   s too earli to know   we should have a better read of the postwar economi by our next meet

thank you  mr  chairman   the news on econom activ in the third district has chang littl sinc our mid april confer call   the data suggest that our region experienc a somewhat larger slowdown in growth in the first quarter than the nation did   but sinc the end of hostil in iraq  i   ve sens an improv in tone from our busi contact   the data show that econom activ in the third district remain subdu  our busi outlook survey show a further declin in region manufactur activ in april   the index of general activ deterior to minus     in april from minus     in march  and the index of new order  shipment  and employ all fell as well   respond attribut some of the declin in order over the past two month to the start of the war in iraq  most of the firm  howev  said that such war relat declin were slight or moder  region labor market also remain weak   the recent benchmark of state employ data show that the declin in employ in our three state area in      was not as larg as origin report   but there were declin nonetheless  and employ in the region has continu to contract this year   residenti construct  which has been one of our stronger sector  has eas in recent month   the demand for offic and commerci space continu to be soft in the first quarter   retail sale in the district in late march and earli april were run below year ago level in all line of merchandis   and retail attribut lower spring sale to a combin of unseason cold weather  the  e of ea   and the war in iraq  but amid these report of subdu activ  i   ve notic some renew op  sinc the end of the war   dure april and may i typic travel the district  hold a seri of meet with our banker and busi leader   my exchang with them over the past few week reveal an improv outlook and higher confid that the recoveri will begin to develop some traction in the second half of the year   they   re not expect a strong rebound in activ but a rebound nonetheless   some of my contact tell me that their firm are start to undertak major capit invest  feel that they   ve sat on the sidelin long enough   this is a definit chang in mood sinc our march meet and our mid april confer call  my view on the nation economi is similar   the hard data on the real sector have general been on the weak side   the initi es  for first quarter gdp was weaker than i was expect  and we continu to see job loss   but the softer inform from anecdot report and the develop in the financi market have been posit   equiti price and corpor profit are up   credit risk spread and oil price are down   in march we acknowledg that it was difficult to discern how much of the econom weak was due to concern about geopolit uncertainti and how much was due to a weaker under econom dynam   we also acknowledg that a short live and success war in iraq would resolv some of the uncertainti but that we wouldn   t have much data on the real side of the economi soon after the war end  given the lag in the receipt of those data   we point to data on oil price  financi market indic  and anecdot evid as the initi piec of inform we could look to as a way to assess postwar econom condit  inde  that is the situat in which we find ourselv today   most of our real sector data are date  so they continu to reflect the influenc of the war and therefor are less help in discern econom condit go forward   the data from financi market and on consum confid  which do reflect postwar condit  have been quit favor  accord  i have littl to say about the  book and it attend forecast   the baselin forecast seem right  and the altern forecast were help to see the sensit of the result   howev  given that forecast general depend somewhat on retrospect  i don   t receiv the usual comfort from the staff   s effort this  e around   that   s not a critic of the effort but rather a manifest of the  e period we are in  that said  i would like to react to the deflat exercis in the  book   the simul exercis impli that the probabl of deflat by the end of      is about    percent   i might quibbl with the board staff   s definit of deflat     of   percent may seem reason  but recent academ work suggest that the bias in price index is declin   more to the point  howev  i think our concern about deflat is a concern that the economi may exhibit behavior associ with deflat psycholog  which includ an expect of continu price declin   i   m not sure that a four quarter    basi point benchmark captur this veri well   further  i question how sensit the staff   s es  is to use a random select of shock from      to        a  e period that includ the     s  a decad character by both volatil and a higher level of inflat   i wonder what the impact would be of use a sampl period over which the economi was less volatil and the averag rate of inflat was lower   start  say  in        my question regard definit and  e period are in part a reaction to the result of this exercis   the result  in short  are troubl   a    percent probabl is not trivial  nonetheless  given the current accommod stanc of monetari polici and the prospect of more accommod fiscal polici  it appear wise to wait to see what addit data tell us about postwar condit befor decid how to respond to the slow of growth exhibit in the data   if the sluggish continu in the period after the war  then a reduct in rate may be in order   in the mean   i think we should remain alert to new inform and evid of chang in either direct in the real economi   thank you  mr  chairman

all togeth  i found littl in either the avail data or the anecdot inform from our region that clarifi whether the current think and behavior are a result of uncertainti or are simpli a realiz of the downsid risk   it seem that it   s just too soon to tell  this is how i read the incom data at the nation level as well   while it   s easi to be at least a littl disappoint that we haven   t yet seen concret evid of grow momentum  the data are just not suffici distant from the war period to allow us to pars the econom consequ of resolv war relat uncertainti from the econom fundament   the consensus among most privat forecast as well as the  book and my own forecast all make a reason case for grow momentum as we move through the year and into next year  but i agre with the chairman   s observ in his recent tes oni that the futur path of the economi is like to come into focus onli gradual  the outlook for inflat is alway an import part of our polici deliber  and there continu to be a debat about the potenti danger of deflat   i take these concern serious also  but i am not yet convinc that deflat is our foremost risk at this  e   briefli i   m go to indic whi   the deflat issu is not simpli about a declin price level but rather reflect concern about the potenti for a signific and widespread weaken in real activ and the disrupt to financi intermedi that accompani it  like those we experienc in the great depress   the great depress deflat was in my view the result of widespread real econom weak  polici error  and extrem domest financi distress  along with intern financi shock that togeth form the    perfect storm      the question is whether we see similar precondit today for such an episod and if so  what is the support empir evid  we clear have experienc signific extern shock   but the real economi is recov  albeit slowli   it is not contract   some sector do continu to suffer   price are fall for output in certain industri   the airlin  telecom  high tech and manufactur good general and for some commod   these are relat price declin  howev  and do not reflect across the board deflat   in most instanc the caus are easili explain by idiosyncrat shock or industri specif circumst   the price declin flow from product increas  overcapac  increas global and local competit  outmod busi model  and secular industri chang  as a consequ  the relat price declin particular to these sector are go to occur no matter what we do in the monetari polici area   even so  the concern for polici may be that the weaken of relat price will feed through into a general deflat   to date  howev  there is no sign that this is happen   inflat is still posit   furthermor  none of the expect measur either from survey or the term structur signal that deflat is on the horizon   last  the fall in the valu of the dollar relat to the currenc of countri experienc inflat is not consist with a deflationari scenario for the unit state  what about polici mistak   in the great depress  the money suppli contract over    percent  and financi intermedi came close to shut down   today  monetari polici is quit accommod in my view  the monetari aggreg continu to grow  and bank balanc sheet and capit posit are favor   financi condit today appear far more posit and simpli aren   t compar to the distress situat observ dure the great depress  intermedi is take place  and creditworthi borrow continu to fund themselv through depositori institut and capit market   what we are see now in the financi distress indic such as measur of default  chargeoff  and delinqu are within the rang of standard recess and are not in my view symptomat of a debt deflat  nor are they a concern to bank supervis at this  e  for some there is the specter that what happen in japan may also happen here   my read of the condit in japan  howev  suggest that they parallel the problem of our great depress   the main differ is a matter of degre   e  and the willing of the govern to prop up econom insolv institut with implicit guarante   real econom activ in japan has declin for near a decad  and a gradual deflat appear to be expect   financi distress in japanes depositori institut is the most signific and well known problem   were it not for implicit govern guarante  these institut would like have fail a long  e ago  and the economi may have gone into a tailspin   in the mean   japan continu to consum it accumul wealth   again  the featur of this experi are not in my view compar to our own situat at this  e  look ahead to our polici discuss  i would observ again that interest rate are alreadi low  monetari polici is alreadi s ul  fiscal polici is s ul and like to get more so  and most forecast are show grow momentum as we move through the year and into next year   it seem to me that we have  e to let the war relat uncertainti unwind and to wait for the path of the economi to becom clear   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   as far as the district economi is concern  we have the usual mix bag of read on activ   but overal i would say that the recent tenor of the incom inform has been perhap a bit better   what i   m go to discuss is base a littl on data but come most from anecdot heard at a recent meet of our advisori council on small busi  agricultur  and labor and at a meet with the leader of the twin citi financi communiti  hous has continu to be a bright spot  at least through march   all indic of hous activ in the district have been quit favor   as far as the industri sector is concern  i would say that  at worst  condit have stabil  and some small manufactur are suggest that activ is pick up   the truck industri in our part of the world seem to be quit busi  although the larg amount of consolid in that industri may be a contribut factor   but i would say that overal there is certain some op  among small manufactur and other in industri that the next six month will be better than the last six to twelv month  consum spend for the most part has held up  and credit qualiti  sn   t seem to be a concern among the vast preponder of bank   on the negat side  there certain has been no discern improv in labor market condit  and no dramat increas in hire appear to be under way   pressur on state and local govern budget persist  and we haven   t seen all of the ramif of that yet   the major airlin base in minneapoli is suffer  as are most of the other major airlin  although to date it problem aren   t quit as sever as some of the higher profil one that we are all awar of  final  base on convers with our contact  there  sn   t seem to be ani reason to expect a quick acceler in capit spend   the stori i got on that realli has three part  some of which are relat   one is clear what i would call a product stori   busi simpli have found way to produc more with the same input   they were quit explicit about that  and they seem to feel that it has some way to go   relat to that  there is veri littl pressur on capac so there   s no s ulus to busi capit invest come from capac pressur   moreov  some busi  as other have comment alreadi  have been busi restructur their balanc sheet and want to get that complet befor they contempl sizabl capit spend project  as far as the evid on the nation economi is concern  i read it the way other have done  i think   clear it has been on the soft side  which has produc what i would expect   caution among forecast and among the busi communiti   i share that caution at this stage   but i tri to remind myself that there   s alway the danger of get whipsaw here by mark down the forecast just as condit are about to get better or vice versa   one thing i know for sure from the day when i was do a lot of bottom up forecast is that  in sluggish circumst such as this  it   s veri hard to convinc yourself that econom activ is actual go to pick up   it   s just the natur of the beast   today  outsid of defens spend  it   s hard to envis an acceler in most of the compon of aggreg demand  yet we know from histori that sooner or later the economi   pick up  especi when the fundament   and by fundament i   m talk here about product and the stanc of monetari polici and fiscal polici   are favor  but in addit  i view dino   s descript of financi market develop  with essenti a rise in equiti price in mani part of the world and declin credit qualiti spread  as confirm what we alreadi know  which is that in the past sever week the big thing have gone right   by that i mean that the war end success and quick  energi price came down signific and rapid  and earn have been at least no wors than earlier fear or expect   all of that give me some comfort  but it  sn   t help me answer the question as to when we might actual see some acceler in econom growth
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to concentr my comment on anecdot inform that is veri  veri recent becaus the formal data we have now are almost entir from the period when the war was still in progress   my contact suggest that there is a more op ist tone  but i   m wonder whether that op ist tone reflect more a sigh of relief that the worst didn   t happen rather than ani genuin op    everyon emphas that they don   t see ani evid in the data right now  there is a sens of greater op  but noth actual go on that suggest a pickup  i talk with my wal mart contact ye day   it was about      p m  on monday  and as is usual  he had data through a good part of the day alreadi    laughter   he said there is no sign of ani signific increas in consum buy   weekend sale were     percent abov the previous year for compar store  and the data so far for monday didn   t indic anyth new go on   he said that there is no evid of ani postwar bounc in consum spend on the kind of item that wal mart sell   there was no weather explan  weather has been normal in most of the countri  includ tornado in the midwest at this  e of year  i   ve also been tri to press my contact on the capit spend outlook   my up and fedex contact both emphas that they   re not buy ani new aircraft   they are give up all of the option they had previous to purchas aircraft   my up contact made a comment that i thought was rather interest   up is even look at pay the penalti to give up firm order becaus the price of use aircraft has come down so much that it might be cheaper for up to go ahead and pay those penalti   of cours  for ani one compani the purchas of use aircraft is a capit outlay  but it is not an increas in capit spend for the economi as a whole   that may be a point that has more general applic as we tri to interpret anecdot report about capit spend go forward becaus there is an aw lot of idl offic space and equip and so forth   in particular  i   m think about structur where from a compani   s point of view they are spend more   and they tell us that   but it  sn   t show up for the economi as a whole  as i look at the nation outlook in term of the actual data  those data are almost uniform on the weak side with minor except   the posit inform is most the financi market inform   the stock market as well as bond market spread   and  of cours  oil price also   i think we should all be awar that while a better tone in the secur market is a posit develop  we know that later this week or next week all that could disappear in a flash   the bottom line for me is that there is no sign at all of a postwar bounc in the inform that we have   thank you
let me begin by summar my broad view   the eleventh district is show some sign of stabil with modest job growth recent  which is better than the continu job loss at the nation level   the real economi continu to soften at the nation level  but consum sen ent has improv   spread have narrow  profit have turn up  oil price have declin  and the stock market has rebound   look onli at the real economi  further eas seem warrant  but the  e might be bad now with the financi market signal that a rebound may be come soon without addit s ulus   moreov  the market are not expect further eas today  so the reaction to a surpris could well be pervers   market particip might believ that the fed know someth that they don   t  turn back to the eleventh district  the economi appear to have bottom out and is show earli and  i hope  sustain sign of expand at a sluggish pace   texa has experienc posit employ growth over the last two quarter  which is better than the nation   s loss of job  as i indic earlier   job growth was at a     percent annual rate   over the last two quarter  job gain have been concentr in construct  financi servic  educ and health servic and in the govern sector   despit veri high energi price over most of that period  the energi sector has been shed job at a rapid clip   though texa has had posit job growth  our unemploy rate has risen sharpli and is near a percentag point abov the nation rate  a few bright spot are begin to emerg  though   our high tech industri may final be show sign of life   job loss there have slow as profit and order are show sign of improv   on the posit side  drill for natur gas has continu to regist gain now that the energi industri is more confid that strong natur gas price are not go to go away soon   on the bad news side  the demand for gas is outstrip the abil to bring on new product  and gas price now are expect to remain well abov histor norm for sever year   oil price are expect to fall further  but energi price overal will not fall proportion becaus natur gas and oil price are expect to be decoupl over the next few year   anoth bright spot come from the temporari employ industri in our area  which has experienc a job surg at an annual rate just under    percent in the first quarter  in contrast to what michael just report for the bigger pictur   final  our beig book contact report that retail  auto  and restaur sale have begun to reviv after be depress dure the war with iraq  on the negat side  the downsiz of airlin oper is continu  and further employ reduct are expect   the wage reduct of rough    percent that airlin employe are experienc are ad to deflationari pressur in the high tech sector as is the district  turn to the nation economi  i   m inclin to agre that the staff forecast for the second half of the year is the most like outcom   it has been six month sinc we   ve lower rate but the real fed fund rate is where it was befor the last rate cut   monetari polici is less s ul  and the economi is probabl less sensit to ani fed s ulus than it was a year ago   although feder govern s ulus is expect to increas in the near futur  the polit process may provid less s ulus than we   ve been anticip   further delay clariti on exact what will be contain in the fiscal packag mean that ani spend that is sensit to the tax code will like continu to be defer   in short  we may be get a lot less s ulus from both monetari and fiscal polici than we think   in addit  the state and local fiscal situat onli reinforc this conclus  as i look at the other downsid risk to the economi  i   m increas concern about the economi underperform the  book forecast   the outlook for econom growth in the rest of the world has been continu revis down for month on end   also  while busi balanc sheet have undergon consider repair  there   s a way to go befor balanc sheet are in line with the econom realiti of the last coupl of year   that appli to the broad swath of busi  not just to the industri such as airlin and telecom that are undergo enorm structur adjust  so overal i see the risk to the forecast as lie primarili on the downsid   given how low inflat has fallen and the possibl of a shortfal from current econom forecast  i could support an eas in monetari polici at this meet   but as i said earlier  financi market are signal better  e ahead  and an eas today could unsettl the market   so i think wait is in order   i feel the risk are weight to the downsid  but i   d rather not say that by reintroduc the bias statement at today   s meet
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi actual has shown sign of some further modest weaken sinc the last meet due part  and onli part  to the war   both retail sale and manufactur activ have edg down  and tourism has been soft   some of the reduct in tourism was veri clear relat to the war   there were a lot of cancel in the tourist area of colorado particular   on the manufactur side  just to give you a sens of recent develop  the year over year index for product deriv from our manufactur survey  after have reach a level of    in februari  slip to minus   in march and was minus   in april   the year over year index for new order  howev  was actual   in april  up from   in march   so it   s a mix bag but is not veri encourag  we have met with our econom advisori council and some of our director  and there is a mix tone in their report  with some modest op  but quit a bit of    let   s wait and see      there has been  of cours  some further pickup in energi activ and some veri modest moder in privat sector layoff announc   consum are in a littl better mood sinc militari oper in iraq end but remain basic cautious   most busi report that the end of the war has not affect their plan  mean that they are still in somewhat of a wait and see mode   on the inflat front  wage and price pressur remain subdu  but firm are increas worri about the impact of insur cost on their profit margin  let me turn to the nation scene   the broad contour of our econom forecast have chang veri littl sinc our last meet   like the  book  we expect modest growth in the second quarter follow by a rebound to trend growth in the second half and then greater than trend growth next year   for all the reason outlin by other and in the  book   monetari polici  fiscal polici  the strength in the financi system  fall oil price  and so forth   demand should pick up   but in that context i   m awar that the recent news  as other have indic  has been relat disappoint   that   s part the reason  which i understand  for take the posit that we should move now for insur   also  while i don   t necessarili think that the probabl of deflat are as high as dave outlin   depend on the model  one can get much lower probabl   the fact of the matter is that acceler inflat is not a near term threat   i understand that also as one of the argument for go ahead and eas now  have thought about that  though  i am more of the view that we ought to wait and see until june   a reason for that is spell out in part   of the  book  in what i think is an import statement            we cannot yet discern whether the uncertainti that may have been restrain privat spend has lift      we will know a littl more about that in june   the second reason that i would put forward for wait until june is that if we eas now   though depend on how much   i think the zero bound will move from an issu on which we get a general question from  e to  e to one of signific debat and discuss public   the nay sayer in various group will be bring that up becaus the fund rate would be that much lower and the zero bound that much closer   moreov  we have an import discuss come up in june on communic   some of that will relat to the issu of the zero bound   so we will be in a better posit to have clearer thought on how we as a committe should talk about that go forward   i think there are legi  question as to how to discuss issu relat to the zero bound   while it may be easi to communic that we can buy asset up the yield curv  there will be question such as what we are target   reserv  an averag rate  or whatev  i   d like to have a discuss of those issu by this committe befor we move to a more public realm on them   so i think that wait until june has veri littl downsid and it may posit us well for a clearer view go forward from there   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   there   s littl in the recent data regard econom activ in new england that suggest much in the way of forward momentum   recent employ data  especi the benchmark revis in the earli spring  indic much steeper employ loss than previous thought   these loss were more signific in size in      to be sure  but in the period from the suppos end of the recess at year end      to the present  region job loss have been relat sever in new england compar with elsewher   inde  while the region is rough   percent of the nation   s popul and econom activ  it job loss over the past year have equal about    percent of the total for the countri as a whole   massachusett has been hardest hit among the new england state and has lost more job in percentag term from pre recess peak than ani other state   to those new england who gaug condit by compar them to the worst recess in memori  the         recess   and the number of those is not trivial   there is some reassur news  relat speak  thing are not as bad as they were then   this  e the pain is more even share  albeit with new england clear on the low side in term of job  other  more forward look indic on the region economi have a brighter tone  like the nation  consum confid in the region improv in april  and busi confid rose a bit as well  larg becaus of improv expect about the futur   an index of lead indic for massachusett remain in negat territori  howev  push off thought of posit growth for the state until later in the fall  in our last telephon confer call  i share with member of the committe a great deal of anecdot inform that we had gather over the intermeet period   as you   ll recal  those anecdot reflect littl near term op  about the outlook and not much in the way of plan for new capit spend  particular domest   contact sinc the last phone call have echo mani of the same theme   in talk with a senior offici at cvs  which is a pharmaci chain with a fair broad nationwid presenc  i heard comment similar to those that presid pool heard from his wal mart contact   my sourc said that cvs see no sign of a postwar pickup in spend and a continu of the trend toward buy smaller rather than bigger size of item   despit what we might read about the popular of economi size   he also note that fewer custom are buy multipl refil of their prescript  peopl are purchas onli the exact amount they need or some  not even a full month   s prescript  so  there is clear a trend toward less spend   most of our contact don   t see a signific rebound in activ this year   they are all hope that      will be better  on the nation front  labor market remain quit slack  labor forc particip is down  unemploy is up  and industri product and busi invest remain subpar despit some sign of life in the telecom world   about the onli good news sinc our last meet came from equiti market  buoy by the end of the war  better than expect corpor profit  fall oil price  and rise consum confid   these bright spot seem fragil  howev   contact at thompson first call expect corpor profit growth to slow substanti in the second quarter  as energi compani earn reflect lower oil price and as the benefici effect of currenc translat diminish   it is question whether market will continu to surpris on the upsid and whether confid will buoy spend  given the impact of real econom data  job loss  and the inevit reduct in the sens of postwar relief  most peopl i   ve talk to over the last sever week have had one question in common  they ask  how is it that standard forecast for econom growth over the next year or so all have a sizabl rebound in the last half of this year   peopl ask this base on their own perspect and what they see in their industri   they wonder what will happen to turn thing around  well  one answer is fiscal polici in the form of increas defens spend and tax reduct  if ani of the plan now be debat in washington are in fact enact into law   but when i say that  the repli usual is  what about state and local spend   taken togeth  state and local govern spend account for about    percent of real gdp   almost as much as busi invest and near twice as much as feder govern spend   given state deficit of about      billion or so in the aggreg for fiscal       it seem clear that either spend will declin or local tax will increas by amount that eat signific into dispos incom  either way there would be some offset  howev sizabl  to feder s ulus  anoth answer to the question of what will fo  a pickup in the economi is that monetari polici is accommod and that the market expect it to stay so   but is it realli  with declin inflat rate  real interest rate are no more accommod than they were befor our last    basi point move in novemb  at least accord to the bluebook analysi     is the fed realli do enough     these question ask  the final answer to the question lie in the fact that three year have pass  technolog has becom obsolet  product remain strong  and busi will soon be forc to invest more   that   s the same logic use in last may   s  book which forecast gdp growth  led by op  about both consumpt and invest  by the end of the year to be about     percentag point higher than it in fact was   clear we were wrong then   perhap the passag of  e has rais the likelihood of our be right this  e   that is  an addit year of spend deferr may have made a second half of      spurt of growth more like  but it   s hard to find mani busi peopl   except in the biotech arena  which has most small firm  or in direct defens contract   who think that the kind of growth project in the  book is a good bet  especi by the end of this year   they may simpli be myopic  nonetheless  i remain skeptic about the strength of the  book forecast for the rest of       even recogn that it has been temper a bit   i wonder as well about the project of a near   percent pace of gdp growth by year end        this forecast seem to have more than it share of risk on the downsid   but even if it is realiz  we will have had near four year of below potenti growth and an output gap even into        unemploy rise through most of the forecast period  fall onli in the last quarter of        and inflat trend downward to below at least my definit of price stabil  given the uncertainti of measur   while i   m concern about the potenti for deflat  for mani of the reason presid guynn mention i don   t think that all aspect of deflat and deflationari psycholog are as like as the  book suggest  that said  the degre of expect price declin and it implic for slack resourc use are not ideal nor in my view consist with our dual mandat   as i note befor  with fall inflat  monetari polici has becom less accommod   it may be  e now   and if not now  soon   to adjust polici so that it provid continu support dure this long  gradual recoveri period   in my view  there   s littl risk  and there could be consider gain in do that  and i think there is a way to explain it

thank you  mr  chairman   my comment about econom condit in the fourth district are not too differ from those that my colleagu have alreadi report about their district   moreov  condit in our region haven   t chang veri much sinc my last sever report   the fourth district   s economi is pois to expand at a fa  pace in the second half of this year  but reason doubt still exist about the  e and the extent of that expans   district busi leader and banker i   ve talk to are still express caution if not outright skeptic about the environ   the banker continu to enjoy fee incom from mortgag refinanc  but they know they can   t reli on that product line to sustain their busi indefinit   they look forward to expand their commerci and industri loan  but their most creditworthi custom have yet to see ani need to draw down their credit line  busi firm still seem to place a premium on stay liquid   for exampl  sever member of our busi advisori council indic that their custom are extend the period over which they are make payment   some of them are extend it by thirti to sixti day  not becaus they don   t have the cash to pay but becaus they want to conserv their cash and stay more liquid  anoth condit that hasn   t chang in sever month  as mani other have alreadi note  is the avers to busi invest   i continu to question busi peopl close about their capit spend plan  and i   ve yet to find ani concret evid point to a firm of spend plan later this year   there is just too much excess capac in too mani firm   also  in line with what presid pool report earlier  sever manufactur have told me that there   s a glut of use capit equip on the market and  becaus of the glut  price are quit low   some firm with veri strong balanc sheet are buy this equip and wareh it until demand pick up  reason that in the worst case scenario they can just sell it again   howev  most firm i   ve talk to don   t want to buy ani capit equip even at these low price  the equip they alreadi own has lost signific market valu  weaken their balanc sheet   lender  consequ  are less will to advanc credit to these firm  busi condit haven   t deterior   just the balanc sheet  mani manufactur in the district also have becom increas more pessimist about their abil in the longer term to compet against firm that have locat product facil outsid the unit state  especi in area like china  where labor cost are quit low   some of these manufactur are recal the shakeout that occur in the     s after a long period of dollar appreci   in today   s environ  manufactur are still cut their price but are face higher input cost for both raw materi and labor benefit   they fear that we   re in anoth ratchet down of industri activ in this countri   a structur adjust that they say began in late      and could persist for sever more year  turn to the nation econom outlook  if i general what i   m hear from my district contact   mani of whom have oper nation and intern   one infer that i can draw is that busi fix invest may be weaker than in the  book path  at least for the next year or two   it could be that the negat tone i   m hear from these busi peopl is contemporan and not predict of their futur invest plan   if that   s the case and the negat tone simpli reflect the current cautious environ  then when econom activ pick up we may inde see the stronger busi fix invest portray in the  book   howev  if the negat tone is more foretel of problemat fundament  then perhap it reflect a reduc expect return to new invest   so it may be tell us that the equilibrium real rate of capit has move down somewhat and will remain lower for a longer period of  e than we thought   i expect we   ll talk more about that dure the polici discuss  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve been tri to think of a term that best describ our district   s economi and the best i can come up with is    tread water      i don   t have a sens that the economi is sink  but i don   t see much forward momentum either  our latest month survey on activ in the manufactur  retail  and nonretail servic sector in our district were conduct in mid to late april  they are not complet yet  but we have most of the result  and they indic that both manufactur and retail are quit soft current   part of the weak in retail may have to do with the unusu cool and wet spring weather we   ve been have in our area   the result from the nonretail servic sector survey   which cover truck compani  busi servic firm  much of the tourist industri  and so forth   are a littl better   they suggest a bit of firm in some of these industri  as i think i mention on the last confer call   the tourist industri along the coast  for exampl  seem to be do better than might have been anticip   but again  other than a coupl of except like that  there   s not a lot of forward momentum  these more or less stationari condit in our region i think main reflect both household and busi attitud about the near term outlook   i would describ those attitud as skeptic or still mix  with a fair amount of linger pessim despit the earli and success conclus of the war   a lot of peopl in our area seem to think that the sluggish in activ is due primarili to the remain slack in the economi that was creat by the revers of the boom of the late      s   they figur that it cannot easili be correct by low interest rate or tax cut but just has to be work through   for lack of a better phrase   howev long that take   one bright side of this is that attitud about the outlook could improv quit rapid if peopl get a sens that this work through process is near complet   in that regard  ani upward bounc in activ that eventu   result from the success complet of the war   and despit the lack of clear evid now i think we could get someth like that   could be help if it   s taken as a sign that this process is near complet  most of the recent data suggest that the nation economi is also tread water   by all account real gdp continu to grow moder  but hour work are still contract  and the output gap appear to be widen further   in this context  to me the most strike recent develop is the behavior of core inflat   a point a lot of other peopl have comment on alreadi   i think the  book put it veri well     note that in the last few month core inflat has enter a rang that  given the measur bias  realli approach zero inflat  a deceler of inflat would have been regard as desir in the past  a lot of us thought that   but as the chairman apt put it last week  today substanti further disinfl would be an unwelcom develop   i thought that remark was someth of watersh  mr  chairman  becaus it confirm veri nice that we truli are conduct monetari polici in an environ of price stabil now  with risk on both side of the coin go forward   specif  just as we face the risk of rise inflat momentum in the past   and undoubt will again in the futur   we now also face a meaning risk that disinfl may acquir momentum and creat deflat and a zero bound problem  with advers consequ for the economi and for monetari polici  with this in mind  the crucial question today  as i see it  is whether the recent further actual disinfl indic that the risk of grow disinflationari momentum has now reach the point where we should act to preempt it   i   ve struggl a great deal with that question  and the deflat exercis in the  book didn   t rais my comfort level a whole lot      i think it   s an except close call   but on balanc  recent develop suggest to me that we   re not quit at the point where we need to act   as other have note  the real fund rate is at or near zero and has been in the vicin of zero for some  e   oil price are fall  the stock market seem to be strengthen  profit appear to be rise again  credit spread are continu to improv  and the  book is project substanti addit fiscal s ulus in come quarter   given these develop  i think we can prudent wait a littl longer befor act and tri to get a clearer idea of whether the economi is go to get a postwar boost or not   i don   t think we realli know the answer to that yet   wait would also have the advantag of ensur that we won   t undercut ani reviv op  that the end of war might s ul in the near term
let   s break for coffe and come back in ten or fifteen minut   coffe break
are we all here   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the answer to presid     s question   who i suspect are realli her alter ego or perhap she   s been speak into the mirror in the morn   as to what will lead to higher growth ahead is that some of the factor restrain growth over the last few quarter should be abat   mani of the develop over the intermeet period have made me a littl more confid in that judgment   it seem to me more like that the expans will inde strengthen go forward and break out of the   percent to   percent growth path that it has been on sinc last summer  as other have observ  the eb of geopolit risk has bol  confid  lower the oil price tax fa  than anticip  and fo  better condit in financi market   the sign of improv go beyond the reduct in geopolit risk   increas  it look as though the restraint is lift from the other persist forc we have cite as hold back the economi   the unwind of the excess of the late     s   these includ the fallout from bad credit decis  defici in corpor govern and transpar  the drop in equiti price  and the overshoot in capit spend   risk spread in credit market have more than retrac their run up of last summer  appropri so in my view sinc bond default rate have also come down substanti   market reaction to occasion new revel of corpor malfeas have been much more measur  suggest that investor have greater confid in the inform they are get from most busi even befor they   ve had the benefit of new leadership at the account oversight board    laughter   as could be seen in dino   s chart  the impli volatil in bond and stock market have also fallen to the level of last spring   as a consequ  although sure some of the caution from govern scandal is linger in busi decis  the cost of capit to busi has decreas  and firm need to have much less concern about conserv cash for fear of overreact to earn announc in skittish market  equiti price have not retrac all of their loss of last summer  but they are well off their low of that  e and have been for a while so that the forc of the negat wealth effect should be decreas over  e   the latest real side data show a littl less weak in nonresidenti construct   the most recent data do indic a tentat pickup in order for equip  reinforc the assess that most capit overhang have larg dissip and rais hope that replac demand may be strengthen   moreov  demand will be further support by a lower dollar  which notabl has occur without ani percept advers effect on u s  asset price   sure lower oil price  greater consum confid  and more accommod financi condit will work togeth with s ul fiscal and monetari polici and continu gain in real incom from rise product to strengthen growth   you can tri that in the mirror  cathi  to see if it work  but as the chairman note in his recent tes oni  the extent and  e of the pickup are uncertain  we still don   t have enough new inform to sort out whether the mark weaken in februari and march was almost entir relat to the close onset of war or also reflect more persist problem that will damp the upturn   we still don   t have enough inform to judg how much the better condit will feed through to spend and product   what is not uncertain is that whatev recoveri the economi experi will be start from a much weaker posit than i had expect just a few month ago   the data we   ve receiv over the last two intermeet period were consider softer than i had anticip  and my expect for growth this year have been revis down a lot sinc januari   in addit  consum inflat has come down fa  than i thought it would  the staff has interpret what we   ve seen as part reflect weaker under demand as well as war relat jitter   so  the level of output in the  book remain below the level of the januari forecast through the entir project period   even so  the staff has incorpor a prompt and sharp strengthen of growth in come month just to hold the economi on a slight lower path   these judgment seem reason  though as i just impli it may be too earli to make this call with much confid  as for the risk  i don   t have anyth use to add to the sens of risk on both the upsid and the downsid that dave and mani of you have mention   what i do want to emphas is that this lower start point for activ and price make a rebound of at least the dimens and persist envis in the staff forecast   if not a stronger rebound   all the more critic for econom welfar  and it has potenti import implic for polici   the output gap is wider than expect  and without a veri strong rebound  it will remain wider at a  e when there is no reason to accept the loss of incom and product longer than necessari   moreov  the slack in resourc util impli that inflat is pois to go lower from level alreadi consist with price stabil   i don   t believ the current low inflat rate is itself an impedi to econom prosper   i don   t see evid  for exampl  that the zero bound on wage is rais actual or steadi state unemploy rate   my guess is that most of the bellyach about the lack of price power or current inflat rate would evapor if demand were stronger and capit util rate higher  but there are risk from low and declin inflat rate   for the most part inflat expect have been stabl   i   m not sure  howev  that peopl have taken on board the veri low level of under inflat   especi if that inflat fall much further  inflat expect could decreas in come quarter as headlin inflat move lower follow the energi price declin   this would tend to rais real interest rate  absent offset polici action  also  even at high level of employ  veri low  steadi state inflat   by keep the feder fund rate and other interest rate down   could limit our room to maneuv were the economi subsequ to be hit with a downward shock   such risk at the current rate of under inflat or one that was onli a few tenth lower probabl aren   t larg   but i would be concern if it look as though we were on a glide path that would leav inflat at consider lower level   for all these reason  it   s import that we soon see the economi strengthen  and by quit a bit  in order to reduc the output gap and limit the declin in inflat   i   m look forward to the discuss of the stanc of monetari polici in light of this imper   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district economi has shown scatter sign of improv sinc my last report   but general most sector can still be character as weak   employ and labor forc indic have been mix with littl chang overal  as labor market have remain slack   manufactur note some improv in busi condit in recent week and are increas op ist about the near term outlook   retail report that sale remain below plan in march but pick up somewhat in earli april   base on two separ survey  consum confid has improv moder sinc the last report   hous permit weaken in the first quarter as the slowdown in singl famili construct more than offset increas in apart construct   sale of exist singl famili home and apart slow notic  though sell price have remain firm except at the high end of the market   demand for offic space in the new york citi area continu to slacken in the first quarter  and district bank report increas demand for home mortgag and steadi to lower delinqu rate  i find myself so in agreement with governor kohn   s remark that i would just like to add some veri small  almost footnot to them  on the geopolit uncertainti  i   ve argu at previous meet that the middl east is basic an unstabl place and  therefor  that the geopolit uncertainti is like to continu but will be differ   as for the likelihood of iraq stabil into a model democraci  it could well happen  but if it    it will happen slowli and there will be mani bump along the road   the possibl of instabl in some of iraq   s neighbor countri is quit high  and therefor i think it is like that we will live in an environ of continu geopolit uncertainti   what one  sn   t know is whether the american peopl and those in other nation will react the way they did to terror   that is  to accept it as a fact of life and learn to live a reason normal life with normal econom reaction despit that realiti  as for risk avers  i think it is like to continu   but risk avers is a psycholog condit and is rather similar to an oversold trade posit   if half a dozen of the most respect busi execut in america sudden turn open op ist  i think the possibl of other follow is quit high   whether that will happen  i don   t know   but the natur of the american societi is that one would expect that to happen  with the  e be difficult to guess  i think the main thing we have to cope with today is the realiti of the marketplac   after a period of substanti volatil in the equiti market  the recent upturn in the market impress me as someth other than just an extra bit of volatil   it has at least the make of a breakout  but it is a rather unstabl and veri uncertain one   in the debt market  as has been discuss  spread have narrow  but they   re still broad by histor standard  and that too is a rather tentat movement   the dollar weak has continu  today the euro is at about          i think we have to be care about the move into the euro as the currenc of choic  with grow specul long posit in the euro   that could turn into someth that would not be veri pretti to watch   that is  a dollar that is weaken far beyond what the macroeconom fundament would indic  but last and perhap far more import  there is absolut no sens in the marketplac that we are go to chang polici today   even though a week ago i thought that chang polici today would have quit a lot to say for it  i believ it would be veri  veri danger to surpris the market in light of the precari of it recent strengthen   i think the immedi reaction of market observ would be to ask  what   the fed know that we don   t know   the answer to that is    noth      so it seem to me that the prudent central banker would think veri serious and decid that polici should stay where it is   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for ani fomc meet it obvious seem appropri to make some judgment about three differ forecast issu  the first is whether the baselin forecast is both reason and accept   the second is how the forecast has evolv over a period of  e  either between meet or even go back a littl further in  e   and the third is what the risk are around the baselin   so let me tell you how i  at least  look at each of those three issu  on the first  i   d argu that the  book baselin forecast may well be reason  certain with the end of the militari phase of the iraqi war  financi condit have clear improv  as other have alreadi indic   equiti price are rise   risk spread have narrow somewhat  though they are still relat wide by histor standard   reduct in oil price  as expect  have becom clearer  and we   ve seen an improv in consum confid and a small uptick in corpor profit   all of those develop i would argu might well be consist with the basic contour of the baselin forecast  take that baselin as at least a reason outlook at this stage  the second part of my first question is  is it accept   to that my answer is a resound    no      i don   t think the baselin growth outcom is suffici   the output gap envis in the baselin persist for sever quarter  it is not close dure the forecast period   unemploy rate remain well abov ani that are reason for a well perform u s  economi   in addit  the composit of gdp growth is an issu   at least in the near term  the acceler in gdp growth is heavili depend on govern defens spend  and inde  privat demand is notic weaker than one would like   import  as other have mention  the inflat prospect offer in the baselin are a concern   in the context of our price stabil target and recogn some uncertainti about measur  i also judg the inflat outlook to be verg on unattract  on this point i want to make a slight distinct to explain the natur of my concern   this is not a question in my mind about deflat per se   it   s certain not a question of go back to the experi of the      s   this is realli much more a question about further disinfl  which is troubl for a number of reason   one reason is it implic for the effect of monetari polici   a second is the vulner of an alreadi weak economi to ani addit shock that might emerg from either intern or extern sourc  also  i would say that have price inflat drop even lower than is current forecast increas the possibl of what i think of as some self fulfil negat ramif for both household and busi   so i   d argu that even if the baselin is reason   as i believ it is    i don   t think it   s necessarili accept and we should be vigil in that regard  the second issu that one think of in term of forecast is exact how the forecast has evolv   as   alreadi point out in his prepar remark  there have been signific downward revis in the staff   s forecast sinc march   i think cathi compar it with the project of about a year ago   i went back to the septemb       book and look at each one of the  book forecast sinc then   with one except  the gdp outlook has been mark down each  e   there has also been a mark down in the rate of inflat   that clear reflect the fact that the data have been come in weaker and weaker dure everi one of these success period  which   at least undermin to some degre the confid one might have in the  book forecast  what the staff has done in the context of incom data that have been weaker and weaker has been to reduc the expect for the first part of       reduc a bit the expect for the second part of       but ramp up quit dramat the expect for        as i read it  they   ve done that but have given exact the same set of reason for growth that at one point was thought to be around     or     percent in      and is now project to be     percent in        so we do have a bit of a problem in that we   re start  as don kohn said  from a much lower base and hope to get a much bigger pickup in        i trust that this is not the triumph of hope over experi and realiti  let me go to the third question  which involv the issu of risk   i would say that the risk are in some sens balanc  but i think we have to be veri cautious in that assess   in order to see ani upsid risk with respect to the baselin forecast  i think two thing have to emerg and they have to do so veri soon   one is that the tentat natur of the various convers mani of us have had with busi peopl has to turn quick to a revel of a great deal of pent up demand either for busi fix invest or for inventori   i don   t see that that   s go to come from the structur side of invest whatsoev  for reason that sever of the presid have alreadi indic   i think presid pool  presid pianalto  and perhap someon els rais the question of whether or not invest in anoth firm   s excess capac end up be a posit with respect to the economi as a whole   so while it   s possibl to argu that there is some upsid risk on the real side of the economi  i would say that it   s a fair tentat argument  i think there are some reason to be concern about the downsid risk to the real economi   one is that condit are not as accommod as one might think   in the context of inflat that has been come in lower and lower and an economi that has been get weaker and weaker  monetari polici in fact is not as accommod as some have been say   when we get to our polici discuss  i   m sure somebodi will point out that the littl dot on the bluebook chart that depict the locat of monetari polici has move firm back within the rang of the real equilibrium interest rate   it is no longer below the equilibrium rate  so monetari polici is not as s ul as we would like to believ  on the fiscal side  we   ve had some colloquy about that alreadi  and i would onli add that it   seem like that we   ll have fiscal s ulus base just on the natur of govern expenditur that are alreadi plan   it is possibl  though not certain  that there will be addit fiscal s ulus   so we should be care there  have indic the risk i see with respect to the real economi  they seem to me balanc at best or perhap tilt a littl to the downsid   with respect to the inflat pictur the risk seem almost all to the downsid   in the context of an economi with so much underutil capac  it is realli hard to imagin a case in which sudden we will have an outbreak of inflat that we have to worri about   it is unpalat but not imposs to imagin that we may have too much price stabil and will have to worri about that   i   d close by recogn that inde the market is expect veri littl of us in term of a polici action today  and we have to take that into account when we get to that part of the discuss   but i would say  if not us  then who   and if not now  then when    laughter
let me add two point to the discuss   the first is on fiscal polici  this is go to be a veri key week with respect to fiscal polici becaus the tax write committe of both the hous and the senat meet this week   it seem to mani that the momentum has shift to the hous  in part becaus the hous committe chairman has exhibit perhap the strongest thought leadership and mayb the most sagaci polit leadership as well   i must say that he   s also deal with the most friend and accommod budget restraint  the senat probabl will meet also and may make an effort to cram the presid   s dividend exclus propos into the legisl in some way within the limit of their budget restraint   it seem like that  instead of the presid   s propos with respect to dividend  they may come out with a cap on the tax rate on dividend and a drop in the tax rate on capit gain   mani in the congress will find that more palat than the dividend exclus  just in term of the abil to explain what they are do   that would also then clear the way for the acceler of the previous enact tax cut   i might note that last wednesday the chairman  in respons to question by the hous bank committe  made a real effort to tri to distinguish between tax cut that s ul capit spend and tax cut that s ul consumpt   but i would say that we don   t see ani of that discuss be reflect in the deliber on either side  in tri to read the polit tea leav  it seem as if peopl have a sens that the white hous would be will to accept a tax packag with ani number north of      billion   and if it could be north of      billion  that would be all the better   but we will know more a week from now with respect to tax polici than we know today  my other point relat to the bank industri  where interest there is littl chang from what i report at the last two meet   we saw throughout all of      a gradual declin in asset qualiti  but in      it has remain stabl   on the consum side  there has been no postwar bounc  in part becaus there was no war  declin of ani signific extent in the consum area   we are hear anecdot   from member of our feder advisori council at it meet last friday and from a number of other peopl   the first hint of plan for expans or indic that busi peopl think the  e might be right to expand   it seem to me like that this is anoth area where there   s a differ between the data we can measur and the anecdot inform we are pick up  which is ex part the number we can read
thank you  mr  chairman   relat to previous meet  there has been consider more discuss of inflat and disinfl at this meet   i   m gratifi about that becaus i think these consider should be central to our polici analysi at this point   let me just add a few point to the discuss  disentangl persist from temporari chang in the rate of inflat is difficult  and measur issu cloud the pictur further   nevertheless  the best guess is that under inflat has been declin recent   compar the year end in march      with the year end in march       the  book note that inflat as measur by the core cpi has fallen from     to     percent   in the past six month this measur has been bare abov     percent at an annual rate   inflat as measur by the chain version of core cpi has fallen from     percent last year to     percent this year   data for the past six month are not avail  inflat as measur by the core pce deflat has been stabl at     percent for the past two year  but the  book note that this stabil is larg a result of increas in nonmarket imput price   exclud nonmarket price  core pce inflat fell from     percent in the year end march      to     percent in the year end march       and it has averag     percent over the past six month   of cours  for a given nomin fund rate  disinfl amount to a de facto tighten of monetari polici  becaus monetari polici work with a lag  in principl we should be most concern about the forecast of futur inflat rather than past inflat   forecast inflat is t i  though it is worth point out that sever well known academ studi have found that the  book   s forecast of inflat are better than ani made in the privat sector   the staff es  that core pce inflat will be about     percent in       owe larg to the fact that even with growth of near   percent in the second half of this year and in all of       the economi would still have consider slack well into next year  of cours  as alway there are both upsid and downsid risk to the staff forecast  howev  our loss function with respect to the inflat forecast error should be asymmetr   a   percentag point undershoot of inflat from the forecast  which would bring us to the brink of outright deflat  would be much more cost than a   percentag point overshoot  undesir as the latter might be   in short  for the first  e in mani decad the risk to our inflat object are decid downward   given that the risk to employ also seem to be downward  there appear to be a prima faci case for eas polici   i tend to agre with that conclus  and bar an except strong near term turnaround in the economi  i hope that the committe will adopt a postur of lean toward eas  i would like to add an import caveat  howev   the chanc that we will hit the zero bound constraint at some point  though not larg  is certain not neglig   in respons to presid guynn   s earlier remark  by the way  i believ a zero bound constraint on polici is the major risk of a deflationari environ   one that could have real cost becaus it would inhibit our abil to stabil the economi   more general  as note by governor kohn and    deflat put a floor on the real interest rate and can therefor destabil and distort capit market   theoret the risk of the zero bound onli increas the urgenc of a preemptiv eas   howev  it also seem import that we have a plan for how we might proceed seamless from standard rate cut to more nonstandard oper should such oper becom necessari   for me  along the line suggest by presid hoenig  if there is an argument for delay further eas at this point  that is it   a delay would give the committe a chanc to think about how an eas action fit into a broader strategi that may involv   though we hope it will not   nonstandard polici oper   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for this meet i start out look at previous forecast  as presid   and governor   did   i note that we   ve had  for the past three year now  a forecast that the economi will get better in the second half of the year   we miss it the first  e in      becaus of a terrorist attack and the second  e in      becaus of corpor govern scandal   i don   t know if i   m op ist or pessimist about it happen a third  e  but i could hope that the new chairman of the public compani account oversight board might have some effect on the risk of that
in which direct    laughter
the brilliant new chairman
yes  the brilliant new chairman   i am concern  though  that we   re start out this year in a soft spot  unlik the last two year when we had stronger growth in the first half of the year   hour work are continu to declin in this soft period  employ is fall  and product in the manufactur sector in particular is show signific weak   the main impetus for the recess was the weak in busi fix invest  and the forecast for bfi has again been revis downward in the  book for this meet  i agre with some of the comment that have alreadi been made around the tabl that  while corpor are cautious  they haven   t been inact   we   ve seen signific improv in inventori control  advanc in product  and increas liquid as firm have move to longer term fund and as cash flow have risen becaus of improv profit margin   but as i look at this pictur  i   m still relat pessimist as to what is go to happen to spark busi confid again   so i tend to believ that the risk are bias toward weak  especi given that i accept the forecast that econom growth will be below potenti even beyond the      forecast horizon  what about the outlook on the inflat front   as sever peopl have alreadi remark  the  book assess that the probabl of deflat by the end of next year is    percent clear is a statement that catch one   s attent   further  i know that the staff has been do work on the confid interv for various measur of inflat and the measur bias  that work show all three major inflat measur at the top of the confid band of about   percent by the end of next year   this concern me   we don   t need to see deflat becaus disinfl   get the inflat rate down to   percent   is a signific enough issu  there has been a lot of talk that busi don   t have the confid to invest becaus of concern rais by govern issu   i think the lack of confid relat to the continu outlook for veri weak price power   busi manag tri to commit to the marketplac that their compani will show earn growth   they commit to that by expect some type of top line revenu growth   but we   re sit here expect econom growth over the forecast period to be below potenti  with inflat at   percent   that mean that if a corpor make a serious commit to growth  they have a veri small margin of error   when cash flow from top line growth provid a robust level of new incom revenu  compani are more abl to take the risk of invest in new busi line and new plant open   but with an outlook for continu sluggish econom growth and overal inflat at   percent or less  in effect we confront a disinfl risk world that at some point cumul slow growth go forward  therefor  i support the comment that presid santomero made about the import of avert a disinfl psycholog in the period ahead  so i   m concern that we have risk on both front right now   the risk of real growth below potenti for quit a long  e and also a risk of further disinfl that is consider stronger now than we would like   i don   t think i can identifi a bias or say that the risk are balanc or unbalanc   in my view we don   t have a phillip curv situat   i think we have two negat face us
thank you  mr  chairman   i didn   t deliber set out to be the last speaker today   i was just a littl slow get on norm   s list  one might liken the economi today to earli spring in michigan   one can see some scilla here  some spring beauti there  and trillium over there   ah  one say     spring is come     true  it is come  but there are still three inch of snow cover the yard    laughter   there are a number of bright spot in the recent data  and previous speaker have mention all of them  so i will pass over them in the interest of  e   bright spot asid  we should not forget that we need to see mani sign of spring befor we conclud that warm weather is here to stay  moreov  despit the bright spot  there are still some not so bright spot   industri product is down again  the workweek is down  the state and local fiscal situat look ever more dire  and foreign growth seem to get revis down everi  e we hear about it  the baselin in the  book forecast incorpor much of what is known about spend demand in the near term in the framework of a structur model that has a good forecast record   as the  book forecast will be the first to admit  they need to see a lot of good news to bring about the healthi growth impli by the  book forecast for the latter half of this year and all of next year   this growth is healthier than that in the blue chip forecast by    point this year and a full point next year   but even this reason op ist forecast leav continu output gap and an unemploy rate of     percent by the end of next year  inde  even if invest were to be stronger than anticip  the output gap would still persist becaus  the way the  book forecast is done nowaday  both aggreg demand and aggreg suppli are rais in respons to a posit invest shock  over the past sever year we have often had a situat where output look weak and inflat benign   we would typic argu that we could pursu one part of our mandat  output growth  without sacrif the other  stabl price   one arrow seem to be point down  and one was in neutral   today  howev  as mani of you said  that is not the case   now inflat has fallen to danger low level  and both arrow are point down   evid of the disinflationari danger is widespread   the  book probabl of deflat has risen to    percent  which is get pretti close to even odd by my count   the increas in the key market compon of core pce inflat has drop veri sharpli  with the index essenti flat for the last three month   it is possibl that this high frequenc read will not be sustain  and it   s also possibl   as the chairman  for one  suspect   that this measur is inordin influenc by declin in the valu of rental hous   but take out the influenc of rent  growth in the market compon is still drop  as is growth in the overal core pce   in term of my own desir  the core pce is now grow at a rate that is arguabl below the band that i person would be comfort with over the longer run   non oil commod price are veri cyclic  but they   ve been move down recent  and  of cours  oil price are way down   both measur of wage chang are grow at low rate in the latest data   all of these are current measur   with output gap forecast to persist  measur of inflat are like to drop further  as i said  both of the arrow reflect our mandat are point down  so  what to do   mani of us i think have alreadi made a strong case for eas polici right now   at the same  e  there are market uncertainti   there is some chanc that the war was a big factor in hold down spend and some possibl that this damp influenc has alreadi been lift   so there is some chanc that we will soon start to see better spend data  i  for one  would like to see much better spend data   we should never let uncertainti becom an excus for prolong inact   we might let it be ground for a slight further delay   here i would support tom hoenig in the view that a slight further delay would also give us more  e to organ our whole strategi in this new non inflationari atmospher   thank you
thank you veri much   we   ve complet our roundtabl  and we   ll turn to   reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that   is hand out now   the mark shift over the intermeet period in market particip    expect about monetari polici are evid in the top panel of your first exhibit  which plot the evolv probabl that the fund rate would be   point lower by this afternoon impli by the may feder fund futur contract  over the latter part of march and earli april  befor hostil with iraq were settl  investor talk about the possibl of an intermeet eas  make them relat confid that the fund rate would be below    percent by the end of today   the cessat of hostil and the relat ralli in the equiti and corpor debt market  along with the percept that the feder reserv was not prepar the market for eas  deflat that notion   as a consequ  market price are now consist with about a   in   chanc of action  about where that expect has been for the past two week   market particip still expect the committe to eas though and ul  by more than anticip at the march meet   as shown by the solid red line in the middl left panel  the current path of expect of the feder fund rate touch   percent by novemb and has shift about    basi point lower at a longer horizon   inde  the option impli probabl distribut of the fund rate this fall  the middl right panel  suggest that investor are place consider weight on a level well below   percent   evid  a string of weak econom releas   especi on product and employ   more than offset the lift to the econom outlook that presum attend the declin in uncertainti  the fall in oil price  and the run up in share price over the intermeet period   it is worth note that the declin in uncertainti about interest rate  the bottom panel  was pronounc all along the yield curv   the narrow of the width of the    percent confid band for the feder fund rate     day henc deriv from option on eurodollar  at the left  was parallel by those post by one  and ten year ahead forward rate on swap  at the right      the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to the transcript  appendix     a more favor backdrop of financi and commod market might be one of the factor inclin the committe to keep polici on hold at this meet  a subject treat in more detail in your next exhibit   the case for hold polici unchang would be support if the committe view  as note in the top panel  the staff forecast to be like and  over the period that could be reason thought to be influenc by action today  accept   under that forecast is the judgment that econom fundament will spark a relat quick pickup in the growth of aggreg demand over the balanc of the year even hold the fund rate at    percent   this can be seen by the blue bar in the middl left panel  which show the staff   s forecast that the growth of real gdp will step up from it sub   percent pace to a rate first closer to and then beyond that of potenti   while it will take some  e for this growth to eat into the prevail level of econom slack  especi given the lacklust perform thus far this quarter  monetari polici action taken today would most be felt   at least accord to the staff forecast   when the economi alreadi has gain a full head of steam   you may have reason to believ that econom acceler will be quicker  impli  as given by the second item in my list in the top panel  that econom slack would be work down sooner and disinfl would be less like than in the staff forecast   for exampl  while the extent of fiscal impetus in the current baselin forecast is a bit larger than in the previous one  the committe might believ that the polit compromis like to be struck will take part of all the propos current on the tabl so that the total end up signific larger than now envis   to give you a sens of the upsid risk  the  book includ an altern simul with both higher govern spend and lower tax   as shown by the red bar in the middl left panel  that would be suffici to boost the growth of real gdp   percentag point this quarter and hold growth at the baselin thereaft   even if you are not confid that fiscal s ulus will be forthcom   as gridlock is alway a possibl   you might want to wait for those prospect to come into sharper focus befor ad monetari polici eas into the mix   anoth reason the committe might not view the  e as right to eas   even if it were lean in that direct   is that it might be worri that financi market could react advers to such action  as note by the third item in my list   as shown in the middl right panel  market have been on a tear in the past nine week  with equiti price up    percent from the march    low and riskier corpor yield   percentag point to     percentag point lower   that ralli came even as expect of veri near term monetari polici eas  as i alreadi describ  were be roll back  investor might wonder how weak the committe consid the outlook to be that it was necessari to augment the alreadi appreci relax of financi condit sinc mid march   moreov  such an action would stand out all the more in comparison with your recent behavior   the bar in the bottom panel record the immedi surpris associ with committe decis over the past three year  measur as the actual target rate decid at each of the meet less the expect fund rate gotten from futur market the day befor   as can be seen  a surpris today on the order of    or    basi point  as would be the case if you eas    or    basi point  respect  would be an outlier   altern  you might see the need for eas  discuss in exhibit    as too compel to be counter effect by argument about  e and recept   as note in the first bullet point  in the  book outlook resourc remain underus throughout the forecast period  shown in the middl left panel by the unemploy rate  which stay at or abov   percent in this and the next four quarter   while a   or    point eas may not materi influenc the near term contour of that path  the project almost   percentag point spread of the unemploy rate over it natur rate at the begin of next year is more like to be within the ambit of your influenc   you may not be so sure that the economi will deliv even that perform  particular if you believ that chief execut still see capit stock as excess or you believ that the prospect for economi abroad are especi gloomi   a failur to get the forecast rebound in growth rais the possibl that household    support to the econom expans will final sag  set in motion advers dynam that may be difficult to stop by futur eas   market concern about the economi may be grow in that the impli probabl of the fund rate sink below   percent by the autumn  the middl right panel  has risen of late   the insur provid by a prompt eas may be attract when  as in the second bullet point  downsid risk to demand are more like or more cost   third  even if the committe believ in a forecast that  to a first approxim  meet it respons to fo  sustain econom growth over  e  it has anoth object as well   eas may be favor on the concern that  as in the third point  inflat may fall further from an alreadi low level and jeopard your commit to price stabil   the four quarter growth in the consum price index is     percent at the end of the staff forecast  which is shown by the horizont line in the bottom panel   while such an outcom or lower has occur about    percent of the  e in the postwar period  it has happen in onli two year sinc        true  for part of that  e the feder reserv had lost the anchor provid by price stabil  but you may have concern that some cost aris from be in a region so seldom travel   whatev the choic about the level of the feder fund rate  you will still have to grappl with the risk assess  as discuss in the last exhibit   the elev uncertainti of march that led the committe not to character the balanc of risk have abat   inde  those uncertainti have probabl diminish to the point where the same rational as in march could not plausibl be repeat to refrain from state the balanc of risk   still  judg from a recent survey of primari dealer  inform outsid are confus about the committe   s next step   as report in the top panel  about half the dealer expect an announc of balanc risk  while the rest are split between a tilt toward econom weak and no assess at all   i think that there are three possibl to consid   first  keep polici unchang or eas modest is unlik to chang materi the evid downsid risk to the path of inflat over the next sever quarter  and the relat distribut of the risk to sustain econom growth would remain debat   if that is the period over which the committe defin the    forese futur     then it could reassert the old languag tilt toward econom weak on the logic that the weight averag of those risk repres a downsid threat to it object  howev  march   s deferr of a risk statement might make may an appropri  e to drop the statement altogeth  the option list second   that might be particular attract if you have been troubl in the past by the mispercept fo  by the exist languag of trade off econom growth and inflat and the ambigu attach to the notion of the forese futur   in that case  this afternoon   s statement could relat that the balanc of risk assess is no longer seen as help in convey the committe   s view to the public   on the theori that you can   t beat someth with noth  i   ve list a third option   the committe could augment the risk assess portion of the statement   one possibl would be regular to includ two declar sentenc that describ the risk individu to the goal of price stabil and maximum sustain growth and a third that summar the balanc of those risk   while this may convey the committe   s view of the outlook more clear  it probabl would be greet with bewilder by some fed watcher at the onset   while your deferr in march open a window to chang the balanc of risk assess  you might want a bit more  e than avail today to deliber on a matter that will set a preced   howev  the problem that you face is that anyth you do today will be read as precedenti   that conclud my remark  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i have a question for     i appreci the dilemma that you just defin for us   what is your reaction to in a sens abandon the balanc of risk statement and expand the press releas statement to defin our posit     that have merit   how would the market react to that in your opinion
we have heard differ thing from differ market particip  the bond market associ met in this room just last week and devot one segment of the session to complain about the balanc of risk statement as not be help   they indic a prefer that we be a littl more descript in the statement   but i think that would result in some confus becaus right now the balanc of risk statement provid the comfort of give code word   the problem is that the code are a limit number of choic  and at least some member have complain that they have constrain your abil to convey what you realli think about the near term outlook   for exampl  in today   s case you might say that plausibl under the languag of the last three year  you   d have to state that the risk are tilt toward econom weak  wherea in fact most of the member have express concern about further disinfl from an alreadi low level   so i think expand the risk assess on balanc   i hate to use the word    balanc        laughter  on net would provid more inform to the market and more flexibl to you go forward   but flexibl come with a cost   you don   t have those code signal
the problem basic is that we have been deal with two issu   the gdp outlook and the inflat outlook   we have defin our balanc of risk in a manner that ani acceler in gdp growth would of necess increas the rate of inflat and vice versa   now it   s veri obvious that that econom model is flaw bad   as i will suggest as i expand on     s remark  i believ the way to handl this is to unbundl the two issu and deal with them separ and at the end weight them for a conclus   that strike me as a solut  though not necessarili the onli or even the best solut   at the end of the day it may leav member with the conclus that the simplest thing to do is to buri the whole idea and forget it   i don   t think that   s the right way to go becaus i do believ we can convey inform about our outlook   but the form that we   ve been use recent to do so essenti assum a predetermin relationship  which is that stronger econom growth creat inflat and vice versa   that   s base on a veri simpl model   but the real world  sn   t seem to want to conform to that model  and that is creat veri substanti explanatori difficulti for us
i agre with that  and i look forward to your comment
mr  chairman  i have just a comment   we   ve discuss the probabl of deflat quit a bit today  and a lot of attent was focus on the    percent probabl in the board staff   s exercis   in answer to toni   s comment about the  e period use in that simul  i would note that we did do the exercis begin in       which is a much more tractabl period  and the probabl we got was    percent as i indic   it strike me that both of those exercis suggest that the probabl of deflat is higher than i think we   re all comfort with
ani other comment   if not  let me move on use a somewhat differ approach to recent develop  and i hope that we will come out with some agreement on how to handl a number of issu  there is no question that the financi data have improv quit dramat veri much across the board   i have in mind not onli the narrow of credit spread and the dramat declin in the premium for credit deriv default swap but the veri signific drop in the level of interest rate on bbb and even higher yield oblig   the fall in those rate has reduc the cost of capit to a substanti part of the busi communiti  which for a consider period of  e had been block out of the lend market by rate that were close to prohibit for lower rate borrow   to be sure  a declin in the cost of capit   not necessarili mean that capit invest will pick up   such invest depend on the extent to which busi execut see real invest opportun   and in line with what jack guynn was mention  i suspect that peopl who are begin to say in privat that they feel a bit op ist nonetheless are not inclin to voic their convict in public becaus op  is not at this point the convent wisdom  the truth of the matter is that the data on nomin order and on backlog for nondefens capit good exclud aircraft are behav better than the rhetor   backlog have been rise for the last three month  not signific but they have turn up   we also are see upward revis to the data   it   s a small point  but the revis data on durabl good order for the month of march that were releas on friday were rais signific  the upward revis stem from data that came in higher than the es  of unavail data that had been plug into the initi report releas by the bureau of the census   in short  the number look better than the rhetor  that remind me of what mark twain onc said about wagner   s music      it   s not as bad as it sound      laughter  it is clear that we are get some fair substanti improv in the financi number   those for the stock market obvious and  inde  for all the credit market   while it is true that the market are be driven in part by improv profit figur  to date they have not been support by evid that econom activ is experienc acceler growth   the question one has to rais in this context relat to histori  which tell us that more often than not  perhap much more often than not  financi data of the type we have been look at in recent week point to an eventu strengthen in econom activ   that   not happen all the  e   there have been occas when for one reason or anoth it didn   t happen   but the recent financi indic suggest that the burden of proof is on those who argu that the economi will not pick up   those who make that argument must presum that there are no signific invest opportun   i find that most unlik   inde  the expans of the communic network that was go on prior to the huge declin in capit invest as risk premium rose in      was by ani measur that we know not complet  and the longer term outlook for such invest still look reason solid   we also know that consider advanc in product continu to be made  and that is tell us that the under profit opportun for new invest have to be there in one way or anoth  there   s a veri interest question as to whether the most recent anecdot report that we heard around the tabl  which do not indic ani new momentum in the economi sinc the end of the iraqi war  are in fact accur   the feder advisori council met with the board on friday  and i came away with the impress   in fact the fac member said this   that they sudden are get a sens of op  among their busi contact   the reason i find that import is that the bank communiti has a special window on what their custom are do well befor actual data on their activ becom avail   i was struck by these comment and by the fact that they came from all twelv feder reserv district  this morn don kohn got a note from our good friend  bill dunkelberg  at the nation feder of independ busi   they have just run their survey   the data are not yet publish  and i don   t know when they will be publish   and it show that their index of confid  which is the overal index they employ  rose   point in april   i believ that is a month record   it is a huge increas   the report also indic that the index rose to a level of     or not far from where it was in      and in earlier year   in other word  if anyth it   s close to normal base on longer term pattern  after be at it lowest level in march sinc        accord to the report  hire plan jump substanti   capit expenditur plan also were up  and plan to add to inventori remain strong   there are       firm in this sampl  those result don   t quit squar with those from the institut of suppli manag  but it is possibl in one sens to reconcil them   all of the survey of the institut of suppli manag are taken in the first half of the month  even though the institut wait two week to publish the data   so the nation feder result could be an indic that someth differ has been happen more recent   we don   t know yet   these survey are use  they   re all diffus index   they   re not hard data   but they are the first indic that someth may be chang  the data that we have been get on product and employ have been  just to state it as simpli as i know how  aw   we can ascrib the weak in the employ data in part to the fact that busi firm have display an extraordinari capabl in recent quarter to meet a tepid but still rise real demand for good and servic with ever lower employ  this is anoth way of say that the abil to increas product is there  but it can   t be the result of larg capit expenditur becaus we   re not get such capit invest   my hypothesi   and i frank don   t know whether it is true  but it would explain what is go on   relat to the fact that in the      to      period we had veri substanti capit expans   we had grow market and veri high perceiv rate of return on new product facil as distinct from invest made for cost cut reason   as a consequ  there was an inordin larg emphasi in the busi communiti on invest to expand facil   a result was that busi firm paid littl attent to the ineffici that invari aris as they are build new plant  ad new equip  and revis the structur of do busi   those ineffici build up over  e  but if the cost of those ineffici are relat modest compar with the rate of return on new facil  busi essenti forget the ineffici   what i think has happen is that  when the spend boom end in the year       there was a cumul level of ineffici sit there that were avail for exploit with a relat modest amount of addit invest   that exploit has gone on for sever quarter   the implic  of cours  is that the under structur product gain from      to      were in a sens actual greater than the publish number becaus there were negat associ with those gain that were not part of the actual evalu  this mean essenti that go back and clean up the barn so to speak is turn out to be a high profit activ   the first quarter earn number are noth short of spectacular in the sens that  after they were revis up veri late in the quarter  they surpris everybodi   now  i don   t know whether the gain are be sustain in the second quarter  they still seem to be hold up  but it   s too soon to be sure   we do know that there has been a tendenc for analyst to revis their forecast down repeat for a quarter as they go through the quarter   they are do that now but at a much slower pace than is typic  impli that the product spillov is still signific there  i don   t know what the short term behavior of the economi will turn out to be in term of the gdp number   i do know that  if we look at outsid forecast that are done in veri consider detail on the base of both work down from the macro data and build up from individu compani data  we find that jp morgan chase and salomon brother smith barney both have     percent rate of increas in gdp for the third quarter   so   goldman sach  which has  of cours  been on the bearish side of these forecast   i myself find it difficult to believ that such growth is in prospect becaus  if it is  that has to mean that by a few week from today growth of real gdp es  on a month basi has to move up appreci or els   percent growth cannot realist be achiev in the third quarter   that forecast at these three organ believ that it can be achiev i find somewhat startl   it may be that they are begin to pick up what the dunkelberg data are pick up  name evid that suggest to them that someth signific is happen that will boost gdp growth   to be sure  the goldman sach number tail off after the third quarter  but they   re still higher than the second quarter number that we are now look at  which are not all that good  in ani event  we did get a report this morn of a sharp increas in chain store sale   i don   t know how much of the increas may reflect a poor season adjust for ea   but it is a veri big increas   in fact  in the last four week the bank of tokyo mitsubishi season adjust week index on chain store sale went up    percent  and that rise is not at an annual rate   it   s the increas over the four week  the evid bear on the econom outlook is a mix bag at this stage   the difficulti in all of this is that a deflat process may be sneak up on us   it is not do so in a way that i anticip in that  no matter which set of price index one use  the rate of inflat has fallen fair dramat dure the last six month   incident  the issu i was rais with respect to the owner    equival rent was not that the other smaller compon of the index are not fall   inde  some are fall more  but i   m serious question whether in fact the owner    equival rent in the current environ of veri rapid chang homeownership is best proxi by the way the bls   it   this involv take a sampl of rent on rental properti that have the same physic characterist as singl famili home   i   m not argu about the data as such but in term of whether in fact we are look at true deflationari process   inde  rememb that the    percent probabl of deflat in the staff baselin forecast includ fall inflat as a consequ of improv product   the real issu that we have to get at when we   re look at the notion of deflat is not onli what price are do but also whi they are do it   an economi in which price are fall at  say  a   or    or    percent annual rate but where rise product is match the declin such that the nomin rate of return on capit is stabl or rise tell us that we do not have a destabil econom system   so price declin per se don   t tell us veri much without advert to the concurr rate of return on capit and whether in fact we have a stabl environ   inde  i would argu that a necessari condit for the type of deflationari problem experienc in the great depress is not onli a declin in product price but of necess a declin in asset price  if product price are declin but asset price are not  the likelihood i would submit is that individu compani may be have price problem but they   re not have product problem   the rate of return are there  and that   s the reason that asset price are high  i do think we have a concern here   in my view we cannot avoid the fact  as governor bernank point out  that we face an asymmetri   we know what to do with inflat when it rise   the committe has taken action to counter it mani  e and has succeed in do so mani  e   we haven   t confront the problem of potenti deflat in a veri long  e  and i find that possibl to be someth on which this committe must have an ever increas focus   we have to be care  howev  about how we think about this process and make sure that we   ve got it right and that we   re not mere look at the zero bound issu   this is a far larger issu that involv the mechan by which the economi function rather than just how price affect product as distinct from asset  my general view with regard to the polici implic is that we probabl would be wise to move the fund rate lower unless we see a fair substanti pickup in econom activ   i would suggest  howev  that it would be a mistak to eas polici today   the reason relat to the issu that sever of you have mention   i did tri  incident  dure my congression tes oni last wednesday to open up the possibl that we might eas today   i rais for the first  e the notion that fall inflat would be unwelcom  and i did emphas a coupl of  e dure the tes oni that we  the feder open market committe  do have further room to move lower   i think reaction to my remark did briefli lower somewhat the may feder fund rate futur  but the stock market then ralli and pull back down the probabl of an eas action  the reason i think we have to proceed cautious is that the recent strengthen of the stock market and financi market general  includ the narrow in yield spread  is a potenti fragil situat becaus it is not as yet be support by posit develop in the real economi   so if we were to come out today with an eas move that the market   not expect  the question would aris as to what we in the feder reserv know that those in the market do not   becaus we are in such an unsettl period  we have the capac of complet revers the nascent rise in financi market valu   if that rise continu  it will lift the economi with it   as a consequ  i think we need to be care   i subscrib to bill pool   s general edict about not tri to fool the market   it  sn   t serv our purpos   the ideal monetari polici is to have noth happen in the market everi  e we move becaus market particip have fulli discount our action   that creat the best general environ except for those rare occas when we want to chang the state of psycholog   that is what we did in veri earli       when we went out of our way to move rate sharpli lower at a  e the market did not expect us to do that   we did it becaus we want to alter general attitud  but at this point i think we   re far better off not to surpris the market   that   s larg becaus  even though a number of us may think that we know how the market will respond  thing happen that we don   t expect   i submit to you that we current are deal with a veri chanci situat  but we are reason sure that if we do what the market expect  then noth will happen   we do not know with ani degre of accuraci how the market is go to behav in the event that we do someth one way or the other   frank  i don   t know how the market will respond if we move the fund rate lower today   but as a comment in the wall street journal said today  if the fed were to do someth the market would respond wild   the report did not specifi in which direct    laughter   i suspect the reason is that he didn   t have a clue  and i can understand that  in ani event  i think we have a t i polici issu in front of us today   ordinarili  as you know  our procedur is for the member to express their view in the polici go around  vote  and then look at a draft press statement   i   d like to do someth differ today   we   ve draft a statement that tri to captur some of these issu   i   d like to circul it around the tabl and have it as a point of discuss as member comment on polici   i would appreci it if my colleagu would distribut the statement   vice chair
thank you  mr  chairman  i support the recommend of no chang in the fed fund rate  and i further support the reason behind it as evidenc by the statement you have distribut
thank you  mr  chairman   i also agre with your analysi that there are some straw in the wind that suggest it might be wise to wait   i ask two rhetor question at the end of my earlier statement   the obvious answer to    if not us  then who     is us   laughter   the more serious question of the two is     if not now  then when      i am support of what i think i heard you impli  which is that we have a two day meet come up in june dure which we can do lot of thing and we also will have seen much more data by then   so i   m interpret that
may i interrupt  i should have address this   if the data we   re see from the feder advisori council and the nation feder of independ busi prove to be a fals dawn  we will know it by the  e of the next meet   and if that should be the case  i think the burden of proof will be on those who think we should not move at that  e   the absenc of sign of an improv economi at that point would suggest potenti deterior that will requir us to respond   i think that   s what you were question
that   s the implic i took from your comment  so i   m glad you made that more explicit for the benefit of everybodi   as for the risk statement  a number of peopl serv with me on the committe that creat the word of the balanc of risk sentenc three and a half year ago  but i will take sole respons for it
it   s your    laughter
it   s mine   when you   re the father of someth that even at the age of three prove not to be as attract as you had hope  you have one of two choic   you can still embrac it becaus it   s your and wait for it to grow up and becom that love swan that you expect   or you can say     you know  you   re not as attract as we had hope  and mayb someon els want to adopt you       laughter   this record will be public in five year  and my children at that stage will be old enough to actual have an interest in what their father was say in this room   they will be teenag by then  and they will realli resent me  now  with respect to the creation of the balanc of risk languag  the then director of monetari affair and i got togeth and tri to work out the matrix of what might happen over the longer term horizon  when we did that  i will admit that i did not see that the u s  economi would be in a posit where we   d have extrem low  and possibl declin  inflat and also expand growth with a forecast of abov trend growth   so the languag that we use   and it was not his fault  it was mine   didn   t fulli pick up the type of situat we are in today   so i think what you have propos in the third paragraph of this draft statement will get us through this period quit nice   it disentangl the two element of our dual respons   it come back with a weight averag   i believ it   s as clear as can be  and i   m veri support of it  overal  i think this is a great statement   and in the context of have a meet come up in june  i   m veri support of your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   first  on inflat itself i would certain agre that  if asset price are not declin  there is less financi risk than if they were  howev  we should keep in mind   though i have to think more about this   that  if good price are declin  then the real cost of capit is rise and i think we still have the classic zero bound problem   so it is better if asset price are rise as oppos to declin  but i don   t believ that solv our problem with deflat   i do want to reflect on this more  but that   s my initi
that would be a veri interest seminar topic becaus there are various aspect to it
right   i want to agre   but there is a differ between a lower cost of capit where the market have lower it versus your point  ned  which is a low cost of capit becaus the issu is low versus what   i think you   re absolut right that rate of return depend on a number of factor and not just asset price   so i strong endors your point
my second point is that i definit don   t want to blunder about when market are fragil   i think we have to be veri care about this whole issu  but we should also recogn that market aren   t exogen either   market are influenc by what we say and do  so if for whatev reason there is not suffici expect that we would take a polici action today  that   s fine   but in my view we have to start build the case regard what we are about in the longer run   so i can go along with the kind of polici that you   re suggest  mr  chairman  but i wouldn   t go along with you forev on this  and inde i know you don   t want me or anybodi els to go along with you forev  pure on the statement   and virtual everybodi has comment on this today   i think we have to unbundl the risk in the way that this draft statement     i strong support that part of your recommend   i do have to be honest  though  and tell you that i have some qualm about the    taken togeth    sentenc becaus it   s akin to ad up the risk for pear and ad up the risk for appl and put them togeth   i   m uneasi about that  but i have no bright idea for what to do about it today   the propos word is as good as anyth i can think of today   but if i were place a bet  i would bet that the languag would need to be alter in three year when roger   s swan get even a littl more eloqu and beauti
if not in seven week
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start at a littl differ place than you did  but i   ll come back   when i came in this morn  i had been think about how to assess the potenti cost of lower rate when in retrospect that prove not to have been necessari or desir versus the cost of not lower rate when in retrospect we wish we had done so sooner   i must say that on that calculus i think the cost of delay are greater at this point   it seem to me that if we were to eas polici today and in retrospect that turn out not to have been necessari or desir  i   d be quit happi   that   s becaus we   d be deal with a situat in which the economi is stronger than expect and come along nice and that would be occur in an environ where the inflat environ is veri stabl   so i don   t think the cost of deal with that would be all that high  with regard to market expect  we have quit an unusu situat   i haven   t gone back and look at the data  but i think in our histori of recent year it is quit unusu to have a veri high probabl of a futur action built into the market but no action built in for the current meet   second  as the first page of graph in front of us show veri clear  as of the end of march or earli april the market had built in a high probabl of a chang in may but now has taken that out   so in term of market expect  we   re deal with an unusu circumst  i believ the market is go to interpret the languag    the committe believ that  taken togeth  the balanc of risk       is weight toward weak    as code  if you will  or a forecast that we are high like to cut rate at our next meet   the question will aris immedi as to whether the cut is like to be    or    basi point   that uncertainti will aris and will be discuss right away   so to some extent not act today but put in this languag will surpris the market in the same way that the market would be surpris by an action today   it   s not as if we total avoid that market surpris  i view this as a perfect satisfactori solut becaus  if the market has a high degre of confid that a chang in rate is come  in term of the effect of monetari polici it  sn   t realli matter veri much whether that chang come now or six week from now   the term structur is affect almost exact the same way except for the veri  veri short run matur  that six week interv can   t make ani differ for a ten year bond   so i think this is an accept way of make it clear that we are veri like to be eas polici unless we see a lot of evid that the economi is pick up steam
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend and the announc as draft larg for the reason that presid pool just state   i also would have been comfort if you had recommend a slight cut in rate and that had been possibl given the market situat   i agre  too  that the risk   reward tradeoff is tilt in such a way that i would rather be a littl too easi rather than a littl too tight  so i   d take my chanc on that side  but in that regard i think we do get a lot of benefit from this statement by break up the balanc of risk   i might note that i don   t think roger did quit as bad a job in construct the old balanc of risk statement as he aver in his statement   to me it didn   t quit have the tradeoff in it that you said it did   but the fact that you thought it did and that other were confus by it suggest that it is certain inadequ to the current situat   so i consid it veri help to unbundl the risk   i think highlight the downsid risk on inflat will be veri benefici by let the world know what we are worri about   it reinforc the last paragraph of your tes oni and put that issu on the tabl more forc   i think that will help to influenc expect and to give long term rate scope to move down if activ  sn   t pick up veri much and if inflat come in lower   and i believ that   s veri help  as to the ad up of appl and pear  i think that   s basic what we have to do here at the end of the day   we have to weigh these differ factor and add them up   by the way  i like the appl and pear better than the sausag that i use to hear we made around this tabl  fruit cup is better than sausag
i support this statement   i would say  perhap not unlik other  that if we had taken an action today  i would have been a littl squeamish   but certain i understand where the risk are and would have support an eas   i think unbundl the risk is a veri good idea   in my view  the second paragraph isn   t necessarili cast in stone but   give us some opportun to be more communic with the public as we move forward   so i   m veri support of this   one thing i would request is that we think about the agenda for the june meet sooner rather than later becaus in light of this statement and our discuss today that will be a real opportun for us to do some veri import plan and discuss
i think you   re give instruct to the gentleman to your right
as a request
your remark this morn and those of governor bie and other around the tabl echo the comment i   ve heard from member over the last coupl of week in other convers   so the chairman has agre that the special topic at the first day of the june meet should focus on altern polici regim in an environ of veri low short term rate   dino and i will organ the staff work on the strategi  tactic  and communic polici associ with that   that   crowd out a bit of the background materi that the board staff has prepar on communic polici more general   what i   ll do is circul that materi in a coupl of week  and i   ll ask for guidanc when you receiv it on whether you   d prefer to tackl the communic polici at the next two day meet in januari or if you   d like to deal with it piecem at meet befor then
mr  chairman  i would like to start off with where i was befor i saw this draft statement and then react to the statement   at the risk of some repetit  to me the key polici issu this morn is whether we want to act today to preempt a buildup of disinflationari momentum or whether we want to wait a littl while to see if the economi strengthen and that risk diminish   as i said earlier  it   s an agon close call   it was for me befor i saw the statement  and it still is   but on balanc the recent improv in at least some of the data   and you ad a few more in your earlier comment   had convinc me that stay where we are was the best way to go   so i favor leav the rate where it was  reintroduc a bias  and make it a neutral bias   my prefer for a neutral bias was base in part on my view that introduc a downward bias at this point could undercut the renew op  we   re hope for  for which i think there is still some basi   i don   t want to frighten the market and the public into think that the deflat problem  even though it may be more immedi  is greater than it actual is   in this statement we   ve unbundl the risk in one place but rebundl them in the final sentenc of the third paragraph   in a sens this statement still suggest that we have a downward bias  that   s the bottom line   i   m not sure i   m comfort with that for the reason i just state  i was go to suggest someth slight differ   let me just throw it on the tabl briefli   clear  we do need to recogn the disinfl risk one way or anoth becaus it   s veri real   i was go to suggest that one way to do it would be to reiter in this statement the concern that you express   i thought veri effect   in your tes oni last week   but in addit to that i would state clear in the announc that core inflat is now at the lower end of the rang that we are will to toler on ani sustain basi   i recogn that this would be a departur from what we   ve done befor and a differ kind of departur than we did last  e   but that is in fact what we   re talk about now  and i think it could serv us well in tri to deal with what is a veri difficult polici choic today   a statement like that wouldn   t pre commit us  but it   s hard to imagin circumst in which we would want the flexibl to allow a sustain inflat below   percent   so that   s anoth way of go   i don   t know whether i   ve made it clear or not
it is  inde  anoth way   but if we start to do that type of statement  we have to be veri care to make sure that we have the actual capac to implement the goal   too mani  e peopl have said we will not allow x to go below y or we will not allow some specif thing to happen   that   s veri forc if one has a lot of troop to invad the other guy if he is oppos   but we don   t have the tool to guarante certain thing   and if we put out a guarante and fail to follow through  the effect could be realli devast   my bottom line here is that this approach is not someth we can do today   i think your propos revis requir committe discuss in a far broader context
i would just respond  if i may   i know we can   t guarante in ani short period of  e that we can put a floor on the inflat rate   but i would hope that over ani reason period of  e we could do that with monetari polici
actual  the bank of japan thought it could
just on this debat   al  i think the problem is that word the statement the way you suggest actual move us quit a distanc toward inflat target  mani peopl around the tabl have differ view regard the desir of inflat target   i know where you are   i know where ben is and where mani other are   we should not get to the issu of inflat target at      p m  at the end of a long meet   i think it is a quit reason issu to discuss in some detail next  e   but we can   t do it quick at this point
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start first by comment on the statement  which i like a lot   it may not be perfect  but i consid it a distinct improv so i think we should go with it   as for polici  on balanc i agre with you that we   re probabl better off not act today   not onli are financi market fragil  but they can also be fickl   we don   t want to do anyth that will set them off unnecessarili   i think bill   s and don   s argument is right that this statement convey much the same sen ent as a fund rate cut   but it   s still differ from take an eas action becaus peopl in the market know that we   re go to be read the incom inform on the economi  as are they   so i feel more comfort defer ani action until june depend on the natur of the incom inform
so much on the tabl here   first  with regard to the polici action  obvious i   m not a vote member  but if i were  i could have vote for an eas in polici  and i could have done it on the basi of the concern you express at the end of your tes oni last week   that is  we may need a more s ul stanc of monetari polici in the situat of lower than expect inflat becaus polici is less  rather than more  accommod than we had plan   so  in order to keep the status quo  we might need to eas a bit to take real interest rate to a posit that is as accommod as polici was  let   s say  immedi after our last move   i thought that might be a way to explain an eas action   to say that it was more or less an attempt to keep the status quo   that would not affect the market so direct  i certain can go along with your propos and i understand what your concern are   on the matter of straw in the wind  the economi is go to grow  so sooner or later we   re go to see these littl straw   the question is  when are they go to cumul to be enough to make a differ in term of an economi that is grow suffici to absorb all the excess capac that is out there   to me the problem is not that inflat is fall so much as that we have an output gap   the declin rate of inflat is relat to that output gap  and i think we ought to be concern about that gap   our best guess at forecast suggest that the gap will remain for more than the next few quarter that are mention in the first sentenc of the third paragraph of the statement   so  i   m a littl uncomfort with this approach  but i   m will to go along with it  i total agre with you that the balanc of risk statement has gotten us into the pickl of too tight coupl inflat and growth or disinfl and no growth   so i like the idea of split them apart   i   m a littl troubl by the word    upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth      what do we mean by the term    sustain growth    in the context of that sentenc   i usual think of sustain growth as noninflationari growth  but i don   t know what upsid and downsid risk mean in the context of noninflationari growth  inflat is go down by all of our best guess   do we just mean growth at potenti   i don   t understand what we mean   you probabl do
this is not the first  e that particular phrase has been argu   the issu basic is this  when we talk about risk to someth we have to say what that someth is   in other word  just to say the risk are balanc or unbalanc is fine if one know the base against which the evalu is be made
the point here is that the term    sustain growth    is a proxi for an expand economi whose growth is intern sustain  mean it   not have in it the seed of it own demis   now  one can argu that that is maximum sustain growth  and one can argu that it won   t matter   the differ here is hard discern   whether we   re talk about growth of   percent     percent  or     percent   it   s somewher in that area  but we shouldn   t be put down a number
i   m not suggest that we put a number down   i   m just wonder what we mean by it  speaker      it mean what is accept
that   s what we mean
as the chairman has indic   i m sorri to talk out of turn without be call on
you   re call on
this concept realli is veri much about a growth rate that is close to potenti   now  potenti growth is in a rang that we   ve never been public about  and i   m not sure we all agre that it   s current somewher between   and     percent
i believ the staff still consid potenti to be in that rang  and i think all of us general understand that that   s what we mean here   the reason we   ve chosen this languag is that we   ve been use these word for a long  long  e   they go back to the era of the humphrey hawkin legisl   in my view  it   s better for us to stick with those word rather than to say a growth rate about equal to potenti becaus that clear beg the question of what we think the rate of potenti is   the word    sustain     at least to my ear  has an implic of a pace of econom growth that  as the chairman suggest    not contain the seed of it own destruct   it mean growth that is not too slow  which is what we have now  nor so far abov potenti that we risk a breakout of inflat   admit it   s shorthand   but i don   t think it   s that my i that we need to tie ourselv in knot about it today   to make the point again  this littl swan that we tri to hatch a few year ago may need to have some plastic surgeri   but i   m not sure that today is the day we ought to look close at this becaus what we mean by sustain growth is not the issu that has trip us up with respect to this whole concept   at least i would argu that   you may disagre
well  if we   re talk about growth that is close to potenti and  sn   t contain the seed of it own destruct   i e   it   s not inflationari and is not strain resourc   my own view is that there are more downsid risk to that forecast in the near futur than upsid risk   one can debat that  i suppos   there is certain the possibl of a fall in inflat  and i like the delink of growth and inflat in this statement  so i guess i can live with it  with regard to the june agenda  i would hope that we don   t talk just about strategi to deal with the zero bound issu   we had an extend discuss of that at a meet not too long ago  so there is consider materi avail to us on that issu  and all of us have thought a lot about the zero bound   we do need strategi  i agre  and we need to think about them in the environ in which we might actual employ them   but in my view it also would be worthwhil to explain the concept that peopl have rais here   i think presid  n was the first to say a coupl of meet ago that all price declin are not necessarili bad   what   that mean   what is the distinct between disinfl and deflat   what   it realli mean to oper in such a low interest rate environ separ from whether we buy secur out on the yield curv or whatev   are there other factor that we haven   t given a lot of thought to that are go to affect us or the economi in such an environ   mayb that   s too much
i concur with your decis and support it   i like the idea of split up the two sentenc   if i were a wordsmith  i   d argu that the    taken togeth    sentenc  sn   t need to be there   let the market put it togeth and just indic what we believ the condit are that relat to sustain growth and inflat   if we put the two togeth  in some sens we are tri to summar our view of the risk  and we   re give code word to the market   so my prefer is to elimin that sentenc  but i can go either way
i can support the statement   i like the fact that we   ve broken out the two risk explicit in this   i could have vote for a reduct in the fund rate target today becaus i   m look at how much the market has move the fed fund futur rate sinc our last meet   the market is price in a rate cut  it   s just a matter of when   so have been on the other side for a while  i   m inclin to believ that the market would not have been all that upset by an eas action today   but i will go along with the recommend that we wait to see how futur inform develop   i look forward to the discuss at the next meet   as i indic earlier  i   d like to see us think through what our strategi should be and what signal we want to send as we move into this lower inflat world that we haven   t experienc for a long  e   i think it will help us to further improv our communic if we have consid care our long term plan to get through this low inflat period   then we can do anoth plastic surgeri on this swan
base onli on my read of the  book and the option present in the bluebook  i would have support an eas today   i am persuad  howev  by the  e question to support your recommend   i would just like to add one point about execut sen ent  build on comment made by the chairman  vice chairman    and governor bie   the market still reward execut who outperform their peer   if we look back at the         environ  when a signific amount of downsiz was go on  onc that downsiz had been complet there were onli two option avail to achiev growth   to expand by merger or to expand by addit invest   it seem to me that this  e we have seen a great deal of improv in the effici and  e of invest decis  to say noth of the decis themselv in term of what invest to make   but the margin of error in the  e is even tighter than it was in           so come back to vice chairman     s comment about the psycholog  onc the psycholog seem right for busi to make new invest  i think the pickup in invest could be quit rapid   in my view to do anyth at this point to disturb that would be wrong  with respect to the statement  eighteen month ago when i first join the committe i thought it would be pretti easi to improv the statement that we were make   it didn   t take me long to realiz that everi chang we made was pars care  so by my second meet i was veri conscious of the desir of not chang ani more word than necessari   howev  as in the busi world  there are window of opportun   have not opin a risk assess at the last meet give us an opportun this  e to make some chang  and these chang seem to me to be appropri   so i support not onli the statement but also the manner in which we   ve alter the statement
i can support your recommend  mr  chairman   i like the statement and the decoupl of the refer to inflat and growth   i would note that there are some potenti and logic issu regard the statement that will probabl emerg as we get more experienc with it   for exampl  if the two risk are in opposit direct but one is sever and one is mild  would that be a balanc risk or would it be       laughter   exact   at some point we may have to deal with this   weight the two object  for exampl   so i would just point out that we may have to decapit the swan at some point    laughter
that   s call orang and sausag
we could alway vote on our loss function
peopl have suggest that  governor
mr  chairman  i think a good case could be made for a further eas of polici today   the most like scenario for the economi over the next year or so leav signific excess capac in place   with low inflat and the economi in a weaken state  i believ that er on the side of eas most like would entail veri littl cost wherea er on the side of inact could be signific more cost   the cost of inact could be especi larg becaus we are within rang of deflat and the zero bound   final  i believ that be preemptiv has serv us well in the past   quit frank  if my recollect is correct  at  e our act in a preemptiv manner has involv surpris the market  and i don   t think we   ve suffer as a result of that  i also would say that the third paragraph is help to me   let me make a few comment  i never thought when we talk about the upsid and downsid risk that it was in term of comment on sustain growth   it alway meant to me the risk to our forecast of growth   that we saw either upsid or downsid risk to our project of growth  not to sustain growth  which i think is a veri differ concept   also the last two sentenc help me a bit becaus they do point out clear the issu that i think we ought to be focus on  particular if we   re still interest in act in a preemptiv way   thank you
mr  chairman  i think the decis on polici today is a close call   i could have easili support an eas today   but as i said in my earlier remark  i think the fair dramat improv in the financi sector offer us enough promis that it   s worthwhil to wait and see for just a bit longer   as for the bias statement  i   ve been a long  e skeptic of the benefit of have a bias statement   in that regard  i think roger has been veri generous in accept sole patern   but sinc he agre it   s not the prettiest babi he   s ever seen  it seem to me that we   re miss a veri good opportun  as you put it  to buri the whole concept and forget it   i would take advantag of that opportun  but fail that i think elimin the    taken togeth    sentenc would be an improv at this point
i am support of the polici recommend  and i support the unbundl of the two risk   i   m also pleas that the statement acknowledg our concern about deflat by indic that a substanti fall in inflat would be unwelcom   howev  i share some of the view express by other about the    taken togeth    sentenc  which rebundl the risk   i am concern that it will caus the market to focus just on the fact that we   ve chang our balanc of risk toward weak   my prefer is not to have that sentenc in the statement   howev  i can support the statement as it   s written   and i  too  look forward to the develop of a communic method that we all feel comfort call a swan
mr  chairman  i support your recommend to make no polici chang today   i actual came in think   and i said this to somebodi dure the break   that the worst of all world would be to take no action today and to go back to a balanc of risk statement of the kind we end up with here   i think it was al broaddus and mayb don kohn who made a point that was quit vivid in my mind   that we need to convey some posit sens about the outlook  to throw a bit of cold water on the way this statement is structur i  like sever other   i   m still think about this as i speak   believ it might be better to strike that last sentenc where we blend the two risk   i know we can   t abandon the statement without prepar the public for it   i   m not smart enough and don   t have enough  e to think about whether or not we can simpli drop that sentenc   but i   m afraid it   undo some of what we   re tri to do today  and that bother me a good deal
mr  chairman  could i just associ myself with the prefer for elimin that sentenc
is there a general willing or desir to do that
i don   t share that view becaus  if we take out that sentenc  we in effect divorc ourselv from the previous form of the statement befor we have an opportun to discuss it adequ at our next meet
yes  i think it would be a mistak to pull it out
as do i
but if it   s the consensus      presid
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i definit agre with the polici recommend not to make a chang today   that   s in essenc what i said in my statement  name that we should wait   on the balanc of risk issu  i do a mea culpa here   i was on the committe  roger
i certain was  along with bob parri and bill
but it   s your babi    laughter
i think the languag is obsolet now   there   s no question that it need to be chang   we need to elimin the word on the risk   i would have prefer to do the surgeri on the swan   or whatev the analog is   outsid of this group   i   d suggest that anoth subcommitte be appoint to do that and to come back to the committe with a recommend   for mani of the reason that peopl have mention around the tabl  i think there will be other iter of this and we are set some preced here  and i think it   s someth we should consid veri care befor chang  i actual would propos anoth option   i don   t feel strong enough to dissent on the statement  but i want to suggest anoth option becaus i do have concern about this statement  my concern tie in with some of the comment made by jack guynn and other   first  i think this statement will surpris the market and will increas the market expect of a cut in rate  in my view  it come close to risk the effect on market sen ent that we wish to avoid here  second  i think it elev the concern about disinfl signific   so my prefer would be   and to my mind this option would have the least risk of influenc the market   to go back to our usual format and to say that the risk are balanc   howev  i would add the sentenc that you put in regard the unwelcom risk of disinfl   i   d put what you said in your tes oni in the statement itself to show that we are concern about it   but i still would prefer to have the risk balanc   as i said  i don   t feel strong enough to dissent on it  but that would be my prefer
it   s veri difficult to make that judgment   basic  if our sole purpos were to do exact what the market expect  what we find is that one half of the primari dealer who respond to a recent survey expect the fomc to adopt a neutral statement   the other half were about even divid between expect an assess tilt toward weak and expect a continu deferr of ani assess   so  not all the view were the same   i think we   re run out of peopl who have not comment
is a postscript allow  mr  chairman   not to rebut  but i just want to make a point that there seem to be enough uneasi about this hybrid statement that i   m uncomfort with     s notion that we might have to wait until next januari to talk about this   i wonder if we can   t find some way to get back to a fundament discuss of the word of our press statement becaus i suspect the issu we   re struggl with will be with us for a while   we   re go to have this problem meet after meet if we don   t tackl it in june or at least fair quick   so i would lobbi for quick attent to it
mr  chairman  i agre with that   and i would like to associ myself with presid     s thought about appoint a subcommitte rather than wait to get staff memo and so forth in januari   put a group togeth sooner rather than later  and let   s get to it
that seem reason   would you read the appropri statement on which we will vote
the vote will be just on the feder fund rate
the word is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent
call the roll  pleas
chairman  span vice chairman     governor bernank   governor bie presid broaddus     governor     governor     presid guynn governor kohn     presid     governor olson presid parri   yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
