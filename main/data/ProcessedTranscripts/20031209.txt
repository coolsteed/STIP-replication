thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the packag that was circul a short  e ago   the intermeet period was character by general stronger data both in the unit state and abroad but with a diverg

shown in the graph at the bottom of page     while equiti and fix incom market have perform well this year  the dollar has continu it steadi depreci   the chart at the top of page   show the valu of

the dollar has continu to depreci despit all the posit data of the last     month   the dollar is at it weakest point against the euro sinc the euro   s incept   at about        as we speak   the british pound recent hit an eleven year high versus the dollar  and other float currenc have also hit multiyear high   part of the reason ascrib to the dollar   s fall relat to reduc long term privat

approv domest oper
the domest credit market have been rather tranquil despit what is presum to be a signific shift in the propens of foreign holder to purchas u s  asset   i assum that impli either that market saw rate go down and have been support of that or that the sensit of market interest rate to the substitut of offici for privat purchas is realli quit small   if the latter is the case  the notion that the offici purchas had to be there to fill in the gap is in a sens realli miss the point   which of these two explan  or a third if you have one  would seem most credibl in this context
i   m not sure that i have a third   the way i would tend to look at it is that  to some degre  offici hold have had to fill in the gap to the extent that offici elsewher have made a polici choic not to let their currenc appreci   now  exact how that relat to the substitut of domest asset
that   s the crucial question
yes  and that   s the unknown   i don   t have a way of quantifi that   i agre with you that it is the crucial question  but all we can see is the end result   exact how we got there is the more difficult question  and i   m not sure i can give you an answer that would be robust and would make sens in a full scale econometr model
further question for dino
may i ask one
we had a brief discuss ye day at our board meet about the equiti risk premium   it seem to be relat wide  even somewhat wider than histor normal   it   s not on your chart  but you mention the equiti market   do you have a point of view about whi it is that the equiti risk premium seem relat high now and how it might evolv go forward base on your experi with the market and from peopl you talk to in new york
i think the answer is    no      i don   t have a view go forward   certain  there   s a lot of discuss in the market   if one look at what is go on in the junk bond market  for exampl   that low interest rate and the percept of abund liquid have help to support risk asset be they high yield bond or equiti   i don   t know whether or not that   s true  but that certain is a percept   the flip side of that coin is that  if monetari condit were to chang  some of those market would be at risk
i would point out  governor    that financi economist refer to observ equiti premium histor in the neighborhood of     to     basi point as the equiti risk premium puzzl   the fact that it   s now a littl high in the rang that has prevail over the last decad  sn   t put it well out of the rang of the last centuri or so   economist have a hard  e understand the price of equiti import becaus it depend on risk avers and expect   so i   m not sure that i   d feel comfort say that what we   re observ now is particular at varianc with the histor norm
okay  thank you
on page   of your chart you juxtapos the declin dollar with the posit interest rate differenti with our major trade partner   the obvious question is whi hasn   t there been a sharp declin in the dollar follow by an expect appreci of the dollar given the interest rate pariti condit   how is hold u s  secur at a lower interest rate consist with the expect of an ongo depreci of the dollar
well  that   s an excel question   the way i tend to look at it is that we have a current account deficit and that deficit has to be financ somehow   the cost of financ that deficit can rise or fall at ani given point in  e   one way that the cost of financ can rise is that we have to offer higher rate to attract fund and interest rate here go up   anoth way is that the dollar goe down   that is  a foreign get more u s  asset for the same amount of local currenc asset   so i think the exact mechan of that are somewhat difficult to pinpoint   but that   s at least a simpl model of how i would look at this   there are a certain number of investor who are will to buy dollar at a lower exchang rate with the expect that the dollar will appreci at some point   now  that   s a question of  e horizon  and differ investor will have differ  e horizon
it   s a puzzl
it   s a puzzl absolut
a fair signific amount of intern hold are tie to the dollar   i   m now talk about china in it current develop stage   do you have ani evid that that creat a more volatil exchang rate adjust process for float rate against the dollar   theoret  if    percent of the world   s currenc were tie to the dollar and   percent were not  that   percent obvious would be move around rather rapid
if i may   i would note that the mechan by which the    percent are tie to the dollar is in some sens the willing on the part of the holder of those currenc to provid the financ   so the job left for the other   percent to do would be consider smaller than in anoth set of circumst
i think that is certain a good point   nonetheless it   s hard to believ that you wouldn   t get signific volatil   if you don   t like   percent  tri   percent  and i   m sure you   d get a lot of volatil
right  but as i said  the financ need would be so much smaller
i think that   s a good point
okay   ani other question
presum part of the answer there is that the capit flow of privat investor have declin substanti   a lot more of the capit flow are offici than was the case last year or the year befor  and offici capit flow are not motiv by the same rate of return consider that privat capit flow are   i have a question about the japanes hold of u s  dollar asset   how much of that is held in the central bank   what happen when the valu of the dollar is measur in yen   the bank of japan has incur a substanti loss on those asset   what happen as the bank of japan   s capit posit deterior   is there a possibl that the bank of japan on paper could show no capit   they   re also at risk becaus they hold a lot of govern bond that are subject to declin in price if the japanes economi realli start to move
i have a question for you   suppos their capit is negat     it matter
well  i think there are two question   one question is whether it matter to the economist  the other is whether it matter to the market   i think i know the answer for the economist   i   m not sure i know the answer for the market  and that   s whi i ask the person who know
as i   m sure you know  the feder reserv has continu given away it surplus for polit reason if for no other reason
we have this issu potenti as well   our issu is complic a bit   or differ from the issu in japan   becaus we have member bank that are sharehold and i think that under the law the member bank capit is actual at risk under the feder reserv act   i   m ask the question particular for japan  but it   appli to us  too
i don   t have the specif number  but i believ about    percent of japan   s overal reserv are held at the central bank
of dollar reserv
of their overal reserv
the rest is in the ministri of financ
the rest is in the ministri of financ   all of the intervent relat activ is by the ministri of financ   the bigger risk to the bank of japan   s balanc sheet is probabl their hold of govern secur at interest rate of zero and credit risk base on borrow from the bank by some lower rate entiti   recent you may have seen some press refer to a loss that the bank of japan report
well  there was an articl in the financi  e   that articl also point out someth that i thought was quit interest   it said that the bank of japan is move away from valu it balanc sheet on a current market valu basi and toward valu it on an amort origin cost basi   that  of cours  would protect the appear of the balanc sheet  though not the realiti  should there be a larg depreci in the valu of their govern bond hold
exact what the market would do with ani particular situat is hard to predict   but in case where some other central bank have had low or even negat capit posit there hasn   t been ani materi effect that i can think of   mexico  for exampl  had this problem recent when it capit account was deplet   the market didn   t seem to be concern by that   that situat has revers  and now they are back to a more normal capit postur  but i don   t know that the market would react veri much if the bank of japan report the deplet of it capit
further question for dino   would somebodi like to move the ratif of the domest polici action
i   ll move ratif
without object   thank you veri much   let   s move on to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   as i sat down to deliv my brief at the last fomc meet  i was feel pretti good   after all  the sizabl acceler in aggreg output in the second half that we had been project for some  e seem to be materi   even the more controversi aspect of our forecast   a pickup in capit spend and a turnaround in the labor market   were receiv some support from the incom data   to be sure  it was earli and consider risk remain  but i thought the case would be easier to make than it had been in month past   inde  i figur that by    o   clock i   d be relax with a doughnut  listen to   execut the more difficult assign of lay out a   by   by   rubik   s cube of polici object  option  and risk assess   laughter   so  needless to say  i was not prepar for the full extent of the resist that our forecast met at the last meet   in contrast to the situat in june  when our project of a   percent annual rate increas in real gdp in second half of this year was wide view as too op ist  there was consider less consensus at the last meet about the natur of our error   some of you argu that the economi would not strengthen as much as we were project and certain not to the point of erod the margin of slack in labor market as quick as we were anticip   in contrast  other of you appear to be skeptic that we could hold the fund rate so low for so long without generat a larger boom in output growth  greater inflationari pressur  or both   for two reason  i thought i would address your critiqu head on this morn  the first reason is that  from  e to  e  it is use to remind the committe that i did graduat summa cum laud from the        school of charm       laughter  second  the issu that you rais at the last meet were serious  central to your polici deliber  and one that we have continu to struggl with over the past six week   so whi do we believ that the economi will be strong enough to put a sizabl dent in the slack that has develop in labor market over the past few year   we start from the premis that monetari and fiscal polici will continu to provid a substanti dose of s ulus to aggreg demand in come quarter   real interest rate are low  and risk spread have come in   make the cost of capit favor to busi and household   the stock market has increas mark sinc march and is expect to rise still further over the project interv   those increas should encourag busi invest and help to repair household balanc sheet  meanwhil  the exchang valu of the dollar has fallen notic and is expect to edg down further  buoy the competit posit of u s  produc on world market   the improv in financi condit has no doubt been a key factor support the recent upturn in capit outlay   real spend on equip and softwar seem like to post an increas at an annual rate of about    percent in the second half of this year  with spend on both high tech and more tradit capit equip contribut to the upsw   from the vantag point of the second half  our project increas in real e s spend of    percent next year  sn   t look to us like too much of a stretch   after all  the cost of capit is project to remain veri low  and given the usual lag  the recent sharp acceler of busi output  sale  and cash flow should provid consider impetus to invest spend well into next year   moreov  the impend expir of the partial expens provis should provid an addit fillip to spend in        the household sector also has been receiv a lift from expansionari fiscal polici   consum outlay soar this summer  as dispos incom jump in respons to lower person incom tax   spend hit a bit of a pothol this autumn  but we believ that it will pick back up in come month   the figur on motor vehicl sale in novemb provid some encourag to that view  though broader report on recent retail sale have been mix   household will receiv anoth larg slug of dispos incom in      from this year   s tax legisl   lower tax along with a pickup in hire are expect to boost real dispos incom by   percent in       and real pce is project to increas about     percent   monetari and fiscal polici are not the onli sourc of upward impetus to output  inventori dynam should also be lift product in come month   inde over the next four quarter  a gradual strengthen of inventori invest is expect to add near   percentag point to the growth of real gdp   even that trajectori for stockbuild is suffici onli to flatten out the inventori sale ratio by the middl of next year at a level notic below our es  of the long run target   the recent data suggest that manufactur are boost product enough both to stem the inventori liquid that has occur for most of the year and to respond to the improv in their order book   after fall earlier this year  manufactur ip was up     percent at an annual rate in the third quarter   and given the data in hand  factori output is like to increas near   percent in novemb and more than   percent at an annual rate for the fourth quarter as a whole   so even the lag manufactur sector is show reason widespread sign of life   will this fa  pace of overal spend and product prove to be a temporari blip   that possibl still can   t be rule out   as i note at the last meet  es  the short run consequ of the tax cut involv more in the way of educ guesswork than hard scienc   the recent soft in consum spend could give one paus   on the other hand  the widen scope of the econom improv that we are wit  includ increas capit spend  an end to inventori liquid  an upturn in hire  and rise factori output  suggest that the forc at work are broader than just incom tax cut   of cours  even if we are rough correct about the cours of spend over the next few quarter  our project declin in the unemploy rate to    percent by the end of next year could be wide of the mark   last friday   s report on the novemb labor market provid mix evid on our progress   privat payrol rose        in novemb and have been increas about        per month  on averag  over the past three month   that   s a bit less than we had incorpor in the decemb  book   howev  the workweek increas again last month  and aggreg hour work actual came in a littl abov our expect   moreov  the unemploy rate declin anoth tenth  to     percent   our project assum that someth akin to a cyclic normal recoveri in employ begin by midyear   becaus we are assum that the particip rate will recov somewhat  after have fallen so much over the past few year  the    percentag point declin in the unemploy rate that we are project is actual a bit slower than the cyclic norm   of cours  that  sn   t mean that it couldn   t be slower still   the  e and magnitud of the improv in the labor market  in addit to depend on the strength of aggreg demand  is a function of the abil of firm to continu to extract greater effici from their oper  as an empir matter  we lack ani precis gaug here  and we can   t rule out that we have been too pessimist about the trajectori of structur product   we explor that possibl in an altern simul in the  book   the consequ of such an outcom are both a weaker labor market and much lower price inflat than in our baselin project   although the recent data have certain been encourag  the step up in the pace of the expans is still relat recent  and some combin of weaker aggreg demand and stronger aggreg suppli could result in an economi that is slower to absorb the exist slack in resourc util and produc even lower inflat than we are project   howev  as some of you have note  there are sizabl risk on the other side of our project as well   most notabl  hold the real feder fund rate close to zero for anoth year and then onli move it up gradual in      could set off a substanti boom in activ  higher inflat  or both   with real rate so low  whi aren   t we project a stronger expans over the next two year   one perhap that resembl a more normal cyclic recoveri   there are sever reason   for one  some of the usual contributor to the upsurg in activ in the earli stage of recoveri are not expect to play their typic role   in particular  outlay on hous and consum durabl have alreadi increas steepli over the past coupl of year  and while we expect low interest rate to help maintain that spend  we project outlay in these area to deceler over the next two year   meanwhil  some other sector have been and are like to remain lacklust over the next year or so  nonresidenti construct activ still appear to be adjust to high vacanc rate and weak rent  and we anticip onli gradual improv in that sector next year and into        moreov  despit the past and prospect declin in the dollar and the modest recoveri abroad  the extern sector is expect to subtract from growth over the next two year   final and import  fiscal polici swing from a sourc of consider s ulus earli next year to some small restraint in        from the perspect of our forecast  the shift in fiscal polici is do some of the work that would otherwis be requir of monetari polici   anoth concern rais about our forecast was that perhap we will experi more inflat with output growth that is the same or weaker than we are project  this implicit is a concern that we are too op ist  in some respect  about aggreg suppli   the outsid consensus forecast appear to embodi this view by combin higher interest rate  weaker activ  and more slack  with fa  inflat  the basic contour of our inflat forecast hasn   t chang sinc the last meet   we continu to expect that declin energi price will push down headlin inflat and that core price will increas in      and      at about the same pace as this year  the sourc of that subdu inflat pictur also remain the same   econom slack is expect to diminish onli gradual   rapid increas in structur labor product hold down cost  and the markup of price over unit labor cost  which has increas sharpli in recent quarter  level out   with headlin inflat come down  inflat expect are anticip to hold steadi or drift lower   one hear a varieti of stori express to support less favor outlook for inflat   one argument is that speed matter   perhap it is not the level of resourc util but the chang in resourc util that influenc inflat   the problem is that we can find littl to no empir support in the u s  data for this stori   the economi grew at rate well abov trend in the earli     s and earli     s   and despit notic declin in the unemploy rate  core inflat move down  not up  that casual observ is confirm by a lack of econometr evid for the exist of econom meaning speed effect   anoth concern has been that the rapid rise in commod price could be signal the emerg of more intens inflat pressur   but it is veri common for commod price to rise sharpli in the earli stage of recoveri without have much influenc on the price of final good and servic   primari commod have low labor content and are sold on auction market that are veri sensit to chang in demand   they constitut a veri small share of the valu ad of most finish good and servic  which typic are much more sensit to movement in labor cost   as an aggreg inflat shock  we believ the recent surg in commod price is like to be of minor consequ   anoth possibl is that inflat expect will deterior over the next year or so in respons to strong econom growth and our assumpt of continu polici patienc   this would seem to be a more serious risk  and we explor it consequ in an altern in the  book   but we don   t think that that   s the most like outcom   look at treasuri index secur  inflat compens over the next five year has move up sinc the summer but onli to the top end of the rang in which it has fluctuat over the past few year   likewis  inflat expect from the michigan survey have move back up in recent month along with energi price  but haven   t broken out to the upsid   we don   t see in our project the type of develop that would like result in a serious eros of your credibl   perhap the most obvious sourc of upward risk to our inflat project is that most or all of this year   s slow in core inflat reflect transitori factor that will be absent or   wors yet   be revers next year   for exampl  the smaller increas in residenti rent  motor vehicl  and medic servic may prove short live   as you know  we discount a great deal of the slow observ earlier this year  and the bounceback in the data in subsequ month has been veri close to our expect   but perhap we haven   t discount enough of this year   s low core inflat   if so  then price increas next year will be higher than we are current project   howev  if that were to occur  it will be import to bear in mind that this acceler of price reflect the unwind of favor develop this year and is not the result of an overh economi capabl of generat ongo increas in inflat   in summari  we acknowledg that there are veri larg risk to virtual everi import dimens of the staff project   there almost alway are   if it provid you with ani comfort  we have place at the veri top of our holiday wish list the acquisit of shini new model that will allow us to make it all clear for you in the come year   but bar that unlik outcom  we will simpli need to be content know that  with the recent run up of commod price  our lump of coal will at least go a littl bit further this year than it has in the past    laughter      son will now continu our present
with respect to econom activ abroad  our basic messag for you this meet is that the rebound in activ that we have been forecast for some  e has been confirm in product and spend data for the third quarter  inde  we were suffici surpris by the strength of this rebound  primarili in emerg asia but also in some other region  that we revis up our outlook for foreign real gdp growth in the current quarter about    percentag point   the list of countri report doubl digit real output growth in the third quarter includ china  hong kong  taiwan  and singapor   no doubt these remark magnitud reflect a bounceback from the contract of output in the second quarter in those economi and the fact that the sar epidem  by it natur transitori  account for the declin   nevertheless  real gdp reach level rang from about   to   percent abov one year ago   robust growth was also experienc in korea  indonesia  malaysia  and the philippin   vigor expans in the global high tech industri has boost growth in mani of the emerg asian countri although other factor  such as strong expans of domest demand in china  have also been import   trade within the region has help to spread demand broad across a number of countri  includ japan   japanes export  particular to china  have contribut substanti to the strong growth report in recent quarter  although some measur issu rais concern that the report japanes real gdp data overst the true pace of output growth  sustain posit growth has occur  in part becaus of s ulus from elsewher in the region   among the other foreign industri countri  the euro area was

the growth rate of aggreg foreign output from an annual rate of about     percent last quarter to    percent this quarter   although we do not think the veri rapid pace that was record in sever countri for the third quarter can be sustain  we see the recoveri in product in mani region  the favor develop in labor market in some case  and the strength of domest demand in sever key region as

privat foreign demand for u s  secur had been quit strong   data for two month are not suffici to convinc us that a major revers is under way   accord  in the decemb forecast we have adjust down the start point of the project path for the real foreign exchang valu of the dollar to reflect exchang rate develop over the intermeet period   as one more bit of evid that our crystal ball is a bit cloudi where exchang rate fluctuat are concern  the dollar has weaken further sinc we commit to that path in the  book   the nomin index in term of major foreign currenc is alreadi about   percent below the  book project for the first quarter   the project path remain tilt slight down as we judg that  over some extend period  the pressur exert by the need to financ a widen current account deficit and grow net intern indebted like will result in some further declin in the dollar   but we recogn that the dollar is like to fluctuat up as well as down at  e   moreov  the current  book assumpt that you will begin to tighten somewhat earlier than was incorpor into the previous  book lend support to possibl upsid pressur on the dollar in the come year   that conclud our present  mr  chairman
in recent day there has been some discuss among those in the intern oil market that opec is becom increas sensit to the fact that the dollar is declin   the notion is that the opec price rang of     to     a barrel that they alleg are endeavor to maintain is becom obsolesc  larg becaus of the chang in the dollar   s exchang rate   that rais a question as to whether there is ani evid at this particular point that oil consumpt in europ  for exampl  is actual stronger than otherwis would have been the case   obvious at the prevail dollar price   or are the tax in europ so larg that the price of crude realli  sn   t matter all that much  and henc there is no signific exchang rate effect on the suppli   demand balanc for oil
i cannot answer the specif question regard oil consumpt in europ  although i will follow up on this   we do judg that there is an exchang rate effect in the market determin of oil price in the sens that the demand for oil react to local currenc price everywher on the globe   so as those currenc fluctuat against the dollar relat to a relat sticki dollar price for oil  they see chang in the relat price of energi  and they react to the chang in those relat price   that feed back  on a short term  day by day basi  onto the demand for oil in the spot market  and it show through to the oil price   i honest don   t have in my head a number in term of how strong it is  but it   s not zero   of that i   m quit sure  now that   s a differ question from the strategi of opec  which might shift the band as a consequ of see a reduc intern valu of the dollar that is erod somewhat the price opec is get for it oil   what we   re see now are fluctuat that are stay high in the band part as a consequ of exchang rate develop   if that persist and if the dollar were to fall further  we might see the band shift so that opec put the spot market price back in the middl of the band
it look as if the opec price is    to    a barrel under that for west texa intermedi   is it someth like that
yes  i think    is the number we usual cite   so both of these factor are at work   we think we see the exchang valu of the dollar show through to the gold price  for exampl  and we think we see it in some commod price   it certain come through to oil in the sens of where the demand curv is   there is the larger question of whether opec might chang it strategi as well
the issu came up at the board meet ye day about the relationship between the gap and the rate of inflat outsid the unit state   in other word  the model in the unit state is reason robust for that type of calcul  histor we   ve never been abl to get reason es  of a relationship between gap and price elsewher   has that improv in recent year   or is there ani deeper insight into whether it   s a data problem or an econom problem
well  for place where one look the hardest  say europ  i   m not awar that peopl see it as a data problem   i believ it   s still the case that what we would call a phillip curv analysi is not well confirm in empir es  for most major foreign industri countri  with mayb one or two except   peopl keep tri to find a relationship  and i think in some sens if you want to believ one exist  you could find some evid for it  but the evid is not suffici persuas that the relationship has becom an accept characterist   it is true  given that these are poor fit equat with big standard error and a tendenc to go off track outsid of sampl and so forth  that there is probabl a bit of evid support speed effect for some of these countri   as dave just comment  that differ from the situat in the unit state in term of the speed effect here   most of the rhetor about speed effect come from colleagu outsid the unit state   central bank outsid the unit state point to these issu as a problem  and they usual explain it in the context of a wage determin process   so i think in fact econometr hasn   t realli answer the question of how price are determin in mani european countri and in japan too   japan may be the biggest puzzl of all  given that there is probabl as much evid for speed effect as there is for gap effect in that countri   that has open up the door to this ongo debat and some behavior respons on the part of foreign offici
do we have ani explan of whi a phenomenon such as we observ with some robust in the unit state could conceiv exist here and not in similar market orient economi abroad
let me mention two possibl   just in term of cross countri comparison of wage and price determin  there was a line of work that suggest that in the unit state nomin wage are sticki but real wage are flexibl wherea in europ everyon   s wage are so tight index that there is more real wage rigid   that could lead to a situat in which one get someth akin to hy esi in unemploy in europ  which in essenc say that whatev the unemploy rate has been recent is more or less the natur rate  therefor  it becom the chang in the unemploy rate that matter more than the level of the unemploy rate
it was somewhat the stori of the     s   that   s when a lot of this work went on and where the word    hy esi    came from   i think peopl do look to labor market for the explan   i can   t say that i   ve seen studi that have revisit this question the way it was look at in the      s and have conclud that noth has chang   i think thing are chang  franc is a countri  for exampl  where a lot has chang by way of labor market regul and the like   nonetheless  the process of wage set is certain more polit in europ than it is here  and the capac of the unemploy to matter either polit or in the market seem enorm less in europ than here   that   s perhap a reflect of the fact that most european have a more generous safeti net than is typic in this countri  so the unemploy may be exert less pressur   moreov  the deck seem stack against them a bit in that the european labor union don   t cri mani tear over the unemploy outsid their own particular union   the polit process is respons to some degre  but the answer from the polit arena seem to be to provid much more in the way of safeti net solut as oppos to better work market  there are other countri   canada  for exampl  or australia or new zealand  with tremend regulatori chang   where we might look for the sort of phenomenon you   re talk about   i don   t think the issu is black and white   it   s not that the phenomenon exist onli in the unit state and nowher els   there is a gradat   but the econometr analysi  sn   t realli provid a clear answer  the relationship are murki
in read the  book and listen to your comment this morn  you   ve indic that  as we go through the next sever month and through       the economi will move back to it potenti   yet the associ real fed fund rate at the end of the period is less than   percent   if one were to look at this option as a polici prescript  is the idea that you want to ensur a move back toward potenti as quick as possibl and then worri about how far below equilibrium the short term rate is   is that the suggest rather than that we should plan to move the fund rate up as the economi move back toward potenti
let me state emphat at the outset here that what we put down in the  book was not a polici prescript   i understand your question  but our forecast was not meant to advoc a particular path or strategi for you to take   i do think  howev  that it   s not an implaus baselin assumpt   obvious it   s someth we arriv at in our forecast   that the economi will be grow at potenti at the end of      with a real fund rate that is still below it equilibrium   we think that  go into       we will have some continu acceler in under potenti output that is be driven by the speed up in invest spend that we expect to get over the next two year   so we believ we can enter that year with a below equilibrium fund rate and still not generat ani acceler of inflat until later in        this is all model construct  obvious   i   m still most worri about tri to figur out what happen in the last quarter   if you   re ask me if i know with ani confid what will happen in
but suppos at the end of      the nomin fund rate is at   percent and you thought that a   percent nomin fund rate   a   percent real fund rate and   percent inflat   was where the rate had to go   could this committe rais the fund rate     basi point in        i think you certain could   you rais it     basi point in        so you   re not that far from equilibrium on the fund rate  given what you   ve demonstr in the past as a reason willing to be aggress   in      as the economi slow down in accord with our baselin forecast   if that were to happen   i think you   re go to be confront with some uncertainti about what the sourc of that slowdown are and how persist they are like to be  and that could potenti make you want to be somewhat cautious about how quick you remov the monetari s ulus   so that was the basic logic   we did not see this as a forecast in which you are definit fall way behind the curv by the end of      and we see inflat pressur as extrem subdu   and we didn   t see that you would have to go that far beyond the forecast horizon to remov the remain monetari s ulus
i have two question on the inflat outlook  and i   ll put them in the context of the phillip equat  which has an inflat expect term  a gap term  a shock term  and a disturb term or random term   you talk about the inflat expect term  you talk some about the gap term   certain from orphanid    work we know that there can be a lot of hazard in that gap   i   m wonder if you could comment on the standard error associ with that gap calcul   there are differ view about what potenti output is and also  of cours  exact where we are today   but you didn   t talk at all about the shock term and i think that a signific part of the r  of a standard phillip equat is come from the commod and exchang rate shock   what are the magnitud of those  and what is the speed with which those effect are transmit into the price index   can you give us just a rough  ballpark idea on that
first of all  the standard error are larg on both the output gap and the natur rate of unemploy
whichev way you want to express the gap
yes   so i would certain say that a percentag point band around our es  of the natur rate of unemploy is probabl a one standard deviat event   as you know  over the year we   ve made adjust in our es   both for thing that we could identifi in term of structur chang in labor market and also just to conform our es  to what was happen out there in the real world   so there is a lot of uncertainti about that es    in term of the shock effect  i tri to touch on that a littl with the commod price comment   if we were to take liter some of our stage of process type model  the run up we   ve had thus far in commod price   and we   re expect some deceler of that go forward   might be worth a coupl of tenth at most to final good and servic inflat
that   s for the total or the core
that   s for the total   that   s a pretti small effect   on the energi side  follow what we see as expect in the futur market  we think that energi price are like to come down and that that will feed through favor not just to indirect busi cost but also on the inflat expect side  in term of the effect on non oil import price of the declin in the dollar that has occur  our forecast is that  after increas    percent this year  core non oil import price are go to rise onli   percent next year and then actual deceler some in        so that is measur in basi point  not even tenth of a percentag point  in term of it overal effect on inflat   that   s just measur the import price part alon  not necessarili how the declin of the dollar is like to feed through to aggreg output   so again  in our model and our forecast of the import exogen variabl  we just don   t see the big shock come through   i think on the inflat expect side there is a risk   in essenc  we are assum that next year there will be some further edg down of inflat expect especi as energi price declin and headlin inflat rate reced   but that could prove to be wrong   also  as i indic in my remark  anoth signific risk is that we got extrem good inflat number in the first half of this year and we fed a littl of that through into our forecast next year   that might be ascrib too much of a signal to the slow we   ve seen this year  and we could get some bounceback just from an unwind of these favor effect
dave  your comment today as well as a memo that was sent to the fomc contain a discuss of how rapid employ is like to grow   the view is that employ growth basic is go to be consist with what we   ve seen in the past  frank  i don   t realli have much of a problem with that view   but one certain hear a lot in the public arena   from editori writer  comment  and so forth   about the impact of special factor that are go to make such growth less like to occur   these observ refer  of cours  to outsourc  the loss of manufactur job  and those kind of thing   my impress is that the number attribut to those develop are realli too small to make much of a differ   do you have a view about it
again  hard data on the magnitud of outsourc are not avail  but i   m skeptic about that be a major impedi to employ growth   mani of these forc have been in oper or have been under way for the past decad in a period when our economi was generat lot of employ growth   we had a veri strong manufactur sector and tight capac util just a few year ago   so the notion that the world has chang in such a fundament way that an appropri accommod monetari polici and a s ul fiscal polici won   t be abl to take up slack seem to me to be far fetch   i think that place too much emphasi on these effect  to me the more import risk to our employ forecast is that we see the level of product as have move up so much that we think it   s probabl well abov it structur level   in essenc we believ there will be some increas hire in an effort to begin to reliev pressur that have develop as busi have push veri hard on their exist worker and facil to improv the bottom line   unfortun  we can   t have much confid in our abil to have that gaug veri well   it is possibl that the stock of effici for busi to draw on is still quit larg and that the need to increas employ might be signific less than we   re think   obvious  that  sn   t mean that polici couldn   t crowd in those job   if that   s the case and the suppli is in fact bigger than we think  then demand need to be stronger to take up the slack
maquiladora were emerg in the     s with far greater number of peopl outsourc from the unit state as our unemploy rate continu to fall
well  i think what   s involv now is a rather vocal group of skill worker  who are get a lot of attent   we hear stori about financi analysi be conduct in india
do you want to know someth   these worker are not as skill as some peopl think   the entir skill level in the unit state continu to rise  and these job that are be outsourc requir what we now would call below averag skill  we   re not send off to india the work that requir realli sophist softwar knowledg   a good deal of the work be sent off is the overnight process and standard data crunch servic that in the twenti first centuri involv a relat skill level not signific differ from certain import manual labor skill a hundr year ago
i agre   but near everybodi one talk to believ this is happen  that   s the point i   d make
some of what peopl believ just    ain   t so      presid
we even believ the cub are go to win the world seri   laughter
no  i think it   s go to be the red sox    laughter
i want to get back to the discuss of inflat expect in this altern scenario that you said is a risk   i think it   s a risk that we have to take veri serious becaus it would be a great shame if inflat expect did in fact increas signific   i   m certain hear a lot of comment about inflat from peopl i talk to  particular becaus of concern about the size of the budget deficit and the long term problem of social secur and medicar  which we all know about  the tip spread was mention in the staff brief ye day  and in your comment today you said that for the period over the next five year there has been a bit of up and down movement but that the five to ten year period has shown a quit dramat increas in inflat expect   in the staff brief ye day part of the explan was the increas liquid in the market   but it was clear note that that was not the onli reason   i was wonder if you could talk about some of the other reason for the increas in the tip spread   which is realli inflat compens   in that five to ten year period   is this a warn sign for us that a signific number of peopl in the financi market are concern that we   re lose control over inflat
i mention the five year inflat expect  in part  becaus we don   t think the five to ten year inflat expect are condit current wage and price set decis   i don   t think anybodi is set a wage contract over the next year or two or three base on five to ten year inflat expect   but those expect obvious would matter for the real rate on longer term secur   i think   sack  our briefer ye day  mention that there is a liquid stori but that there is also a possibl that market particip have shift their view as to your longer term inflat object   it seem a bit far fetch that so big a chang in expect could have occur over such a short period of  e   so we   re somewhat skeptic about that     also mention hedg demand  but we think that was probabl a relat short live effect   i don   t know whether   madigan or   want to say ani more about that
i don   t have too much to add to that   i would just note that probabl the mortgag hedg activ that were veri promin in the summer did play a role  and that make it a littl difficult to interpret the exact  e of the movement in the inflat expect seri   but i person wouldn   t be inclin to complet rule out the possibl that market particip may be look at longer run inflat trend and that a slight larger premium may be built in there now
the other point i   d add  presid    is that the differ between the nomin and the index yield is inflat compens that includ both inflat expect and an inflat risk premium   so it wouldn   t be that far fetch to say that  while market particip may not believ that the committe   s view on longer term inflat expect are materi differ  peopl in the market might be a littl more uncertain about whether that   s the case  they might well have greater uncertainti about that  given various comment about the rang of view among committe member in term of how they interpret their longer run inflat goal
are we see it in the tranch of the longer term issu   say the thirti year bond or even the ten year note   are those tranch move up   or as you point out ye day  is this a reflect of improv liquid in the tip market to the extent that we   re get a lower tip yield and henc an artifici liquid relat increas in inflat compens impli in the five to ten year part of the tip structur
there are two point to make about that  mr  chairman   the first is that we do think the tip market is more liquid   that   s in part a reflect of the fact that more instrument are tie to tip  includ some exchang trade product that are price relat to tip   so that provid more liquid and more opportun to trade  and there are more mutual fund that use those product   so we think it   s a more liquid instrument and that is associ with the declin bid   ask spread and the increas trade volum  i   d also point out that one of the other brief ye day look at the inflat compens measur from the euro market  canada  and the unit kingdom   as was note  there was a consider synchron to the run up in inflat compens in those market  that would make one think that perhap there was someth about the overal liquid and arbitrag across those market rather than an unravel of investor    confid in the long term inflat target of three differ central bank
what has happen to the one year matur ten year out
in term of impli forward rate
over the intermeet period that forward rate structur realli hasn   t chang much at all
is it correl with what is conceptu ident to inflat expect for a forward period   do the two give the same answer   my recollect is that they do not
they don   t in part becaus the inflat risk premium and the potenti for differenti term premium between the index and the nomin secur drive
which is not an inflat premium issu
right   so one can   t read it as an inflat premium   we   ve found histor that the slope of the term structur   not do a particular good job in forecast either activ or inflat   there   s a littl inform on the further ahead forward rate but not a lot   it is the case that the veri far ahead forward rate were up a bit up over the intermeet period   but the ten year was actual down   so it isn   t as if there are some obvious set of signal there   nor is it the case if you look at volatil that we could get from swaption   the impli volatil on ten year instrument are higher  but all interest rate volatil are a littl higher
yes  but presid   is rais a question base on look at that chart   i think he call it scari  and it is scari if you believ what it impli   if it is inde is tell us someth  it   s obvious veri import for polici   if it is not  it   s import that we know that
and that   s where we are expend a lot of effort to tri to figur it out
we   ve certain seen no corrobor in ani other survey of inflat expect that there has been ani deterior
come back to your question on forward rate  mr  chairman  over the past year it look as if one year forward rate of the ten year matur haven   t realli done anyth on balanc   they did declin in the spring and then move back up in the summer  they have been rough flat in recent month
this is interest  but i want to switch gear a bit and ask a question about the real net export dynam in our forecast  if i could   the depreci of the dollar has improv the outlook for real net export in a lot of privat sector forecast  but hasn   t done so in the  book   what are the reason for that differ     this impli that we may be find ourselv with greater depreci later on down the road   could you just comment on how you view this and whi you think it look so differ to the privat sector
to be honest  i haven   t check what the privat sector forecast are say  so i can   t comment on that   it   s certain not the case that the project for the dollar has not shown through to our forecast   in fact i tri to suggest in the  book that we   re final at the point now where past dollar appreci has exit the veri long lag term  particular on the export side   so the consequ of the dollar depreci sinc it peak in earli      are now more or less fulli come through without be moder by some of the linger effect of past dollar appreci   in the export equat in particular we are see some signific effect from the fact that the dollar is lower and go forward is project to come down   now  in all honesti  in our forecast we don   t have a lot of dollar depreci yet to come   so it   s most a backward look effect of relat depreci that we alreadi have experienc that is show through to export   we have export growth rebound to someth like    percent   a signific portion of that is due to the exchang rate effect  and some of it is due to the improv outlook for foreign economi that i talk about this morn  on the import side  it   s a littl more difficult to say exact how the dollar   s declin is have an effect becaus import price have been surpris us   we haven   t gotten the increas in import price that the econometr relationship would suggest we should get   so with that  we have been chip away at how much of a given dollar chang we are will to put into the import price chang   it   s onli through import price that the dollar is go result in import be restrain by the fall dollar   if import price don   t rise in respons to the dollar fall  then the effect of the dollar   s declin  sn   t show through to the relationship that guid the way we project import  all in all i think we have fair vigor import growth here   as a consequ  we have net export becom yet again a drag on output   we   ve had posit contribut from the net export sector in somewhat anomal way dure the slowdown becaus  while we had export fall  we had import fall  too   go forward  everyth revert to it usual sign   export contribut posit  they contribut about   percentag point on averag over the forecast period in most quarter   but the contribut from import rise to about minus     to minus     percentag point   so we get a net drag from the extern sector reemerg  as is usual the case  if i may put it that way  now  how power is the dollar to do this   we have the usual elast in our equat   i don   t think our trade relationship differ great from those use by most of the other forecast that i know of   what is usual the culprit here is the fact that import are so much bigger than export   what happen to import realli  realli matter   the fact that we aren   t see the depreci of the dollar reflect in import price may be a sourc of differ between what we   re forecast for net export and what other are forecast   we would have slower import and stronger gdp if we had the pass through to import price occur more quick in the forecast
that is what forecast in the privat sector have   i was curious about how it work and whi that differ exist
if i give dave ani more gdp he   s not go to buy it anyway
i   m go to switch gear back to the inflat issu   in your comment  dave  you address some of the risk toward higher inflat   of cours  our statement still say that the probabl  though minor  of an unwelcom fall in inflat exceed that of a rise in inflat   in june you prepar and share with us some probabl of the economi fall into deflat   i would like to know you have rerun those simul and whether they   ve chang veri much or if that is just not a concern ani longer
we   ve continu to tinker with both the model and our definit of deflat sinc june   let me put it on a consist basi with the number we provid in june so you can actual compar how econom event have chang those probabl  we would calcul that the probabl in      that core pce price would be run below    percentag point   which is our es  of the measur error and thus would be real deflat   has fallen to about    percent   that probabl on our june baselin forecast was    percent   the probabl of what we would call a more pernici deflat   that is  price declin on a measur adjust basi and the unemploy rate remain at or abov   percent in         has fallen from   percent to about     percent   so those probabl have reced   i   d leav it to you to judg whether you thought those were big number or small number   but clear the improv in the under baselin forecast has made deflat a less like event than we calcul in june
ani further question   presid
i realiz that this discuss is go on a littl longer than we probabl all expect  but let me just follow up with one more question   in the      s i think all of us were struck by the degre to which compani said that they were never go to rais price   they felt that global competit or domest competit or whatev one want to call it had put them in a posit of not view price increas as an option avail to them   there were a lot of factor help them in that regard  particular in term of the cost of labor   they were pay peopl with stock option  which they didn   t have to account for   the stock market was help on benefit cost   the rate of increas in health cost was go down at the  e   there were ani number of account t  that we now know compani were use to figur out how to show a level of earn and revenu and so forth that the market expect  more recent we   ve had slow growth in demand  but at the same  e the factor that kept the cost associ with hire peopl low have all disappear   firm don   t have the same benefici impact from benefit program   health cost are clear escal   busi can no longer pay peopl in way that are not transpar  those cost have to be account for in some fashion or anoth  at least for most compani   clear the emphasi on improv product is a reflect of the desir not to increas price   but i   m wonder if we are still hear with the same intens the view that rais price is just not someth that firm would ever consid do again
i think one read and hear more about a return of price power than was the case a few year ago   i   m not quit sure what that mean   there has obvious been a signific firm  as i indic  not just in commod price but in intermedi materi price too as the economi has pick up some speed   again  we don   t think that is go to be a major sourc of posit inflat shock   but i think one hear more about price power there  there have been other area  too   for exampl  in educ and medic care  one never heard that there wasn   t price power
i would note two thing that i think are relev   first  given the spectacular increas in product  if one assign even some small portion of that go forward as an increas in under product  that   s still a major factor that will be reliev cost pressur on the busi side   second  we think there were some special factor in the second half of the     s   the inflat outlook that we   re show you in this forecast is nowher near as benign as what happen in the late     s  when the unemploy rate fell through   percent to below   percent and we didn   t get ani inflat   in this forecast  with an unemploy rate that remain at or abov our es  of the natur rate  we think we will not be get much further deceler in inflat   part of the reason relat to some of the factor that you mention   for exampl  that on the compens side thing are go to be a bit firmer   we think we   re not go to see much downward pressur there in part becaus of medic cost and in part becaus employ might be reli primarili on more tradit mean of provid labor compens   so in essenc we believ that we have built into this forecast the broader effect that you   re get at in your question   i   m skeptic about the view that the world has becom less competit and that there will be a return of more signific price power   if anyth  i   d say that factor might be a downsid risk to our inflat project   given the strong burst of product  the markup over unit labor cost has increas in the nonfinanci corpor sector almost back to it peak in the     s   a peak from which it subsequ fell   and that was a forc that contribut to disinfl in that period   so although we have that markup more or less level out  one could just as easili imagin that go down as up
who would like to start the committe discuss
could i just ask one other brief question   i know we   ve gone on for quit some  e  but this is just a quick question for   build on the same theme      do you have ani sens that ani of the weak in the dollar may reflect concern in foreign exchang market  and especi on the part of foreign investor  that u s  monetari polici is too accommod   in other word  is there some sens of inflat expect that may not be show up in the other indic you look at
i guess i   d say    no    as a short answer   it   s certain true that some other central bank comment from  e to  e on their sens of monetari accommod   but there are other central bank with a differ posit   for exampl  the bank of england has alreadi rais rate  and the reserv bank of australia has rais rate twice   but i think the notion in intern financi circl that the global economi has turn and it   s  e to start rais rate   there was even a  e when peopl somehow thought the fed would have to go first   is not preval   we occasion might hear in the press about worri voic in other countri that  if the fed  sn   t act  how can we act   but it turn out that we don   t have to go first   the reserv bank of australia can certain go first  and it did
well  isn   t it main the issu of hous price inflat that is scare both of those central bank you mention rather than
well  that   s certain a piec of it  although both of those bank i think quit legi  see themselv as have a zero output gap   the australian economi has perform remark strong   so they need to have their polici rate much closer to equilibrium than we do
well  we just discuss the notion that the output gap  sn   t make ani differ there
well  i would use that languag even if they don   t   and i would say that they are grow    speaker      with speed limit
for various reason their economi has been grow around   percent at  e and rather consist   now  in england  i think there is an enorm tension over the hous price on the one hand and other price on the other   not all price are rise   there   s a sens of the servic sector of the economi versus the manufactur sector of the economi   one monetari polici just won   t do for the unit kingdom anymor  but of cours  they can have onli one monetari polici   so there is a certain tension there   but i think in the intern set it has becom clear that  depend on the inflat situat and the macroeconom pictur more broad  some central bank need to be act now and some do not have to yet  but i have not detect a sens that the reason the dollar is be sold is that we   re fail to address an emerg inflat problem   i have certain heard often   and dino may confirm this   that the australian dollar is one of the currenc that has appreci the most against the u s  dollar  so just the interest differenti in the normal cours of transact is loom in peopl   s convers
there is a minor that would say that the low interest rate here are affect the dollar   they would also say that that  sn   t mean that our polici isn   t the right one   it   s just that one of the side effect of have that polici is that the dollar will depreci
okay  can we move on to the econom discuss  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the seventh district economi continu to improv   much of the uncertainti that was pervas earlier in the year has dissip  but mani of our busi contact suggest that econom growth in the region is still somewhat less robust than what they see in the nation number  the holiday shop season got off to a reason good start   most retail said that sale in the day follow thanksgiv met their expect   even the old line depart store were said to have fare well dure the period   sever contact note that inventori were lean and that retail were tri to cut back on discount   but consum still seem to be veri price sensit   mani retail report to us that the strong post thanksgiv sale larg reflect purchas of deepli discount merchandis   one nation specialti retail who sharpli cut back his discount note that sale at his compani slow consider and unexpect in the last few week  as you know  nation light vehicl sale pick up in novemb and were slight higher than automak    expect   with the general improv economi  automak have rais their sale forecast for next year   this friday the chicago fed will be host it annual econom outlook symposium  and the auto industri particip are forecast light vehicl sale between      and      million unit in       which is at least         unit below the  book project   more broad     individu submit forecast for      for the overal economi  and the consensus among them was general similar to the decemb blue chip consensus  at our last meet i mention that we were wait for manufactur to shift from be cautious op ist to just plain op ist   that now seem to be happen   we   re hear more and more report of strong order  increas backlog  and in some case even firmer price   for exampl  the vast major of particip at the fab tech trade show held in chicago last month said that new order for fabric equip are up   this was especi encourag given the low capac util rate   in addit  produc of heavi equip in a varieti of sector note strengthen demand  exampl includ construct  agricultur food process  drill  and airlin servic equip  labor market continu to improv   our contact at two larg temporari help firm said that the number of worker on assign continu to rise steadili  but they also indic that the increas were below their expect given the strong gdp growth we   ve seen   we   ve receiv preliminari result of manpow   s first quarter hire plan survey  and the index improv moder from the fourth quarter of      to the first quarter of       but was slight below the year ago level   let me note that this inform will not be releas public until decemb     turn to the nation outlook  most of the recent data have been encourag  employ and hour continu to improv  although friday   s report was somewhat weaker than expect   household sector demand remain solid  and at last corpor decisionmak have becom more op ist   this confid appear to be translat into the broad base increas in spend that we   ve been wait for   firm seem to be shift from inventori liquid to restock  and the order data point to further robust gain in expenditur for equip and softwar   of cours  resourc gap remain   but given that the expans final seem to have gain traction  i feel more confid that the gap will narrow a good deal over the next year   in my view this put the risk regard inflat outcom into closer balanc  so i think we need to start prepar market for inevit rate increas   my prefer is to start do that today  perhap with some minor chang in the word of our statement

thank you  mr  chairman   my contact have somewhat differ view on the situat   a number of peopl have said that the economi just  sn   t feel like one in which gdp growth is     percent   i think there may be some explan for whi the percept  sn   t match the data   on the truck side  my contact at j b  hunt report that they are see a modest upsw in busi though not a huge improv   he note  howev  that driver are in tight suppli  my contact at fedex and up have a consider more buoyant outlook   at fedex the word is that all arrow are up by a fair substanti amount   fedex is expect a good holiday season   even the express busi is show growth in volum and revenu at this point   it was not earlier   moreov  base on contact with custom  fedex expect further increas in growth   fedex anticip that  for the next six month  express busi will be up at a     percent rate  ground busi at a    percent plus rate  and freight at a     percent rate   my contact at up start off by say     we   re get the door blown off with volum      he note that a lot of the volum is driven by sale over the internet and by phone sale for holiday season packag   so the retail firm ship packag to peopl are drive that volum   in fact  the volum has been great enough that the huge autom facil in louisvill has been oper at capac on a number of day   up actual has ad leg to it aircraft  send some of the packag to other facil to be sort becaus the louisvill facil is oper at capac   my contact said that up has been revis up it project for the holiday season  busi in asia is pick up tremend  and in europ the project is for   percent growth in busi next year   in south america  no growth is expect  nor is much expans anticip in mexico either  i talk twice recent to my wal mart contact   he also start out by say that the economi  sn   t feel as if it is grow at an     percent rate  and he note that wal mart supplier agre with that assess   in my convers with him last friday morn he said that wal mart had never been particular op ist about the holiday season this year and that it sale experi has been about as expect   there are a number of press report about holiday sale be less buoyant than the op ist had hope   my wal mart contact point particular to what to me is an interest phenomenon regard the so call retail blitz  the day after thanksgiv   he said that onc the park lot are full   and that was true for wal mart this year   the onli way their store can post increas dollar volum is if consum are buy more expens good  particular the consum electron that have the bigger price tag   but given the deflat in consum electron   he said those price are    to    percent lower than last year   it requir a huge increas in volum for the dollar sale to go up   retail in particular look at dollar sale  they make their comparison on the basi of dollar  not so much on volum   he was veri op ist  howev  about the first quarter   anticip substanti effect from the tax refund check that will be go out becaus of overwithhold of incom tax   we must have some es  of how big that is go to be  we didn   t talk about that earlier  i think there are a coupl of puzzl in the nation situat   i see lot of veri buoyant data  but i find the financi data   the actual declin in the money stock and in bank credit   quit unusu and someth of a puzzl   i   d also note that the latest employ report show a veri larg discrep between the household and payrol survey   the payrol survey get all the press   in the last two month  take the two month togeth  payrol employ was up         wherea household employ show an increas of      million   that   s a veri  veri larg discrep   now  we know that the payrol survey has problem pick up birth and death of firm   so if we are in a period with a lot of birth   new firm come along   it   s possibl that the payrol data are not pick up some of them   we won   t know until februari       i suppos  becaus in februari of next year we   ll get the benchmark revis through march of this year   so we   re not go to know that for quit some  e  my wal mart contact point out that it sam   s club sale are veri  veri strong   he said that wal mart has been emphas sale to small busi   small busi buy a lot at sam   s club  they stock up on suppli  includ item such as toilet paper and paper towel   he note that busi membership at sam   s club have been rise at doubl digit rate   a year ago the growth in busi membership was flat  but a surg in the number of busi peopl take out individu or busi membership began about nine month ago   my contact say that the evid is cloud  howev  by the fact that wal mart initi a big promot with small busi   so it is unclear whether the surg is just a reflect of the promot take hold or of some fundament chang in the small busi sector  i agre with a coupl of earlier comment that the inflat risk now are sure symmetr and not tilt to the downsid   thank you
with both polit parti in california propos to borrow money to get out of debt  laughter  and with up ad leg rather than wing to it plane  everyth in texa is relat good   our district economi has been show sign of consist but gradual improv with each success snapshot throughout the year  and we   re now look at a pretti strong outlook for the region  mirror that of the nation   we had been lag behind the nation  we believ that condit are in place for strong employ growth in       corpor profit are much improv  as is busi sen ent  the airlin shakeout appear to be behind us   texa cattl produc are back in the saddl again  with the price of beef rise    percent over the last few month   thank in larg part to the atkin diet   the local defens industri  notabl lockhe martin and bell helicopt  is flush with new contract   product and export in the texa high tech sector are stronger than we had expect  which bode well for incom produc in these industri   aid by the continu boom in singl famili hous  construct employ remain strong   also  there are increas sign that the offic sector has bottom   the medic servic industri continu to expand at a rapid pace  with employ grow at a   percent annual rate in octob  the negat for the district are manufactur and mexico  but the latter may be more ye day   s stori than tomorrow   s   in the last few year      mexican maquiladora plant have close  with     of them move their oper to china   mexico   i think this appli to offici in mexico   has final recogn that it compar advantag no longer lie in low wage job but in move up the food chain to a higher product product mix   howev  i was at a maquiladora convent in guadalajara late  and a lot of the owner of maquiladora seem to be in denial about that   they   re just look for the old way to come back   mexico is still in the doldrum but should show improv as the recoveri in our manufactur sector take hold   although the district   s manufactur sector continu to shed job in octob  sign of strength in order are becom more widespread  and export have been grow as the world economi continu to improv   overal  the district outlook is for econom growth to pick up steam in      with employ to follow suit  last friday i met with a group of ceo from san antonio and south texa  and for the most part they concur with this view   one of the interest item to note from this meet is the increas bifurc natur of the household sector   two major auto dealer were in the group  and both lament that an increas proport of car buyer is have difficulti get credit   one of the dealer  who is a member of our san antonio board  mention that one of his dealership had forti four prospect deal the previous weekend but onli four qualifi for credit   both dealer expect that this situat will continu to put a crimp in car sale   i might just say that mani custom who come into the dealership to trade are alreadi under water with the car they have to trade in   when they success trade  they walk out the door even more under water   these dealer contact also indic that buyer of high end car are have no troubl financ and that a lot of those buyer pay without ani financ   this underscor some of the inform that bill pool has been report from his wal mart contact about liquid constrain household   or mayb they   re incom constrain household   bare make it from paycheck to paycheck  turn to the nation economi  so much for the  book staff be over op ist about growth    laughter   it seem clear that virtual all of the econom data we   ve seen sinc the last fomc meet both here and abroad has been posit to strong posit  after the invest bust and the slowdown associ with war in afghanistan and iraq  a robust expans is clear under way   we now know that job growth has been under way for four consecut month  even on the establish survey basi  with improv prospect for continu declin in the unemploy rate  the two issu that this committe need to address are     when and if this improv econom outlook might translat into higher inflationari pressur  and     when monetari polici will need to shift into a less easi postur   a third issu involv how to manag that polici shift without unduli disrupt financi market and therebi the recoveri  as i look at the balanc of risk go forward  it seem to me that the risk on both growth and inflat have becom much more even balanc or are approach balanc   as i review the altern simul in the  book  the scenario i consid the most like was the one that assum fa  structur product growth   that scenario would get us to an inflat rate of about    percent at the end of       which would put us rather close to the zone that   has character as be on the edg of price stabil and potenti deflat   the staff suggest that we   d also get fa  gdp growth and possibl a higher unemploy rate than in the baselin forecast  although i   m not so sure about that  in the late      s capit deepen was occur as a mean to deal with labor shortag  over the last few year the next phase of the high tech revolut kick in with an organiz revolut   outsourc  network  and global are take the benefit of compar advantag and special to a new level or dimens   this increas special is one reason that product gain are spread outsid the manufactur sector   the greater abil to outsourc some servic sector job to foreign worker is enabl mani compani to reduc cost and to increas the flexibl of their product process   to the extent that global in it has made mani previous nontrad good and servic immin tradabl  we should expect to see some signific chang in the relat inflat rate of good and servic   i don   t think it is unreason to expect that servic inflat could end up a lot closer to good inflat as a result of these develop   that is just one more reason that i   m reluct think about rais interest rate at this  e  rapid gdp growth is not our enemi  though i am will to conced that rapid growth sustain primarili by substanti negat real interest rate may prove to be a problem   but that problem is not immin given the degre of product growth and slack in the economi and our abil to capit on the slack in the economi of other countri   i believ that the outlook for growth in real gdp is either balanc or bias toward more growth  and i think the outlook for inflat is now balanc   with regard to the    consider period    of accommod polici that we   ve mention in our press statement  i think we have to honor that promis when it come to polici chang in the next littl while   but i believ it   s  e to withdraw that phrase  even though the initi market reaction will like be negat   the clock  sn   t even start until that phrase has been remov from our statement   that phrase has becom a liabil to our credibl   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc the last fomc meet  econom activ in the sixth district has continu to expand at a reason pace  with strength fair broad base   compar with the rest of the nation  the region   s growth appear robust  suggest that our area may be lead again as we did in the recoveri from the         recess  to illustr the breadth of the strength we   re see region  retail are upbeat about sale in recent week  and prospect for the holiday season appear to be better than last year   auto sale  which had weaken in octob  bounc back in novemb   commerci real estat market are improv  especi retail and distribut expans   residenti hous market remain general stabl at veri high level   while offic vacanc rate remain high  we   re now get posit absorpt with subleas space no longer come back on the market the way it did earlier   the tourism industri report a rise in visitor and a posit outlook for the winter season  especi for cruis   visitor from europ are return  buoy by an appreci euro  although traffic from latin america has drop   this is the third fomc brief in a row in which we   ve had report from our bank sector suggest that loan demand is pick up  primarili in the servic sector but with some new borrow now show up for commerci real estat project and manufactur   trade and transport activ improv in the district   inde  truck manufactur are note a sharp increas in order   one local trailer manufactur said that his compani had an inventori of      trailer just six month ago and today they are struggl to keep up with demand   they have a backlog of order through the end of the first quarter  the district is also lead the nation in job growth  as it did come out of the         recess   recent job momentum for georgia in particular was exceed by onli two state  and metro atlanta had the fastest job growth in recent month of ani metropolitan area in the countri   it   s difficult to pinpoint a distinct sourc for this growth  such as a few larg employ bring back worker   all indic are that  outsid of manufactur  it   s quit broad base  the rise in employ is be reflect in improv state sale tax and incom tax receipt  everi state in the district now has an unemploy rate below that for the nation  and georgia   s stand at     percent   that said  it   s also true that job growth in our district is consider more mute this  e than in the post recess period in the earli      s   we have yet to see the surg that would signific push down unemploy rate  as for inflat  price increas still appear mute except for health care and the pass  through of higher natur gas price   we also hear some scatter anecdot report of higher price in truck  where shortag of equip are begin to affect truck and trailer price  on the nation front  i count myself among those skeptic who were surpris by the sheer strength of the third quarter growth and product number   perhap even more encourag are the sign that invest has begun to pick up and the sign of life in labor market   in anecdot report  revis to inventori number suggest that accumul has now begun  further complement the other signal   all this bode well for this year and next   i  like other  expect some slowdown in the fourth quarter from the third  but i do anticip that      will be even stronger than        ani quibbl i might have with the  book over point es  for growth are minor becaus the baselin forecast path in the  book is consist with our own atlanta model forecast  i find it more difficult to work through the longer term outlook for inflat and to reconcil the  book   s veri benign outlook with the somewhat earlier upturn in the inflat path suggest by privat sector forecast  some of our own model work  and financi market view   certain  the less than benign view regard the inflat outlook seem to be reflect fundament in one way or anoth   those fundament includ money growth for sever year in excess of the nomin rate of econom growth  real interest rate near zero or negat  a surg in govern spend with veri larg short term deficit  a drop in the valu of the dollar  a grow trade deficit  and increas lean toward trade protection   i would conclud that the inflat risk are current close to balanc   the growth that we have seen recent and that we expect to continu into next year certain reduc the probabl of worrisom further disinfl  that should remind us as well as other that inflat could move sooner than expect in the other direct  look ahead just a bit to the polici discuss  i would guess that there will be a sens that we continu to have the luxuri of be abl to be patient in term of adjust the stanc of polici   at the same  e  we   re at a point where we can and should begin to turn more attent to the longer term and the process of ul  adjust polici  hope grace  initi back to a more neutral set   in prepar for those later discuss  i would suggest that our ul  polici adjust would need to take care account of certain exist condit in the economi that may affect the under polici transmiss channel  what i have in mind is the follow   approxim    percent of the increas in gdp sinc the trough is due to hous and durabl good purchas  which usual need to be financ and were clear encourag and support by low interest rate   measur of consum debt produc by the board   s staff show that consum clear have increas their debt burden and their financi oblig ratio   delinqu rate on subprim mortgag far exceed those of other mortgag   final  while credit card lender remain profit  their chargeoff ratio are now approach   percent   as a result  current profit level are be maintain by low commerci paper fund cost and not by increas charg on loan  should we rais rate too high too quick this  e  we risk choke off demand for hous and durabl  a situat that will be exacerb by a profit squeez on lender  particular credit card lender  who will be forc to curtail lend or tighten standard  there   s also a risk  with busi invest still tentat  that precipit rate hike might heighten businessmen   s risk avers and lead them to postpon plan invest   but smaller rate hike might have a greater econom impact this  e than in previous expans  these structur issu suggest to me that we may need to be more concern than usual about exact what evid or signal we will need to see to trigger a preemptiv polici revers  given the lag in the transmiss of polici   these consider also seem to argu for prepar peopl at the right  e for a smooth transit to a less accommod polici   it   s nice to come to a point where we can begin to sort through those longer term issu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in new england continu to lag that of the nation  but much of the region slow seem concentr in massachusett   elsewher there are indic that a more solid pace of growth is take hold  for one  merchandis export for the region climb almost    percent in the last quarter from their low point in earli       with the largest growth in chemic and comput and electron product   more notabl perhap  despit the downbeat natur of some of the region data  consum confid rose sharpli in novemb  with improv in view regard both the present situat as well as futur expect   confid is now back to level seen just as the recess end   hope that   s a precursor to a brighter tone overal  i say    hope    becaus some import data remain relat downbeat   employ level in the region drop again in octob   the two most popul and richest state  massachusett and connecticut  led the way with year over year job loss of near     percent  for the other state in the region  howev  the job count was either unchang or margin posit versus a year ago   moreov  even though massachusett and connecticut employ declin over the year were compar  massachusett account for near all the recent drop  thus there is some reason to believ that five out of the six new england state are move in a posit direct  with onli massachusett stuck in contract mode  commerci real estat market remain weak in the region  with offic rent fall  again  the boston market seem to be the most sluggish  with contact report stabil elsewher   not surpris  a survey indic that busi confid in massachusett slip a bit as well  fall slight below    in octob after strengthen through most of the summer   employ were report to have signific concern about the present and a wait and see attitud regard the futur   similar  an econom index of massachusett growth fell off a bit from both a month and a year earlier   the state   s economi is nonetheless expect to grow over the next six month but at a slower pace  move beyond the data  and particular the data from massachusett  there are uneven sign of vital   beig book contact in retail and manufactur were more upbeat than they were the previous  e we talk to them   temporari help firm report that activ has pick up in recent month   revenu are up  and the excess suppli of avail labor may be moder   softwar firm were more upbeat as well  with more specialti show better growth than earlier   contact in the chip make industri say growth should be at    percent global in the fourth quarter  a good pickup for that sizabl industri   paper mill and packag industri continu to see onli slow growth in demand  and consum electron sale through octob seem to signal a reason but not a great christma season   nevertheless  consum continu to be will to spend relat larg amount on entertain   one larg sport venu report high per capita spend at recent game   in sum  new england still face challeng  though for the most part massachusett seem wors off  with the other state on a more posit trend   condit are slowli improv though the degre to which this is happen vari  on the nation scene there are mani more sign of a solid grow economi   clear the     percent pace of growth in the third quarter won   t be repeat if onli becaus consum won   t find their pocket line as great with tax cut and child tax credit again   it   seem now that  while consum spend is eb a bit  the busi sector is pick up   new order data  a surg in corpor profit  and continu favor financi market condit all suggest that busi spend will continu on the upward growth path seen in the second and third quarter   in this context i was a bit dismay by the novemb job data   it seem clear that the benefit of the recent product surg   that is  high real incom for those peopl who are work and low price pressur   are like to remain fixtur on the landscap for a while  but i do think the caution that has character labor market recent is eb   busi have begun the hire process   we   ve seen that over the last three or four month  and i think it   s like that process will acceler and creat a sustain growth pattern for       outsid the unit state  prospect for growth have pick up as well   most of the world   s economi regist an uptick in growth in the third quarter  and monetari and financi condit in the big three develop area   the unit state  the euro area  and japan   are s ul as we head into        there are geopolit risk  but the world overal seem to be deal with the uncertainti they present in way that less and less affect the growth process  i continu to find the  book   s es  of growth in the  s and  s for this year and next and into      with declin inflat rather op ist   our calcul in boston suggest a more moder path   but i have to admit to a great deal of uncertainti about ani particular forecast   it   s clear that activ is grow solid  but given the slow pace at which the output gap is like to close in almost ani scenario  price pressur are low and may remain so   but there are sizabl risk around that   i am less concern than i ever was  and that was not much  about a period of truli harm deflat   the risk around the inflat forecast appear balanc  as sever other have mention   on the other hand  there are some upsid risk to what could be an over sanguin view of the inflat process if stronger growth than project in the  book actual occur   in that regard  i found the polici tighten embed in the  book comfort   i think we may need to begin take rate to a more neutral place fa  than is expect in the  book   for now i continu to believ that we have some  e to wait and that polici may continu on an even keel for a  e   but what we say about it has becom more of a concern   i expect we   ll talk about that a littl later
thank you   presid santomero
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district continu to improv  and busi sen ent has turn more posit   manufactur activ in the region is expand  and forward look sign are posit   the index of general econom activ in novemb from our busi outlook survey was plus     down slight from the octob read of plus      the forward look indic from the survey suggest that product activ should continu to strengthen   although the index of new order and shipment were a bit lower in novemb than they were in octob  they are still at the highest level we   ve seen sinc        firm that make electr machineri  instrument  and metal product were more posit  while firm make lumber product  plastic  and transport were among the more negat   that itself i think is rather interest   anoth posit sign is that more firm are tell us that they plan to increas capit spend in the next six month than were say that earlier this year   and posit capit spend plan are more widespread across sector than we   ve seen in quit some  e  special question in our novemb survey address one of the long term trend affect manufactur and a topic that came up here earlier   name  outsourc and foreign competit   not surpris we found that mani local firm are be affect by global   more than half of the respond report that they had lost domest custom to foreign competitor in the last three year   one fifth of the respond indic that they had outsourc product for support activ to foreign countri   about    percent report that they have increas purchas of import from foreign sourc in the past three year   two third said that their foreign outsourc activ had risen in the past three year as well   this phenomenon is like to continu to affect the manufactur industri in the long run both in our district and in the nation as a whole  retail report that sale pick up fair well in novemb from a weak number in octob   they attribut the weak in octob to unseason warm weather  which discourag sale of winter merchandis   i think this week will solv that problem    laughter  auto dealer report a rebound in sale in novemb  and manufactur increas incent  our retail expect holiday sale to be stronger this year than last  but their forecast for sale growth is in the   to   percent rang  somewhat weaker than the nation number  in a new develop  busi lend in the third district is begin to pick up   we have heard this from a number of sourc and institut of various size   the increas is in middl market compani across a wide rang of industri  and firm are begin to implement expans plan or purchas capit equip for replac need   construct activ maintain the pattern it has shown sinc the recoveri start   residenti construct and home sale continu to show strength  while the commerci real estat market remain soft  the job market in our region continu to outperform that of the nation as a whole   payrol employ in the three state in our district edg up in octob after be flat in the third quarter   the tri state unemploy rate stand at     percent compar with     percent in the nation   so the recoveri continu to build momentum in our district   this improv is be reflect in a more posit mood and sen ent among our busi contact   i would describ them as see the glass half full now rather than half empti  which was the case a year earlier   they are now more will to believ the forecast that econom activ will continu to strengthen next year  turn to the nation scene  econom condit have also improv sinc our last meet   third quarter growth was even stronger than the initi report indic  and fourth quarter growth ought to be quit accept  though not up to the third quarter figur   although signific slack remain in both product and labor market  busi have increas capit spend and have start to hire worker   both busi and consum sen ent have improv   the improv in fundament impli that the economi will expand at a robust rate through next year  i welcom this period of strong growth   core inflat remain subdu  and more rapid growth will help reduc econom slack  put more peopl to work   a year from now  when we look back  i expect we will see the autumn as the inflect point in the recoveri  the point at which it becam self sustain  i agre with the  book that inflationari forc are like to be mute over the forecast period   but i also believ  as other have indic  that the risk of disinfl is subsid substanti at this point   although the level of inflat may be somewhat lower than my target  the current and forecast output growth rate make it much less like that low inflat will creat the kind of zero bound problem we have been concern about   in fact  i believ the risk of inflat move upward over the medium term is now about balanc with the risk of it move downward  a sen ent i   ve heard rather frequent around this room recent   as a matter of fact over the last twenti minut    laughter   the recent and forecast futur depreci of the dollar  higher oil price  and continu growth in raw materi  not to mention higher benefit cost  will all put upward pressur on price go forward   obvious  now is not the  e to chang interest rate   but it is the  e to be particular watch and prepar to counter ani substanti negat chang in inflat or inflat dynam as well as rise inflationari expect   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   as for the district economi  thing look fair good  as appear to be the case elsewher in the countri from the comment we   ve heard so far   base on our servic sector and manufactur survey  activ expand strong in octob   it appear that activ may have slow a littl in novemb  but condit are still veri healthi in the district   factori order and shipment in particular strengthen further  indic some strength in demand in manufactur for the first  e in a while   employ in manufactur is still soft  but the pace of layoff appear to have slow notic recent  includ in the basic manufactur belt in the  ina  where the problem has been center in our district   residenti construct is still veri robust  and for the first  e in a while we are see a few sign of life in nonresidenti construct   one of our director is a member of a reit board   he report recent that absorpt rate in the offic sector have risen in sever area market   anoth director  who own a larg number of so call necess shop center  which are anchor by groceri store  indic that his occup rate have increas recent   like bill pool  we have sever truck compani base in our district   what we   re hear from most of them suggest that shipment are increas in a fair mark way   so condit look fair strong in our district   everi silver line has a touch of gray though  as jerri garcia onc remind us   the good news is that anoth new compani open shop in charlott recent   the bad news is that it busi is help other compani outsourc their activ to india    laughter  on the nation economi  in the spring and summer of this year some of us were needl the staff about be too op ist  they were much more op ist than other forecast   but let the record show that they got it right   at least in term of the broad direct if not all of the detail   the third quarter growth rate in gdp  of cours  exceed even the octob  book project  which at the  e seem to be a veri op ist forecast   earlier  book also had predict that employ would final begin to grow  and it has  if less robust than we might have hope   given the recent improv in busi fix invest and the persist of solid household spend  it seem increas like that this recoveri is go to develop into a balanc expans   the princip risk in the outlook at this point  as i see it at least  is that the output gap may not close soon enough to avert a further fall in inflat   weak wage growth and strong product growth in the third quarter combin to deflat unit labor cost at an annual rate of about   percent   we probabl won   t see anyth like that kind of declin in the current quarter  but the board staff is project a further small declin  and it could be larger than they have forecast  from my standpoint there is just no way to get around the fact that this kind of unit labor cost perform constitut a moder disinfl risk in the outlook  at least for now   i recogn that  with econom activ clear acceler  there is now an upsid inflat risk as well as a downsid disinfl risk   this is clear go to be a t i passag for monetari polici over the cours of the next sever month   but given that we are now at the lower bound of what i   ll call   for lack of a better term   our inflat toler rang  i think we should continu to be concern primarili about prevent a further declin in inflat   we should have ampl  e to react to ani evid of incipi inflat pressur  and i just don   t see such evid at this point
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the fourth district have improv notabl sinc our last meet  as was describ in some detail in our latest beig book report   consum spend and hous remain buoyant  and now a broader mix of busi person are will to express satisfact with their profit and their order book  nevertheless  those i talk to remain cautious about their capit spend plan and are still tentat about hire plan   i get a lot of question from busi peopl in our district about where this     percent growth is occur becaus they just don   t see it   i suspect that the fourth district is go to be one of the laggard as this economywid expans extend into the next year  although the media like to report on the manufactur sector as if it   s some type of one dimension anim  the perform in that sector has been quit mix   certain there are differ among compani due to the manufactur sub industri in which they oper sinc some sub industri are experienc stronger demand than other   defens relat industri is the most obvious exampl   howev  small firm that suppli compon to larger compani are have an extraordinarili difficult  e in the current environ   these small firm typic buy raw materi in world market  and they have no bargain power over the price they pay   their final custom can sourc compon  even custommad part on world market as well  and those custom are forc the compon supplier to compet against one anoth strict on spot price   the result is that the compon supplier are be squeez from both side  an exampl of this in my district was relat to me by a contact whose firm make a varieti of small rubber part   he sell those part to larger compani that are produc automobil  comput  and consum good   one of his custom recent ask him to reduc his price for a compon from       to        if that price request could not be met  the custom said he was go to have to take his busi offshor   my contact couldn   t produc the compon at that price so he went offshor and found a produc who could   he then was abl to sell this part to his custom for      apiec  just slight under the      price request  the part cost my contact      plus      ship  so he   s still make a profit   i find two aspect of this stori noteworthi   the first is that my contact  when ask to reduc his price  thought the product could not be made at that price   but he found that it could be produc offshor with technolog that he didn   t even know exist   he was unawar of the technolog until he visit the shop floor and actual saw that technolog be use   so it wasn   t labor cost that was drive down the price but the technolog be use offshor   the second aspect that i find interest is that mani larg u s  manufactur compani are now depend on inexpens offshor sourc to keep their own product competit   so if there are disrupt in the relat with emerg economi  that is go to help some u s  industri but will hurt mani other  collect these circumst suggest to me that we are still in the process of adjust to the global in trade that is occur and that the adjust process is go to last for some  e   again  i don   t think i will be surpris to learn that this adjust process is alter some of the econom relationship that we have use in the past as guidepost  such as measur of capac and it util   i think it   s clear that intern trade and product pattern have been instrument in drive down price of both good and servic  especi manufactur consum product   cpi good price are still fall and by enough arithmet to hold the overal core rate of inflat at a low level   in fact  as we   ve discuss extens this morn  inflat rate are somewhat lower than various es  of expect inflat  as has been report in the media late  some wall street economist think that we   re tri to communic that we want the inflat rate to move up about     basi point from where it is today   other seem to think that our statement are design simpli to communic someth about the amount of slack that we see remain in the economi through the next year   this confus lead me to want to be a bit cautious about chang our communic signific at this meet   it reinforc to me  though  that we need to be clear about our intent and i am look forward to our discuss next month  which i hope will help us communic more effect to the public in that regard   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   overal for the current quarter econom condit have continu to improv in the ninth district   this improv is attribut primarili to continu strength in residenti real estat market  an uptick in manufactur  a modest increas in consumpt  and an improv agricultur pictur   other sector   includ commerci real estat  mine  and energi   are hold steadi   there are no report of signific increas in price or wage   i   ll have a littl more to say about wage and price in a minut  but first and perhap most import  it appear that labor market have stabil   one of our minnesota director note recent that for the first  e in a number of month none of his contact had plan to decreas job at their compani   he did add  howev  that employ he spoke with were still cautious about hire addit employe  next week we   ll announc the result of our annual ninth district busi survey  preliminari result show that    percent of the respond expect to increas employ at their firm in       wherea    percent plan to reduc job over the come year   if the stori we   re hear from our director are ani indic  some of the job loss will be due to outsourc and the movement of oper oversea  other anecdot inform we   ve receiv late reflect a similar moder op ist tone   for exampl  busi condit in the inform technolog sector are report improv  albeit slowli   and some busi expans was note  includ by a telecommun firm in southwe n wisconsin and a window manufactur in minnesota  agricultur condit appear favor  with a solid grain harvest and high cattl price bring most good news from our agricultur advisori council   a relat rare event  accord to our advis  this good news for agricultur produc is creat posit spillov effect in rural communiti  return to the question of wage and price increas  accord to our recent busi poll  almost    percent of respond expect wage at busi in their communiti to increas between   and   percent   onli   percent of the respond predict that wage will grow   percent or more   at the same  e  respond report signific product increas this year and plan to increas capit invest in        last  more than half the respond predict that price for their product and servic will remain unchang  wherea    percent expect price increas next year  turn to the nation outlook  there are mani indic that the solid expans will continu over the next sever quarter   firm are hire again  payrol employ has increas in each of the past four month  and hour work are up sharpli   initi claim for employ benefit have been general declin  and the unemploy rate has fallen slight   the weak manufactur sector appear to be turn up   while consum spend has slow  data on order and shipment of nondefens capit good indic that last quarter   s rebound in busi spend on equip and softwar is continu into the current quarter  further  residenti construct continu to be quit strong   there are also indic that real growth in foreign economi is pick up  which should improv export  we are op ist about the perform of the real economi next year  but we   re not quit as op ist as the  book   moreov  we see weaker growth in employ and hour work and stronger growth in product next year than the board staff     with respect to inflat  we   re also somewhat less op ist than the  book   we see headlin rate of inflat either unchang or modest higher over the next few quarter   this view is base both on our model and on recent movement in market interest rate   we see core inflat rate remain rough at current level   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we all could agre that the shift in sen ent around the tabl across almost all the district has been one of the more unusu chang in a posit direct that we   ve seen in a veri long  e   i think it provid us with further confirm that we don   t have to rewrit the textbook  at least the standard new keynesian one   in the absenc of downward shock  massiv amount of fiscal and monetari s ulus interact with the natur resili of the economi will boost demand and put the economi on a track on which output is grow fa  than potenti  to my mind the global charact of the strengthen in demand is particular noteworthi in that it suggest a broad base for improv econom condit   we   ve had posit surpris  as   note  almost everywher in the world   even in economi in the euro area that aren   t especi resili and where fiscal polici isn   t that expansionari   to some extent this is a reflect of the strength in the u s  economi  but i think domest demand has pick up in mani countri  respond in part to widespread expansionari monetari polici  and with our exchang rate fall  greater worldwid demand should show through at least to less leakag from u s  product than we might otherwis have expect from strong u s  demand go forward  the upward revis to central tendenc forecast for both output and inflat   and just as import the substanti reduct in the downsid risk around those forecast   should make us consider more confid about the outlook than we were a few month ago  it seem like that the economi will grow rapid enough to begin to erod slack and that inflat will hold near current level instead of move substanti lower  the continu surg in capit spend and the pickup in hire suggest a rebound in busi confid that is unlik to fade quick   in the household sector  hous demand has remain strong even after the earlier rise in long term interest rate   other household spend hasn   t fallen back and may have risen modest further even as the effect of tax rebat check and the earlier surg in mortgag refinanc wear off  privat domest demand for the third quarter was revis up   percentag point  and this revis  sn   t seem to be borrow from the immedi futur   incom data have led the staff to add anoth   percentag point to privat domest demand in the fourth quarter   in financi market  greater confid continu to be reflect in the persist eros of risk premium  especi on lower rate issuer  and in rise equiti price   taken togeth with the fall dollar and stabl treasuri bond rate  these develop indic that financi condit are becom more accommod even as the fa  econom expans take hold  on the inflat front  the declin dollar and stabl inflat expect should provid a counterweight to continu  if erod  output gap to stem the drop of inflat   i agre with the rest of you that the risk of pernici deflat  which never were veri larg  have almost disappear   but in my view some downward risk to the overal outlook for inflat remain   the major unknown is product  where i suspect there is a greater possibl of an upward than a downward surpris relat to the pattern of slow product growth in the staff forecast   fa  product growth  if it is not a consequ of capit deepen  could slow the declin in the output gap and could put further downward pressur on price  especi if it come more quick than anticip increas in worker compens  part for this reason  the shift in the balanc of risk around achiev our object for output and price   not call for a chang in polici ani  e soon in my view   moreov  what hasn   t chang in the unit state is the cost of miss to one side or anoth of these forecast   inflat is low and  as mani of you remark  close to the lower edg of our price stabil comfort zone   and output gap remain sizabl   shortfal from expect for output and price would have a greater deleteri effect on welfar than overshoot  includ an overshoot that result in a small rise in inflat down the road  so we should continu to take our risk on the easi side of polici   but polici is quit easi  quit s ul   we got here by aggress eas to deal with the threat of deflat and the zero bound  and in the unusu circumst that we face last spring and summer  we reinforc that stanc in market expect by our    consider period    terminolog   as the threat reced  we need to be think about whether we have the flexibl to react if upsid risk materi or even if the economi evolv as expect   a zero real fund rate may not be way out of line for a   percent output gap  but it would be unusu to keep the fund rate that low as the output gap is close next year   we can see this in the various version of the taylor rule  which all point to higher rate next year  this was a featur of governor bernank   s present last  e and is even more so in the calcul use updat actual and forecast valu for output and inflat gap   taylor rule are just rough benchmark  and i would not argu that we ought to follow them in ani mechan way   but these result do underlin the question about how we posit ourselv go forward  i look forward to the next part of the meet to a discuss of how in our announc we can acknowledg a shift balanc of risk and begin the process of ensur for ourselv suffici flexibl to react to potenti chang in circumst
thank you  mr  chairman   you   ll find that we   re fair close to the center of graviti in this discuss   let me start with the greater new york region in the second district  where we see grow sign of strength  most notabl in the financi and the busi invest sector   earli result from our forthcom decemb empir survey   i don   t think    empir    refer to the imperi new york fed    laughter  show widespread improv in busi condit   a rise proport of firm   higher than the alreadi high number in novemb   report increas in employ and in the workweek  notabl  the decemb survey show strong expect for higher price paid and receiv six month ahead  the secur industri associ  as you may have read  project that bonus will be up    percent from a year ago   the leader of the financi communiti in new york general express grow confid in the strength of the recoveri  though they cite vari degre of concern about strateg or terror risk  about the caution induc by legal and corpor govern account uncertainti  about the nation   s extern imbal  it fiscal deficit trajectori  and about what one might call a modest eros in the credibl premium that the u s  financi system in some sens has enjoy  for the u s  economi as a whole  we are encourag by the breadth of the strength in recent data and by sign  of cours  that polici work   with consum spend recent strong  the initi sign of growth in employ  the strong respons in capit spend  and low level of inventori  we feel more confid that the foundat have been laid for a sustain expans   our forecast show somewhat less confid in the strength of consumpt and in the pace of employ growth than   the  book  and we show a modest higher negat contribut from the extern sector   but overal  we think the evid support the view that the economi is grow at a reason healthi pace and will do so over the forecast period at a strong enough level to begin to absorb the avail slack  these factor and the initi sign regard price suggest a more balanc inflat outlook   the extent of the remain slack in the economi  the slow pace at which we expect it to be absorb  and the strength of product growth all suggest littl basi for concern that inflat will rise appreci in the come year   yet the dollar   s declin  the run up in commod price  and the rise in some measur of inflat expect suggest that the risk of further declin in key price seri has diminish  it   s import to note that we face a fair degre of uncertainti over mani of the key element of this recoveri   consumpt may deceler more than we anticip  as the forc of tax chang and monetari s ulus fade   the strength of under growth may surpris us still and with that may come more modest job growth   the confid necessari to sustain strong busi invest could still falter   growth in europ and japan still look veri slow  even if the downsid risk have diminish   emerg asia is  of cours  veri strong  and there are better number across most emerg market   but mani emerg economi remain veri vulner  with veri larg balanc sheet exposur  weak institut  and polit system veri open to populist pressur  the scale of dollar reserv accumul and the exchang rate regim that support that demand for dollar seem unlik to be sustain indefinit   the combin of the sheer magnitud of our extern imbal and the size of the gap in potenti growth between the u s  and other major economi will leav us expos to consider risk in financi market  with potenti cliff for the dollar and a sharper rise in interest rate   these risk and the troubl fiscal trajectori mean that monetari polici will carri a greater burden for sustain confid in u s  financi asset   the extent of the declin in credit spread and the magnitud of opportun for the develop of leverag posit combin with the larg scale of the mortgag back market mean that we have to be attent to the risk that will come from a sustain period of low rate and to the forc that will be unleash as it end approach   this requir care attent  though it   s not clear what that realli mean for the polici judgment ahead  on balanc  we see the prospect of stronger real growth and a higher under rate of potenti growth  and we have greater confid about a more benign inflat outlook   we   re approach a point at which we need to consid how to move to a more neutral  less accommod  polici stanc   we will have  e and perhap reason to begin that discuss in the new year  probabl sooner than we had thought would be necessari   i   ll wait for the discuss on polici and our press statement to address those interest question   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   it can be veri frustrat when one   s intuit   not squar with the result of one   s model   colleg footbal has this problem right now    laughter   it should be obvious to everybodi that usc is the best team  but when the model builder tri to develop a system that weigh whom each team beat  the strength of oppon on the schedul  and other variabl  they get the wrong answer   i can see a similar problem come up for us  if not today then fair soon  compar with most of       the economi seem clear to have turn   almost everi forecast is now quit op ist  and for two month the data have consist exceed expect   even friday   s labor report  view as lukewarm  could be interpret as fair strong with the rise of self employ and the rise in hour   and the slight declin in manufactur employ coupl with strong manufactur product impli a sharp rise in industri product   given all this and given my feel that at the previous turn point  novemb       the fomc may have been a bit slow to recogn a downturn  it is import that we stay ahead of the curv   it is way too soon to start rais rate  but it may not be too soon to chang some of our rhetor and even go toward a neutral bias  that   s what my intuit say  as for the model  let me use the output and inflat build block the way the bluebook   in the chart on page      for the output side  the staff forecast show an economi clear point in the right direct   over the next few quarter  growth should proceed at a rate that exceed the trend level  enough to be ul  consist with maximum sustain employ   note the familiar word   there are both upsid and downsid risk  of cours  but overal output risk seem balanc  on the inflat side thing get t ier   my own prefer target rang for core pce inflat  for which i cite my reason in a speech i gave a few week ago  is from   to     percent   by that standard  inflat is now near the bottom of the target rang   will it increas or decreas   on the one side  output gap are larg  impart downward pressur   on the other side  output growth is rapid  impart upward pressur if there are speed limit effect  to compar these pressur  one can first look at histor data   in the earli     s we had almost exact the same situat  larg output gap and rapid growth   inflat definit fell in that episod  as dave   note earlier   anoth place to look is at price   cost margin  these are current veri high  lead to an expect that price growth could be soft   a third place to look is at the staff regress explain price or wage or both   as usual  the staff has lot and lot of regress model   all of them have strong negat gap effect  some have zero speed limit effect  and other have small and general insignific speed limit effect   rapid growth   seem to drive up commod price but not overal price or wage  at least not veri much   the clear verdict here is that output gap impart power downward forc on inflat wherea speed limit impart weak upward forc   this mean that inflat should be more like to declin than to rise   this  by the way  is essenti the argument that the wall street journal this morn critic governor   and bernank for make   if the wall street journal editori page critic an argument  there must be some merit to it    laughter  sinc core inflat is alreadi near the bottom of my prefer rang and is more like to drop than increas  that should show up as a negat bias for the inflat term   a negat for inflat and a neutral for output should lead to an overal negat   but my intuit suggest that the overal bias should be neutral   that   s the differ between intuit and model  how to resolv this   one possibl  as dave mention earlier  involv some of the upsid risk on inflat coupl with the foreign exchang risk that we mention and the oil price risk the chairman mention   anoth possibl is that  although the inflat bias is still negat  it is move toward neutral  as is the overal bias   whatev the case  i think we ought to start prepar the world
mr  chairman  the tenth district economi is similar to the district economi other have describ in that it continu to expand and has done so fair clear sinc our last meet   busi are show some real confid that the recoveri now is go to sustain itself  let me talk just a minut about region develop   our labor market have inde firm sinc our last meet   accord to the payrol data  employ rose in octob for the second month in a row   moreov  layoff announc have subsid  and hire announc have pick up  suggest that job growth will continu to strengthen further in the come month   manufactur activ also has expand   product and new order rose strong dure the last two month  and expect for futur activ have move higher  employ is no longer fall  and for the first  e sinc the slump began  firm in manufactur appear will to hire addit worker to meet anticip increas in demand  capit spend also continu to improv  with consider more firm plan to increas than to reduc invest in the come month   consum spend look solid despit reduc s ulus from the tax rebat and the slowdown in mortgag refinanc activ  anecdot report suggest that the holiday season has gotten off to a good start in our area  particular in the east side of the region  with store feel less need to discount merchandis this year than last year   travel and tourism are also do well  with convent activ continu strong and ski book in the we n part of our district run quit high  hous activ remain robust   and though commerci real estat is still in a slump  we   re begin to hear that the bottom has been reach  at least in the view of our local develop  energi activ remain strong  with respect to inflat  wage pressur are still minim  but price pressur have increas slight   manufactur not onli expect substanti increas in raw materi price in the next few month but also anticip have somewhat more success in pass the cost increas on to the custom   that   s the anecdot comment we   re receiv from them   in agricultur  incom are up   they were adjust up anoth   percent in novemb   the onli fli in the ointment is some of the upset inform relat to china   that has affect our agricultur outlook to a small degre  let me turn to the nation economi   to repeat what mani other have said  recent indic have been strong and more so than general expect   as a result  mani peopl have revis upward their forecast for growth in        overal  i expect growth to be in the    to     percent rang in      and stronger than that   mayb    to   percent in        obvious my forecast is lower than the  book   s but somewhat higher than the decemb blue chip number that came in at just under   percent   the reason for the strong outlook are the same as they have been for some  e   accommod monetari polici  s ul financi condit  cumul effect of fiscal polici  and strong product   in addit to these  i would add strong forward momentum and improv busi confid as import factor  moreov  employ is final rise  and the unemploy rate is fall   we also are see more sign of recoveri in capit spend on a nation level  as i   ve heard around the tabl   the growth in profit and busi fix invest seen in the last quarter along with strong order and shipment of nondefens capit good suggest that the recoveri will continu to improv as we move forward  while there are risk to the outlook  i think they are probabl balanc now or on the upsid  depend on one   s definit of upsid   at the last meet i felt  as did other  that there was a fair amount of uncertainti with regard to capit spend and employ   while risk in those area perhap remain  they are clear much smaller today than just a short  e ago at our last meet   in addit  the upsid surpris we have been see may continu as the recoveri gain momentum  let me turn to the inflat outlook   i take the view that inflat will rise  but i agre with those who say it is like to increas onli slight  perhap by   point in      and        i would add that  while i think the argument that the output gap will tend to hold inflat down is a fair one  i believ the high accommod stanc of monetari polici in an acceler economi balanc out those deflationari risk   as it settl out for me  mr  chairman  i would suggest that at worst the output risk are balanc   i think the inflat risk are also balanc  in my view we realli do need to reconsid the last sentenc of our statement   i think we can chang the languag   and perhap at this meet   in a way that move us more toward neutral  with balanc risk assess  without necessarili upset the market or the mainstream  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   a few month ago the nation embark on an import and interest experi in macroeconom   most of us had confid that the s ul polici be put in place would have the desir effect  but the  e and the magnitud of that effect were a bit uncertain   the question was how s ul the set of fiscal and monetari polici chang might actual be   the answer today  as mani of you have alreadi said  is that the combin of histor low interest rate  the home refinanc boom  and this summer   s tax cut   seem to have succeed even better than earlier expect   the incom data sinc the last meet clear indic that household consumpt and residenti invest have remain robust   import  i think the data indic that the particip of the busi sector through busi fix invest is also start to becom firmer   in short  as i think the consensus has emerg here  the turnaround seem relat firm entrench  the  book take on board the strength of the incom data by rais the forecast for the next year  and i must say that i find the baselin forecast accept   while i suppos there is still a slight possibl of growth stall out  that prospect is certain much less palpabl than just a few month ago and seem to reced with almost everi data releas  with the growth forecast seem reason  the major question appear to be the risk around the baselin inflat outlook  given the alreadi low level of inflat and the size of the pool of underutil resourc   i must admit that i conced  as do other  that there are both upsid and downsid risk around the baselin inflat outlook in the  book   on the upsid  the risk is that the economi will heat up and interest rate will remain inappropri accommod for a littl too long  allow inflat expect to build as in one of the altern scenario in the  book   that scenario is not complet without valid  inflat compens has tick up recent  though the reason  as we discuss earlier  may be subject to some question   and labor compens may well have to play catch up if you will  given the fact that wage have lag the increas in product for sever quarter now  on the downsid  howev  there is some risk that inflat might soften even further from this point   while there is some valid for the upsid risk  i would say that in fact the downsid scenario still carri slight more weight   now  we may have underes  the degre to which trend product has increas and overes  the willing of busi to hire new worker   but the ambigu  shall we say  of the relat weak of the most recent employ report compar with both expect and with earlier report suggest that we cannot discount this prospect complet   the steadi eros of unit labor cost  which presid broaddus refer to earlier  and the rise in the markup over unit labor cost also give some further weight to concern about the downsid risk   moreov  recent research has shown that  as inflat has been brought down over the past two decad  the sensit of price to the level of resourc util has also fallen   consequ  i think the fa  structur product growth scenario in the  book deserv some attent from this committe  all in all  recogn that the inflat call is much more balanc now than it was even a littl while ago and that the risk of a pernici downward spiral seem to have been remov complet  i would still put admit margin greater weight on the downsid inflat risk  given the low level of inflat  i hope that when we get to the polici discuss we can give some due regard to the balanc of risk in this key area  final  sinc a few have alreadi rais the question of the last sentenc of our statement  i will say that my prefer is to move away from it gradual   as i   ve tri to convey in a coupl of other meet  i think perhap the best way to do that at this stage is to make it much more condit and much more close tie to econom realiti as oppos to just to the passag of  e   i won   t go ani further into that topic  but i thank you all for your attent
i   d like to bring up two point that larg haven   t been talk about here  the first involv fiscal polici issu   i   m sure you   ve notic that the govern is be fund at the moment on a continu resolut   the hous ye day pass an omnibus budget bill that i think is total consist with  book expect of what that bill would includ   the senat undoubt will not pass a budget bill this year   the signific of that is that  for the congress  the presidenti elect year start the first day follow their return after the recess   it will be interest to see the extent to which budget issu are dealt with  i have some concern about it  the hope sign from my perspect is that for the first  e sinc septemb           we are see some concern about fiscal disciplin   you may have notic that the bill pass ye day had almost as mani republican vote against it as democrat vote for it   i think this countri receiv a free pass for a period of  e post   septemb     dure which it did not need to maintain the same fiscal disciplin that it did for almost the entir decad of the      s   i can   t help but believ that some of the concern about the dollar from foreign investor reflect the seem lack of concern for fiscal respons  particular when one consid that the most signific legisl accomplish of this congress will have almost no budget implic until        so while i don   t see anyth resembl a return to the pay go spend restrict in this congress  it seem to me that at least it will be a campaign issu for the first  e sinc the year        i hope so anyway  with respect to how the bank industri has respond in light of the improv econom perform  you may have notic that the third quarter result indic a signific improv in bank industri profit   but it   s a differ mix even from six month ago   six month ago the improv profit pictur was base on fee incom and secur transact   it is larg this  e a result of improv asset qualiti   in fact  there was no need for loan loss provis that would indic ani weak in asset qualiti   i think this support what dino suggest also   that we are see veri strong asset qualiti   this mean two thing to me   first  the fact that we have not seen ani growth yet in commerci lend mean that there is still a signific amount of firepow in the bank industri to fund a continu expans   second  to the extent that there   s a tighten in credit standard  it has noth to do with the avail of fund   i think those are two import point   we do not hear from banker the same concern now that the economi is not turn around   there is clear anecdot evid that it is  but that hasn   t result in increas loan demand up to this point
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom news sinc our last meet has been hearten   the odd that we have begun a strong and sustain expans have risen signific   becaus of the rise in growth  we   re go to see even more op ed articl  wire stori  and editori opin that the fed need to tighten soon to avoid a repeat of     s style inflat   the wall street journal today has an editori along those line   i believ these critic are not particular well inform and that  as a committe  we should continu to remain patient and not choke off growth unnecessarili   in particular  though of cours we have to be vigil to detect ani chang in the inflat trend  the odd of inflat rise signific ani  e soon from it current veri low level seem small  let me make a few point   first  those on the street and elsewher who late have been worri about inflat have tend to point primarili to raw materi price  which have been rise  and to the dollar  which has been fall   here i will larg reiter some thing that dave   said   the board staff   s monday brief  which i believ has been post electron  debunk the import of the raw materi argument quit convinc in my view   the brief includ a graph of the histor data  which show that even veri larg movement of raw materi price   which are quit common by the way   appear to have mute effect on intermedi good price and  most import  no discern effect at all on final good inflat   presum this lack of inflationari impact reflect the fact that raw materi are onli a small part of total cost   as anoth figur in the brief show  unit labor cost    which  of cours  have been fall rapid as product has surg and wage growth has slow   are far more import in inflat determin than are materi price  an analysi similar to that for raw materi would appli to the dollar   as we   ve been see  larg movement of the dollar against major currenc tend to translat into smaller movement against the u s  trade weight basket of currenc and into still smaller effect on import price becaus of imperfect pass through   nonoil import price  in turn  are a relat modest part of the overal price index   in short  the ul  effect of the dollar depreci of the magnitud we have seen on broad measur of core inflat is like to be quit small inde  i note the key role of unit labor cost in inflat   of cours  unit labor cost will not continu to fall at the recent rate   inde  as employ pick up  product growth in particular will slow mark   critic may point to this declin in product growth as anoth incipi sourc of inflationari pressur   i would just note that this prospect product declin is fulli incorpor in the  book forecast that we have befor us   in particular  the  book forecast assum that product growth will fall signific below trend in      and      as employ pick up  specif to     percent in      and to onli     percent in        given recent experi  it seem entir possibl that these assumpt are conserv and that product growth  though deceler  will nevertheless be higher than what the staff has assum for the next two year   if so  that would tend to increas the risk of further disinfl  final  although output gap are of cours veri hard to measur  the weight of the evid continu to support those who believ that consider slack remain in the economi  let me give one bit of evid on this point   the recent new york  e articl by chicago economist austan goolsbe argu that the rise in the unemploy rate in the past two year underst the degre of labor market weak   the reason is that today a larg percentag of job loser  a greater fraction than in the past  simpli withdraw from the labor forc  for exampl  to appli for social secur disabl benefit   i look at data on the ratio of employ to the work age popul  which combin inform on both unemploy and labor forc particip and found that they confirm this general observ   between it peak in april      and it trough this past septemb  the employ to popul ratio fell     percentag point   with the strong gain in the household survey of the past two month  the net declin in the employ to popul ratio sinc      is still     percentag point   for comparison  the combin of the      and         recess  dure which the unemploy rate peak near    percent  produc a peak to trough move in this ratio between septemb      and februari      of     percentag point   the declin attribut to the         recess alon from it local peak in april       until februari       was     percentag point   so on this particular metric   and of cours it   s onli one metric   the deterior of the labor market from      until now is compar to what occur dure the deep         recess   for comparison  the movement in the employ to popul ratio from it peak to it trough dure the         recess period was     percentag point  possibl the extent of the recent declin is exagger becaus employ was unsustain high in      and        howev  even relat to a more neutral benchmark of   percent unemploy and a particip rate at it long run trend  current household employ   the more op ist of the survey   remain some     million job below normal  that number fulli incorpor the rise in self employ about which much has been made  on balanc  the larg declin in the share of the popul that is work suggest that employ can rise signific befor we see pressur on wage and unit labor cost  to summar  vigil on inflat is absolut essenti   i do not disagre with that one bit   but we should not overreact to purport sign of inflat that are in realiti no such thing   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet the news about econom growth  as mani peopl around the tabl have alreadi said  is much stronger   one point i   d note is that i   m veri happi to see that growth is more balanc in term of come from more sourc   it is no longer reli total on consum spend  busi capit invest has resum   we continu to be amaz that inventori are still fall  which leav room for further expans as inventori get rebuilt to suppli sale growth   moreov  the intern economi is pick up and should support some modest expans of export   as busi spend continu to grow  more worker will also be ad to payrol   that will support consumpt and to some extent offset the lower impetus from tax cut and mortgag refinanc in the futur  when i look at the risk with regard to econom growth   if the risk is assess just on the growth rate   i   d say the risk is on the upsid   howev  if we look at the economi   s perform relat to the level of potenti output  the gap is signific   as mani peopl have alreadi mention  the es  of the output gap is veri hard to come by   in the  book forecast we see that unemploy continu to run relat high  and we   re assum   percent as full employ from a nairu perspect   howev  as dave   alreadi mention  the standard deviat is   percentag point on this unemploy rate   mani of us rememb that in the late      s unemploy got well below   percent without ani inflat pressur  after talk to human resourc execut at sever corpor about the way they manag peopl today  i also am op ist that wage pressur will continu to be more mute than they might have been in the past   busi today have much more flexibl in the way they manag human resourc   manag tend to compens peopl more through the use of incent pay so that employe earn more money either as product target are met or as revenu come in through sale commiss   busi accept the practic of outsourc and contract employ so that function that are not core to the organ are now contract out to other organ that have much more product and effect in handl those particular function and can do the work at a much lower cost   compani continu look throughout the organ for such opportun whether sale are up or down   improv in technolog now allow servic and busi to be suppli by access labor resourc intern so that we   re no longer confin to u s  worker even for servic   all these mitig factor lead me  look forward  not to be so concern about the impact of compens as a forc to drive up inflat in the short run  the except larg jump in product that we saw in the third quarter is not like to be sustain  especi as grow busi confid lead to new hire   howev  becaus of the factor abov  i think the pace of product growth may well continu to run abov histor high level   like governor    i believ that product growth may not slow as much as in the  book baselin forecast   corpor profit in the third quarter were signific higher than they have been recent   in fact  the profit were back to level record in quarter of the boom year   interest  the consensus forecast for corpor profit for all of      is run at twice the level that was expect at the begin of this year  what about inflat   inflat   appear to be turn up  but it remain at veri low level   the  book continu to forecast that core inflat will be in the low   percent rang for the next two year   nevertheless  as dave comment in respons to presid pianalto   s question  the probabl of inflat get into that danger zone of under    percent is still run at   in    which i consid to be a signific risk of unwelcom inflat with substanti cost to the economi  the market and privat economist have differ forecast from the one in the  book   the outsid forecast tend to have much lower growth and much higher inflat  but it   s interest to compar today   s blue chip forecast for      with the blue chip consensus at the begin of the year   the project for real gdp growth has move up    basi point  and the expect for inflat have move down    basi point   closer to what the  book is show for
thank you veri much     madigan  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that is be distribut now   financi market were subject to two strong crosscurr over the intermeet period  general robust econom data and policymak    statement emphas that polici could remain accommod for a long  e   as of the close of the bluebook on thursday even  the econom data had predomin   although market particip saw no chanc of polici tighten at this meet  a major thought that  in view of evid that the economi has turn the corner  you would modifi or drop the    consider period    sentenc today to begin lay the groundwork for an eventu move away from accommod   as shown in the top left hand panel of exhibit    the expect path of the feder fund rate es  from futur market quot  the blue line  had steepen a littl relat to that prevail at the previous meet  the red line    the top right hand panel show that yield on treasuri coupon issu were up    to    basi point for the period   howev  friday   s employ data prove disappoint to trader  and the pictur in financi market has chang notic as a result   treasuri yield now are about unchang to up sever basi point for the period   the expect path of the fund rate over the next eighteen month  the red line in the left hand panel  has tilt down a touch   it trajectori remain notabl flat for the next few month  testifi to the efficaci of your statement in anchor near term expect  inde  as indic by the probabl distribut in the bottom left hand panel  market see good odd that the target fund rate will still be at   percent around midyear   still  the five bar to the right of   percent indic that market place consider weight on a tighten over the next six month       the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     much of the market debat on monetari polici over the past six week has focus on just when this firm process will begin and  especi  on how you will adjust the statement in advanc of that tighten   as shown in the bottom right hand panel  about half the primari dealer now expect you to modifi or drop the    consider period    languag at this meet   that fraction was notic larger befor friday  but the employ data prompt some to revis their predict  onli a few anticip ani chang in your individu risk assess at this meet  and five of the twenti two expect you to shift to an indic that  overal  the risk are balanc   the bluebook similar devot much attent to altern balanc of risk assess and    consider period    statement   by the way  as note in the top panel of your next exhibit  the bluebook also discuss two polici altern   an unchang stanc of polici and a    basi point eas   our decis to includ some discuss of eas was motiv part by the committe   s exist risk assess and    consider period    languag   support for that altern came as well from the staff   s project that an output gap would persist over the next year and that  as a consequ  inflat would tend to edg down further from an alreadi low level   from one perspect  a case could also have been made for consider of a tighten   aggreg demand has heat up  the real fund rate appear to be below it longer run equilibrium  and in the  book  the next polici move is the first in a sequenc of tighten   nonetheless  we didn   t discuss the pros and con of polici firm at this meet becaus ani near term move in that direct would seem complet out of sync with both the exist balanc of risk statement and the fomc   s indic that polici can remain accommod for a consider period   inde  judg by your comment so far at this meet  the issu on the tabl today would appear to be not what to do but what to say in the rational paragraph of your announc  in your risk assess  and in the    consider period    sentenc   the main chang to the rational paragraph  outlin in the top right panel  presum would be to updat the analysi to reflect the recent data   for exampl  by character the expans as now    brisk     or someth along those line  rather than as    firm     and perhap by describ the labor market as    improv modest    rather than as    stabil      the balanc of risk assess  howev  is consider more complic   to help address this issu  the middl panel repeat tabl   from the bluebook   the two column present what would appear to be the plausibl choic for the balanc of risk on inflat   the risk of unwelcom further disinfl and balanc risk   the two row refer to balanc risk to sustain econom growth and upsid growth risk   as   note at your last meet  the committe   s current communic structur give it plenti of toggl switch  and those row and column  togeth with the numer entri in the tabl  plus some less plausibl choic that have been omit  reflect that multitud of option   begin with the current configur  indic in the top left hand cell  the committe could choos to retain it assess that the risk to sustain growth are balanc  that the risk to inflat are weight toward an unwelcom fall  and that a declin in inflat is the predomin concern   this assess would seem especi warrant if the committe interpret the phrase    sustain econom growth    as allow for expans for a  e at a rate abov potenti   an outcom that recent data seem to be suggest   so long as growth is expect to moder to a pace that would eventu bring the level of output into line with that of potenti   in this case  the like persist of an output gap for sever more quarter even in the context of abov trend growth   and the possibl that product could continu to come in abov expect   would seem consist with downsid inflat risk   with these individu risk  the committe presum would again indic that the risk are weight toward an unwelcom declin in inflat  although it could also assess the risk as about balanc if it saw the downsid inflat risk  while still present  as have diminish substanti   you might instead view the risk to inflat as now balanc   although you might project that an output gap could well persist for some  e  tend to tilt inflat down  you might also now see some upsid risk   these upsid risk could stem from a varieti of sourc  includ the possibl of speed effect caus by strong econom growth  inflat expect that may have edg up   at least as infer from financi market   dollar depreci  or even econom growth that could turn out to be rapid enough to push the level of output abov it potenti in the forese futur   as shown in the upper right hand cell  the combin of judgment that inflat risk as well as growth risk are now balanc presum would be accompani by an assess that the overal risk have been equal   the bottom two cell pertain to case in which the committe judg that the risk to the attain of sustain growth have shift to the upsid   this assess might be appropri if the committe see a strong chanc that the econom advanc will remain rapid for a while and would be especi consist with an interpret of    sustain econom growth    as strict denot growth at the same rate as that of potenti output   even with this apprais of output risk  the committe could still see the risk to inflat as weight to the downsid in view of the like effect of the output gap  as note in the bottom left cell   with these two compon judgment  the committe would like conclud either that the overal risk are balanc or that undesir low inflat remain the predomin concern  the choic between those two conclus would depend on the committe   s assess of the relat probabl as well as the relat cost of the various possibl outcom   in particular  the committe might feel that the risk are still predomin to the downsid if it saw the potenti econom cost associ with signific further disinfl as especi acut   but if the committe saw the downsid inflat risk as now smaller  it might view the overal risk as balanc  as note in the bluebook  a third net assess   that unsustain rapid growth is now the main concern   would also be a logic possibl in this cell   but it seem unlik that the committe would make such a sharp chang in it assess of the overal risk while make no chang to the risk to inflat   the final set of choic  shown in the bottom right hand cell  would aris if the committe conclud that the risk to growth had move to the upsid and that the inflat risk were now balanc   particular if the committe had arriv at this judgment part becaus it interpret    sustain econom growth    as the growth rate of potenti  then it might gaug the overal risk as balanc  that   s becaus the expans of output at a pace abov potenti would presum not involv ani signific econom cost as long as the level of output remain at or below that of potenti   howev  if the committe had conclud that the risk to growth were to the upsid even use a more liber definit of sustain expans  then it might also see the overal risk as skew to the upsid   as note just below the tabl  the committe could also choos to qualifi ani of it judgment about the risk   for exampl  by indic that the risk to inflat are now onli margin to the downsid   particular if the committe saw one of the compon risk as just slight out of kilter  there are case in which gaug the overal risk would seem to involv excess hair split   if so  you might see advantag in refrain from character the overal balanc of risk  let the individu assess in the context of the overal announc convey your sens of the risk   in that regard  your treatment of the    consider period    sentenc will be key in term of the market reaction   some option for this decis are outlin in the final panel   obvious  retent of the sentenc is one option   it would seem to be warrant if you saw a reason high likelihood that the stanc of polici could be left unchang for some  e   repeat it might seem particular appropri if you were fair confid that market have built in a steeper trajectori for the fund rate than will prove necessari   howev  you might be inclin to modifi or delet the sentenc for ani of sever reason   you might be uncomfort as a matter of principl with a polici precommit  particular one that seem tie simpli to the passag of  e rather than to econom develop   altern  you might feel  at a more practic level  that the statement has serv it purpos but is no longer necessari   or in view of the recent econom data and the relat low real feder fund rate  you might think that the  e at which polici might need to start move toward neutral is draw closer   a rang of possibl modif to the sentenc in question also could be consid by the committe  with the intent that the sentenc could be further adjust in the futur and eventu drop   one approach would be simpli to vari the word slight  say  by substitut    for a while    instead of    for a consider period      even such a slight chang would be read in the market as signific  anoth option is to explain whi polici accommod can be maintain by incorpor a prefac to the sentenc      with inflat quit low and resourc use slack     etc   a similar approach would be to declar that  in view of the substanti slack and low inflat  the committe can be patient in adjust the stanc of polici   these formul would hint not onli that polici tighten need not start soon but also that it could be implement at a measur pace when it   begin  still anoth approach would be to condit the mainten of polici accommod not on the passag of  e but on econom develop  such as a substanti reduct in disinflationari risk   a final option would be just to drop the sentenc   as i mention abov  the committe now has sever dimens along which it can adjust the communic of it monetari polici intent   becaus of this complex  predict the market respons to ani particular configur has becom even more difficult   nonetheless  the    consider period    sentenc probabl is key   given current market expect  interest rate like would tend to fall somewhat in respons to combin that leav that sentenc more or less in place  although that effect could be offset at least part by other chang to the announc   but drop or signific modifi the    consider period    sentenc at this  e could prompt a notic sell off in fix incom and equiti market
i think i   m speak for most of us when i say that i hope this tabl  sn   t get more complic than it is    laughter
you haven   t seen the three dimension one yet
no  i haven   t  and i don   t want to
those who particip in draft the bluebook would share that view
further comment or question   if not  let me get start  it   s fair evid that the economi is at a turn point by virtual all the measur that we have   histor  it has almost invari been the case that the feder reserv would tighten under such condit   inde  preemption is someth that has filter it way into the monetari polici lexicon   the issu of preemption impli  of cours  that we will adjust our polici ahead of anyth that we can readili forese   in current circumst  therefor  there is and there will continu to be a lot of pressur on us to move rate higher   we have resist becaus of a quit consider and signific differ in the present economi from what we have observ in the past  in recent decad  the turn point toward acceler econom activ usual occur when the inflat rate was   percent or   percent  some  even higher  and the necess for preemption was critic obvious   the problem with preemption  though it is someth that is veri interest to observ in retrospect  is that it  sn   t necessarili follow that we are preempt futur develop that will actual occur the way we expect   so  we have to be care not to tri to preempt someth that is not fair like to happen  there is a risk and inde a cost to be wrong   the risk was one that we were will to take in earlier year becaus the econom outlook was such that we could not realli afford not to be preemptiv  even if we recogn that we might misread a turn point and act prematur  with clear negat effect  the market obvious are presum that the earlier sort of paradigm is current what is in place   it is not   it is not becaus we are at a veri low inflat rate    percent or thereabout  and the output gap  howev one measur it  is quit sizabl   as a consequ  what we have been tri to communic to the market is that we don   t wish to take the risk of preemption when we don   t have to   that is what induc us awhil back to put a refer to a    consider period    in our statement to underscor the fact that we are in a differ type of period   it   s veri evid that our effort to communic that messag succeed   we succeed in the sens that the basic tilt of the yield curv is reason consist with the presumpt that we will not adjust polici right away or that we need to move right away   leav asid the issu associ with the five to ten year inflat compens measur that we were discuss earlier  there   s veri littl evid that the market are price in a buildup in long term inflat expect  consequ  i think we may reason conclud that the market believ us   in al broaddus   s term  we clear have    credibl    in this regard  and it   s veri import that we not squander it  the reason i say that is that we took a risk with the insert of our refer to a    consider period     not a risk so far as econom polici or monetari polici were concern but a risk that what we said could signific erod the credibl of this institut  with negat effect   that did not happen  we chose to take that risk rather than to take preemptiv action that could have been a mistak   as a consequ  we are now in a posit where we have to figur out how we should gradual move away from our statement regard a    consider period      it   s fair appar that for a central bank to forecast how long it is not apt to move is a mistak  of which we are all awar  in my judgment  what we have to do at this stage realli rest on how best to disengag ourselv from this problem with minim negat effect and  i hope  major posit effect   in this regard i   m inclin to the view  but i   m not certain  that if we use    consider period    this  e we can chang almost anyth els in the statement without fo  ani advers impact  inde  that   s what i would suggest that we do   i do not deni that the most like outcom is that inflat will continu to reced   the problem in act on that belief  howev  is that if we are wrong the consequ will be quit negat  to say the least   the chanc of be wrong are there   i don   t think they repres the major probabl  but as we were discuss earlier there are larg varianc among some of the equat that link the output gap and inflat   we also discuss the fact that this phenomenon is veri difficult to filter out in other economi  moreov  we have the problem of take a regress analysi larg base on period with an inflat rang of perhap   to    percent and extrapol that regress linear to below   percent and presum that we are get the same interact   so  not have past observ of how this augment phillip curv function at this low inflat level  we   re just make an extrapol  and it could be wrong   if it is wrong in the context of an economi that is acceler rapid and a marketplac that is get fair jitteri  the cost to the stabil of the market are in my view potenti too high  therefor  my general view and approach here is to presum that the inflat risk are close to balanc  what that   for us  if we also have balanc with respect to growth and retain the word    for a consider period     is to give us the flexibl to do sever thing   for one  if our statement regard balanc inflat risk turn out to be incorrect and the rate of inflat continu to fall  it  sn   t cost us veri much   we can veri readili move rate lower if necessari in the context of a statement refer to a    consider period      moreov  my propos would also put us in a posit where we may be abl in januari to chang the refer from    consider period    to some concept of    patienc    or the    abil to have patienc      in turn  that would provid us with the flexibl to move  possibl as earli as march if we have to but certain by may  in ani event  so long as we have a refer to either    consider period    or    patienc    in our statement  we will have the capabl of move the fund rate lower   in my judgment  put out a statement that essenti captur that capabl give us  as far as i can see  the maximum flexibl that we can achiev at this point   it also give us an exit strategi that put us in a posit where we can be adjust our polici   one need to rememb that the current feder fund rate is well below ani es  of the equilibrium rate   that is  when we start to rais the rate  we may have the problem of have to return to the equilibrium rate relat quick   as mani of you have mention  a quick adjust in the rate structur at this stage could destabil a number of the element in our forecast   we will want to move as moder as we can in the process of return to a neutral posit at a point when the output gap is declin but still there   obvious  we can   t wait until the gap close to begin to move becaus financi market may be adjust well in advanc of that   expect of grow pressur will be there  we also have to bear in mind that our es  of the output gap is not all that clear cut   fifti year ago we had no difficulti know what capac was in a lot of industri  open hearth furnac produc a certain amount of steel  and the chemistri prevent them from do veri much els until steel manufactur start put in oxygen lanc and eventu go to oxygen furnac   assembl line for motor vehicl involv veri rigid system a half centuri ago   now  manufactur use batch process  and consequ the notion of what is capac is an increas flexibl concept   but in order to generat an output gap we need a point es  of capac  and that   s what we use   as a result  there   s a question as to whether the gap mean the same thing today that it meant twenti year ago   i think not   i believ the potenti varianc of that measur has increas consider  and i think we have to take that into account  my bottom line in all of this is that i would recommend that we not move the fund rate and that we communic in our announc someth similar to the type of risk balanc i   ve just mention for growth and inflat   let me read a way of do this   it   s onli five line      the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal   the probabl of an unwelcom fall in inflat has diminish in recent month and now appear almost equal to that of a rise in inflat   howev  with inflat quit low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period      you will observ that the previous statement of balanc for growth and inflat combin is not in here and that the    consider period    refer is employ in lieu of that and i think for appropri reason  so that   s my recommend  who would like to comment
well  i support the recommend   as i said  i have a hard  e get the right flavor  given the logic of the tabl that   has in exhibit     my logic is that we are in the northwest and we want to get to the northeast  or from low inflat as the predomin concern to a balanc inflat risk assess   i think the statement you propos migrat us over   i   m not so sure it   s a bad idea   it might be a good idea   to get rid of that overal balanc of risk statement when it becom veri awkward  and this meet may be one of those  e   so i think your recommend has all of these element  and i support it
at the end of the earlier discuss i was go to say that the polici decis continu to be a    no brainer    but that what we say about polici has becom a headach   i   m not sure about the no brainer part anymor  but i am sure about the headach   i agre with you that we don   t want to move polici now   i think the uptick in the economi is just begin to be sustain on it own without an excess amount of polici s ulus  and i   d like to see that play out   whatev we do in the futur  i agre with presid guynn that  when we do decid to move  the risk inher in rais rate in larg step earli on are quit sizabl  so i think we ought to be will to begin earlier in order to move the fund rate up slowli when we do begin to tighten  when one think of the number of what might be call    move part    we now are deal with in our statement  as discuss in     s present and in the bluebook  the complex is realli quit stun   we   re not look at a   by   matrix   there are some extra dimens of this that are beyond my capabl to describ correct in mathemat term   as far as i can tell  someth like six or seven move part are involv   they includ what we did  whi we did it  where the risk are on growth  what we mean by sustain growth  what the risk are on inflat  the balanc of the risk  and now the    consider period    languag  there can be a number of variat on those six or seven move part  and that profus is multipli and increas the headach associ with how to talk about our polici decis  i agre with the thrust of your recommend  mr  chairman  which is to reduc the number of move part   i   m not sure i would have start with the refer to the balanc of risk   my prefer as a place to start would be with the    consider period    sentenc   by modifi it or even take it out   as a central banker i am grow more and more concern that we   re in a veri difficult place with that languag   presid     s remark on the credibl within financi market at a  e of a declin valu of the dollar and other develop suggest to me that we should start to look a bit more conserv than we have been   even recogn that the evid point to a wide output gap   that said  i am happi you are will to start modifi this languag and reduc the number of move part   i think the step toward modifi it could be taken fa  than you   ve outlin  but i am will to go along with your propos at this  e
mr  chairman  i think your propos is an excel one   i veri much like the fact that you   ve narrow the balanc of risk on unwelcom disinfl versus inflat   i think that   s desir   i like drop the overal balanc of risk statement  and i particular like condit the    consider period    of  e phrase at the end of the statement   i think put in the addit word     with inflat quit low and resourc use slack     is an excel way to condit it   i assum  although you didn   t mention it  that you will also be suggest some chang in the rational paragraph in term of what we say about the labor market
yes   let me just quick read that paragraph   it   s veri short      the committe continu to believ that an accommod stanc of monetari polici  coupl with robust under growth in product  is provid import ongo support to econom activ   the evid accumul over the intermeet period confirm that output is expand brisk  and the labor market appear to be improv modest   increas in core consum price are mute and expect to remain low
i think that   s veri good   i spent a lot of  e tri to figur out how we were go to get out of this dilemma we have with the languag and what the word should be   i think you   ve captur our assess of the situat veri  veri well
thank you  mr  chairman   the way i tend to approach this is that i want to be veri clear in my own mind about what i believ befor i tri to talk about how to communic it   so let me start with what i believ  i think that the inflat risk are balanc and that the output risk are balanc   i believ there is a lot of room for the economi to grow   i don   t think we   re like to press upon ani speed limit issu  and in my view even veri robust growth is not like to caus imbal that are go to get us into troubl   so in that sens i think we could have output growth signific abov   i hope not below   the  book forecast without caus problem  i realiz that a lot of peopl are concern about the zero bound issu  although as i think most of you know my person inflat target is perhap at the bottom of the rang deem desir by committe as a whole   at ani rate  for those concern about the zero bound  i think that issu is go to aris primarili in an economi that is weaken   one that need the support provid by push real interest rate down below zero   that  sn   t seem to be the prospect   therefor  if in the next year the inflat rate stay below what one would like as a long run target  it seem to me that it   s veri unlik to caus ani problem in an economi that is grow robust   in my view  there is some risk that inflat could run abov the rate in the  book forecast  and that could caus us a lot of pain   i think that could be a difficult situat to deal with  i agre that this is not the right  e to start rais rate   when i walk in here my view was to tri to chang the statement along the follow line   in the paragraph review our assess of the current situat  i would say that the inflat risk are balanc and that the output risk are balanc   in that case we wouldn   t need to indic which is the predomin concern  we could just elimin that sentenc altogeth   i   d also delet the    consider period    sentenc altogeth   make the statement a veri lean and spare one   understand that remov that sentenc probabl would produc a negat reaction in the market this afternoon   but peopl would get over that   then we   d have a chanc to explain at greater length what is realli involv here   that this is not a typic recoveri period becaus we are start with such a low rate of inflat and there is no immedi need  given what we now know  for a polici respons   that would get rid of the problem all at onc  and we would not have to deal with it again   we   re go to have to deal with it again as long as we leav that phrase    consider period    in the statement   so i think this might be a good  e just to be done with it  which is the posit i had when i walk in   thank you
i think it would be a mistak to drop that languag entir   in my view make it condit is the right way to proceed  and i support your recommend
mr  chairman  while i   m still uncomfort with a polici commit in the propos word  i feel much better with the introductori phrase    with inflat quit low and resourc use slack     which make it a condit statement   i also like drop the languag that wrap up our assess of the balanc of risk   i think do that help   so i   ll support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   this is a committe of nineteen peopl  and i think we   re in the area of a judgment call as much as anyth els   if i were do this individu  i would have retain the summat sentenc and not chang it veri dramat  but i would have made the other chang you recommend   i don   t feel so strong about it  howev  that i couldn   t support what you   ve propos   so i am support of your recommend   and i don   t want to lose sight of the fact that your initi recommend is that we keep the fund rate at   percent  which i also support
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i think we   re move in the right direct  recogn that the balanc of risk is in the process of chang or in fact has shift   over the last coupl of month  the statement hasn   t chang veri much  but the economi has  and i think we   re in the process of catch up   and we   re prepar the market for a modif of the    consider period    languag   i think they   ll see that   i   m not concern that there might be some advers market reaction to this percept   i think the economi is suffici strong and robust to be abl to handl a modest to moder backup in rate   we will be consid the languag more fulli at our next meet   so rather than tri to fiddl even more with the word  i think just drop that overal balanc of risk sentenc is probabl better sinc we will all have a chanc to look at the languag with a more or less clean piec of paper next  e  i agre with you that the balanc of cost and risk we   re face now is differ from anyth the fed has face sinc probabl the     s in term of a low inflat environ   i don   t think that rule out preemption as you seem to be impli   i think it   mean that we take the risk on a differ side  we will have to be preemptiv  we   ll need to move polici well befor we see inflat pick up   it   s just that we won   t need to move quit as fast   i see it as a lesser degre of preemption rather than no preemption
i don   t disagre with the way you phrase it
mr  chairman  obvious i agre with your polici recommend for the fund rate   i don   t agre with the chang in the statement   i think we have an opportun here to identifi the risk as balanc and drop the    consider period    statement   if we were to remov that statement  i think the market might  as presid pool suggest  exhibit some gyrat this afternoon  but i believ there   s a fair amount of expect in the market that we will drop that word today   if we did  i think it would allow us more flexibl go forward  it would enabl us at our januari meet to focus on more forward look issu relat to the polici statement   i must admit that that would be my strong prefer
mr  chairman  after the first go around i made a note to myself dure the break that if i were a committe of one i would drop complet the refer to further disinfl   i think we learn earlier that repeat phrase get us into troubl   i note also that i would like to character the inflat risk as either balanc or close to balanc   i think we   re miss a chanc to move a littl further away from the    consider period    languag   i actual like the    can be patient in adjust the stanc of polici    phrase that was suggest as an altern   howev  i can and will support your recommend   i   m not sure  given the hour  that i can convinc myself   or anyon els   that my approach is a better way to go   so i am comfort with your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   when i enter the room  the question in my mind were how to deal with these risk balanc statement and how to deal with the    consider period    sentenc   i wonder whether or not the group would be will to take step to address both of those issu in one meet   i think the balanc of risk is correct done in your recommend approach   i share governor     s view regard the summat of the balanc of risk  i was never quit comfort with it   so i view drop that statement actual as an extra posit   take this in a two step process   recogn that we don   t realli have to move and that we don   t expect to have to move veri quick   suggest that the    consider period    sentenc is probabl still a factual statement   in that case  it seem to me that this is the appropri way of get the market and the economi readi for the next step   so i can support your recommend   i think it   s the right way to go
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know  i   ve indic a prefer for balanc in term of the inflat risk   it seem to me  howev  that the suggest you have made move us a long way in that direct and  therefor  i   m veri comfort with your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman     indic in his remark that one rational for drop the    consider period    languag is that one is oppos to a polici precommit   i   ve been oppos to the polici precommit all along  but i don   t think drop that sentenc at this  e convey that messag   i would prefer to do more work to improv our communic rather than have the market tri to figur out what we   re attempt to communic by make a chang in that    consider period    languag   i support your recommend
first vice presid lyon
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   the propos languag captur our view of the impact of recent develop and  as you have outlin  preserv polici flexibl
i support both the polici decis and the statement
mr  chairman  i support your polici recommend   i especi like what you said about preemption and particular the issu we could face now in that regard versus what we face when the inflat rate was   percent or higher in past period   i could accept don   s edit regard preemption  but i like the general thrust of what you said   i think it   s especi relev  i can accept your recommend with regard to the languag   my own prefer would have been to leav all of the statement unchang under the circumst   i understand the intuit  but i person don   t see a compel reason on the logic  given what i understand to be the fact  for make a chang today   but i can accept it   i   m veri glad that we   re go to leav in the    consider period    refer   i think that   s where the public focus is go to be  for me the key point  as i mention earlier  is that we had an extraordinari declin in unit labor cost in the third quarter   we may be look at further declin  and that is a key determin of inflat go forward   again  the actual and prospect inflat rate is at the bottom of what i think most of us see as the desir rang for the longer run   given that situat  i would not want to send a signal to the market that i think a signific modif of the languag would have sent   that   s my feel  so i support your posit
i   m comfort with both the polici recommend and the statement as craft   i think the statement you   ve propos is better than the altern   in my view we   re at a point where it   s appropri to dial back a bit the forward look signal we   re send   you   re propos to do it in four differ way  and i think each of those is justifi and help   peopl say that there   s someth of a paradox about polici and interest rate in that  by the  e we feel the need to talk about an exit strategi  it may be too late   i don   t think one can make the case that we   re at that point yet  and i believ your recommend approach give us a littl more flexibl as we confront the more difficult choic we   re go to face in the first two quarter of next year
i support your recommend   i would have prefer to elimin the    consider period    phrase  get it over with  and start the new year out with a clean slate  but i support your recommend
would you read the appropri text  pleas
i   ll be read the direct word on page    of the bluebook and  with regard to risk assess  the first two sentenc that the chairman read to you from the draft press releas   that   s what is be vote on   with regard to the direct itself      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent      with regard to the sentenc go into the press statement      the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal   the probabl of an unwelcom fall in inflat has diminish in recent month and now appear almost equal to that of a rise in inflat
call the roll
chairman  span vice chairman    governor bernank governor bie   presid broaddus  governor    governor   presid guynn   governor kohn  presid   governor olson   presid parri             yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
i suggest that we take a brief recess to get lunch and come back to the tabl here   governor   will then give us a progress report on the activ of his work group   recess
governor   has the floor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start by say that this is mere a progress report from your work group on communic   how long we discuss this today is up to the committe   i have some comment that will take about five minut or so  and we can stop there   but there will be  e for substant comment later   the work group  as you know  ask for contribut from member of the committe on how to handl the balanc of risk statement or the risk assess
whi don   t you indic the member of the work group
okay   my colleagu on the work group are governor    governor kohn  governor bernank  presid  n  who   s not here today   presid    and presid parri   our group was ask to consid what cathi   has describ as the headach part of the statement  which is the risk assess   we recogn that the origin languag work for two to three year but that circumst have caus it to outrun it use   we receiv from various member of the committe eight or nine differ recommend   some of the propos focus narrowli on the risk assess paragraph itself   some were more broad focus on the overal process in term of how we put togeth the statement and how that might interact with other possibl chang to our communic polici  such as an earlier releas of the minut  as you know from a memo that i sent you earlier  the member of the work group think that the overal committe will benefit most from our effort if we remain focus primarili on the risk assess paragraph   we may look at the slight broader issu of how      the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     the risk assess would interact with the first substant paragraph in the statement but not go much beyond that into think about the minut and when they are releas  and so forth   we believ that ani decis on the minut should be view as a separ issu and should be debat by the committe as a whole   we don   t necessarili  as a group of seven  add a particular valu to the process of help to think through the issu involv in that  so in the context of focus on the risk assess  it turn out that the recommend that came in basic had three differ approach  or flavor if you will  that differ in three basic respect   one differ involv the specif with which the risk assess was given   in particular the question of whether it had some sens of a benchmark associ with it   the second thing that seem to divid the various option that were present was how they dealt with the discuss of level and chang in output gap or inflat gap   some mix them  and some tri to divid them veri neat   the third differ was the specif regard the length of the  e period   some of the propos favor a fair vagu  e frame  and some retain the languag of    forese futur      other approach recommend to us support specif  e frame refer measur in term of quarter  month  or even year   so we look at those three element and basic came up with three archetyp  if you will  of how to put togeth these various compon  and that   s what we   re go to focus on for the remaind of the life of this work group  what you have befor you after the first page  which give an overview  show three type of propos   i   m not go to ask you to comment on them or vote on them   i have provid them just so you can see what they look like  recogn that the committe itself will have plenti of  e to work on the languag  the first propos   just in term of the element that i talk about but not look at the detail of the languag   basic merg level and chang   we had sever suggest that fell into that categori  they merg level and chang and allud to benchmark   there were a number of peopl who want to do that in the overal risk assess sentenc   as you can see  in refer to long run goal of price stabil or long run goal of sustain econom growth  the  e horizon use in this approach is a veri elast notion of the forese futur   so this propos repres that clu  of approach to deal with the risk assess   notic also that this is onli a risk assess paragraph  so that   s what we   re go to stress under this option  propos b is somewhat more explicit about level but address them in the first paragraph   this is an exampl with refer to such thing as inflat remain well contain or slack remain consider   so it includ a discuss of level  but that   s separ from the discuss of chang   this one put our judgment regard chang in the second paragraph  reflect a certain style that seem to come through in sever of the recommend we receiv   it allud again to benchmark in the overal risk assess but in a somewhat less structur or less quantifi way  with term such as    long run sustain pace     et cetera   but it use a much more specif  e frame   the next few quarter   than the elast concept of forese futur   so this propos reflect anoth clu  of thought that we receiv   again  you can see that this one work primarili with the risk assess but   leav a clear expect that the first paragraph would tend to have some languag that deal with level   so that   s how we handl the level versus chang dilemma  the third propos is much more focus on the whole statement   it again is explicit about level  primarili in the first substant paragraph  leav the chang basic to the second paragraph on the risk assess   this one allud to benchmark in the first paragraph  it  sn   t talk about inflat necessarili be contain just in and of itself but put that in a broader context   this propos move us  frank  veri much in a direct that we   ve never travel   it is in some sens the most radic of the option we are consid becaus it   talk about a forecast   it refer in the second paragraph to the committe   s assess of the risk to the outlook in term of it forecast of econom growth over the come period   it is explicit about the forecast period   the next two year in this case   and refer some potenti develop that might chang the forecast   some of you realli want to see us move in this direct   this would be veri new territori for the committe  import  if we go in the direct of propos c  i think that realli   impli a broader set of chang in our committe dynam   i say that becaus to get us talk about forecast at everi meet will take more  e and will be quit differ from the risk assess discuss   so if the committe were to adopt this approach  we ought to recogn the like effect on the committe dynam   that it will requir more  e to look at the statement and more  e to think through what our outlook might be   this in some sens is a logic progress from where we   ve been sinc the risk assess was origin intend to have a forward look tone   but this put much more weight on the forward look aspect and involv a forecast type of statement from the committe   go in this direct  i will repeat  reflect the desir of enough committe member that our work group thought it was at least worth consid  those are the broad type of statement we are look at   i would discourag you from get terribl focus on ani specif set of word but would ask that you realli think about whether or not the mixtur that we   ve put togeth is one on which you might like as a basi for our further discuss  the second point i   d like to make in my part of the  e allot to this issu today is that we intend to stress test these various option   a combin of reserv bank and board staff will look at the six scenario we   ve identifi  includ some of the recent episod that have proven most challeng   our goal here  as is alway the case  is to tri to see how these various type of risk assess stack up against whatev develop are like to occur or whatev curv we think the economi might throw us   again  we   re not go to be ani more prescient than anybodi els  but one hope that with the six scenario we   ll cover most of the thing that are like to happen   or certain all the scenario that we think are most like to be problemat   so when we come back in januari we   ll have the result of those stress test  and we   ll see which one seem to work and which one seem to fail in certain circumst  recogn that we have had some phone call and letter ask us to think about our communic polici more broad  the board   s staff will prepar some memo deal with other suggest such as expedit the releas of the minut   the staff also will look in general at go even beyond the type of statement i   ve outlin today and enhanc the role of forecast  sinc some peopl have suggest that as an approach   again  that is not someth on which the work group is go to give you a propos or recommend  but it will be provid as input for the discuss we   re go to have in januari  final  this materi is go to be sent to everyon in advanc of the two day meet in januari so we think there   ll be plenti of opportun for level set  if you will  that will give us the chanc to talk about the risk assess and the statement more broad and even expand the discuss to the question of the interact of the minut and of forecast becom a fair normal part of the committe dynam  so that   s what we propos   as i said  at this stage the work group is not seek specif comment on the languag   though obvious you can do that if you want   but rather just an affirm about the process i   ve outlin   we seek your view on whether the varieti or flavor of the statement that i   ve shown would be suffici  as we think they would be  to give you the kind of thought input that will allow us to have a focus and intellig convers at the two day meet in januari   that   s my six or seven minut of  e  and now it   s up to you how much further we go today   cathi
thank you  roger   i   m a littl worri here   i would just go back to what i said earlier   we have gotten ourselv into a situat where   in the terminolog i use befor   we have a lot of move part in this statement   none of these propos that you have present   without go into detail on ani of them   diminish those move part at all   it   s possibl  base on a brief glanc  that these propos actual may add move part   i don   t think that   s the direct we want to go   i think we should be aim to minim rather than maxim the number of thing we talk about in the statement we releas after everi meet   i believ we get into increas amount of troubl as we tri to expand on what we cover yet keep the word short and pithi enough   that is  without the logic and back and forth discuss that went on in the committe meet   to be in the press statement for each meet in my view  and you and i had this convers on the telephon  the endeavor of the work group should not preclud a discuss in januari of have the statement be shorter and sweeter   perhap confin it to what we did and whi we did it   we could let some other vehicl   perhap the minut releas on an earlier schedul   convey all the in and out and up and down of the committe   s discuss   you indic that the januari discuss would not preclud that possibl   my concern is that an intens amount of stress test of three altern with the same amount of move part   albeit phrase somewhat differ or focus somewhat differ   will result in our receiv huge paper on this topic five day  say  befor the two day meet   we have enorm amount of materi to assimil anyway  and this will give us no  e to discuss ani other propos or perspect that might not be as well flesh out as these   i   m worri that we   re go to continu along a line here that i don   t think has been veri fruit for us
okay   the chairman want to speak  and then i want to respond to your comment   also  i have a list of peopl from the last meet who want to speak on this issu but we ran out of  e
oh  i   m sorri   did i speak out of turn
no  you did not speak out of turn   i recogn you  so by definit you didn   t speak out of turn
i want to support what cathi is say  and i do so from the point of view of somebodi who has to figur out how to get a consensus out of this group  it   s far easier to get the requisit number of member to support a polici than to support what we say about it   for exampl  with twelv committe member and  say  ten who favor the polici decis  there could be fifteen differ reason that might caus member to vote for it  therefor  it is far easier to get a group to support the actual polici than to get a consensus on whi it is the appropri polici   the multipl of the problem that emerg   just use cathi   s move part terminolog   to get peopl to agre on whi they vote a certain way is a wholli differ ball game   i suggest to you that this is a remark uniform group in the sens that i think without except we all hold a reason consist view as to how the economi function and  therefor  which lever are requir to do what   the onli differ realli boil down to question of how we view the outlook  nonetheless  this is a veri complex process  and i just want to agre with cathi that reduc the number of move part is go to be veri import   we also have to avoid like the plagu  if michell smith has a      p m  deadlin for releas our statement to the press  anyth that will extend these meet well beyond when we ordinarili adjourn   just take today as an exampl   today   s agenda was not particular extens  but it   s alreadi twenti minut befor      p m   if we start tri to discuss all the if  and  and but in the statement  we will not finish in  e   but there is an altern   we can go to a      p m  announc but let the press know well in advanc that we are chang the  e we plan to releas our statement   we can go later than that if you want   but there are lot of other implic about this whole communic busi
let me say a coupl of thing   one is that the committe can collect decid that this is more troubl than it   s worth and that we are communic more than we need to communic   we can conclud that none of these option feel right for a varieti of reason   we can mere say that this is all veri interest but  have look at the stress test result and everyth els  we as a committe think that we no longer want to tri to provid anyth in our public statement that is forward look   we may reach that conclus for process reason or for substanc reason   we may decid that we like have meet that last onli from   a m  to   p m   so noth in this preclud  mr  chairman  the committe   s ul  decid that this whole risk assess approach or forward look approach that we   ve work on is not worth a candl
but we   re like to do so after have pore over a fifti page paper
we   re leav it to the committe to decid whether or not we should have a risk assess or a forward look element in our statement   i don   t think we felt that it was appropri for our littl subgroup to do anyth more than to say that it is clear an option not to have that in the statement   we   re not take that option away from you   we can follow a process in which we first side with those   if it is the major view   who want us to tri to work on this approach   we can certain do that   but noth in take that step preclud the committe from ul  decid that it  sn   t want to go down this path   i do agre  howev  that some of these option would impli a meet that start earlier or goe later than is current the case  and i   m not sure that the committe want to do that  i have one thing to do here becaus i have some note from the last meet that four member   governor bie  and presid santomero  hoenig  and     weren   t abl to speak on this topic becaus it was close to      p m  and we had to adjourn   i don   t know if ani of you four want to jump in at this stage  but i will call on you in that order   i also have governor   and presid parri as indic today that they want to say someth   but as a matter of courtesi and organiz disciplin  i think we owe to those who were preclud from speak last  e an opportun to comment today if they wish   therefor  governor bie  presid santomero  presid hoenig  and presid    in that order  if you want to say anyth pleas do so
let me make a coupl of comment   i would hope  as we make the decis on the statement  that we have the staff   s input on the issu of move up the public of the minut   i say that becaus i am veri concern about make the press statement the domin issu   when peopl read the minut  they do have a chanc to see the varieti of viewpoint express at that particular meet   just as we did today  we got around to a consensus   some of us are will to bend or some get to the same answer from a differ place  and i think the minut reflect that more clear   i worri that this statement may get veri  veri long  and i like the idea of keep the press releas cleaner and simpler   so i   m look forward to see what practic can be done from the minut perspect  second  i person am veri reluct to go down the path of give frequent forecast or make commit   to my mind that presum that we   re more omnisci about what is go to occur in the futur than i think we are   it also rais question of what to do when confront with a situat such as we had in the spring with the iraqi war  when we couldn   t even assess the near term much less the longer term outlook   presidenti elect come up  and a lot of other thing happen   i   m veri concern about tri to give a forecast of the outlook at each regular meet   now  we might want to think about how the chairman communic to the congress twice a year in his tes oni on monetari polici  we can do that separ   but to routin tri to do a forecast at everi six week interv i find veri problemat   i also want to say that i do like the stress test idea   one of the thing that we found out is that the relationship between fall inflat and econom growth   the phillip curv kind of tradeoff   got a bit out of whack this year   so i like the notion of stress test these various altern
i have presid santomero next on my list
it   s a littl hard to pick up from the introductori discuss last  e  but let me just respond to what i   m see befor me   i think the idea of project out two year and continu forecast the outlook two year ahead is go to do more harm to our credibl than aid in clarifi our announc   so i must admit that i don   t see the use of these type of statement as like to be a sustain scenario   that would be one respons  second  the question of how much we want to cover in the announc  which is essenti the issu that presid   is suggest that we think about  is worth address direct   if these option are a  b  and c  then option d ought to be an altern to pare back the statement   mayb the best way to get at some of these question is to have peopl give you input in write on what you   ve shown us today  so that you can determin a way to respond   if in fact everybodi say that    c    is the way to go  that   s fine   if everybodi say    d    is the way to go  that will help the committe as group figur out what we should do   i think we still have a lot of open question here  the third point i   d make relat to the question of  e   as the chairman note  it   s approach      p m  now   these are critic decis  and the question of the  e we need to discuss them is becom an issu   the committe may want to think about that   whether we want to move the announc to      p m  or start our meet at      a m   we ought to at least address the  e issu  so that we have an opportun to talk about these matter in a way that will be construct
i   m not quit sure what to say  roger   i start out  as i   ve thought about our communic in the last few month  think that the earlier releas of the minut would provid us with an opportun to cut back on the statement   you indic in an earlier memo to us that cut back on the statement  even coupl with an earlier releas of the minut  would be view as a step back in term of the inform we provid   that caus me to think that the forecast we submit twice a year in prepar for our semiannu report on monetari polici should be the focus of our communic about the outlook   i   d rather have the forecast we provid to the congress in those report   along with the relev committe minut   be the vehicl we use to put out that rang of view rather than the risk statement  which for me has been a veri dissatisfi effort to communic with the market and whomev els   so  sinc we   ve open up the door to have more option to choos from here  i would say that i realli would like to pare back the press releas   and i   d tri to provid sooner rather than later a greater sens of the varieti of veri valuabl view among committe member and the differ that come through that ul  lead to a consensus   so that   s my two cent worth
okay   i have bob   on my list from the last  e  and then i have ned    bob parri  and bill pool   i think we still have the same dilemma we had last month of have to end our discuss by      p m
i agre with cathi that the statement should be shorter and simpler   veri much so   as i   ve long argu  i don   t think we did ourselv a favor when we start announc a bias vote   i would recommend not have a bias vote   if we don   t have it  then we   re not be nontranspar by not releas it   if it   s fair obvious which way polici ought to be go at a meet  i think we ought to just go there rather than do noth and promis  through a bias vote  that we will like do it next  e   whenev we act  peopl on the outsid know pretti much the same inform we do  they don   t realli need that much of an explan of whi we vote the way we did   so i think we leav ourselv much more flexibl if our announc have fewer move part  and we have fewer way to make a mistak if we just leav out the bias   if do that requir releas the minut earlier  fine  that   s all right with me   but i don   t think we even have to do that   i   d just say that we   ve found recent that the lengthi press releas and announc of various bias have not serv us veri well and we prefer to go back to the old system
i   ll tri to be quick   in term of write a relat formula statement with few move part  which as you know i tri to do last  e  what happen is that all sort of difficulti aris   peopl ask  what are you go to do about this problem   what are you go to do about that problem   i don   t want to be so clear on this issu or on that issu  and the statement just get more complic and murkier   so  frank  i don   t think that kind of statement is go to work  my second point is that this group should not think of the minut as a panacea   it   s a separ issu   we might get them out sooner  but even if we do  we   re still go to have to issu a statement on the day of the meet   the world is go to want a bottom line  and either we can give it  or somebodi els will give it   so i   d just propos  as roger suggest  that we treat that as a separ issu and deal with the post meet statement as best we can  third  there may be an attract altern to the option in the materi roger pass out   it is exact what we did today   to issu a short statement after everi meet   we vote on it and go forward   what happen is that the situat we face are so checker and tailor and differ that it   s hard to design a formula with few move part that will work for everi meet   if we want to give a statement  it has to be reflect of what we think   that   s the type of statement we agre on today   a short statement that describ what we think is go on in the economi   if we were to do that  i would say that the statement should be short   no more than seven or eight sentenc   i person would recommend that we have a compulsori half hour period to read a draft of the statement and think about it   we shouldn   t rush and just ram it through   we can actual tri to do someth democrat and then talk about it   this will result in longer meet  and that   s all right with me   i don   t have ani more toler for meet than i think most of you have   but we are set interest rate that will have an influenc throughout the world economi   it just may take us anoth two hour to do that
roger  cathi refer to these three option as have lot of move part   i think they are differ   the number of move part and the number of thing we have to agre on are veri differ   one of the propos has languag we   ve actual use for year and never had ani problem with   or at least veri few   while i agre that we don   t want to have a lot of move part  i do not think that all three of the option are the same in that regard  so it seem to me that we can look at these three altern
as i say  this is a judgment call  and obvious  we have nineteen differ judg   bill  what   s your view
i   d like to see a propos that   s pretti close to a   i   ll call it a prime   that would focus on the reason for the polici decis at the meet and would have a minim amount of forward look element   so when we judg the risk to be rough balanc  we leav the feder fund rate alon   when we judg that the risk are becom unbalanc in a particular direct  we either rais the fund rate or lower it  and that risk assess would be the explan of whi we took the action we did   that   s point number one   that i think we could recast a along those line  second  i would urg that the stress test take the actual situat we face at the meet of  let   s say  the last five year and determin what we would have done with regard to the statement at each of those meet   there may be some scenario you would want to stress test in addit to that   but i would like to see histori rerun  if you will  to see what the statement would have look like in septemb      or whatev under each propos
well  i guess i   m go to have the last word becaus we have onli a few minut left   here   s what i   ve note   i heard a rang of view about these three option  but i don   t think i heard anyon say let   s not stress test them   some of you may ul  say it   s too complic and let   s not go to a new type of statement  but i didn   t hear anyon say    pleas stop the process now      so i think we need to continu this process  perhap broaden the stress test a littl  to make sure we pick up a rang of situat that we know have occur over the last five year   i   m not sure we have to do that for everi meet becaus one can recal that there were a seri of meet when inflat look as if it was pick up and a seri of meet when it look as though inflat was fall off   so as long as we cover that wide rang of circumst  i think we can respond to the issu rais about stress test  the second thing i heard clear was that we have to keep on the tabl two option that aren   t specif set out in this materi   one is simpli to cut back on the press statement altogeth and minim the forward look aspect of it   so we   ll includ that clear as an option to be discuss  but there   s no stress test to do on that   or no more that our littl work group can do with regard to that option  i   d say the same thing with respect to the focus on the minut be releas earli  that   s clear someth that peopl want to talk about   we have to leav enough  e in our two day meet to cover that  though it   s slight independ from this other aspect of our communic polici   we alreadi had plan to discuss expedit the minut and  as i said  i think that requir some input from board staff on how they think the market may react  and the pros and con of take that step  et cetera   those two issu   what to do on the statement and the minut   do interact a littl   as michell has warn us a few  e  if we appear to be step back from transpar in the statement but are give someth els in it stead  that will make a differ in the public reaction   so those two decis are interrel to a degre   while i in some sens share bob     s frustrat about the bias statement   had we never vote on a tilt we   d never have to disclos it   our problem is that we   ve vote on a tilt for mani year   so elimin that would lead to great market con n   so  of cours  we can   t wind the tape back to whenev it was that the committe decid to first vote on the tilt  those are the three thing i hear   the fourth is that  as ned   said  in some sens the length of our meet is a relev factor in all of this   i don   t know what the right answer is to that   but i would say that it   s certain someth we are go to have to consid   if ned is right  and i think to some degre he is   we   re set interest rate at least for the world   s largest and most complex economi if not for the world   the attempt of nineteen peopl to do that in three hour may be more than we can manag   we may no longer be at a stage where we can do that   we may decid that we   re no longer just set rate but we   re talk about the economi and set up the implic for polici in the futur   we   re set rate  we   re tri to figur out how best to explain it  and we   re look forward   that   s a lot for nineteen peopl to do in three hour
i think that   s a red herring   i don   t think anybodi in the room would argu that  if we choos one of these option  we will have short meet   there   s no argument about that
no  i   m suggest that one of the thing that may come out of the januari meet is a general consensus that we need to start our meet a littl earlier   i don   t know   i   m just say that that   s part of the discuss we   re go to have to have   i   m not put that as an option to be trade off against some of these other thing
but  roger  i think it   s import to recogn that for ani of us who favor a shorter  simpler statement  the length of the meet has noth whatsoev to do with that prefer   if we had to spend ten hour argu over polici  i   d be happi to do that
well  in fact it   s now      p m    laughter   i was tri a filibust to that   no  i did say that those two issu are not interchang   we may decid that we want a differ length of meet independ of what we decid about the statement   that is an issu that has bubbl up and has to be decid   now  our chairman may not be in agreement
let me just indic to you that in good congression tradit the clock has stop at      p m
it   s up to you how to proceed
well  unless somebodi has some formid import issu to rais at this point  the meet is adjourn  end of meet
