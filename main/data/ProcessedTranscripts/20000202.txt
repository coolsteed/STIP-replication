without object   we will now move to the regular formal meet agenda   i ask for approv of the minut of our decemb meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag of chart with the peach class ii cover on it  begin as usual with the chart on forward deposit rate    the top panel depict u s  forward rate and current   month rate   as you can see there  forward rate back up from the  e of your decemb meet through earli januari and then flatten out a bit  even as the current   month deposit rate  the black line  remain quit steadi   then  with the notic except of the spike in the   month forward rate  the solid red line  that spike be a true data point  these rate general move sideway from the  e of the chairman   s speech on januari    at the econom club of new york through last friday   the movement in these    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix       rate seem to reflect nois rather than ani specif develop we could point to   by the  e we reach mid januari  the market had alreadi pretti much price in an expect of about    basi point of tighten some  dure the first quarter of this year   now  the releas of the gdp and eci data on friday did affect the forward rate a bit  as the   month forward rate shown at the veri top right of the chart back up almost    basi point   howev  the april fed fund futur contract back up onli about   basi point from a rate of      to      percent   the fed fund futur isn   t shown here  but to give you the flavor  i   d say that the market had pretti much built in it expect of a first quarter tighten by the middl of januari   my point is that the data releas on friday chang the outlook beyond the first quarter somewhat  but did not chang veri profound the sens of the committe   s like action dure the first quarter   in contrast a bit  while european forward rate also drift up  as shown in the middl panel in blue  onc we got to januari these rate level out to a consider extent and remain that way until the   th when the euro close below dollar pariti for the first  e   you can see the uptick at that  e in all the rate   particular notic is how much the current   month deposit rate  the black line  move in the expect that the ecb might need to respond in some way   in the bottom panel  you can see that japanes rate also rose a bit from late decemb through earli januari  and then began to drift off after mid  januari   there had been a fair amount of talk in tokyo in late decemb and earli januari about the need for the bank of japan to develop an exit strategi from it zero interest rate polici   but around mid januari bank of japan offici  both in report and in comment  began to express more anxieti regard the fact that the self sustain recoveri was not in sight   this seem to be confirm by the veri weak consumpt data that came out last friday   but from the middl of januari onward  as you can see  the forward rate in japan began to fall back to their low level   turn to the next page  there was rather more excit in the treasuri bond market   in the top panel you can see              and    year treasuri yield as they have trade sinc octob  st   the bottom panel depict various spread within the yield curv  the    to   year in    the    to    year in blue  and the     to    year in red   treasuri yield were rise from late novemb and continu to rise after your last meet  but they too began to move sideway rough from januari   th forward    in this case  in addit to the chairman   s speech on    that day  secretari summer announc the final plan for the buyback program to repurchas outstand treasuri debt   in his remark and the press releas he suggest they would be buy as much as     billion in the year       most of that probabl at the long end   that should be seen against the backdrop of expect alreadi in the market  befor the buyback came into play  that the treasuri   s net paydown of secur in the first half of this year would be someth on the order of      to      billion   with that shift in the bond suppli outlook be emphas in the market  you can see in the bottom panel how quick the     and    year spread began to invert after the januari   th announc   the drama came last friday with the releas of the gdp and eci data   prior to that date  there realli had been two contend camp in the market   one saw the invers of the yield curv as a temporari phenomenon  expect the curv to steepen again onc this committe began to tighten over the cours of the first quarter   they were thus take short posit in the long end   a differ camp expect the invers of the yield curv to continu   they expect it to flatten when this committe began it wide expect tighten  they anticip a reduct in treasuri suppli at the long end but an increas agenc and corpor suppli in the short end   and it was also their sens that a late cycl firm by the central bank should slow activ and fo  a ralli in the bond market   thus  they took long posit in the long end of the bond market   last friday  the initi reaction seem to favor the first camp as the yield curv back up  and some in that camp seem to have been tempt to doubl up their posit   but then the yield curv began to go down rather quick again  and they were caught scrambl to cover their short  which caus a fair bit of see saw in the yield curv all day on friday   bid ask spread in the market on friday were not as wide as the widest we saw in octob       but dure the cours of the day they were compar to the averag of octob        so  bid ask spread widen out quit a bit   you can see in the bottom panel the profound impact that last friday   s new data had on the    to    year and the     to    year spread   the onli upward slope left in the coupon curv is in the    to   year sector   as this posit adjust wash through the market  i think we are increas go to see a flat treasuri curv  with convers in the market increas turn to whether this is just a treasuri suppli stori or a fundament stori in some way   the next page depict some domest yield curv comparison   in the upper left is the treasuri yield curv from last octob  th  show the close rate after the committe   s octob meet and those as of ye day      in the upper right is the interest rate swap curv   the lower left panel has fanni mae yield and the lower right those on ford motor compani debt   while they are all at differ level  the spread to treasuri are realli veri littl chang from octob   onli the    year swap spread is discern wider than in octob   all other domest spread to treasuri have narrow slight or are unchang from octob  th   the short end of each of these other domest curv are notic steep  but they are less steep than they were in octob   and they are all quit flat now from   to    year and from    to    year   my own sens is that the treasuri yield curv has a veri power influenc on these other curv  the habit of trade at certain spread   so  while i don   t want to overst the import of the treasuri suppli stori  i would not want to underst it either   howev  none of these yield curv suggest to me that the rest of the domest interest rate market is expect a sudden outbreak of inflat   i don   t think they would be trade at such a flat long end spread even in thin market   a rather differ pictur emerg on the next page where our yield curv is compar to other nation govern yield curv   as you can see in the top two panel  u s  and canadian yield curv are realli quit similar  with canadian yield just a bit below u  s  treasuri yield  as they have been sinc the fall   but in the bottom two panel you can see the rather dramat differ between our yield curv and those of the unit kingdom and germani   the unit kingdom is everyon   s po  child for the impact on a govern bond market of a firm to tighten central bank polici and a shrink govern issuanc of long term debt   those who are wonder how long a ralli we can get in our bond market have in the back of their mind this pictur of the u k  yield curv   in contrast is the rather steep continent curv  the german yield curv  relat to last octob it provid a strike contrast to the u k  and u s  yield curv   i don   t think the differ between their yield curv and our is a first order caus of the weak of the euro over the last few day  but it is certain a contribut one  given that the differenti have continu to widen in the dollar   s favor sinc last octob   the chart on the next page depict from the begin of octob to date the percent chang in select currenc against the dollar   this highlight how much of an outlier the euro is   as you can see  the brazilian real and the canadian dollar have been firm against the dollar  the japanes yen and the mexican peso have been trade around zero  and the euro has weaken profound over the last few day       one of the most anticip event of januari       i would guess after all the hoop la about the y k bug  was the expect ralli in the euro   it was so wide anticip that there was no one left to make it happen  institut investor have been buy euro asset and run them on an unhedg basi most in the currenc market  hope for the euro ralli to give them a greater kick in their invest   in the last few day  as we came to the end of januari  these investor ran out of patienc and began hedg those exposur in rather vast amount  rush to hedg the unhedg   i was given some advic onc by someon in the market that the histori of exchang rate volatil is the histori of success new class of actor learn how to hedg and how not to hedg   turn to the next page and our open market oper  you can see that the movement in the three key reserv factor sinc decemb   th requir us to add a total of     billion in reserv from that point forward  you can also see how  after the turn of the year  the treasuri balanc and currenc in circul began to drop off veri quick  caus the whole posit of reserv factor to revers   on the next page is a bar graph show how our oper at the turn of the year were structur to help us meet this buildup and then to pull back rather quick   the dark blue portion of the bar repres the rps that we alreadi had in place as of the   th of decemb  the   dash portion are those that we put on start on the   th   the yellow portion indic the forward rps we execut in our effort to put in some addit reserv around the year end   the red negat part are the match sale that we conduct dure the first half of januari as we tri to get our posit back in balanc   but overal  the rather larg amount of rps that we had put on the book and roll off rather quick in januari work rather well   i includ the chart on the next page to show you the interest rate behavior at the short end of the money market that we saw around year end  the top panel has compar data for last year   s turn from decemb      to januari        the effect fed fund rate is the   line  the treasuri rp rate the blue line  the target fed fund rate the black line  and the morn fed fund rate at the  e we oper the red line   you can see at the bottom how we did this year   we had a much softer market sever day befor the year end and then rather less volatil in januari onc we got through the turn of the year   what led to the rather profound soft those day befor the year end is in part a my i  but as best we can judg we think that the scarciti of treasuri collater was a major factor that pull repo rate down and had some influenc on the fund rate  in addit  howev  there was a widespread percept in the market that we were flood the market with liquid   market particip had data on our     gross oper but not our net oper   they were not abl to see the inform depict in the first chart i show you on the factor that were drain reserv   the next page show the behavior of the fund rate and reserv in the two mainten period that surround the year end   in the top two panel on the fund rate  the blue line depict the trade rang  the red horizont line is the daili effect rate  and the red vertic line repres one standard deviat   in the bottom panel on the key reserv factor  the blue bar show the actual free reserv on the day and each black dot repres our intend level of free reserv on the day   the red bar is the borrow that occur on each day  both discount window and slf borrow   interest from my perspect is how soft the fund rate becam  as you can see in the top left panel  on decemb             and      that happen even though  as you can see below  we actual were leav in rather normal  if modest  some might even say skimpi  level of free reserv on each day   the amount were quit typic  or if anyth skimpi  for the end of a mainten period   nonetheless  the fund market got quit soft on those day   and  as i say  that occur i think signific on the percept that we were flood the market  sinc they onli saw our gross oper and not the impact of our net oper   clear  at the start of the next period that cover the year end  we did flood the market for the reserv in that new mainten period on the   th and   st   but as you can see  we had a negat miss on the   st itself of more than    billion   so we did not even get in as mani reserv as we were shoot for   again  though  we subsequ were abl to get the fund rate to trade around the target level relat quick by drain reserv   we got down to an histor low oper balanc in the bank system of        billion on januari  th and still kept the fund rate reason well behav   anoth way of view our oper dure the fourth quarter of last year through the period until this meet is shown on the next page   you may recal that i have use this chart befor as a measur of our perform  each dot is a day   the horizont axi is the deviat from the target rate   that is  the effect deviat  zero be the target and plus or minus either side   the vertic axi is each day   s daili standard deviat in basi point term   as you can see  over the fourth quarter of last year and januari of this year the fund rate was reason well contain   as indic by the median valu in the tabl in the upper right  the deviat of the effect rate from the target in absolut term was onli   basi point and the standard deviat was just   basi point         the next page show compar data for the previous year  octob      to januari       also cover the period of market turmoil typic of the fourth quarter   as is appar  we had a rather more volatil market in      than we had this year   the final page give one more way of compar volatil  it plot the same data against a norm establish from the two previous year   that is  the brown box and the   box are base on data from octob      through januari      and from octob      to januari        fifti percent of the observ in those two   month period fell within the brown line and    percent within the   line  that provid a sort of base case  you can see that in octob      to januari      we succeed in get onli    percent of the day to fall within that tight rang and onli    percent within the    percent rang  wherea this year the compar figur were    percent and    percent   so i guess we can say we at least live up to our own standard for manag the fund rate for the two year end period prior to        i would like to thank the committe for give us the tool to help us to do this   it made a great deal of differ   i should note that the fund rate has been firm thus far over the last two day   those day encompass a month end and a first day of the month  normal firm day in the market  but there is also a widespread expect of a firm in rate by the committe  and there is not much chanc of get the fund rate to behav in a    normal    way in these last coupl of day    final  we distribut to the committe copi of the desk   s annual report via our secur web site   i hope you all had access to that as well as to the other report that we now make avail there  mr  chairman  we will need to ratifi the domest desk   s oper sinc the last meet   i would be happi to answer ani question
i would just like to say that i thought the desk handl this veri turbul period extrem well and i found your report most inform   i am glad that we were abl to unwind ourselv from this period without ani undu casualti  or at least none of which i am awar
thank you veri much
i would second that   i think you earn an a  for the way you perform through this period  you and your staff deserv congratul   i have a question    even though you did so veri well    laughter   did you learn anyth through this process that   would lead you to want to do someth differ if we had a similar episod to go through in the futur
well  we will be bring forward as mani of those issu as we can think of to be discuss formal at the march meet   i will say that what was veri frustrat for us  and i am part respons  was the asymmetri of the inform we provid   that is  we gave the market veri detail inform about our gross oper and then they got a onc a week snapshot of the system   s balanc sheet   they thought that page repres our oper  that it was our base   they saw our onli our gross oper   there were day when there were rumor that the desk was flood the market with reserv  and in fact we were leav them bare enough to get by    so that was veri frustrat   if i had to go through a period like that again  and mayb alway  but certain in similar circumst  i think i would want to be more balanc and give out inform on our net oper as well as our gross oper
i would like to make a comment also to applaud the conduct of the desk   but sinc i got to drop in and watch them on occas  i want to note that one would have thought that this was the most relax period that ani group of veri young peopl was go through   and they are veri young       and sandi krieger are ancient compar to the averag age of the staff involv   it was commend that they behav as if go through this firestorm was the most normal thing in the world
if i could  i should have mention it in my brief  i would like to thank the staff from all the other reserv district  particular those in the cash offic  that   provid us with a much higher level of inform than usual and made some of this   forecast a lot easier   there was a tremend effort on the part of everi bank   s cash oper staff  and we may be come back to you to find out whether we shouldn   t make some perman improv in the flow of inform in that regard   but i want to thank staff from the whole system for their effort dure this period
further question for     if not  i assum there is no problem ratifi the action the desk took dure the period   would someon like to move approv
without object           son  and dave
thank you  mr  chairman   i almost hesit to refer you to this rather tame set of chart after the abund of color you have just seen   but this is what we have     chart   summar our forecast   but  befor i get into the number here  i should take note of some late break news   first was the upsid surpris in the bea   s advanc es  of fourth quarter gdp  publish on friday   the     percent real output increas exceed our guess by about a half point   howev  we decid not to redo the forecast and to go with the  book number for this present   this wasn   t simpli for the sake of conveni   to be sure  bea knew more about the fine detail of the fourth quarter data than we did  but the key differ between their es  and our relat main to assumpt about miss number  and we were reason content to stick with our for the  e be   we would have said that if bea   s es  prove closer to the mark  it would have tend to argu for weaker gdp growth in the near term than we forecast  with lesser contribut from defens purchas and inventori invest   this morn   s releas on construct put in place in decemb has reinforc that argument   construct spend now     a copi of the chart use by mr     ms   son  and mr    are append to this transcript   appendix         appear to have been stronger than either bea or we anticip  especi in the state and local sector  where good weather may have given a temporari boost to build   all thing consid  howev  our basic assess still would be that the economi is run strong enough that  absent a consider further tighten of financi condit  pressur on resourc will intensifi over the project period   we   ve assum  though  an increas in the fed fund rate of about a point and a quarter by this fall  and on that basi we   re project that real gdp will grow in the vicin of   percent this year and next   as you can see in the upper panel  we are anticip that domest spend will deceler appreci  howev  that is larg offset by a lessen of the negat contribut to gdp growth from the trade sector   with potenti output rise at about the same pace as actual gdp  we expect that the unemploy rate  in the middl panel  will remain near the recent level  in the vicin of   percent   the tight of the labor market and other factor suggest that inflat will general be tend to move higher  but we   re project that the price of crude oil will declin and damp the rise in overal consum inflat this year and next   as you can see in the bottom panel  most easili in the tabl  we have pce price rise   percent  the same as in       while the cpi rise slow a bit from last year   s pace   i have also includ in the chart  as the red line  a plot of the    current method    version of the cpi  for those who might wish to make histor comparison for that seri on a more consist basi   with that overview  let   s turn to the gut of the forecast   chart   explor the financi backdrop   the top left panel show the p e for the s p      but with the index broken into two compon  the top    by market cap in each period  and the remain       this may be a dubious analyt devic in some respect  howev  it   illustr that  while investor    crave for big cap growth stock  especi    tech    stock  has lift the favor few to veri high p es  even the rest of the index has enjoy a consider valuat boost   the result is that  at this aggreg level  noth look especi cheap by histor standard  even when the p es are measur  as they are here  in term of the rosi earn forecast of secur analyst   we don   t have the earn forecast for the full set of nasdaq stock  but i   m confid that  if we did  the p e rise for them would be onli a littl less startl than that shown on the basi of trail    month earn in the right panel        i won   t belabor the point  but we continu to believ that the valuat are unrealist and that this creat the risk of a larg downward adjust   howev  we also recogn that it is imposs to predict when the bubbl  if that   s what it is  will stop expand  let alon burst  therefor  onc again  we   ve taken a sort of middl posit  anticip that stock price simpli will fluctuat around their januari averag as the fed tighten and earn growth disappoint   that would leav price earn multipl not far below their recent peak  by that measur  equiti capit would remain relat cheap  but it probabl wouldn   t be an environ in which the new issu market was quit so recept   in the credit market  the altern measur in the middl left panel both show that real    year treasuri yield have move up consider in the past year or so   and the prevail real rate level are not low by the standard of the past decad and a half   but  if you buy our analysi of product trend  you might suspect that the equilibrium real rate has risen in the latter half of the     s   in our forecast  we have nomin bond yield rise  to around   percent for longer term treasuri   this impli some flatten of the yield curv  shown at the right  if  howev  market particip should sens that the fed is not in the process of rein in the emerg step up in core inflat  such a flatten is less like   we have  in effect  assum that longer term inflat expect will ratchet up onli a littl dure the project period   look beyond the treasuri sector  the bottom panel suggest that there has been some diminut in the froth in privat credit market sinc the russian and ltcm shock of        howev  with y k concern remov  junk bond spread have revers a portion of their late      widen  even as default rate have continu to rise   and bank  though not revers all of the tighten of busi lend standard they did in the wake of the      turmoil  have not been firm aggress sinc then  by most report  bank and other institut continu to be activ seek lend opportun   and we anticip onli a mild tighten of credit avail over come quarter becaus we don   t see an especi scari deterior in busi or household debt repay perform  given the continu high level of econom activ  in sum  we   re anticip that financ condit will becom less accommod of demand growth but not harsh so   the most import element of restraint  as we see it  is the loss of impetus to consum spend from the stock market   as shown in the top left panel of chart    consum sen ent accord to the michigan src     index has been trend upward sinc        this has been a period of strong growth in employ and incom  and peopl have becom increas confid that the good  e will continu to roll   the stock market has both reflect and reinforc that sen ent   but  as indic at the right  our flat stock market path impli that the household wealth incom ratio will be fall   the wealth effect on consumpt will gradual move from posit to negat  and as may be seen at the middl left  this  along with the dynam of the acceler effect for durabl  is expect to push pce growth below that of dispos incom by        soar consum confid and wealth also have play a role in the hous market   as you can see at the right  percept of

than that record last year   in light of these market develop  we are project that our index of non oil commod price  shown in the middl left  which rebound sharpli at the end of       will rise at

 in the baselin  the ratio of the deficit to gdp stabil for a  e as u s  growth is assum to slow below potenti and foreign output acceler   onc that adjust is complet and domest and foreign     output

 the nonfarm busi measur is es  with inform on benefit that is less  e than that in the eci   these uncertainti have made it more difficult to interpret formal model of price determin that reli on

tight of labor market and the upturn in import and energi price last year   the  book project also call for some acceler  but not so much as project by this model   in part  we have shade down our forecast on the thought that  with capac util rate still below histor averag  price pressur may remain more subdu than suggest by the unemploy rate   as a remind that scienc  such as it is  onli get

even this exercis underst the uncertainti you face by fail to account for the uncertainti surround the model   s basic specif of the inflat process   the lower panel dispens with an analyt framework

percent   with our project anticip the unemploy rate to hover near   percent over the next two year  we have clear enter a danger zone when judg by the histor perform of inflat   but even this stori is a bit murki   we   re expect capac util to move up over the next two year  but to remain in the    to        percent interv   as indic by the correspond bar in the lower left panel  that rang has been associ more often than not with a pickup in gdp price   but the frequenc of acceler in that rang  about two third of the  e  is not near so high as that suggest by our forecast of the unemploy

summari of histor behavior  by our reckon  one of the key factor behind the favor perform of recent year has been the pickup in potenti output and product growth  the subject of your next chart   as shown on line   in the upper panel  we are expect an acceler of potenti output to a   percent rate over      and       reflect a larger contribut from capit deepen  line     given our invest project  the growth of capit servic  the middl left panel  is project to trend still higher over the project interv   multifactor product  at the right  is expect to continu to increas near the   percent pace observ in the past sever year   the   percent annual rate increas that we are now project for structur product is near doubl the pace averag over the     s and earli     s   as has been note around this tabl  it is imposs to know just how far along we are in the process of implement new technolog and  consequ  what the scope is for even fa  growth of product   the lower panel of the exhibit plot the acceler of product  that is the chang in product growth  measur here over two year interv   as can be seen  product in the nonfarm busi sector  measur from either the product or the incom side  has been acceler in recent year   in our project  we expect actual product to remain close both to the   percent pace observ over the past coupl of year and to our es  of structur gain in product   but a further acceler certain cannot be rule out   your next chart updat a simul that we have present previous to lay out the sensit of our project to altern trajectori for structur product   as shown in the upper left panel  the first scenario  the red line  consid the consequ of a further acceler of structur product to   percent by the end of        in the remain panel  i display the econom consequ of that acceler use a simul of the board staff   s larg scale econometr model   for purpos of this exercis  i have assum that the feder fund rate is held to the baselin path   the growth of real gdp  the upper right panel  is much fa  under the more op ist product assumpt   firm and household boost     spend on equip  structur  and durabl good in respons to the improv futur prospect   as we have note in the past  in our model  the boost provid to aggreg demand exceed product augment suppli in the near term  and  in the simul  the unemploy rate  the middl left panel  declin to well below   percent   becaus wage respond sluggish to both the tighter labor market and the improv in product  compens inflat  at the right  is onli margin higher over the next two year than in the  book   that sluggish behavior of wage in the face of acceler product lead to an increas in the profit share  the lower left panel  which provid a boost to equiti price and feed back to stronger aggreg demand   fa  product growth and the competit pressur that follow fatter profit margin also help to keep a lid on price inflat  the right panel   core pce price inflat is project to level out at just under   percent in the fa  product scenario   of cours  it is possibl that we have gotten carri away by the stellar perform of product in the past few year   ani reliabl separ of structur from transient increas in product is difficult in the midst of an ongo expans   the second scenario shown in the upper left panel consid a gradual deceler in structur product to about   percent by the end of the forecast interv  well below the pace we believ has prevail in recent year but still more rapid than the      to      averag  obvious  the econom outcom would be consider less favor than in the  book   there would be a pronounc slow in the growth of real gdp and a clear upturn in the unemploy rate   with product slow more rapid than wage inflat  the profit share would drop  firm would rais price more quick in order to restor profit margin that are squeez by rise unit labor cost  and core pce inflat would move up toward       percent     will now complet our present
just to wrap up quick  the final chart summar the forecast you submit   the central tendenc for real gdp growth is       to       percent  somewhat below the  book number  and you see no signific chang in the unemploy rate over the cours of the year  as is the case in our forecast   your pce price inflat forecast is a tad lower than our  with a central tendenc of       to   percent   we don   t yet have the administr   s forecast  to which we customarili compar your in the humphrey hawkin report   my suspicion  howev  is that the administr will be predict less growth of gdp  with a weaker product perform   that conclud our prepar remark  mr  chairman
that was veri well done and i think quit inform  question for our colleagu   presid
you highlight at the end of your remark that you thought the administr   s forecast was like to be differ from your on the growth side  possibl becaus of differ assumpt about product   it would seem that most forecast are differ from your on the growth side   whether one look at the dri or blue chip forecast or other  almost everybodi is closer to the central tendenc of the reserv bank by this render of it than to the rather op ist growth pictur that you are show in the  book   i would be interest in ani thought or comment you have on that
it may just be that we are wild and crazi guy here    laughter
i love it when you say that
howev  we tri to temper our wild and do a littl homework  and i think dave   laid out the crux of our analysi   we   ve look in particular at what has been  and we expect will continu to be  rapid growth in the capit stock and the flow of capit servic   that growth   seem to have been pay off   we expect a sizabl contribut from capit deepen   we have assum what would seem to be rather moder improv in multifactor product  given recent perform   but there is a great deal of uncertainti   and mani forecast are wrestl  as we are  with the question of how much of the improv in product is solid and perman and how much reflect a transient element  with busi surpris by the strength of demand and thus press their avail resourc veri hard in the short run   if the improv is more perman than transient  they are go to attempt to bring their work forc up into what might be consid a more normal   align with their product level   and they may have difficulti do that in this labor   market   but our assess  as we look at the steadi of the product gain in the last few year and the ongo acceler  is that one should not attribut as much to the cyclic element of product perform as i think perhap the averag privat forecast has
it is also rather interest  though  that most of those forecast have assum much less tighten than you do   the averag tighten in all of the forecast is somewher between    and    basi point with someth on the order of    to     basi point less in term of growth
i don   t have enough inform on all of the individu forecast to be abl to analyz these differ   i think the product assumpt differ is part of the stori   it is propel perman incom growth higher   it is affect the stock market   some of the forecast  macro advisor  for exampl  for which we have the explicit piec  are still anticip a declin in stock price  which we are not   in some instanc i think these forecast do not have the same analysi of invest that we have  take into account this larg compon of replac invest   our invest forecast  i believ  is abov the consensus   and on hous we   re stronger than the consensus   again  we   ve been abov the consensus for a while  part on our analysi that there was a good backlog of order and that wealth effect might be signific   we think those condit are still in place   so  on all element of privat final demand we have a littl stronger pictur and a somewhat stronger view of the under fundament in mani instanc   now  some other folk have rise stock price and still have weaker demand   so it   s veri hard to
that   s just inconsist
one can have differ coeffici or a differ view of the wealth   effect and so on   one can attribut less of the strength in consumpt demand to normal wealth effect and more to the spate of mortgag refinanc last year or to just errat element  we recogn that we are abov the crowd but we are hard press  given our analysi  to come to the conclus that we should be materi lower at this point
could i just give an interpret of whi the staff has a somewhat differ perspect from most of the privat forecast   i think the main differ is that the staff here has a veri strong view of the interact of suppli and demand   this common forc of product is affect both demand and suppli   i think they have been proven veri accur in that   one  sn   t see that perspect in most of the privat forecast   so  when those forecast revis up their product growth es   they do not get the same demand impact  and that chang the whole dynam
i think that is exact right   in fact  the risk to the staff forecast may veri well be on the up side   the probabl that their forecast is too low is by no mean neglig
i might just say  in term of sign of strong demand  that we have receiv a preliminari read on januari auto sale   and they seem to have come in at almost    million unit       million  for light vehicl  which is well abov the rate we are anticip for the first quarter   so that in combin with the construct data this morn mean that we   ve had two piec of much stronger spend data than we had built into the  book forecast
thank you   i have a few question on the intern side and then    if i may  a question on dave     s present and the simul on chart     but first     on chart      i think these kind of simul are interest  but i want to get you to say a bit more about a scenario that might at least be consist with the exercis that you went through here   we see a lot of refer to the idea that the unit state has becom a debtor nation now and that our extern liabil are grow   i   ve probabl even talk that way myself on occas   but we know that a lot of the hold by foreign  the sourc of the capit inflow  the counterpart to this larg and mayb grow current account deficit  consist of asset that from the perspect of these foreign investor are denomin in dollar   we may think of some of it as debt  but to them it is an asset   and some of their hold are liter dollar   i would assum  the way the account is done  that if last year foreign increas their hold of u s  currenc by     billion  or whatev the number was   that it is count as part of our debt   so  that would be part of the financ that has been go on
in the balanc of payment statist it is log that way   it is not a huge number but  yes  it is count as debt
it is get pretti big   depend on what the rest of the world   with regard to so call dollar  it could get quit larg   i don   t know how much the russian alon acquir last year   the other dollar denomin asset that foreign hold   whether cds or other type of deposit in our bank  mutual fund  debt secur  equiti  or other kind of invest vehicl  are count as part of our debt   the part that in a sens realli is our debt is what they buy of uncl sam   s debt or debt instrument of other govern or corpor in the unit state   that is debt  whether held by domest or foreign investor    and appropri so   and to some extent we are on the receiv end of what on the basi of   anecdot report is an increas volum of direct foreign invest of all kind  acquisit of our compani includ  for exampl  supermarket chain and bank chain  which may increas too   suppos we superimpos on your simul two extrem       that all of the increas in foreign hold of dollar denomin asset realli is uncl sam   s debt  or     the other extrem  that it is all equiti invest  portfolio invest  or direct invest of ani kind   would we draw differ conclus about the implic for the exchang rate of the dollar
you are read in here a step that is not truli on a piec of paper
that step is the notion that as this number get veri  veri larg it would inevit have some consequ on peopl   s willing to hold dollar and would produc a    percent devalu or a   percent devalu or whatev    the analysi that i have here  the model that i am abl to reli on  onli work from one side of this process   and it say   if the dollar   x  y would be the implic for the current account balanc   to answer your question  not have ani simul to draw on but just react to where i think you are go  i would say that it is true that the capit account is an import piec of the stori   the desir of foreign to invest in the unit state and to particip in the gain from the product develop that have occur in the unit state    i think  lie behind some of the develop we are see here   that is most evid in the fact that through much of the  e the deficit has been widen  over the past three year  let   s say  the dollar has been rise   that mean the capit account is go in this direct at the same  e that the current account is go the other way   that might lead one to take comfort in the notion that peopl   find attract the instrument they are buy in the unit state   if we believ that the asset   valuat in u s  financi market are sound  there is no reason to think that is go to chang in ani hurri   it will over  e  taken at face valu  open up a gap between gdp and gnp   that in and of itself is no big deal  although i can imagin some politician will make a lot of nois about it   but in principl there is noth about the econom of have a gap between gdp and gnp that would be troublesom   we could well imagin that the world is make a ration and appropri alloc of global save into a major economi where product is higher than it is elsewher and where capit ought to be accumul   some of that capit is own by foreign and some of it is own by the resid of the unit state  and there is no problem  and that could continu for some  e   but i don   t think there is anyth about the form that foreign invest take  whether it is in portfolio or in direct invest  that necessarili assur that it will continu   that   s becaus if foreign were for ani reason  polit  econom  ration  or irrat  to decid that they were unhappi with their exposur to the u s  economi  they would avail themselv of financi instrument either to decreas that exposur or to hedg it   one can readili hedg foreign direct invest by sell financi asset short and view that as have protect oneself against certain kind of exchang rate develop or certain kind of econom develop   it is not the case that the form in which the capit enter the unit state necessarili impli anyth about futur behavior  so  while i put this forward as a warn flag  i don   t deni that  i do not think it necessarili impli that the dollar will come under pressur tomorrow or the next day or next year   but i would also say that there is noth automat about how the form of capit inflow will work out in the futur should there be a chang in investor sen ent toward hold claim on the unit state
okay  i accept that  and there is noth in this simul that   suggest a chang is immin   let me come at my question in a slight differ way  becaus i   m tri to understand this better   let   s start from the panel in the lower left where the exercis involv an assumpt that the dollar is devalu by    percent   my first reaction was to say to myself     okay  that s a use exercis to go through      then i start think about the fact that if the dollar were declin by    percent in valu over some  e period  other currenc would be rise by    percent against the dollar   and i can   t imagin ani currenc for which that might actual happen
i ll submit the euro  but i guess i ll throw that out    laughter
you ll never convinc me

think about the problem that the japanes economi is confront  i   m person quit pessimist about japan  so i don t think anyth posit is go to happen there ani  e soon   but all those peopl who are buy japanes equiti clear feel differ and have felt so for a while   and the peopl put upward pressur on the yen feel differ   the japanes economi might appear to be restructur and recov and might appear to offer return down the road that will be quit attract   nonetheless  the japanes current account surplus mean that exchang rate and interest rate have to be such that japanes investor are persuad to acquir net claim on the rest of the world each and everi month  no matter what  go forward   that  too  is a daunt thought   one might well believ that that is go to be hard to do after a while  if the japanes economi begin to recov
mayb the japanes are all ricardian   let me ask dave   a question about chart     if i may   these are interest scenario   this get back  i think  to   governor     s comment on the simul differ between other forecast model and the   staff   s model   under your scenario   in the staff   s model  wouldn   t it be the case  at least with partial analysi  that given the acceler in product and the correspond increas in real gdp growth you would have a deceler from the inherit rate of inflat correspond to that   to the extent that   not occur  then you would have to have  and i guess the model requir this  an acceler in nomin spend   that say that you don   t get all of the product gain in a lower price level over  e  a lower rate of inflat on an ongo basi  but rather some of it produc an increas in final demand   and that increas in demand has to be financ   so  is it implicit in this that there is an accommod polici on our part   either money growth acceler and all the credit come along to financ the greater spend or veloc must chang   what happen to make these thing come togeth
in fact the under assumpt here is that monetari polici accommod this step up in nomin gdp   there would be an increas in money growth to go along with that   obvious  this is a short run scenario   i think the simul that are present in the bluebook tri to give a flavor of the case where we are in the midst of an acceler in product and the equilibrium real fund rate has to go up along with that   this in effect say that you could hold on for anoth two year and experi a period where the unemploy rate declin even further and the inflat rate basic stay where it has been   now  at the end of that two year  you are not where you need to be ul    in some sens the fund rate and the entir structur of interest rate will have to move higher over the longer term in order to sustain that low inflat
okay   but  and i think this is a veri import point  the simul   not allow the real interest rate to move up to the equilibrium level becaus you don t let the   inflat rate come down   that is the way the model work   we don   t get that automat   increas in the real rate that would come along with the deceler of inflat  and therefor the real rate has to rise out in the futur to get thing back into balanc
in the constant feder fund rate scenario  there is a veri small increas in the real feder fund rate just becaus of the slight lower inflat rate   but your point is exact correct
okay  thank you
i have a question about japan   recent the financ ministri indic that it might be borrow at     percent as oppos to issu    year bond that would cost     percent   i have a few question on this and i will tri to sound object in ask them   first  is this an astut financi strategi or is it a                        given all of the financ that they have to do   second  is this chapter    so to speak  of capit inject into the bank system  which would suggest that perhap bank realli have not turn the corner in japan   i must admit that it seem realli  to use a neutral term     interest    at a  e when long term postal save deposit are come due and are be renew at     percent  that the financ ministri is go to borrow from bank  which is a narrow privat group  at     percent   it seem to me that that would caus tremend polit problem
the onli inform i have on this is from the new york  e articl that i read   we have talk about this among the staff and have tri to figur it out  there are various hypothes about how to understand what is go on  though i can t distinguish among them   and i put into this particular stew the fact that the bank of japan has announc that it will be busi sell bill into the market over the short run to absorb excess   liquid   the ministri of financ say                                                                                           that   they are tri to mobil fund that they view as sit around in the bank system do noth   they haven t admit that this is some sort of approach to a credit crunch situat  they see these fund sit there and they are go to util the resourc   so they propos to borrow to provid to local govern fund that they are oblig to provid under budget provis that alreadi exist   in essenc they are borrow from the bank system to financ this   the right altern  presum  would have been to issu more japanes govern bond  jgbs    and one might imagin that the bank would have taken these idl fund that are be provid for them and bought jgbs at   basi point
so  one possibl is that this is a way to give the bank a bit more incom   one might ask  as i have  whether the ministri of financ think that becaus this is a relat more attract instrument bank will provid more financ than they would have through the direct jgb rout   if so  when all is said and done  in some sens the ministri of financ is go to be abl to expand the amount of financ it can do becaus it is not just a one for one swap that will appear on the book but in effect has no polici implic   the ministri of financ might actual have to do less financ in the open market as a consequ of have issu an instrument that is particular attract to bank  therebi increas the willing of bank to hold claim on the japanes govern   if that were the case  the ministri could say that  yes  it paid a bit more but actual sold more into the market   if it did more in the jgb market than it would have otherwis  if it just has to sell as much as it has to sell with noth els go on  this is not a crazi scheme from the point of view of the ministri of financ  i guess    a coupl of thing about it worri me   one is that it seem to be at odd with what the   bank of japan is do        anoth concern is that all those jgbs sit out there are go to sell for enorm capit loss when japanes long term rate realli move   so they end up with a bank system into which they have put a larg amount of capit and bare gotten ani effect   the bank system is not fix by ani mean   if the economi were to recov  as they deal with the cycl of debt they are creat  this undercut that process by put more capit loss on the book of japanes bank   these instrument presum won t be trade in the market  they won t be mark to market and won t show capit loss   at least they won t show them ani  e soon becaus they are go to be sell at rate that are abov market for a while anyway   this may be a way of tri to improv bank balanc sheet  a way of give them return of   percent instead of   basi point  becaus they are go to need it

thank you   i have a question about the simul as well      the  book show a baselin simul and a flat fund rate simul   as i look at the analysi  it seem to impli a sacrific ratio of about one   in the bluebook the sacrific ratio is much wors   i am tri to understand what caus the differ   is it differ assumpt about credibl or about how expect are form   i don t know what it is
it is a differ  e period   our sacrific ratio in the bluebook is calcul over a full ten year when all the lag work out   it might be veri differ in the short run than over the long run
realli   but it involv a differ of     percentag point   a    differ in the unemploy rate and a    differ in the pce price number
in the short run the exchang rate dynam exagger this respons  that   s probabl an import element in get an effect this big
all right   then let me ask about the bluebook sacrific ratio   i don   t know what your credibl assumpt is  but it seem realli high
it is a littl higher than we ve had in the past  but not much   it is consist with the model look out over the longer run   it is a fair high sacrific ratio  i think  compar to some other model  but it is not out of the bound   the baselin simul over the next two year has a   percent plus nairu gap and onli a veri small upward creep in inflat   that impli a pretti high sacrific ratio   that   s great when the unemploy rate is below nairu becaus it  sn   t result in much upward creep in inflat   obvious  if you want to lower inflat  you have to be a lot abov nairu for a long  e to get inflat to   come down   so  this sacrific ratio was intend to be consist with the basic stori in the    book in term of how fast inflat would acceler over the next few year given the assum output gap   it   s import to recogn that there are a lot of thing go on in the  book scenario that have to do with price shock  oil price move  and so forth   but this analysi tri to abstract from that and get at the under slope of the phillip curv
one of the thing we have point out befor repeat in these model simul is that the same output path generat through a differ stock market assumpt versus a differ monetari polici assumpt will have much larger expect effect in the monetari polici case   it is quit plausibl that if the fed were perceiv to be do noth in the face of this declin in the unemploy rate and the acceler in price  peopl s inflat expect would be mark up consider   so  that chang in expect would exagger the effect in this kind of scenario   but this   generat a signific declin in the dollar on exchang market and that exacerb the inflationari effect
i want to go back to chart         it look as though you have an assum exogen chang in an endogen variabl   that   s someth i have spent    year tri to tell my student not to do
but i use a partial equilibrium model  so it s okay    laughter
i m speechless    laughter
there is noth about these simul that is intend to suggest how the dollar would react or to caus chang in the dollar   this is simpli a statement that say   if both foreign growth and u s  growth were at potenti  as best we know it  and if the   dollar were to follow this path  this would be the outcom of the current recoveri   noth here   is meant to be predict of what drive the dollar
i guess the question is   what can one learn from such an experi when by it veri natur  if it   s partial equilibrium  it involv a whole lot of thing that don t add up   the model that you have is now intern inconsist
what i think one can learn from this analysi is that those who believ a return to stronger  more vigor growth abroad will solv the extern balanc problem of the unit state are mistaken   unless the paramet that relat trade to it near term determin chang a lot and chang soon  it is not the case that a resumpt of foreign growth will have the effect of close the u s  extern gap
this contradict to some degre what i was say earlier in my comparison of various forecast   but  if you look at outsid forecast  mani of them have the net export balanc reach a nadir some  this year  either flatten out or turn   and they have had this kind of pattern for a while   we have not been abl to understand whi  given our analysi of the elast involv   yet peopl still do seem to have this notion in their mind that strength in these foreign economi will have this result or that our import elast isn   t as strong as it seem to be
and dave  with respect to your simul  let me ask someth that i think has been hint at around the edg in two or three previous question   in the  book prepar last  e for our decemb meet  you had an assum increas of    basi point in the fund rate in the work   in this  book you have an increas of     basi point   if one look at these simul  the analysi suggest that we are behind the curv   unless scenario   occur   so let me ask what you think the odd are of scenario   materi    everyth els suggest that we are behind the curv
i am not sure i would character scenario   in quit the same way you have character it   in fact  one could argu  and i think this may be what presid jordan was argu  that in scenario   you fall further behind the curv in the sens that even though inflat is not pick up  the unemploy rate is fall even further below it equilibrium   inde  the real feder fund rate is fall even further below it long run equilibrium   in that scenario we are enjoy anoth period of sustain  strong econom growth and low inflat   but there is still a fair amount of work to be done in scenario   in term of adjust polici at some point down the road in order to bring the fund rate back into equilibrium   now  you will inherit a lower rate of inflat after go through that process  which is certain someth that benefit you   but while it is good news for this two year period  there is still polici tighten to be done further down the road   that  in fact  is what some of the longer run bluebook simul are show  now  in term of the probabl  if one were to judg the probabl of scenario   by the staff forecast error of recent year  one might say that it is not entir implaus   laughter   obvious  we think we have a relat balanc set of risk in our forecast   but as seen in chart     the most recent observ show that product is still acceler   so  it is not entir clear that the probabl are split right down the middl between scenario   and scenario
that   s interest   thank you
could i just follow up on that   in judg that probabl you might want to indic what the path of invest would have to be in the model to produc the capit   deepen requir to achiev that scenario  given that the capit deepen is what has been   generat most of the uptick in trend product
that is true   but in this particular scenario  that fa  product growth is generat in part through the more rapid multifactor product growth that we   ve had   and there   s some addit to that from the capit deepen   so both of those factor are work here
to underscor that point  i hope all of you saw the pre fomc brief from ye day   our multifactor product trend here pale by comparison to what has been experienc in some long period of this countri s econom histori   so that could well be a compon of a better product perform
yes  but that   s almost pull someth out of the hat in a way   it seem to me that the big stori here is the increas in capit deepen   if you want to play the stori out  i think you need to trace through what would be need to get so much more capit deepen to produc that acceler in product
but if one thought that this invest was mere the prelud to put in place more effici oper and so on  one might say the payoff in multifactor product still lie ahead   if one want to be a new wave op ist here  it is certain possibl to come up with stori in which the assumpt are more generous   we feel that we have a reason balanc scenario in our baselin forecast  obvious   we are far more op ist than other forecast by and larg  and yet we think this is a sensibl look at the prospect
there is an interest interplay between what   was say and what larri has just said   the strength of the dollar in the face of this widen current account deficit is appar the consequ of the increas rate of return on facil    which is relat to capit deepen   that relationship has been fair strong  at least up until   the immedi forecast  so that there is a tie among all of these simultan simul in which lot of thing are occur   if you pull one string  the whole thing unravel
just to grab onto one more string  though  it is possibl that the buoyanc of the dollar has had someth to do with what some might argu was a bubbl situat in the equiti market   so peopl may have exagger idea of the prospect return from these invest
domest and foreign investor   but foreign are play a role in this  invest in what they perceiv to be veri  veri profit u s  ventur
shall we break for coffe befor it get frozen
may i add one comment relat to this   go back to   s chart     we have been do a great deal of work on the current account deficit as a percentag of gdp   in a way the work we   ve done was driven by the notion that given almost ani reason pattern one assum for the world economi  the current account deficit as a percentag of gdp continu to worsen   as one goe from deep concern to sheer terror about that prospect  the question aris as to what can possibl be done about it   so one come out with question like    what happen if there is a    percent devalu      just about all the analysi we have done indic that a continu worsen of the current account deficit is inevit until and if  ration or irrat  as   suggest  foreign decid that they don t want to hold these asset ani more   go back to     s present and look at what has happen to the euro   everybodi who thought it was wonder to invest unhedg in euro asset all of a sudden decid that that wasn t such a veri good idea   so over a period of a   coupl of day the hedg went up   nobodi had to sell ani of their under asset  they just   hedg them   that drive home the valid of the point that   was make   there is veri littl distinct between foreign direct invest in bond and bank deposit and anyth els  onc a foreign decid that he  sn t like dollar asset  the deriv market get a veri deep and immedi opportun to do someth about it   now  there is no way in the world that we can predict when it might happen   but it certain seem to me to be a veri clear and present danger   we just don t know whether it will happen eight year from now  eight day from now  tomorrow morn  or never   the least like prospect of all is that it will never happen  it seem to me someth that clear has to be taken into serious consider
as herb stein said     if thing can   t continu  they won t
right  they won t
let   s have coffe   coffe break
if there are no further question for our colleagu  would somebodi like to start the committe s discuss    presid jordan  do you have a question or
i   m just volunt to start the discuss  bank in the district have report that both commerci and consum loan demand remain strong in near all the earli week of the new year   in the mortgag area  while refinanc activ has dri up complet  mortgag loan applic jump sharpli in the past two week  we are told   one banker said he think mortgag loan demand is be s ul by peopl s belief that interest rate will be higher later   we have heard quit a few   report that deposit growth evapor complet in the first few week of the year and  with the   cost of fund rise  that interest margin are under pressur   one larg region bank report that they are alreadi in the process of put through a round of loan repric dure this quarter to offset partial the squeez they are feel on their interest margin  a banker with a fair good size institut told us that bank stock mutual fund are experienc veri substanti runoff  which is forc the sale of bank stock out of these fund  he said there are sever larg block of bank stock current be price for sale on the market  he note  base on his own experi  that foreign interest in buy u s  bank is increas  from the perspect of foreign investor it is bottom fish  e  in motor vehicl  though we don   t have ani solid number for januari  we were told that auto sale were veri strong dure the month  along the line of what     report  steel is look quit good and the mood of peopl in that industri is the best we   ve seen in at least a coupl of year   both domest steel consumpt and product are increas   import volum declin last year and appear to be continu to fall  so order for domest product have been rise   some steel price increas have alreadi been implement and further increas have been announc to go into effect april     so  we will have to see whether the market can withstand those increas or not  let me make a coupl of comment about the nation economi and the global economi in term of the context in which we   re make polici decis   i thought  and i m sure everyon will agre  that the chairman s speech on januari   th was an outstand framework for think about the environ in which we find ourselv   it provid a basi for a dialogu insid the system as well as outsid the system about the broader implic of   the challeng of monetari stabil   that overal concept includ what we call price stabil but   encompass much more than that   the challeng is to tri to maintain some sort of equilibrium  the messag for the rest of the world is a hope one   other nation may be at best in the veri earli stage of experienc the kind of product gain we have had over the past sever year   and if other place around the world get into the type of reinforc virtuous cycl that we have had  that may help them work out of some of their veri deep and long last problem   but the messag for us is that when the acceler of product occur  we did not get the full effect pass through into a sustain drop in the price level   so we did not get the automat increas in the real interest rate that might otherwis have happen   we reli on these other safeti valv  as the speech i thought describ veri well   our relianc on those other safeti valv is problemat becaus those thing can chang  whether on the fiscal side  the labor market side  or the immigr side   and we have to be veri awar that our own polici respons may be influenc heavili by the action of other in these area  especi on the fiscal side

thank you  mr  chairman   as we look back on      in new england  we see an economi that has recov from the shock of the asian crisi to it manufactur base   we see an economi whose construct  retail  and busi and financi servic sector have experienc healthi employ increas   and we see an economi that seem pois for a continu of quit solid growth  there are some darken cloud in the pictur  howev   the suppli of avail labor  and not just skill labor  seem lower than ever as evidenc by anecdot from contact and by the long line at most retail outlet even after the christma rush   inde  from      to      new england s labor forc regist an averag annual increas of zero in contrast to the nation s growth of     percent per year over the same period   these data mask some tempor variat  as the area experienc out migrat of labor earli in the period and growth more recent  and variat among the state as well  with the labor forc grow more rapid in northern new england than in the southern region   but the data do highlight a pictur of veri tight labor suppli   inde  this shortag of labor is wide consid to be a key factor in restrain region growth   clear  this would seem to be a  e for wage to acceler  and mayb they will   but for now contact report that plan wage increas are not much higher than in other recent year  in the rang of   to   percent  though bonus may well be substanti more than last year   it appear that busi have continu to cope with tight   labor condit by restructur process  improv effici  train exist worker  and   invest in new technolog   inde  at a recent meet of the bank   s small busi new england advisori council  one member state that he had no choic but to continu invest in technolog as it was the onli feasibl answer to continu labor shortag   these small firm all report an upsw in busi over the internet  a develop they view as have potenti cost save or revenu enhanc benefit   howev  all view the problem of get good to internet buyer  so call    fulfil     as a difficult challeng  the other major cloud on the new england horizon  and the nation   s as well  involv health care   the region s largest and one of the nation s most well regard hmos was put into receivership in januari with loss that rang from      million to      million  depend on which news account one read   two state  vermont and rhode island  no longer have ani local hmo coverag   provid of servic to hmos  the hospit in particular  are reel from cutback in medicar due to provis of the balanc budget act  and there is real concern that if the hmo in receivership end up be fold  it may take a hospit or two with it  boston s medic care cost were grow at a pace abov that of the nation prior to this develop   that trend is like to continu if not worsen   in part this may be a region phenomenon  given the number of teach hospit in the region  all of which seem to be particular affect by chang in feder fund   in addit  the larg hmo in question appear to have been poor manag  especi in the inform technolog area   howev  the under pattern of hmos offer lowbal premium to custom in order to expand market share  and somehow expect to make it up on volum in an environ of rise drug and other cost  is not uniqu to new england   in that regard  i would expect the increas in benefit cost in the most recent eci data not to be the last    asid from these worri  much about the new england economi is veri upbeat   as i   note  manufactur have recov from the asian crisi  and mani compani  especi fast growth  high tech firm  are especi upbeat   there are pressur on input price  especi on materi that have a petroleum base   some attribut these pressur not onli to rise oil cost but also to greater strength in asia   in particular  subcontractor in the far east are charg more or have stop offer quantiti discount becaus their capac util is now quit high   but here again there is a determin to hold the line   most of our contact said input price would be rise even fa  if their firm were not make a consider effort to seek out lower price through strateg sourc  global procur negoti  or longer contract  contact continu to believ that they cannot rais price  particular for commod type product or for good they are sell to larg buyer like the big three auto manufactur or wal mart  final  real estat market remain vari by citi but are extrem tight in boston  rent for class a offic space in boston remain veri high  with new suppli come on line veri slowli   on the residenti side  sale volum in      was about the same as in       but price rose strong in most market   limit inventori of properti for sale are the like reason for both the volum and the price data observ   new hous construct slow  with permit and construct contract in the fourth quarter below year earlier level   but that may be as much a function of constraint in the suppli of construct worker and build materi as it is a reflect of ani eas of demand  on the nation scene  there clear is no eas of demand   for some  e now our own forecast in boston and those of the  book as well have assum that the current expans would slow somewhat on it own   sooner or later consum would decid that they   didn t need or want anoth hous or car and that they did need to increas their save for the   futur   consumpt would slow  moder corpor profit and slow the rise in the trade deficit  and the stock market might even level off nice in an atmospher of a littl less euphoria   in short  we thought realiti might just bite a littl   we have been expect someth like this for three year or so but it hasn t happen  and there aren t ani sign that it will happen  instead  consumpt is boom  confid is high  the save rate is even lower  the trade deficit is higher  and consum are borrow more and more   and nonfarm  nonfinanci corpor debt  while certain still afford  is grow rapid and hit rather high level  at least relat to gdp   so i m glad to see that in both our own forecast and that of the  book the idea that the economi will slow on it own appear to have been abandon   the  book project  as do we  that substanti polici tighten is necessari to bring the economi back to a reason balanc between demand and suppli  various aspect of suppli remain in question  howev  at least in our view   the longer term altern in the  book and the bluebook have the rate of growth for potenti output at around   percent in the near term  the next two to five year  and a nairu of somewher around       percent   i must admit  though  that the bluebook   confess to a fair amount of uncertainti about the latter   howev  as the bluebook s altern so clear illustr  other assumpt about potenti and labor market capac constraint are possibl and perhap reason   for our part  we remain somewhat agnost about whether product will continu to grow over the next five year at the pace of the last two or three year   but we think  at least for the near term  that the nairu might be lower than the board staff   s es   so with about the same amount of tighten in       we have growth slow to about our   es  of potenti        percent or so  slower than in the  book forecast  but with near   the same result in term of price and unemploy  of cours  other assumpt are possibl as well   one can take a more op ist view about both the growth in potenti and the nairu and make a case that veri littl  if ani  tighten is need to bring demand and suppli into balanc   but to take such a view would  i believ  run an increas risk of further imbal   as i look at both household and corpor balanc sheet  i see grow liabil and debt servic burden that are reason onli when one factor in grow market valu of asset and relat low debt servic cost   it goe without say that this is an economi that is increas vulner to chang in market percept  market price  and interest rate   and it appear that this is an economi that increas buy into the idea that thing go onli in one direct  that take me to the major risk we face when think about econom forecast  which is the risk that polici action taken to tighten credit condit may caus larg market reaction that not onli affect u s  balanc sheet but caus foreign inflow to our market to declin as well   the  book forecast has move away from an assumpt that polici tighten will caus market valu to declin   the stock market flatten out but   not turn down   person  i think that is a reason assumpt base on the experi of the late     s and     s  and it figur into our own forecast as well   but in mani way  that would be the ideal outcom   so  i think it would be wise to be a bit agnost in that regard as well   thank you
econom growth in the eleventh district has been strengthen over the last few month   it turn out  after some revis in the data  that employ growth   was veri  veri slow in the first half of last year but pick up nice in the second half   that   pickup is expect to continu as texa feel the lag effect of higher oil price   the energi industri is show definit sign of rebound   produc are more confid  thank to strength in asian economi and increas confid in opec s solidar   most of the gain in drill activ has been for gas so far  but recent we are see some shift in emphasi toward oil drill   in the high tech area  semiconductor manufactur have been revis up their forecast for       consist with what bob parri just said  demand has been especi heavi for telecommun chip   one of our director note at our board meet a coupl of week ago that the pickup in chip demand from asia has been especi strong  underscor other evid of a rebound in asian economi  both home build and commerci construct activ have been show sign of cool  probabl due as much to overbuild as to higher interest rate   it seem that construct activ has becom more sensit to grow inventori and suppli demand imbal in recent year   the benefit of inform technolog for inventori control are becom more pervas in the economi   in spite of the texa unemploy rate be near it    year low at     percent in novemb  wage gain have been moder across a wide rang of sector  overal  there seem to be an absenc of inflationari pressur in the eleventh district other than for good whose price are tie to oil   we ve seen some eas in price pressur for sheet rock and cement  but one of our director note upward pressur on the price of asphalt  reflect the strength in non build construct  that is  road construct  turn to the nation economi  my forecast is pretti close to the staff   s  the main except is that i see somewhat less inflat than they do   in fact  i turn in a   percent   number for real gdp growth this year  just a bit less than the staff   s     percent   that mean i m   go to be increas my forecast and i imagin     may be reduc his as well  i have one piec of anecdot inform that support the view that the economi is veri exuber on a nation basi   i took my annual trip to vanderbilt univers in nashvill last week to speak to former governor daan   s class   as usual  he had me meet with a group of nashvill businesspeopl beforehand   the main convers at lunch was whether they were go to have to pay closer to       or       for scalp ticket to the super bowl   those nashvill busi titan were take their footbal veri serious   the dalla busi communiti  incident  feel that some part of the countri take footbal too serious   laughter

the situat in our district is veri similar to the one jack guynn and other describ for the rest of the southeast   by all account econom activ has expand veri strong sinc our meet here in decemb   consum spend was especi   strong in the holiday season and remain robust in januari   we have had inform on strong   car sale  which is consist with the number     mention earlier   manufactur activ also remain robust apart from textil   we had seen some moder  i guess that   s the way i would put it  in both residenti and commerci construct and sale befor the bad weather   we got a whale of a moder with the snowstorm last week   but overal  i think the slow has been fair modest to this point   some of it reflect suppli constraint  shortag of worker and construct materi   and there have been delay in some plan new construct  includ the put in place of infrastructur  also ul  reflect suppli constraint  the region inform that has struck me the most in recent week has to do with labor market and price   i don t want to belabor the tight labor market theme ani further  but the increas difficulti of find qualifi worker across a broad rang of servic and manufactur industri is realli the key preoccup of all our busi contact   in addit to construct worker  nurs and teacher are in especi tight suppli at the moment   and in this environ  as ed   just mention for his district  we are hear more report of signific wage and salari increas   in our regular month survey of manufactur  most respond now report that they expect a much broader acceler of wage over the next sever month than they did two or three month ago  regard price  for year now we have receiv innumer report  complaint actual  about a lack of price power   perhap a bit differ from what cathi   was say about new england  i have a sens that this may be erod somewhat in our region   a few businesspeopl  and mayb more than a few  are tell us open now that they feel they have more price flexibl than they had  say  a year or so ago   i don t want to exagger this   point   sizabl price increas are still not widespread in our area  but the price atmospher  if i   can put it that way  seem to be chang a bit  as far as the nation pictur is concern  our forecast is veri close to the  book forecast except on inflat   on the predict for the core pce inflat rate  unlik bob    we were a littl higher rather than lower   it s a strong forecast but i still think the risk are primarili on the up side   and that s a point that seem to me to have been underscor by the data we receiv on friday and by the data releas today that     mention earlier  i alway have a hard  e separ discuss of the econom outlook from discuss of polici  which is a problem relat to the way our meet are organ   i find that to be the case especi at this meet   but in that context  i found the various simul in the  book and the bluebook veri help and interest in tri to disentangl thing   i want to make a few comment about that  but i ll wait until tomorrow after don kohn give his brief on the bluebook and polici altern   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi has not chang appreci sinc our last meet and on balanc remain veri healthi overal   labor market do remain tight but wage pressur  though increas  are not increas dramat that we can tell   our agricultur sector continu pretti much as it has been  with low price and high subsidi make the outlook for that sector appear fair stabl   one thing i might mention about this expans is that rural america realli has share in some of the good  e   job growth in our region has been near as high as that for the nation on averag and  of cours  in our scenic and recreat area it has been substanti stronger   so  we   ve had good uniform growth in job across the rural area as well    let me talk a littl bit about the oil sector   even with the sizabl increas in oil   price  the effect on level of activ in our region have been relat modest so far   in talk with our director in that industri  he said that the industri right now is still budget in their capit budget at around     per barrel for oil   they feel that if opec can manag to do so it will maintain the price at between     and      not want it to go over     becaus that will spark interest among other oil produc   so that seem to be forestal the price   they are watch develop  in term of adjust their capit budget around those number and those price level   unless we see an acceler price level  his judgment is that explor budget won   t increas dramat  let me mention anoth local anecdot   the kansa citi southern railway run a railroad through texa  monterey  and all the way to mexico citi   i was visit with the head of that compani last week and he told me that the volum of traffic on the railroad over the last    to    month has increas by a good    percent in both direct   he said it was strike how much busi capit invest was be made all along that railroad   he said that the state of technolog at the manufactur plant was as good as it get and that the qualiti of the product come from there was as good as it get   interest  though  he also note that shipment of finish good  not just intermedi good  are also expand dramat along that rout as peopl   s incom and prospect improv   that may be a sign of more posit thing to come  let me turn to the nation economi   basic  i   m convinc that the u s  economi is experienc the effect of excess demand and that  base on the evid  pressur probabl are build   while my project are not as strong as those of the board staff  it   s a matter of degre and not direct   i see a greater likelihood that this demand will increas and continu to   outpac suppli  even though the sign on the suppli side are good   in my view this   put   increas pressur on price   and the situat is complic a bit further by what we refer to as    imbal    that are also persist  with level of debt rise and the current account deficit increas as well   all this to me suggest that there is perhap room for us to think about increas rate modest as a minimum respons   i   ll stop there   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the district economi remain veri strong and i won   t go into the detail except to comment on a few thing that have chang or are in the process of chang in the district   there are five thing that i want to mention briefli  first  on the bank side  banker report that they are continu to compet aggress for loan but  and the    but    is that they are tighten credit standard   and they report that they are encount examin who are encourag them to tighten credit standard   second  a glut of offic space is come   it may be a year or two or three off but  at least in our district  i think it   s pretti well bake in the cake right now   third  labor market  of cours  remain tight but we are start to see some upcreep in the rate of increas in wage and the frequenc with which wage are go up   fourth  as far as inflat is concern  we run a survey annual and this year   s result versus last year   s result show a deterior in the inflat outlook   more respond expect inflat of   percent or more this year than was former the case and more firm report that they are plan to rais price than was the case last year   whether those price plan reflect wish think or whether these firm will make their price increas stick  of cours  remain to be seen   final  and this is the first  e i   ve heard this comment  develop  especi residenti real estat develop  are express   concern about interest rate level and are start to believ that the higher rate will affect their   busi both this year and beyond  at the nation level  my view realli haven   t chang for quit some  e   i think we are well posit for further signific growth in the real economi   whether it will turn out to be       percent or   percent or even more  i don   t know   but growth in that rang look to me to be a pretti good bet   i   m much less confid about the outlook for inflat   we may see a meaning acceler of inflat but i have to say  as i   ve said befor  that i   m not entir persuad that labor market indic are good precursor of like develop on the inflat scene   and  of cours  one of the reason for that  though not the onli reason  is that we realli can   t say veri much about the outlook for product
mr  chairman  the second district   s economi began the new year with strong upward momentum   despit ongo cost increas in hous and manufactur  consum price inflat has actual deceler slight   unemploy rate in new jersey  new york state  and new york citi fell to    year low at year end  while privat sector job growth acceler to a     percent annual rate in decemb  up from     percent in the prior two month and   percent in the third quarter   retail indic that sale in januari were fair strong  with minim effect from either new york state   s tax free week or from the recent snowstorm  the general view express by our contact around the district and by busi leader who have a nation and intern reach is that certain in the unit state firm do not feel that they have price power   so  busi big and small have to run themselv better   and take advantag of inform technolog to be abl to preserv their profit margin without   the benefit of price increas  we had a particular interest meet of our small busi and agricultur advisori committe last week   manufactur  in particular one who produc and one who produc high sophist report that they were be hurt on the cost side larg becaus of increas cost of health benefit   but they said that they simpli had to use better inform technolog becaus they couldn   t pass these addit cost along in their price   in a busi that is about as tradit as one can think of  dairi farm  the use of technolog is astound  now has a piec of equip on each of his      cow that establish how much the cow is walk  how much the cow is eat  and how much the cow is produc   it also give    hour addit advanc warn on whether the cow is develop a respiratori problem so that medic can be administ earlier and  therefor  there isn   t a loss in milk product   the fellow who run sever                       has an inform system that is so incred that he actual knew when one of his restaur was miss    order of     the next morn he confront the restaur manag to ask him whi he wasn   t do a better job   these small anecdot would lead one to believ that the upsid potenti on product gain may be real   unfortun  becaus it has both a suppli and a demand side effect  it  sn   t make our job ani easier   what i view as a matter of great concern  as indic in the remark i made befor the coffe break  is that i think we face a veri clear danger from the grow current account deficit as a percentag of gdp   if there is anyth that tell us in the committe that we have to carri out our respons wise  steadili  and well  it is that
it strike me that the cow need a privaci act     laughter   governor
it   s hard to follow that  though i might say that as administr governor i want to find out about these machin    laughter   the staff and i will discuss that later  in a more serious vein  at the end of the last meet we state that we would review the incom data veri close for sign of imbal   the data we   ve receiv to date suggest that the economi is continu to expand at a fa  pace than it potenti  even if that potenti has gone up     brought in the most recent data on automobil sale  which are strong   and the recent eci data  even though the measur are flaw as i understand it  suggest that vigil is import   similar  the latest inform regard person incom and outlay suggest that consum continu to be veri will to spend beyond their incom  give credibl to both the op ist survey number and also to the worri that we have regard some imbal   with respect to the recent gdp number  i think i have been well educ by the staff and have done some independ analysi and have discov that in fact we should be relat agnost about those number   but they are not the onli one that suggest some strengthen of the economi  we had an earlier discuss regard the forecast  and in that regard i   d just like to make two observ   one is that the staff   expect both a shortfal in earn and a widen in the corpor financ gap  and implicit some high volatil in equiti market  as well as notic higher interest rate   all that suggest to me that it is not inconceiv that expect return on invest might weaken and  in conjunct with that  that the amount of   invest itself might weaken   that lead to one small intern inconsist perhap in the    book  though i understand how they got out of it  similar  the  book suggest that there should be a signific increas in short term interest rate   but it also suggest  in spite of that  that equiti market will tread water in the sens of end the year pretti much at the same level as they start the year   i have a grow concern that a placid surfac may disguis some under turmoil   i think the dispers that we saw among various indic at the veri begin of the year may suggest that this market is subject to some volatil  includ signific downsid correct  all of these consider are not meant in ani way to counter the various recit of strength in the economi that we have heard discuss today and will probabl hear more of dure the cours of the day   i  along with other  certain do think that the risk to good econom perform are primarili on the up side and that the equilibrium interest rate are probabl higher than the current market rate   howev  as a few other have suggest  i think we should be prepar to move polici increment and to use all of our tool care   to my mind  presid   put it correct   our goal here is to attempt to maintain maximum sustain growth as well as to tri to focus on price stabil   i believ we are enter a particular challeng year  with an economi that may prove to be    interest    in the sens of the chines proverb   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   our staff alway serv us well and i believ they have done so particular this  e   i appreci the inflat target exercis done in the bluebook  and i think there s a lot we can learn from it   as you all know  i have recent becom interest in this approach to monetari polici as a possibl mean of deal   with polici in an age of product shock   i tri to put some of my think into word in a   speech that i gave earlier this month   reaction from around the build were interest  some like inflat target  some do not   some say  what s the big deal  we alreadi do it  other say there is no way we can ever do it   i am fortifi by this consensus   laughter  and unlik al broaddus  i cannot wait until tomorrow to talk about the bluebook    laughter   i find it so excit that i   m go to tri to draw three lesson from that exercis  the first lesson  i think  is a fair obvious one   sinc the unemploy rate is now well below the structur es  of nairu  incipi inflationari pressur are out there  pressur that should be counteract by a fair sharp  earli rise in the fund rate   this is someth i think we   ve all more or less suspect for a while now  but the staff exercis is still valuabl in show just how high a fund rate is requir to stabil inflat  someth like   percent   of cours  this assum that the model are liter correct and we may not want to assum that   but i think we should take note of the general point  the second lesson is that preemption is good   again  we have all suspect that  but the staff exercis show that the inflat target fund rate has to rise anoth full percentag point or so if we wait to see actual acceler  and henc get behind the curv  wait will lead to larger variat in the fund rate   an ounc of prevent is worth a pound of cure  the third point is that in the present circumst revers seem to be  at least to me  relat unlik   the staff did an exercis assum that nairu is   percent   none of the profession forecast that larri   recent survey in a paper is prepar to go that low  though   percent is within the normal statist distribut of these es  and it is the es  from the recent paper by brainard and parri   for the sake of argument  the staff assum that   percent is the right number and then work back to the op  monetari polici    they still get a fund rate rise to   percent in the near futur   henc  even if we make some   earli tighten move becaus we have an old fashion  out of date view of nairu  the probabl seem to be relat slight that we will have to eat crow and revers those move  one could also do inflat target from what i   ll call the pipelin method  look for price that lead final good price   the ppi is one such measur   it rose rapid in the third quarter but has been pretti stabl sinc then  and was actual deceler in late      if the impact of oil is remov   much the same is true for import price   we think they are bound to rise at some point  but at this  e they seem to be relat stabl   commod price have by now revers their downward movement and are begin to trend up even apart from oil  and commod futur are up  the chairman has often told us that the singl most import number to him is unit labor cost base on the combin of wage cost and product   here the evid is still veri reassur   the recent eci number suggest that non wage labor cost may be trend up but still less so than the increas in labor product   at this point unit labor cost are rise less rapid than befor and  in fact  they are near stabl   not onli is this the chairman s most import number  i think it s also the most reassur number in all the pile of data that we have gotten in the intermeet period   in an out and out inflationari spiral  the rabbit of wage increas beat the turtl of product increas everi  e  but so far the turtl is ahead  next  let s look at what other forecast are say   the blue chip forecast are actual pretti mellow individu   on averag they are not predict a rise in inflat either for final good or for produc good   they are predict some increas in interest rate  so it seem that their inflat predict is base on an assum polici tighten   presum without the tighten they would be predict some acceler   in both the michigan and the   philadelphia fed survey forecast for price are also rise slight   in this case it s imposs   to tell what monetari polici their forecast are base on and it s hard to read the evid  then let   s look at the bond market   there the evid could  i think  be worthi of attent   for exampl  the interest rate on    year bond  nomin and real  recent have chang notic   just about a year ago the tip real yield was slight below   percent and the nomin yield was about       percent   the notic skittish bond market was at that  e build in veri littl inflat premium   now the real yield has gone up to about     percent  and even with it latest drop  the nomin yield is all the way up to     percent on    year bond  the bond market is now build in a pretti hefti inflat premium  presum due to current inflat of     percent or so  a major chang from last year   the potenti undo of the flight to qualiti around the turn of the year may partial complic this analysi  as would the treasuri buyback program   but rise expect of inflat must be a promin factor   the obvious implic is that inflat may be return as a key econom phenomenon motiv bond market  someth that i think none of us would like to have happen on our watch  from an inflat target perspect then  both the model and the bond market seem to me to be a vote for tighten   the other forecast are hard to read and i think the pipelin method signal an abstent  final  i would like to look at condit from what i ll call an equilibrium perspect   in a stabl growth economi with inflat rate settl in at the staff   s target of about   percent  the term premium on bond should be close to zero   the real rate on tip bond just allud to abov is about     percent   most financi peopl think there is rough a    basi point liquid premium for tip bond  given their thin market as compar to compar nomin bond   henc  the adjust real interest rate might be     percent or so   even with   stabl expect of   percent inflat  an inflat rate that we would be lucki to achiev   accord to the staff  the equilibrium level of nomin short term rate should then be on the order of     percent for a stabl growth stabl inflat economi   present rate are a bit south of that and i think most of us  in view of our feel about the balanc of risk  would like that balanc to be realign   the key question i think  as ed   mention  is how quick we realign and how grace we realign   thank you
mr  chairman  i   ll be veri brief   i don t have anyth to report in the st  loui district that add to what we alreadi have heard around the tabl   my contact at fedex and up confirm veri  veri vigor economi in asia   air cargo is at capac come from asia to the unit state and both fedex and up are talk about ad more capac  in the unit state  both firm find that the fourth quarter was better than they anticip   a survey of custom and potenti new custom at fedex indic a more vigor spring than had been anticip a short  e ago   so the outlook in the immedi futur is veri strong  both also report  though  that the labor situat is well under control   they see no problem with either staf or labor cost  no undu pressur there  on the nation pictur  i would simpli like to emphas my sens that it   s a lot easier to imagin that inflat will be a half point higher than the staff forecast than a half point lower
i want to share with you some observ about the outlook that shape my view about the appropri polici action tomorrow and the strategi that could guid us go forward   given the uncertainti that we face about trend growth  nairu  and inflat dynam  we   ve had to balanc the risk that we might fail to take full advantag of the higher   trend growth and the lower nairu against the risk of overh  higher inflat  and   increas econom instabl   as we have probe the limit of the new possibl  the risk of overh has increas  my first observ is that the risk have now becom signific tilt toward higher inflat   that judgment is base on the still more robust growth at the alreadi veri high labor util rate  by the dissip or revers of the favor relat price shock that have been restrain inflat  and by some sign of incipi pressur on nomin compens and inflat   while there have been consist upward revis to trend growth and a grow appreci of the import of higher product growth in explain recent macroeconom experi  the key challeng for monetari polici today deriv from the persist imbal between the growth in suppli and demand   from the perspect of monetari polici  the absolut valu of trend growth in gdp  whether it s now        or        or   percent  or whatev  is less import than the relat growth rate of demand and suppli  the higher trend product growth appear to have had simultan effect on demand as well as suppli via the invest boom to take advantag of profit opportun and via the consumpt boom driven by the surg in equiti valu and perhap expect of higher perman incom   i want to read a sentenc from the staff memo on the frb us model forecast prepar for this meet becaus i think it is veri tell      with trend product growth assum to be     percent rather than     percent  real gdp growth is boost by near     percentag point in      and by     percentag point in       hold the nomin fund rate and the nomin exchang rate at their assum valu      so      percent higher product growth result in     percentag point fa  growth in basic demand   that s the problem i think we are face    my second observ is that we should focus more on relat growth rate than on   absolut one  notwithstand uncertainti in the comparison   this point to the need to tighten despit op  about trend product growth   inflat prospect ul  relat to the balanc between the level of actual output and potenti output  not to their relat growth rate   i continu to believ that output has move beyond potenti and that the inflationari consequ of this imbal have been restrain by temporari effect associ with suppli develop  includ earlier relat price shock and  more import  the higher product growth itself   this has allow the economi to enjoy fa  growth and a higher level of output than is sustain in the longer term   the polici implic is that we have to recogn the serious possibl  in my view the likelihood  that we will need to encourag a transit back to more sustain macro condit  not onli in term of relat growth rate but ul  in term of relat level  my next observ is that the rise in interest rate necessari to balanc suppli and demand and contain inflat risk may initi be smaller than usual but ul  may be larger in a boom featur an increas in trend product growth   the temporari disinflationari effect of the suppli shock may at first limit the increas in interest rate  but given that the product upturn carri with it an increas in the equilibrium real rate  the cyclic rise in rate requir to contain inflat may ul  be larger than otherwis   wicksel   s framework of natur versus market rate provid a use perspect on this develop  the recent product upturn impli an increas in the economi s natur rate   at unchang market rate the gap between natur and market rate has widen  and monetari polici has in effect becom more s ul   onli when monetari polici move market rate enough to close this gap will the expans begin to slow    my final observ is that i believ we still have an opportun for a relat   benign transit to a soft land  if we begin the journey immedi  are prepar to implement a seri of tighten move and  most import  are will to toler a period of inflat abov our prefer rate  if we are alreadi oper beyond potenti and with growth abov trend  some rise in inflat is probabl inevit as the economi make a transit to a more sustain set of macro condit   what is call for is a polici path that endeavor to achiev what i have call a    revers soft land     a transit to potenti from growth abov potenti achiev by a period of below trend growth   this feat  i am compel to admit  has never befor been success accomplish   it is  nevertheless  achiev with precis in the bluebook   laughter   while there are some limit sign that inflationari pressur may be build  the inflat process still has a lot of inertia  and we may get some help from a declin in energi price over the next coupl of year   in addit  a revers soft land  requir as it   a slowdown to below trend growth for an extend period  is easier to achiev without recess in a fast growth economi like today s than in the slower growth economi of the     s and     s
thank you  mr  chairman   the afternoon is get on and by my talli i am the final speaker   but let me say a few brief word  if i may  about momentum in the economi and product  where the trend that have been in place for some  e seem to be continu  and about inflat  where it seem to me a chang is now potenti close at hand  momentum in the economi clear remain strong   the record high of the stock market and consum confid are result in continu strong consumpt   invest spend remain high  manifest by rise durabl good order and backlog of unship good   so   far  hous has not collaps  perhap be support by a shift to adjust rate financ as   mortgag rate rise  and export demand is rise   if sustain  it   s a bright outlook  product gain continu to be veri strong and i believ may be enhanc further in the upcom period as a fallout from the y k episod  million of manag and proprietor of econom unit  larg and small  profit and nonprofit  have attain a new level of awar and know how in the high tech arena   that   s truli a wonder prospect  but i am concern that the price level pictur may now be chang in an unfavor direct   as we know veri well  we   ve enjoy a superb mix of rise activ and declin inflat   this has been made possibl main by the surg in product  but product gain have not done it all   there has been signific help  and mani of those help factor are go away   as we expand  much of the world was in a slump until recent   consequ  we have seen the dollar rise  help to hold down import price even as we went on a buy spree that balloon the trade deficit but absorb consider excess demand   weak export demand also has freed domest capac to fill domest demand   we   ve enjoy weak commod price and for a  e collaps energi price   all of that has either ceas to help us or actual turn negat  with the tenuous except of the notori caprici energi price  which may fall again  domest  as new job continu to be creat  to our societi s great benefit  our remain avail labor pool get thinner  less skill  and less motiv   as demand continu strong  the effect of that develop have to show up in cost at some point and may be do so now   it may be too much to expect ani like level of product gain to carri almost alon the burden of maintain price level stabil in the near term environ   a number of price seri are begin to move   industri commod  the eci  core   pce  the cpi  the gdp deflat  and other measur had been stabl at low level but recent   have been show at least tentat sign of move upward   it is too soon to declar this a trend  but i suspect a trend may becom increas appar   it is still onli a t l and far from a flood  but i believ it is now our job to insur that it is not allow to becom a flood   i look forward to discuss how that can best be done while maintain a healthi rate of econom growth   thank you

has been stabl over most of it histori  while m  veloc has general trend down    the central tendenc of potenti output growth impli by your forecast for this year appear to be at about the       to       percent expans of real gdp you have  given the rough unchang unemploy rate   this growth rate for potenti  plus the es  inflat measur bias  would be veri close to the midpoint of the rang shown in altern ii   as you know  the staff has revis up it project for potenti output growth to about   percent over this year and next   though higher than your impli potenti growth es  and those of outsid forecast  product surpris have general been to the up side of late   these and other uncertainti are reflect in the idea of price stabil rang rather than point es    nevertheless  if you select the adjust rang given in altern ii  the humphrey hawkin report and tes oni could clarifi that the revis reflect the fa  expans of potenti gdp observ in recent year rather than a project of potenti growth go forward   it could also be state that if addit inform suggest a differ pace for potenti gdp  the committe could alter it benchmark rang again   in addit  the report could affirm that the adjust to the rang   not reflect ani chang in your long run goal of stabl price and   not signifi that ani greater weight would be place on the monetari aggreg in the formul of polici
question for bill
i am troubl by the idea  i know it was said last year and repeat again here  that fa  product growth mean we should rais the money growth rang   i     suppos in the   th centuri if we had discov we had fa  product growth  we would have said we have to go out and dig gold at a fa  rate   there is noth inher in our object for price stabil and what we are tri to do about the purchas power of money that say that when we have a favor suppli shock we should rais our money growth object   there   s no more reason to do that than to cut the money growth target if we had an advers suppli shock  we wouldn   t do that   i   m sure that back in the     s or the     s we didn   t argu for lower our target   what we want to do is to view the transitori effect of the acceler in product growth in a lower report rate of inflat or transitori declin in the price level as an increas in the purchas power of money   it would be a one  e declin in the price level  i don   t want to use that    d    word   and then when the suppli shock goe away  we would return toward the sort of balanc equilibrium that we would have been in  also  i don   t see whi it follow that leav the money growth rang alon communic that they are not import and that we have reduc the weight we give them   whi do we need to chang them to say that we are pay attent to them   and whi   not chang them mean we don   t pay attent to them
perhap i can respond to that   i think you are absolut right in the case of a temporari suppli shock   we would not expect the concept of some long run steadi state condit to be alter if there were a transitori suppli shock or temporari increas in product   if  in fact  you believ that the product growth surg we have experienc over the last four year or so is transitori and is go to go away soon  that would not be a reason to alter long run price stabil   howev  if you believ that there is a perman compon to those increas in product  which i think most peopl do  then presum you would be alter your expect steadi state of growth of nomin gdp   and if you believ that you need   to have compar growth rate of  say  m  to your expect steadi state growth of nomin   gdp to accommod that kind of steadi state expans  then presum you would want to be adjust up the long run rang for that aggreg
the part i am question is the linkag of say we should adjust up the nomin growth of gdp  it   s a sort of nomin spend effect   that was the point i was get at ye day with regard to dave     s simul   to be clear about it we ought to be explicit rather than implicit say that we want a monetari polici that is go to be    accommod    to nomin demand increas becaus we have a real suppli side favor develop   if we are go to do that  then let   s also think about the implic of be symmetr about the matter   if we were to have a surpris advers suppli shock  what would we be do then   would we say    let   s cut our money growth target      probabl not
of a perman natur  certain   if product growth shift down  as in       in order to achiev the feder reserv   s goal of stabl price and maximum employ  the fomc at that  e  though those were not the goal set forth in the feder reserv act at the  e  should have shift it target m  growth rate down   the question is what is a steadi state nomin gdp growth   and when you have a steadi chang in the rate of growth of product that is expect to persist for a while rather than be a one  e chang  consist with what bill said
in a sens the logic that is be appli here is the veri logic that got you to the current target   it   s just recalibr the target to a new  longer term trend
i would agre with what don said if it were the case that we had the abil to distinguish between an advers oil shock in           and someth that much later on the profess came to view as a secular trend in what we call product   i don   t know that   our abil to know what we are experienc at ani given  e allow us to make that judgment    the committe certain did not do it in the     s
not until veri late  right   i think to a certain extent you can observ what is go on   you can see thing like oil shock  dollar appreci or depreci  excis tax  or whatev that might chang a price level more than you can see an ongo chang in product  which i agre take some  e to recogn   this committe has been struggl with that for the last sever year   but it has been four year sinc it appear in retrospect that product growth chang   and i think it is true that by chang these rang you would be say that your best guess is  as bill said  that there is a perman compon to this chang in product and that you will have to reevalu that on an annual basi
isn   t the issu here a littl more limit   we are in effect  as best i can judg  assum that long term m  veloc is flat   in do that we are effect engag in es  long term nomin gdp   and the issu here is that if  and i underlin the word    if     price stabil is the goal defin  then what fall out is a specif rang of central tendenc for m    it strike me that the other question is whether it is bad if price are declin   in other word  if we hold to where we are now in the context of rise product and rise real growth  that is  keep nomin the same  we will then get declin long term price   that is a differ issu   and i think that   s a veri legi  question to be ask   it come down strict to the question of what our goal is over the long run   and have stipul that  if we assum stabl veloc  then the issu is what is the implicit m  project   i don   t think it is ani more complex than that   i don   t disagre with a word that you said  but i don   t disagre with a word that your oppon said in this debat either   so i rais the question   do we realli have a problem here
i think the issu is this   is our goal stabl money growth or stabl   inflat   if your goal is stabl money growth  you   ll take whatev inflat come out of it depend upon the product shock
that may be okay
that may be okay    but that is not the goal  as i understand it   we oper under a mandat of achiev price stabil  which i think indic not necessarili zero inflat but at least a stabl inflat rate   so we have to make a choic
as the chairman mention  given the midpoint of the exist rang of   percent  if we take your es  of potenti output plus a measur bias  impli nomin gdp of   percent as consist with price stabil  that mean you are aim for deflat of   percent per year
i agre that that   s an arithmet implic   we did not start this period with price stabil   had we start with price stabil and then later found out that we had an acceler of product growth  that would have been one thing   we did not do that  so to me an acceler of product growth when we   ve start with a posit rate of inflat  somehow measur  mean we have a deceler from that inherit rate to someth move toward price stabil   at the junctur where we are today and with concern like those be regist ye day by the staff and other  i would be afraid of what the messag that we are chang the rang would convey   rather than communic that we are go to put more emphasi on achiev a higher rate of growth  it would seem to say that we are more will to be accommod of an acceler of inflat   we could all say to ourselv that we are accommod fa  product growth   i might even be persuad that   that is the right thing to do   i think the messag that would be heard is that we are   accommod fa  inflat
suppos we say explicit that that is not the issu   we can say that we are tri to find the rang for price stabil and that we envisag that potenti growth has risen   and  therefor  other thing equal  the rang should go up if our object remain where it was sever year ago
i am sure you have the credibl to say that and be believ  i do not   i know that peopl wouldn   t believ me if i said that
i don   t believ that   in all serious  i do think  and i may be wrong in this  that to the extent we rais this question  we have the capac in the minut and the humphrey hawkin report and in speech we make to say that essenti noth has chang  that fundament our goal is price stabil   but if potenti has risen  of necess  unless there is a chang in incom veloc  our money suppli goal should be differ   as you said  it   s an arithmet truism
i think it is easi to attribut an adjust in the rang to product becaus nobodi actual believ that our goal in set the rang is pure price stabil  nobodi believ that our goal is just price stabil   so  in my view  peopl will not think that we are accommod higher inflat if we rais the rang
my question is relat to much of the discuss that has been go on   for altern ii  i think you said that the midpoint of   percent on m  is consist with a shift in product and also our goal of price stabil   so  potenti output growth would be in that   percent area and price stabil would be defin as zero inflat   i guess what is   troubl to me is that if nomin gdp is   percent  that mean the goal is zero on the gdp   deflat   if we went around the tabl  nobodi would give that number
i   m not sure if this answer your question  but what we are suggest is that the       percent potenti growth that has been observ
oh  i see
that plus a    percent measur bias   in other word  the measur gdp deflat would be    percent  but the true inflat would be zero
well  if that is what the group is happi with  i   m realli happi
that   s the way the rang have been construct for the last five year   that is  with the same reason and arithmet in mind   the committe might want to think about whether it want to chang that   but we were just be consist with what the committe has been do
i think be veri explicit about the number involv would be a good thing for us to do   suppos we were to say that our long term goal is   percent on the deflat and that we now es    percent on real growth as potenti  which add up to   percent   that would be all right with me   what i fear  howev  is that without be explicit about the inflat goal  peopl will read that   percent  given that price have been creep up a bit and most of the pressur are on the up side  as indic that we are go to accommod somewhat higher inflat   that is the messag that we would be give   that would be my fear if we are not explicit
that is clear the down side   there is no question that   if peopl were to read that as accommod more inflat  then the argument for move up  i think  is unambigu   but the point is that may not be the case  and that is the problem
well  as i said  if we are will to be veri explicit about what our long run inflat target is and what our es  of potenti growth is  then i think we can make the argument   and i believ we should   i   ve said befor that i think we should be much more explicit about our inflat target   in my view  that would be construct
we are essenti say that price stabil is our goal  you want a numer judgment of price stabil   is that the issu
yes  becaus given what i   ll call our    reveal prefer    in the way we actual have been behav  i think the market believ that we are perfect satisfi with an inflat rate somewher in the neighborhood of where it is right now   and that   s a littl abov what i would regard as zero inflat  proper measur  take account of the bias in the indic   my best guess is that someth like       percent on the cpi and   percent on the deflat  take account of measur bias  is a pretti good es  of what zero inflat realli is   we are somewhat abov that right now and i think the market believ that we are quit happi to be somewhat abov  as evidenc by our own reveal prefer in term of the decis we have made
i have not bought into chang the rang and i have some reluct to do that  given the discuss we are have   but suppos we do   if we rais the rang for m  and m  by a point  tell me again what we would say about debt   would the reason for not chang the debt rang be the reduc feder debt or what
we have never interpret the debt rang as be a long run   price stabil rang   we could move to that interpret on debt as well  if you thought that was desir  and make the interpret for all three of the rang consist and make all of them long run price stabil rang   if you want to do that  you could have the debt rang match that of m   becaus for long period of  e debt has grown at rate compar to nomin gdp growth   or if you take the declin in debt veloc of the     s veri serious and think that experi could be repeat in the futur  you might leav the debt rang right where it is at   to   percent and interpret it as a price stabil rang   but that is not how we have spoken of it in humphrey hawkin report in the past
i think you said it well  mr  chairman   one can make a pretti solid argument for make a chang  so i don   t feel that strong about not do so   but if we do  i believ there is go to be a signific communic issu  as bill pool and jerri jordan and other have point out   to me  this whole discuss is a good argument for a numer inflat target   we have to have a clear  nomin anchor in the long run   i think that is the key thing   so it is against that background that i would prefer to stay where we are   the other thing that bother me a littl is that while i certain have the sens that there has been an increas in trend product growth  i am uncertain how transitori it is and exact what it magnitud is   so  i don   t think the argument is absolut ironclad   and if we go that rout and tri to explain it that way  that is go to involv our take posit on thing that i am not quit readi to take a posit on yet   i don   t see ani particular reason to do that now
i would like to join bill pool and al broaddus on the comment that   you just heard   i  too  see consider merit in move in the direct of a more explicit inflat target   i don   t know whether we are go to talk about that some more this morn or not   but particular in the absenc of such a target  i believ it is much smarter to leav the rang alon for the moment   i think it could be distract   we have some much more import polici work to do and i don   t think we ought to confus the messag that we are send to the public at the moment
mr  chairman  chang these rang is alway a dicey issu these day becaus no matter what we say or what we do  there are more interpret than there is realiti   at the same  e  i could be talk into it becaus i think there is a build consensus that the rise trend in product improv is real   and if  in fact  we are will to accept that  and there may be some who are not  then move the target   make some sens in term of their consist with price stabil   and i do agre with what jerri jordan was say about how we might have react to product shock in earlier period  but i think thing are a littl differ now   on balanc  i could come down in favor of rais the rang
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to go back to the question portion of this discuss   on page    in the bluebook  don  you talk about a       percent trend product growth as oppos to someth in the high
that was trend potenti output growth when the committe first set these target
oh  yes  excus me   is       percent your trend product     growth
current it   s   percent
how much of that upward revis is the result of the chang in the nipa number
not veri much actual  in part becaus the staff   s current es  of potenti output growth in the mid     s  through the second quarter of       is still       percent   the current es  for the last four year  by contrast  is       percent  and then we have   percent go forward   there has been a ratchet up of potenti output growth es  with structur product  so that after the second quarter of      we move from       to about       percent   at the begin of      we have potenti output at       percent and then begin this year we   ve predict that it is   percent
so in the mid     s you had a potenti output growth of somewher around       to       percent and now it is a full percentag point higher than that
our es  is still that up to the second quarter of      potenti output growth was       percent   start this year we have it up       percentag point higher to   percent
in each case  we   ve done littl more than extrapol the recent experi for a near term period   in think about what you might want to do if you adjust the rang  one question would be your assumpt about potenti gdp growth   would you want to rest your assumpt on the experi of the past few year  where the behavior of the unemploy rate relat to gdp  for exampl  would seem consist with potenti output   growth somewher in the       percent rang or a littl higher   or would you want to look   forward in the op ist way that we have with an assumpt of about   percent
i understand exact what you want to do   i was just tri to get a handl on the effect of the nipa revis   i knew there was some effect  a few tenth of a percentag point  from the nipa revis all by themselv
a few tenth came from the chang
i   m just think about this communic issu
if ani portion of this product chang was realli the fallout of revis number in a better way  presum as a result of the nipa chang  that is someth that would help in communic the reason for a chang
cathi  if i could just comment veri quick on that   it  sn   t chang nomin   what the nipa revis have done is to chang the split between real output and price   so in that respect those revis do not realli bear on this issu
but they did chang product
that   s right  but there was an offset chang in the inflat number  essenti it chang the split of the nomin
i realiz that   that isn   t the point
but forward look  relev to think about the bias adjust in the price measur  if that were all that was go on  switch from one compon to the other in nomin gdp  then there would be a wash
back in the mid     s we think that perhap the bias was closer to a percentag point  wherea now it   s onli about    percentag point
now it   s about    percentag point  and i was think in term of   look forward  which is what these rang are suppos to be do   if we have a differ product number  in part becaus we think it was differ in the past  becaus of the chang in the break between the price bias and under real growth  then that give us a non polici orient reason for make a chang in our think about the growth rate in money  that said  i think the peopl who have comment on the communic difficulti have a point  particular in an environ in which we do not think the outlook for inflat is at all bias on the down side   it is not even bias  there is upward bias   whatev we want to say about risk  everyon around this tabl ye day talk about the under pressur on the economi   so i don   t think anybodi is satisfi with the exist state   the inflat number look okay  but the direct in which it is like to be move is not  the difficulti in communic our reason  if we chang the rang  is that it   tend to say someth about our willing to accommod the condit that exist right now  unless  as other peopl have said  we want to get a lot more precis
in term of the communic issu  presid    we did inform the public last juli that a chang in the rang might be come up becaus of adjust in our assess of product
i know you did
thank you  mr  chairman   i walk in here be realli quit agnost on this issu   i know it is a matter on which some peopl feel strong  but i was interest in hear both side   i have come to the conclus that perhap the better cours is just to leav well enough alon  not to make a chang at this stage  for a varieti of reason   jack   guynn rais one reason that to me is most import   dure the cours of this year  i suspect   we will be under a fair amount of scrutini about core polici matter  and i would prefer not to have to go into that period have to explain monetari aggreg issu  which frank are not terribl import to us right now  second  there is the whole issu  which also has come up  about numer inflat target   i happen to be one of those who think that the qualit inflat target that we have now has serv us well   and i see no reason to open that debat  which i think we would have to do in the cours of reach a decis to chang the rang  the third thing that worri me  as i listen to this convers  is that it will also forc us in some sens to be more explicit as a committe about our view on product and the product trend   and i   m not sure that i am hear consist among the committe member on those issu  final  i believ there is a lesson to be learn from some of our central bank colleagu around the world who are in a posit of have to talk about and defend their action vis  vis what is happen to growth in the monetari aggreg   in particular  the ecb  which has put more weight on money growth than perhap it should have  is be lambast week by week in the newspap for whi it is allow m  growth to be abov it target   i think we are in a much better posit in that we have clear said we are not put much weight on these aggreg  and so m  growth may or may not be abov our target   i frank prefer to be quit clear in our communic   we have enough other issu about which we need to be clear   if we just leav this one alon for the cours of this year  i think we will be in much better shape  given the other thing we are like to be do
i associ myself with governor     s   veri wise remark
well  now for a differ perspect  i suppos   i must say that this has been a veri interest discuss so far and i think we have identifi two issu relev to the target rang   the first is whether to revis them to reflect the fa  rate of growth of trend gdp   the second is what implicit inflat target we should use to set the midpoint of the revis rang  altern ii deal with the first issu and i believ perpetu the possibl misunderstand that our inflat target is pure price stabil  adjust onli for an es  of inflat bias   now  i say a possibl misunderstand becaus the committe has not fulli discuss it prefer inflat rate and certain hasn   t work to achiev a consensus on that point   as for the strict price stabil target that is implicit in the target rang today  we might ask this question     that realli make us look like the central bank most focus on price stabil around the world or like the central bank least transpar about it inflat object  i think it is the latter  i will offer an altern iii set of rang that incorpor my view that the implicit inflat target  set as the midpoint of the m  growth rate  should reflect what i   ve call price stabil plus a cushion   although there remain a lot of uncertainti about the precis valu of trend gdp growth and how it might evolv over the next sever year  i think the current monetari growth rang are outdat and bad in need of revis   now  i am comfort with the judgment reflect in altern ii that the rang should be updat to reflect an assumpt that trend gdp growth is current       percent   the humphrey hawkin report and tes oni   should emphas that the fomc will reconsid the set for the monetari aggreg rang   as incom inform lead us to revis our es  of trend real gdp growth   that is  instead of think of the monetari growth rang as be carv in stone  we should use them as digit  subject to costless adjust in respons to the flow of new inform  let me turn to the second issu  which is undoubt the more controversi one   i think we are send an implicit messag about how we defin price stabil when we set the rang   we can tri to escap from this realiti  but i doubt we will be success   ani chang in the rang  as mani peopl have alreadi indic  may result in a probe for our implicit inflat target   clear  we go through this exercis veri explicit when we set the rang   the question is how we present it to the public   should we blur this logic  ignor the issu entir  or be more transpar about it   i think the main  and mayb the onli  purpos of the monetari aggreg rang today is as a mean to offer an implicit inflat target   so perhap we should view today   s discuss of the rang as an opportun for an intern discuss about how we should set an inflat target that is consist with our interpret of price stabil   and we might also look at our discuss and decis today as an opportun for anoth step in the direct of transpar  i want to point out that  in my view  there is a subtl but veri real differ between an    explicit inflat target    and    inflat target      i do not understand how a central bank can conduct monetari polici to achiev price stabil without establish an inflat target consist with our interpret of price stabil   given that we want market to help us achiev this target  there is also a valu in be explicit about it   and i believ i can accept an explicit inflat target without have to sign on to a specif strategi for achiev that  which is what i interpret    inflat target    to be    other countri that have price stabil mandat and explicit numer target have   uniform set rang center on what i   ve refer to as price stabil plus a cushion   this  in my view  is an appropri option  in light of concern about a deterior in cyclic perform near zero inflat with a zero nomin interest rate valv   therefor  i offer as altern iii a rang center on my prefer midpoint of   percent   that reflect the sum of a       percent rate of trend growth in gdp  a    percentag point es  of bias in the chain measur of the price index for gdp  and a   percentag point cushion   and this suggest a   percent to   percent rang   this would be a small step to take toward an explicit inflat target and enhanc transpar  but it would be a big step for this committe to take  i will give you an altern strategi here  which would be to set a central rang rather than a point  with the bottom point be consist with pure price stabil and the upper point consist with price stabil plus a cushion   in this case  the central tendenc might be   to   percent   attach a symmetr rang about the central tendenc would yield a rang of   to   percent for m    this is analog to the australian approach of set a    thick    point target of   to   percent   it has it own problem  particular the indecis onc m  growth is insid the central rang   but it would allow us to defer a more precis set of the midpoint until a consensus could be reach in the committe and perhap until there was consult with congress
thank you  mr  chairman   this is an interest discuss  but from a practic standpoint i come back to exact the same place i have been the last     e i have been here when we have discuss this   and that is that we should not make ani chang in the rang   i think it would be mislead to the public for us to make a chang unless there is a   huge educ program up front   as other have said  a chang would give the impress that   we are place a lot of weight on these rang in the formul of monetari polici and we aren   t   i think the communic challeng are signific  not insurmount  but veri signific  becaus a lot of peopl don   t accept the premis that the economi   s potenti growth rate is as high as mani peopl around this tabl think it is these day   so we   d have to explain that as well  otherwis peopl are go to think that move these rang up indic that we are go to be conduct monetari polici in a way that they would view as inflationari  final  on the inflat target issu  the question is realli whether we should have a quantit inflat target   that is a veri import issu and i think it is one that should be discuss  but in my view it should be discuss separ and not in the context of these monetari polici rang   it is someth on which reason peopl obvious disagre   we have disagr around this tabl   i believ it is import to discuss it  but i realli think it call for a separ discuss entir
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i don   t have a lot to add   as mani peopl have alreadi observ  we have discuss all of this befor   in my own case  unlik in previous discuss  i do think that today both arithmet and substant the case for rais the rang is pretti strong   but i don   t feel veri strong about it becaus i think there is a communic challeng   have said that  my guess is that the communic challeng can be dealt with   i think market particip would get the messag pretti direct if we use the vehicl avail to us   but that is just a guess or a judgment   i could be wrong about that  so i don   t feel all that strong about rais the rang
governor   captur my view near complet and i    would like to associ myself with his comment
thank you  mr  chairman   after listen to this discuss  i have to say that i have revers the posit that i came in here with this morn   the question for me is  how perman is this higher rate of growth that we now perceiv   if it is perman  then i think we ought to move to altern ii   but i note that the concept of what sustain growth is has shift meaning in the past sever year   and it seem to me that it could veri well shift again  possibl in either direct   i note that  for veri good reason  we are abl to recogn and  if you will  formal accept these shift of what is sustain onli with a consider lag   so  if the dynam here involv what is sustain growth and it move around and we are abl to perceiv it with confid onli with a lag  then i think we run a consider risk of be out of sync a lot of the  e   if we go chase this explicit by move these rang around  i think it will be veri hard to explain and veri easili misunderstood or misinterpret by the public   and i see no compel reason to do it
thank you  mr  chairman   this comment is go to sound a bit tire and i apolog for that   i think transpar is good   and as i   ve said a number of  e  i think we would be well advis to move in the general direct of inflat target   at some point we might even tri to agre on explicit target   but i think right now we have bigger fight to fight and i   d just as soon pass on this particular one and not talk about explicit target in connect with these monetari rang   so i would prefer no chang  altern i
thank you   in the earlier comment period  i was in the question    mode  so i   ll state a view on this now   we are talk about two differ thing back and forth at  e here  about a belief in a sustain growth in product and potenti output and what would be an appropri stanc of monetari polici  especi as impli by monetari growth  versus acceler in product   those can  at least  be separ analyt in the way we think of them   if it was a matter of a consensus that we are go to have real growth on the order of   percent  through a combin of product gain and labor forc growth  and if in rais the rang it could be communic that the committe was pro growth  that is one thing   and i would have a hard  e object to that   if it is a question  though  of acceler and deceler with a fair degre of uncertainti about what is happen to product  then we run higher risk of miscommun our polici intent  i would be delight  as i think everybodi would be  if product growth acceler to the point where real output growth was   percent   but i still would not necessarili conclud that we should veri quick chang our monetari growth assumpt  that   s becaus with a favor product surpris  there is noth wrong with an increas in the purchas power of money   there is noth wrong with manifest and distribut the wealth gain through societi in the idea that the dollar buy more   we know that in most sector and industri where product growth is increas rapid  price are fall   and that is a good thing   there is no reason whi we should think that price of other good and servic need to rise fa  than they otherwis would have in order to hit some statist measur of averag price chang   so i don   t think we should rule out the idea that favor product develop can be accept as be associ with rise purchas power of money or a fall price level
i wish jerri hadn   t just said that
eras that from the record and start again    laughter
he made me have misgiv regard what i am about to say   i agre with gari  n   s ambival  i don   t feel strong about this issu one way or the other  but sinc i am on record as believ that product gain are not a transitori phenomenon and if consist suggest it  then i guess i would have a small prefer for rais the rang  although i could accept deflat as a way of take those product gain as well
mr  chairman  i like what governor   said  although i must admit i   d probabl be happier with a thinner cushion than he would   that lead me to think that a case can be made for altern ii   but i keep come back to the idea that we realli do not have much confid in our forecast of the aggreg and what they mean and that  therefor  it is probabl best not to draw attent to them   so  on balanc  i have a slight prefer for altern i   in either instanc  howev  i think we should make it clear that we are not target the aggreg and that our goal is price stabil  defin in the way that we talk about earlier
i came into the room  have been staunch against do anyth with the rang previous  at least think about the possibl of chang them becaus  unlik a lot of you around the tabl  i think the product chang are now unquestion real and  if anyth  still acceler   but the argument cite on the difficulti of communic the logic of a chang are realli quit persuas   and sinc we have been so success in defus interest in the rang  the question is   what do we gain by stir this   issu up   and the answer is not veri much except academ consist  which is not to be    dismiss materi  but it  sn   t strike me that that has been a high prioriti among our set of goal in general  let me just weigh in a littl on this price stabil question  becaus i think jerri jordan has rais an issu that is go to becom veri import   it wasn   t all that long ago that we had consider discuss about what is the op um price path   we talk about the issu  for exampl  of price stabil as a necessari condit for econom stabil   that is fundament the reason whi we have opt for price stabil  on the ground that the risk premium rise on both side of price stabil and that price stabil is at the lower bound of ani evid of risk and uncertainti almost by definit   yet it is hard to argu the case of  say  a high technolog orient economi with product rise veri rapid  nomin sale and profit margin reason stabl  but price  howev defin  fall   rememb  price are not easi to defin in certain instanc    all we can visual are sale  profit  and incom  and  sinc an hour is an unambigu unit  i guess we can measur averag hour compens  but price is not an unambigu notion nor  therefor  is price stabil   as we move into a high tech economi  this issu becom a lot t ier than i think we realiz   the question isn   t price stabil as an ul  goal  it can   t be   that is a secondari issu   and it is subject to differ in measur  so we have to be care about what we are do in term of what our goal are and what we lock ourselv into   i think at some point we are go to have a veri interest discuss on this issu   but at the moment  i must say that i have been persuad by most of you that it is a great idea to move forward  but somebodi els better tri to explain it becaus it isn   t go to be easi   and i think it rais some veri serious question   so  as i judg the discuss around the tabl  it is veri clear the desir of the larg major of peopl   here to keep the rang where they are for m   m   and debt  which i presum is altern i     let   s vote on the total altern accord   would you read the appropri languag
i will be read from page    in the bluebook  the bottom half of the page      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   in further of these object  the committe at this meet establish rang for growth of m  and m  of   to   percent and   to   percent  respect  measur from the fourth quarter of      to the fourth quarter of        the rang for growth of total domest nonfinanci debt was set at   to   percent for the year   the behavior of the monetari aggreg will continu to be evalu in the light of movement in their veloc and develop in price  the economi  and financi market

shall we move on to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i shall first discuss the simul in the long run scenario section of the bluebook  and then consid the choic at this meet about the stanc of polici and balanc of risk to announc   the result in the first set of scenario on chart   follow page   extend the  book forecast and look at polici to reach altern inflat rate depend critic on the staff assess      of the current state of the economi   the fomc has  in effect  taken the posit suppli shock stem from the acceler of product and from the declin in oil and import price of a few year ago import in the form of ad output and lower unemploy   but in the staff view  this has left the economi oper well abov the level of it long run potenti  and now  with price shock revers and product growth seen as acceler onli a littl further  inflat is about to pick up  moreov  the polici tighten implement last year is not view as suffici to elimin that tendenc   inde  current financi condit are seen as suffici s ul that inflat pressur are like to intensifi if the feder fund rate is not rais further   the effect on demand of the rise in equiti market last year and the ongo resurg in foreign economi mean that the equilibrium fund rate is expect to continu to increas into this year   and the  book baselin forecast see a     basi point tighten as necessari just to hold the unemploy rate flat   all three scenario see substanti addit tighten beyond that     basi point as need to keep inflat from continu to rise   that need aris from the judgment in the  book forecast that at the end of      both the unemploy rate and the real fund rate will be appreci below their natur or equilibrium level   to say the least  such judgment about the level and growth of potenti suppli and equilibrium interest rate have been especi difficult to make in recent year  and a number of you have wonder whether polici shouldn   t scale back it relianc on such assess   to address this question  the bluebook also show sever set of simul that compar the behavior of the economi under a polici rule that look onli at current and past inflat with rule that also took into account perceiv output gap   moreov  the realiz inflat polici set rule was one that determin the chang in the nomin fund rate  not it level  so that policymak need not form a judgment about equilibrium real interest rate   of cours  it will alway be advantag to employ all the accur inform you have when form polici   but use less than what you have in hand might work to your advantag if some of it turn out to be wrong    laughter   in fact  as can be seen in chart      and    the realiz  inflat rule   toler well in stabil the inflat rate and produc reason good econom perform under some circumst   in particular  chart   and   show that when the suppli side of the economi behav in unexpect way that you learn about onli slowli  the inflat rule   much better at stabil inflat than base polici on mispercept about the trend of the growth of potenti  the rule allow suppli side surpris to show through most in variat in output  which is especi advantag for favor suppli shock      when inflat is alreadi low   it can be success in these circumst becaus it is veri aggress in lean against actual chang in inflat  while at the same  e also pay attent to the level of inflat relat to the committe   s object   howev  as can be seen in chart    one risk of such a strategi is the slow respons it has to an aggreg demand shock  produc greater fluctuat in inflat and output than a rule that also look at realiz output gap  even when the output gap may be misperceiv   in decemb  you express concern about the strength in aggreg demand and the potenti inflationari consequ of it tendenc to outrun increas in the economi   s long run potenti over  e   with demand and output show few sign of moder sinc then  and with recent data on cost and price rais question about how long the good news on inflat will last  the committe   s choic about polici at this meet would seem to be about how much  not whether  to firm   how you assess the uncertainti about suppli and demand  and how much weight you wish to place on es  level of potenti output relat to incom inflat data  may help to shape your decis today on exact how much to tighten   a    basi point firm accompani by a balanc of risk sentenc that suggest persist concern about potenti inflat is current expect by the market   that combin is the unanim project of primari dealer economist   and it is rough consist with rate in feder fund futur market  where there is certainti of a    basi point firm at this meet  a small probabl of a    basi point action  and a certainti of at least    basi point of tighten by the end of your next meet in march   the bluebook discuss presum that  in light of recent data and forecast  you would still assess the risk to be unbalanc toward inflat pressur if you firm by    basi point    ani    relief ralli    that might be spark by a    basi point firm should be limit by the balanc of risk statement and by ani associ increas in the discount rate   as a consequ  this combin should have no appreci long last effect on longer term interest rate and asset price   judg from the yield curv  those longer term rate now embodi a total of       percentag point of tighten by the end of this year  but littl further thereaft   as i alreadi note  in the staff forecast this path for polici is consist with stabil the unemploy rate  but not the inflat rate    still  the current configur of market rate may be accept to the committe  at least until the extent of inflat risk becom clearer   the committe might be uncertain enough about the judgment that the nairu is substanti abov the project level of the unemploy rate  to want to down weight it import in it plan   at      the same  e  even with the fourth quarter nipa price data  longer term trend in inflat and cost would not yet seem to confirm the hypothesi that the economi is oper well beyond it potenti   four quarter averag of most core inflat rate remain relat stabl  and the effect of strengthen compens on unit cost have been offset by fa  product   even if the committe is convinc that you will need to tighten more than    basi point eventu  so long as you do not see the restraint built into the yield curv as clear inadequ  the cost of a gradual approach to the contempl polici action would seem to be small  and gradual would seem to have some advantag   it give you more opportun to adjust the trajectori of your action over  e  base on new inform about the economi and financi market   this flexibl might be seen as especi valuabl when there is so much uncertainti about prospect aggreg suppli  and when financi market are volatil and their reaction to polici difficult to predict   in the past  the committe has deviat from this approach primarili when expect and psycholog have move advers  work against the committe   s object   in the current circumst  long term inflat expect seem to remain reason well anchor at moder inflat rate   the nomin real yield spread on treasuri  for exampl  still embodi    year averag cpi inflat of       percent or less  within it rang sinc last june although up a lot from a year ago  as governor   note  with onli a percentag point or so of tighten in the yield curv   and a firm dollar on foreign exchang market  where the demand for dollar asset seem to match the burgeon suppli from our current account deficit  suggest an absenc of concern among global investor about adequ polici respons to develop inflat problem   howev  if the committe see the inflat risk as greater than do the financi market  perhap becaus the committe is put weight on the possibl that the sustain unemploy rate is well abov the current rate  and believ it will need to tighten consider more or fa  than is now built into the yield curv  it might want to rais it target feder fund rate    basi point at this meet   the committe would be surpris market with that action  and would most like prompt increas in interest and exchang rate and a drop in equiti price   such reaction would not be unwant in that they are an integr aspect of the less accommod financi condit you saw as necessari to restrain real growth and contain inflat   the public   s interpret and market reaction would depend import on the associ balanc of risk statement   a statement that risk were balanc would suggest that the committe saw financi      condit after the firm as equal like to produc rise as stabl or fall inflat   such an announc would tend to limit ani increas in rate  inde  one could not rule out a ralli in capit market  especi the equiti market  if the symmetri were seen as an express by the fomc of substanti less concern about longer term inflat pressur than the market now perceiv   more like  given the strength of demand and the firm of labor market  the committe would still view the risk as unbalanc toward higher inflat  even after a    basi point tighten   the respons of interest rate and asset price to this combin could be consider  and market would remain on alert  attempt to discern whether addit tighten might be forthcom at your next meet   both the respons and the volatil might be mute to some extent if the committe also tri to indic in it statement that it was not necessarili contempl anoth firm at it next meet  that is  emphas that the  e of it next action was high depend on incom data   the committe   s new disclosur polici contempl that announc might provid such indic  now that the offici languag is focus on the longer run econom environ instead of on the possibl of near term polici action
question for don
don  i   d like to hear your thought about how the  book is character the current stanc of monetari polici   in one part of the  book there is a refer to the real equilibrium fund rate as be   percent   i suppos that calcul involv the pce chain weight core rate less food  energi  and tobacco   recent experi would suggest that the inflat premium is mayb       percent if one   s analysi is backward look and about   percent if it is forward look   that would suggest to me that the bluebook is say that until the nomin fund rate reach a level of       to   percent polici is in a s ul mode   is that what the bluebook is say
the bluebook is the extens of the  book forecast  and chart    immedi after page    is essenti say that   it is say in the stabl inflat case  the   middl line with dot and dash  that the fund rate get up to       percent in the next two    year   and over that period inflat rate are rise  so it   s not   percentag point of real tighten  but it is about       percentag point of real tighten   so i think the messag of the  book  which is reflect in these altern strategi  is that polici clear is not now posit to keep inflat from rise   in fact  it is not now posit to keep inflat pressur from intensifi in the sens that with an unchang fund rate the unemploy rate would like fall further
so with an increas of   or    or even   of a percentag point  we would still be in a posit of basic s ul the economi and provid an environ where inflationari pressur are like to continu to rise
as i was tri to say in my brief  that depend import on the weight you put on the nairu calcul   what you do at each meet is import obvious  but what the market perceiv you are go to do may be even more import in term of the effect on econom activ   and it   s the intermedi  and longer term interest rate that have the most effect   so i think what is import is the trajectori that the market perceiv you to be on   that is what is go to be reflect in intermedi  and longer term interest rate  where we see most  though not all  of the effect on econom activ   that has effect on the dollar and presum on equiti price if the discount rate matter at all for equiti price these day   so  the point here is that the market has built in approxim     basi point of tighten over the next year or so  which is what the  book has built in
so if we were to move cautious  it would be veri import to communic clear about the work that appar still has to be done
that   s right   and i think that is what the balanc of risk sentenc is    design to do   and my judgment was that a combin of a    basi point increas and an unbalanc risk sentenc  plus potenti a discount rate chang  would tend to communic that   one can never be certain about how the market are go to react
that same communic probabl would not be modifi much if we went    basi point
if you went    basi point and had an unbalanc risk sentenc  i think that would communic a greater sens of concern on the committe   s part than the market now perceiv
but not a greater sens of concern than is in the analyt work that has been present to us
i agre   and what i think that would tend to communic is that you are put weight on an es  that the economi is oper well beyond potenti and that the unemploy rate need to rise appreci to stem inflat   the question is whether you want to do that now or wait for some evid that that in fact is the case   in a sens it   s a strategi issu  whether you want to surpris the market now with that assess or wait until you get some evid
don  how comfort do you feel about all of these simul when the econometr structur that they are be simul from has not provid a good record for judg the outcom with respect to inflat  cost  and the like
there is a lot of uncertainti about the suppli side of the economi and i would tri to communic that   we ran a number of other simul and present them in the   bluebook to underscor that point   but i think the staff has been catch up with this veri    quick  we might even be ahead on product but certain we have been catch up veri quick on the growth of product   we have modifi our wage price assess  which in effect is what sever peopl were remark on ye day about the sacrific ratio   that is now higher becaus we see the economi in effect as a littl less inflat prone in the sens that  even take account of suppli side effect  the rate of inflat seem to be less sensit to output gap than it might have been befor   so i think we are move as quick as the data will allow toward our best assess of what those suppli side effect are   but you are right  that assess is embodi in these simul   i tri to emphas that the result  particular the extent of the firm  are crucial depend on those assess and that there is a lot of uncertainti about them   the committe may want to think care about how much weight it put on them
in the simul  what are you do to the statist discrep
i don   t know   that   s an incom side thing and the simul  i believ  are basic done on the product side
as you know  the huge open up of the statist discrep is creat differ coeffici than one would get use the product side   and i would submit to you that the stabil of a number of the outcom you are get in these simul relat to the forecast of this discrep is much larger than i think we all realiz  my concern is that we be care about this becaus the number of differ is not small  and my suspicion is that the polici implic are of signific   that is import to recogn  for exampl  when we rais the question about whether this product improv is real    and  eventu  when i get to my remark  i will tri to provid some evid that there is    someth veri unusu go on   the one thing we know is that the appar mark increas in profit margin in the fourth quarter  in the context of a relat modest set of increas in cost structur  make it veri difficult to get around the conclus that product growth is signific abov what the number are give us basic becaus they are be reduc by a widen negat statist discrep   i just want to say that  as an old aficionado of build econometr model  i know what they can do and i know what they cannot do   i am a littl concern about the definit of some of these result  they give the appear of realiti   i submit that model that don   t forecast all that well have defici coeffici   and then to simul a forecast use those coeffici give one a sens of realiti  which is at root fals   i am not say that these are not use exercis  they are  if we consid them not in term of the actual number they produc but in the structur of the chang that they are tell us about  one exampl is the issu that larri   was rais ye day with respect to the wicksellian real interest rate   qualit these are import issu to discuss   but to put specif number on them and say this is the number of basi point we need to move the fund rate to make the system balanc is ludicr   i would be laugh hilari were it not such a serious question  becaus there is just no way these model can be precis about that   their rang of error is such that they cannot give those answer   what they tell you is direct and rough order of magnitud   but the presumpt that small chang here and there will make a differ i think misread what these techniqu can do
mr  chairman  may i make a coupl of comment   one is that i would encourag peopl to look at most of these simul in a broad sens  simpli in a direct sens   i think the messag will carri even if one adjust some of these coeffici signific    on the question of the statist discrep  mani of the thing that would be affect by that    would affect both the potenti output and the aggreg demand side of the equat
i disagre with that   that is not factual correct
if it is a matter of mismeasur of output growth over the recent period  then that is someth we would need to recalibr  both in term of our es  of potenti as well as actual growth
it chang the probabl  in the sens of the secur one has in what the under rate of trend product are
you are assum right now that the second deriv  which has been posit for quit a period of  e  fall to zero   you have been assum that for the last   or    book and it has been
actual  in this case we are assum that the second deriv is posit for the forecast period relat to the recent period and we are make no assumpt about it past
rememb you are forecast it to fall
that   s a veri long term assumpt in the simul  yes
i don   t want to get into a detail discuss on this  it   s just that i want to make clear that there is some  a presumpt about the accuraci of the result these model produc  which i don   t think convey the humil requir for them   i just want to put that on the tabl   if we want to have a seminar on this  i would be most delight to get involv in it becaus i think this is a veri import issu
i take a backseat to no one in term of humil about these model  but    i just want to close a loop on one other thing so everyon understand what we have done in the project   this is get into how the sausag is made   in fact  in balanc the incom and product side of our forecast  we actual do have a continu widen of the statist discrep   so that   s built into our baselin forecast through        the model extens  in effect  take some of this on board becaus it is deriv the structur that is carri in the futur beyond      base on the structur of the judgment  book forecast
that is the point   suppos it is actual go in the other direct   look  i am not argu   i do not disagre with the general polici focus that is come out of the  book   i happen to think that  this year  we are go to have to move the fund rate quit signific higher   and the number i would put in the back of my head would not be terribl differ from where you are come out  and a lot of that is implicit in the intermedi period   it is just that i believ we have to be terribl care about the notion of what we know and what we don   t know   i am a littl concern  basic  becaus we can exagger the extent of our knowledg veri readili  i didn   t mean to digress into that long discuss   presid jordan
thank you   i  too  have a lot of reserv about the nation incom account set of inform that we use to think about an increas global economi   it is certain not what we would construct if we were start from scratch today  given the way we see the world go   nevertheless  it   s what we have  so we tri to tortur the data in our effort to find some use inform   i thought this was a use set of exercis and simul from the standpoint that while we are all veri uncertain at  e about all kind of thing  our degre of uncertainti about specif thing vari a lot   some peopl are quit   certain about one thing while other are veri uncertain about that same thing   so these exercis    at least allow peopl to be rather explicit about what they are certain about and what they are not certain about   so from that standpoint  i think they are use  what occur to me as i was look at this was one exercis that i would have been interest in  which was not includ  involv the augment taylor rule that ben mccallum has written about  essenti what in the     s we would have call a taylor rule with a proviso claus   that would have been one addit exercis that i would have been curious about had it been present  i am go to ask a question to character my understand of this and you can tell me how close or far off i am in the character   first  i need to digress into the framework that we are look at  becaus for the last three decad at least we   ve had essenti two compet paradigm   one has to do with the suppli and demand for money  somehow measur  and the other relat to the suppli and demand for output or the unemploy rate and the nairu   at  e the empir experi tend to favor one framework and at  e the other framework  go back and forth  with reason for uncertainti about both of them  as i look at the differ chart and listen to the narrat that went with them  the messag i took from the materi was this   the greater the confid one has in ani lead indic  whether in a nairu framework  a money suppli money demand framework or someth els  the more gradualist one can afford to be in term of smaller increment chang in polici action   the less confid one has in lead indic  the more aggress one has to be   one might have to see a blip or some new inform in order to take polici action  you might not like the character  but the label i would put on the simul you call the realiz inflat rule is the    bunker hill    or    white of the eye    approach   as soon as we   see a blip up in inflat  bang  we move and we move aggress   is that a fair messag to    come out with in regard to one   s confid or uncertainti about lead indic
i think that is a fair messag  and it is illustr in chart   to a certain extent   i   m not sure about the gradual part  but it certain relat to the polici success that you can have   chart   look at that realiz inflat rule against one that is the same as the price stabil rule   now  that price stabil scenario in chart   is deriv from the model   it assum that household and busi and the feder reserv have at least a pretti good idea about what is go on   they form their expect   the feder reserv is assum to have a veri good idea what is go to happen in the futur as it chang the fund rate   so in a sens this is about as well as we can do   the altern is the case where we are not sure about what is go to happen in the futur   the inflat rule was use there to illustr how  if you wait until you see inflat becaus you are not sure  it may not be such a bad rule to follow  provid there are certain kind of shock occur in the economi  that is  the favor suppli shock  second  as you note presid jordan  onc you see inflat  these are four quarter chang  so it   s not just one quarter   s worth of inflat  you do need to respond fair robust  twice as robust as the taylor rule would have you respond   if you do that in circumst when you are uncertain about the suppli side of the economi and you   re experienc favor suppli shock  the outcom are not bad   and they are certain better than if you act on incorrect inform   so  the basic messag you took was approxim correct   that you can run a success polici respond ex post under certain circumst   you have to be care  that   s not the case under all circumst   it   s good to be preemptiv where you know some inform   but if your polici respons is more reactiv  you have to get more aggress
don  i suppos this is half comment and half question  and it is    premis on the idea that these simul are use   i think they can be use  especi in make comparison between particular simul   i   m on chart   and i just want to compar the so call baselin scenario and the stabl inflat scenario   the baselin scenario basic incorpor the tighten assum in the  book forecast through        there is no further tighten in      and then we begin to tighten further   the result shown in the bottom panel on the page is that the pce inflat rate is up to   percent  steadi state   it wasn   t too long ago that we were talk about the core cpi and i imagin it relationship has remain the same in term of what we use to talk about   so we   re talk about mayb       or       percent inflat on the core cpi measur   i think that is a result that would not be accept to mani peopl  if ani  around this tabl  the stabl inflat scenario  though    produc a better result  whether it would be accept to everybodi or not  i don   t know   but there is no differ in      between that scenario and the baselin   the differ is that in      we continu the tighten   i would have expect in order to get that much of a differ that we would have had to move more strong this year in order to preempt inflat expect   it rais the question in my mind as to whether the structur of the model take adequ account of credibl issu and effect  and i thought you might want to comment on that
the structur basic assum credibl   that is  unless the feder reserv chang  the structur assum that if you have a   percent target  the public know you have a   percent target   and as long as you are follow the polici action that flow from have that target  so that you are confirm period by period the public   s percept of your target  then those expect are firm anchor   what happen  and this part follow   through on my respons to presid  n ye day about sacrific ratio  is that if the fed    deviat from the action the public expect with  say  a   percent target  then the public begin to chang it expect   and that give you differ sacrific ratio in the short run   it give you differ effect in the short run   but the public would slowli learn that you had a   percent target instead of a   percent target over        i think part of the differ here is that while the nomin rate aren   t that differ  that   s not the case for the real rate   becaus the tighten in      get a bit ahead of the rise in inflat  real rate are consider higher in       and that is to a larg extent what build in the extra restraint
that   s a good point  especi at the end of the year
right   so  there   s almost a percentag point of extra restraint by the end of      and that persist for the next year or so   that is a signific amount of extra restraint
as i said ye day  i like this exercis   at the same  e  i think we all should be veri humbl   there is actual an ad dimens to the humil and it goe to this product debat   i had alway thought that whatev the rate of product  if we had a posit shock  that is  if product went up  that would be good news for inflat   that would make the economi general less inflationari   larri   made a point ye day that i think is right   you   ve said this in the past  too  mr  chairman   if you link the suppli and the demand  that is not necessarili so   we could get a situat  as the illustr larri gave ye day indic  where a product shock would actual be more inflationari or  i suppos  it could be neutral   so while we are put our humil on the tabl here  i think we also ought to be humbl about that   even if there is some chang in product  we don   t necessarili know what that is go to do to our price forecast
you can see from chart   that a posit product shock   not    tend to lower inflat rate in the short run unless you are target the inflat rate veri hard  i think one need to differenti between veri short run effect and longer run effect   let   s say in the short run that you have the product shock  which is consist with dave     s chart ye day   inflat would tend to go down as profit margin are swell  and competit would drive price down   over  e  howev  the demand feed back   that lower the unemploy rate  wage begin to catch up with the higher product  and we end up with a higher equilibrium interest rate approxim equal to the size of the product shock   it depend on the model  obvious   there is a short run effect  but if we let it run on too long  we will find ourselv in that situat
true   but also if we have forward look long term market  such as the stock market  it could be that the demand effect get telescop up front into higher consumpt and invest demand
that mechan is in the model   now  whether it   s suffici captur in the model is a question   but the effect of the extra earn on stock price feed back on consumpt  though you may think all of it has not been captur in the last coupl of year  is in the model
don  i have two comment   one  if you   re uncertain about whether the growth is the outcom of a suppli shift or a demand shift  wouldn   t a nomin incom rule domin the taylor rule or the inflat rule in term of exercis like this
if it were a price shock  a chang in the price level of the old oil shock varieti that we use to studi  then a nomin incom rule is a way of take part of that in   inflat and part of it in output   in that regard it   s much the same as a taylor rule   there might    be a differ dynam path  but i don   t think it would differ veri much   but in some way it   s a bit like the discuss you folk were have a littl while ago   if you had a nomin incom rule and you tilt up the product growth and kept the old nomin incom  you   d start build deflat into the economi if the start point was price stabil   so i think the kind of suppli shock that occur matter a lot
my other comment follow from what the chairman said earlier   it seem to me that it is import to keep in mind that there are standard error in these exercis and they are signific   i must admit that if i didn   t think that was the case  i would have been terrifi by these outcom   instead  i   m onli scare
ani further question   if not let me get start   i believ we are enter a period of consider turbul in financi market   it characterist are what one would expect  though we may never have experienc them  from be on the upward slope of a general acceler in technolog applic and acceler output per hour   this is the old    s    curv scenario  which we have look at theoret but have never observ in the past  the current economi has all the s curv characterist  and i am not look onli at the macro data   we can see it in compani  we can see it in the multipl applic of a lot of new technolog   someth veri differ is happen in the way this economi is function   it differ from ani economi that i have observ in the past  and i have been look at our economi everi day profession sinc the summer of        there has been noth like this in my experi   it is just dramat differ    leav asid the measur that we have for product  all we have to ask ourselv    is how we can reconcil the behavior of profit margin from domest busi oper in recent year with the price pattern we have seen  algebra  what we get from the incom side is the same acceler in profit margin as in product   i see no evid at the moment that the acceler in product has stop   the second deriv for the latest data is still posit   and i am not awar of ani evid that the expans is slow down  the general notion of a signific deceler in the first quarter is an interest forecast  but we are one third into the quarter at this point and i don t know what evid support a slower growth forecast    certain  initi claim are down signific   order are quit strong   retail market are quit strong   and  inde  if we were get some slow in gdp growth measur either from the incom side or the product side  one would presum that it would be evid of slow growth in product   altern  until the evid chang i think the most reason view is that product probabl is still acceler  inde  if we examin the earn es  of secur analyst  includ those who look at the earn outlook compani by compani  the overal es  through januari are still rise in the sens that forecast of long term earn per share are still go up rapid   this evid suggest that product enhanc invest are still move up  sinc what we are observ is veri unusu  as i indic at the last meet  we tend to get statist acrophobia   we are not accustom to see motor vehicl sale at these level  hous start so high at these interest rate  or busi activ so robust in virtual everi part of the economi while inflat has not move an iota   inde  total unit cost in the four quarter just end are about as low as we have seen them in this cycl  unit labor cost have bare move    the rise in inflat in the fourth quarter show up wholli in profit margin   actual unit    cost  grant the rough natur of the data  appar declin in the fourth quarter   this is not an inflationari price environ or an inflationari cost environ   if we look at inflat expect  the best measur that we have in my view is one deriv by subtract the yield on an inflat protect    year treasuri secur from a so call synthet    year nomin rate to get the best es  of expect    year cpi inflat   that number is bare differ today than it was in decemb        the implicit inflat expect in that calcul declin with the asian crisi   it had recov by the spring of last year and has been absolut flat sinc then   to be sure  the actual nomin    year rate has gone up compar with the real    year rate   but that is mere a reflect of the fact that the adjust for    on the run    and    off the run    rate  appropri made  has rais the nomin rate by about     percentag point sinc novemb of last year   in other word  the dramat chang between the so call synthet rate and the nomin rate give a fals view of acceler inflat expect unless it is proper adjust  as is done by the staff  for the degre of illiquid in an inflat index treasuri secur vis  vis an appropri nomin treasuri oblig  it seem to me that what we have here is an acceler of a process that would not creat a problem were it not for the wealth effect   the problem  as we have discuss in the past  is that while potenti suppli increas pari passu with the rise in trend product  which i believ is still acceler  it has a more pronounc effect on demand   obvious  rise product creat higher real incom from which expenditur can be made  but  leav asid the issu of whether or not the stock market is appropri price  rise product also creat a ration upward adjust in long term earn expect which  all els equal  will result in an increas in the valu of stock market asset   unless there is no wealth effect    and there are some who argu that case though  frank  i think the evid is overwhelm in    the other direct  there will be an increas in purchas power over and abov the increas in suppli   that has been the case in recent year   the result excess demand basic has been met by an increas in our net trade deficit and by draw on new sourc of labor   the latter have been found by drain the pool of the current unemploy  through increas in the particip rate  and through immigr   both increas net import and draw in new worker obvious are safeti valv that can for a  e fill the gap creat by excess demand  but they cannot be drawn upon indefinit for reason we have discuss previous  the high rate of return that are drive our technolog boom are also attract dollar from abroad  or i should say increas claim against the unit state  and that has held the dollar essenti unchang   that process can go on for a while  but the question is how long   obvious  as i have note befor  the minimum unemploy rate is zero   i do not care whether we bring the notion of a nairu into the analysi   the point is that there is an ul  limit to unemploy  and it is call zero   so  we are sit here with an imbal that essenti say the wealth effect by it natur cannot persist indefinit   to argu that it can impli that the gap between excess demand over suppli can alway be fill without creat major inflationari pressur   the point i am make   not rest on ani econometr model but mere on the proposit that there is a wealth effect on consumpt and that acceler product will continu to increas expect earn  the question basic is   what close the gap   what close the gap is obvious the real long term interest rate  and it has been go up quit signific   it is put pressur on financi market   at the end of the day it is go to swamp the rate of discount in the stock   market  which now is virtual zero as best i can judg   that is a slight exagger  but onli    slight  the problem that we have here is that monetari polici work through it effect on overal financi market   the presumpt that a    basi point  a    basi point  or even a    basi point chang in an overnight rate can come to grip with the suppli demand imbal is in my view silli in the extrem    the overnight rate is just not tie into this process in ani direct way   what we actual do is to fo  a term structur of interest rate by our polici action and therebi influenc real long term rate   what i am say is algebra equival to what larri   was say ye day about the wicksellian real rate and the gap   the differ  i think  is not simpli how we may view the gap between the expect equilibrium real rate and the market rate  but how we look at this process from a disaggreg perspect  in order to disaggreg  what we are realli look at in the real world  and not in a wicksellian world  is this crucial issu of the wealth effect  the polici question that confront us in my view is how we should influenc the real long term rate  which is the primari forc involv in this process   it is do most of the work that we would like to think we have the power to do  but we realli don t have that kind of power except to the extent we can influenc how the market perform  it strike me that what we have at this stage is a veri unusu situat  which if anyth is go to becom still more difficult for us   in that regard i think the answer that don kohn gave is the correct one  name  that inflat will stay down in the short run becaus of the acceler in product   but ul   if we do not solv the problem of the gap  mean that if the acceler in product lead to continu expect of acceler earn per share  the onli way to elimin the wealth effect  which has to be elimin  is for the   discount rate  the market interest rate use by investor to calcul the present valu of expect    earn  to rise   i think that is in the process of occur   and if that is the case  the interest issu  which realli get to the question of the longer term effect of inflat in this model  is whi the bond market is show no real evid of acceler inflat expect   in short  what the market basic are say  right or wrong  is that long term rate are go to rise eventu to close the gap   they may also be argu that the current rate are the right rate   i person do not believ that  but that is what one has to assum is the prevail opinion in these market  the question that confront us here is what we should do in the context of this phenomenon   if the rate use by investor to discount futur earn has to rise as a necessari condit for stabil  the question is how we can facilit that rise   to put the monetari polici issu in a somewhat revers order  as don kohn did  i think the crucial point here is that we express and continu to express a general view that our goal is basic to move the fund rate up consist   at this point i don   t know whether we eventu will need an increas of    basi point     basi point      basi point  or     basi point   my guess is that the increas is like to be toward the upper end of that rang  in my view  the key consider at this stage is to make certain that we do not adopt what we use to call    symmetri      that would be the wrong thing to do no matter what els we do   inde  while i am go to argu against a    basi point increas  i would say that if we were to decid on    basi point  we would have to do it with asymmetri   in my opinion     basi point with symmetri would be a terribl mistak at this stage   it would impli that our job is over   what we have to convey to the market  consist with what is clear an acceler   in product and i think increas turbul in financi market  is that we are on the scene    and that we are embark on a routin of increment tighten  what is the argument against    basi point today   i would say the argument is basic twofold   one is that  as a general rule in an environ like this  the last tighten move that we make is go to be a mistak   we will not know that at that  e  but it is almost invari a mistak   if we tighten in small increment dose  the size of a mistak is smaller by definit   second and far more import  i think that our latest evalu of the equiti premium in the stock market is that it is downright scari   i haven   t seen anyth like this befor   in fact  if we use the inflat earn expect of the secur analyst and the p e ratio that we have now  we get an extrem impress equiti premium   back in       you will recal  long term rate were go up as the stock market went up  and the market just ran out of steam   we are in a far wors situat now than we were then  i am concern that  if we are too aggress in this process of tighten  we could crack the market and end up with a veri sever problem of instabl   i don t know how far we will have to go   inde  i don t know how long we can continu tighten by    basi point  as a sort of work hypothesi  i would argu that we should think in term of move at everi meet and that we move by    basi point increment  we would continu on that cours unless and until it appear that we are get behind the curv on inflat or inflat expect  in which case we would rais the size of the adjust   on the other hand  we could continu to implement our strategi if we began to see the wealth effect stabil and or the gap between suppli and demand begin to close   unless and until that happen  we will remain in a veri unusu period that we have never experienc befor   what i am argu is not someth that is come out of a particular simul   all that is need for my argument   to be valid  as best i can judg  is that there is a wealth effect  that the market is at extrem high    valuat level  and that we have to take action to close the suppli demand gap   i would propos  therefor  that we move the fund rate up by    basi point today and that we includ in our press releas the equival of what we use to call asymmetri   there would be a full expect that we will be move again in march   if it turn out that the econom expans is acceler  and inde i have everi reason to suspect that it may  that would not in itself be a polici issu in my view  that is not what we ought to be look at   we should be look at the under inflat pressur in the economi   and if they becom larger  then i think we will have to move fa    but for today i think it is appropri to move    basi point and issu an asymmetr statement  i don t rememb the exact languag we plan to use to express that
balanc of risk
the balanc of risk is toward inflat  vice chair
mr  chairman  i fulli support your recommend  but let me make a few comment   the issu clear is not whether we should do noth  but whether we should firm    basi point or    basi point   and i agre that in either case we would have to use the balanc of risk languag indic that we are more concern about inflat   i think we have to look at ourselv   the realiti is that we are perceiv everywher around the world as the best central bank in the busi   we are high regard  high respect   and our commit to price stabil  certain as defin by you in speech and tes oni  is i think unquest anywher   our style is that of a strong  silent leader  one who move increment   we move    basi point at a  e in a veri systemat way   if we were to move    basi point  to continu my analog  if all of a sudden the strong  silent leader start beat his chest to show what a tough guy he is  what would be your   conclus   i believ it would be that he is scare   what do we have to be frighten about     we can certain go about our busi in our normal way  continu to exhibit the confid that we have earn by our perform   and i think that is the thing that will contribut the most to stabil the economi   i agre with you fulli that a work hypothesi that we will have to have a seri of tighten move is appropri  and i believ that that should be in the background of our think   but i feel veri strong that    basi point combin with a balanc of risk statement toward inflat concern is by far the right packag for today   thank you
mr  chairman  i certain also support your recommend   we are face with veri power  real forc that we want to allow to run to the extent that they can in term of increas product  employ  and real incom without upset the inflationari appl cart   i would like to relat your comment this morn to our discuss ye day about the trade deficit   the trade deficit is also part of this real adjust that is go on in the economi and it is not fundament a nomin phenomenon   the trade deficit is financ the capit flow that are come to this countri becaus the rate of return is so high   and it cannot itself be an object of our polici becaus it is determin by these real forc that are so unusu  certain in the context of postwar u s  histori and perhap much further back than that  i think a move of    basi point and a statement that the balanc of risk is toward inflat is exact the right way to go   the market is our friend   the market  after all  has anticip this move   we saw interest rate rise   this feder fund futur predict has been in the market for four week or more  and we should not do anyth that leav the market wonder what we are up to   if we were to go with    basi point and a balanc risk   statement  the market would most like say that we have conclud that we are done   and that    is certain not our conclus   so we want to make the market do as much of this work as possibl  lead the way  and help us figur out what is the correct respons to the incom flow of inform   i absolut agre that this is like to mean a sequenc of    basi point increas at each meet   it wouldn   t be correct to say in dave   s famous languag    as far as the eye can see    but  nevertheless  for quit some  e   and by work cooper with the market i think we will have the best chanc of come out of this without a big upset  so  i support your recommend     percent
mr  chairman  i would prefer a    basi point increas in the fund rate and also a public statement that we are focus on heighten inflat risk in the futur   my concern is that the  e period between this meet and the next meet on march   st is quit long   i might suggest someth that would make me more comfort with a    basi point increas and that is that we agre to assess the situat again at the end of this month   we will have consider more data  certain more data about price   we could review those data and see if we feel at that  e that a further move is appropri   i don t see whi we have to be constrain by a fix calendar  which in this case involv quit a long interv between meet   over the    year i have been with the fed  we have found telephon meet at  e like this to be veri use   from my perspect  though it   s certain not one share by everyon here  it would reduc the possibl that we will get behind the curv
the option of a telephon confer is alway on the tabl   it alway has been   it   s just that we have not need to employ it for a while   but it is obvious there
well  i think there might be a case for it this  e
the market will tell us   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend in it entireti   it seem to me  given the kind of technolog or product shock that we have had  that real interest rate need to rise   to some extent  that has occur   my judgment is that they need to go up more   i do not see ani way we can accomplish that other than by rais the fund rate   so  a   point increas is certain accept to me   i would not go beyond that and be more aggress  princip for consider of uncertainti   it seem to me that we are uncertain about the futur path of product and we are uncertain about nairu   i person am uncertain whether the latter is a use concept at all   and we are uncertain about the implic of the increas in real rate that has alreadi occur and what the effect may turn out to be   so  i think what you are suggest is what we ought to do
mr  chairman  i support your propos complet   i believ the increas risk of inflat is there  so i think we ought to say it   also  i am veri much in favor of    basi point for sever reason   first  while the model show direct  i agre that they don   t show it with precis  so i think we should proceed gradual   second  we are in an environ where core inflat has been veri modest  and we need to recogn that as we begin to pave the way for higher rate   and third  some imbal remain out there  which we are tri to take into account  but we don   t want to shock the system either   so i think continu the steadi path that we have been on is the appropri approach   therefor  i support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend for a       basi point increas in the fund rate and what i will continu to call an asymmetr postur   i also agre with you that we are like to have to implement a seri of tighten this year  it is like to be appropri to make a move at each meet for a period of  e   given the uncertainti about trend growth  nairu  and inflat dynam  and also given the uncertainti about the impact of our polici on financi condit more broad  i think there is a strong case for a gradualist approach   i hope we will be abl to use the bias in the announc that accompani today   s action skill   by that i mean that i hope we don t undermin what i view as veri sensibl expect about the rise in the fund rate that are built into the term structur and futur market  we had a lot of discuss today about uncertainti  about the structur of the economi and inflat dynam  and about the valu of humil   i don   t want to lead a discuss oppos to humil    laughter   howev  i think some  we draw an implic here that humil suggest inact  though that is certain not what you have been argu  mr  chairman   but i want to bring us back to the discuss of our monetari growth target becaus it seem to me that in a monetari growth target regim the danger of inact is much less than in a fund rate regim   and that  i think  is consist with some of the point that presid jordan was make   if product growth is a littl higher  we will end up with a littl lower inflat  it will be somewhat limit and won t be as much of a problem   but in an interest rate regim inact can be veri  veri danger  and particular danger in an expans that is driven by higher product  which rais real equilibrium interest rate  i also want to comment a bit on your discuss of the role of the wealth effect   it clear has been veri import   we go from the product upturn  to the wealth effect on   consumpt  to the excess of demand growth relat to suppli growth   and we   ve had a lot of    discuss  not onli here but in a number of other arena  about how a declin equiti premium or higher equilibrium growth rate can rais the valu of equiti price   a lot of that is a partial equilibrium analysi   you just plug into the formula a low equiti premium and voil  higher equiti price  that make veri littl sens in a general equilibrium model  becaus in such a model that wealth effect will ul  generat increas in real interest rate that will signific cap and diminish the increas in equiti premium  i think the danger that we have been face recent is that a monetari polici that has been somewhat slow to tighten and has allow the economi to oper in this partial equilibrium world   i think we are now go to see how equiti price evolv in a general equilibrium world  and i think that is one reason whi we have to be a bit cautious and gradualist  i want to make just a few comment on what i perceiv to be the consensus strategi that is unfold   it seem to me that what we have been talk about is be veri preemptiv now in slow the economi to trend growth  but be veri reactiv onc we get to trend growth and we have stabil the unemploy rate   then at that point we are prepar to be veri reactiv and respond onli to evid of higher inflat   i have been struggl with the issu of whether this is an appropri strategi  or perhap even an op  strategi  given our uncertainti about the output gap   if it is a sensibl strategi  i think there are some gap or detail we have to fill in   obvious  we have to decid what the appropri path of the fund rate is to slow the economi to trend   but we also have to keep in mind that if we are unsuccess in slow the economi to trend and  therefor  the output gap rise even further  that should affect our polici and we should tighten by more than we otherwis would   that is  we should tighten enough to slow the economi to below trend so that we can push the output gap back down   i   think that is consist with the nonlinear rule that i have discuss in the past   as uncertain as    we are about the output gap  that uncertainti about whether or not we are beyond the economi   s potenti diminish veri great as the output gap increas base on our best es  of potenti  and the third issu i think we are go to have to focus on in this strategi is just how aggress we should move against higher inflat   to the extent that we have down weight our respons to increas in the output gap  when inflat rise we have to be more aggress than we would otherwis be   the way to think about that is that onc we get to trend growth and the unemploy rate stabil  we have assum that our polici set and strategi are consist with stabl inflat and the output gap is basic zero   if inflat then begin to rise  not onli do we have to respond to the increas in inflat the way we ordinarili would  we also have to revis our es  of the output gap   that requir a more aggress respons to inflat than would otherwis be the case  so  those are a few thought that at least shape my view of the strategi go forward
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with both halv of your recommend   i think we should reinforc market when they are right and i think they are right in their expect   second i  like other  am move by the uncertainti that we have talk about  but i also recogn that inflat   not appear at this stage to be on the verg of a virul outbreak   so a move of    basi point seem to me moder and appropri   i think you re absolut right in suggest that over  e we can and will continu to look at the reaction of market general  includ the asset market where i do think  as i said ye day    there is like to be some under turbul   final  on the outlook sentenc i believ the    statement that suggest the risk are balanc toward inflat is obvious the right one to use becaus it   not take back all the other thing that we re do
i agre with your recommend of   point and i think we need to convey the view that we have more tighten ahead of us   my best guess is that there will be a signific amount of tighten over the come year   there may well be a  e in this seri of tighten move where a move of    point is go to be appropri   but today i think   is just right   our basic product is one of confid  confid that we re go to do what is appropri to keep the economi on the right path   and in today s environ a    basi point increas in the fund rate captur that becaus it indic that  yes  we know that tighten is appropri   we re go to do what need to be done   we are neither go to underreact or overreact   i think that is import for our imag as a strong  confid central bank that the public deserv to put it confid in
mr  chairman  i am pretti much where bob parri is   this is a tough call but  if i had my druther  my prefer would be to go the full    point   it would be a veri decis move that would preempt ani inflat expect that might either be build or like to build in the near term futur   i recogn it would be a strong move  particular in the context of the need for asymmetri whatev we do  i agre fulli with your point on that score   so  i recogn that there are risk   to me the big risk is that we might get a market break that could lead to what i would refer to as a disord plung in the stock market   that would complic the situat and make it more difficult for us to take the kind of step we will need to   take   so i am abl to accept the   point increas this morn   but i would hope that we will do    it with what i might call    asymmetri plus      we need that languag   also  i would hope  and i expect you   d be inclin to do this in your tes oni  which is not too far down the road  that we will underscor the intens with which we are watch develop and our readi to move more aggress if in fact we need to do so   also  and i hope this is not out of line  i would hope that the board of governor might consid a complementari discount rate increas in the near futur   furthermor  i agre with bob parri   i know that an intermeet confer call is alway on the tabl but  in the context of your remark  i hope we will watch market develop veri care for ani signal that we should have a call
first  on the data point   i talk ye day about the differ in ten year bond between the nomin and the real spread   i am no match for you in develop the synthet yield
i didn t do it   it was your colleagu down at the other end of the tabl
i was use the chart  exhibit     that the staff send around everi monday   and on that render  certain in the last month there has been a rise in the inflat premium   but don kohn did persuad me that i way overst it ye day   nevertheless  it has gone up  the second thing i would like to say is that i tend to agre with the bluebook simul on inflat target  humbl as we are about model   and i believ that we are like to need a lot of tighten  and that the real question we have to deal with today is how we get there from here    i will support the recommend of a    basi point move with a tilt and the implicit    gradual   i recogn the benefit of that strategi   i m delight to be thought of as a strong and silent leader    laughter   i think you make a good point  mr  chairman  that the economi is in mani way veri fragil  that thing could chang rather abrupt  that the past record has not been good in call the turn  and that  therefor  there is a chanc that we could overreact   in that regard  as i thought about the tilt in connect with roger     s work group  there is one thing i like about the tilt   it is easili revers   if we were to rais the rate    basi point  discov we did too much and then reduc it    basi point  it would look as though we didn   t know what we were do   if we do    basi point with a tilt and new data come in indic the economi is not as strong as we thought  we can take off the tilt   then it look as if we do know what we re do and we re just look at the data   that   s a nice advantag of the tilt and i   m glad we are use it in this situat   so  there are a number of benefit in the gradual strategi   i recogn that and i support your recommend  have said that  there are some cost to the gradual strategi   we could be move too littl and too late   there is histor preced for that  too  and i think we ought to keep that in mind
thank you   when i look out at what the financi market are tell me  or mayb more import not tell me  i see the treasuri yield curv upward slope a bit from two year out to five year   beyond five year it   s downward slope  with corpor bond yield and mortgag rate at   percent   i would be hard press to say that those are at the wrong level for an environ as outlin in the  book and the associ expect   i would feel on much firmer ground in say that there is someth wrong with   these market level if  given the second half experi of       percent real growth and     depend on the inflat measur  nomin spend of       to   percent  i thought it didn   t add up   but this say to me that the market is not build in that kind of real growth plus inflat inherit from the second half of last year through this year   so  i don   t know that nomin interest rate need to go up   if inflat were to turn advers and acceler more than seem to be built into the marketplac right now and inflat expect were begin to rise  i do think it would be undesir for real rate to go down   then i would think that nomin rate would need to increas  on the front end of the curv  though  when i look at the rise in rate for secur matur in up to two year  it   leav me with the feel that a       percent overnight interbank rate is too low to be consist   just close that gap somewhat would be the wisest thing to do  and take a step today  i think  is appropri  i have a comment  though  on this question of    basi point versus    basi point  and that requir me to make refer to the discount rate   there was a  e  and i think it is still the case  that a movement in the fund rate with an accompani increas in the discount rate was interpret as be a more last move as oppos to a move in the fund rate alon  given that  i would think a    basi point increas in the fund rate with a discount rate chang is too strong   and sinc i do consid director    recommend for a discount rate increas appropri in this environ  i would prefer   point on the fund rate know it is to be accompani by a discount rate move   in fact  i would oppos a    basi point chang in the fund rate either with a discount rate increas or without it
the board of governor will be meet later to vote on the discount rate   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   i came into the meet with the intent    and inclin to argu for a    basi point tighten  and i think the staff present we heard ye day and the comment made around the tabl would certain support that   i believ there is evid of mount inflationari pressur   the probabl of inflat move up has clear increas in my view   my biggest worri was that if the consensus was to go with a    basi point tighten  there would be an inclin to slide back to a balanc risk statement  and as you eloqu point out  that is not where we want to be  i can support   point tighten today with the balanc of risk on the side of inflationari pressur   i guess you alreadi answer this question  but let me just say that i  too  would realli like to see the board consid a discount rate increas   i think that give our director some ownership in this polici action and reinforc the action we are take   and in my view there is a reason high probabl that we will have to step up the pace in term of further polici action in the meet to come   but i support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   there was a tabl in today   s wall street journal   i don   t know how mani peopl saw it  but it list a seri of possibl fed action today  gave the odd on them and the like market reaction   it had all the differ scenario we   ve talk about  an increas in the fund rate of    or    basi point  with a tilt or without  and so on   and the last line in the tabl was a rate cut by the fed   the odd were    as like as the cub win the world seri       laughter    and the like market reaction was    holi cow      laughter   i found that veri upset   obvious  there is no chanc we are go to lower rate today  but cub fan are alway op ist    mr  chairman  i support your recommend veri strong   i think the strategi of    increment move is an excel one  support the market when they are right and help confirm their inclin   it seem clear that if we do not move today  that would not onli jeopard the expans but would also jeopard our credibl as well  which is so import  i should note that our outlook assum a fed fund path that has a decid upward drift over the forecast horizon   and even with that strong upward tilt  we project a deterior in the inflat outlook   regardless of whether we look at the core pce or the core cpi or all those measur that i mention ye day  inflat is still go up   so in my judgment  an increas of    basi point is not go to be enough over the forecast horizon   i believ  as you said  that we should be think of a seri of move to make sure that we correct the imbal between aggreg demand and aggreg suppli   i think it   s also veri import that we say that the balanc of risk is tilt to higher inflat for exact the reason that you explain so articul
thank you  mr  chairman   one thing i came into this meet veri determin about was that we should end with an asymmetr direct  whether we went with a    or a    basi point increas in the fund rate   so i   m glad it appear that we are go to do that   i imagin that most peopl  if they gave ani thought at all to what i might recommend at this meet  would have thought i would clear be on the side of a    basi point move   but i must admit that i   m have more frequent debat with myself  not so much on the demand side of the equat  i don   t think anybodi doubt the strength of demand  but about all the element of suppli that are so rich portray in don kohn   s differ graph   i   m becom much more a believ in the view that the potenti for product to stay flat at it current high level or to   grow in the futur is better than i thought it was   and i don   t know where the nairu is   as    with ani forecast  all the forecast we   ve been do in boston requir a great deal of jigger after they are done to tri to captur a bit of the uncertainti that i know i feel and other peopl appar feel on the suppli side   i also think that the interact with the market present us with a seri of risk that you talk about   i tri to incorpor some of that into my discuss ye day  with respect to the buildup of imbal in term of credit  all relat to rise asset valu   so  with those two thing in mind  both a sens of risk and a sens of uncertainti about the economi   s actual capac  i   m veri comfort with a move of    basi point
mr  chairman  i support your recommend for all the reason that have been express   i think it   s exact the right thing to do   but i do want to say that i feel a good deal of identif with the remark of presid broaddus and other around the tabl
i support both part of your recommend   as far as the futur is concern  i hope we will keep look at the data and make our decis one step at a  e and not get too program in advanc as to what we are go to do
i guess we have heard from everybodi
it look as though we have strong support for an increas of    basi point and a balanc of risk statement toward concern about inflat
i   ll be read from page    for both the balanc of risk sentenc and the sentenc on the feder fund rate   onli one vote is involv  encompass both      to further the committe   s long run object of price stabil and sustain econom growth    the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with    increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around       percent     and move on to the balanc of risk sentenc      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat heighten inflat pressur in the forese futur
