befor we turn to our regular agenda  i want to mention that today is ed     s last meet   he has been attend these meet for mani year  in fact  none of us has sat at this tabl without see ed sit in his chair   he has been a member of this group longer than ani of us   but what is more impress is that becaus he was the philadelphia fed   s economist to the fomc  his attend at these meet goe back to       if there is some way that we could perhap buy him off not to write a book  it might be an appropri use of fund   needless to say  we are realli go to miss you   i think at one  e or anoth your wise counsel has chang the mind of everyon around this tabl  and i don t recal ani instanc when it went in the wrong direct
thank you    applaus
we need to get that chair reupholst
ed  would you move to approv the minut
so move  speaker       second
without object   thank you so much
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag of materi in front of you  which includ chart and some text    first  i will briefli review interest rate develop and ask for ratif of our domest oper   then i would like to go over some background materi in anticip of item   c on the agenda  which encompass the two item on which i am seek a committe vote      a copi of the materi use by mr    is append to this transcript          the chart on the first page depict three month deposit rate impli by forward rate agreement   as you can see in the top panel  forward rate have move littl on balanc sinc the committe   s previous meet   they rose a bit on the chairman s humphrey hawkin tes oni and came off a littl toward the end of march  around the  e of the strong revis in fourth quarter gdp   but i have a hard  e understand the causal connect there  which is whi i didn   t includ the gdp releas date as a trip wire on the chart   it   seem that there has been a slight increas over the intermeet period at the short end of the forward rate curv  that is  the three month forward three month rate  wherea the nine month forward three month rate  the top line  has realli not move at all on net   i think the one thing that could be said about market expect is that the market are anticip a littl more action from the committe sooner  but the same net amount over the next twelv month   as you can see in the euro area panel  the one in blue  the ecb rais rate    basi point last week and their forward rate declin ever so slight   i think that may reflect someth of the same phenomenon in that the ecb was move a littl sooner than the market had been expect   in this case that might be reduc slight the amount of tighten the market is look for further out  but there is a lot of nois in these rate  with a lot of seesaw back and forth   i think the ecb is be unfair treat   on the one hand  a lot of analyst are say that the ecb is confus  lost  and hopeless   on the other hand  there is clear a germ of truth in that assess   member of the polici committe are bring out their disagr in the public domain   that there is disagr is veri evid  the market are not mistaken about that   in the bottom panel  you can see the slight upward drift in japanes forward rate sinc the releas of their fourth quarter gdp data   over the last few week japanes offici have been talk up the prospect for growth while tri to talk down the currenc   that is give peopl in the market a bit of a headach   the bank of japan has interven sinc your last meet  direct by the ministri of financ  buy a total of     billion dollar and     million euro over the period    turn to page   and develop in the fed fund market  it   s clear that we ve had a rather quiet  e of it sinc your last meet  the fed fund market has been remark well behav  with some modest and predict volatil at the end of mainten period  at month end  and at tax date   so  we have the pleasur of report that               the effect intermeet fund rate was      percent   it s nice to be both good and lucki   mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper sinc the last meet  so at this point i would be happi to answer question on this portion of my present and seek the ratif of our domest oper sinc the last meet
question for     if not  would someon like to move approv
move approv of the domest oper
mr  chairman  turn to page   of my handout  i have outlin some signific chang in condit in the fix incom market over recent month   coincid with the invers of the long end of the yield curv  daili volatil of the    year bond has risen abov the volatil of both the   year and    year note   ten year credit spread have widen to their      high and beyond  and ten year spread relationship among privat credit have becom much less stabl   the bid ask spread on treasuri secur have widen   and the scarciti valu of treasuri secur can be seen in lower overnight repo rate   i have includ on the next three page sever chart that i will use to discuss each of these point   the top panel of page   simpli show for background the yield on   year     year  and    year u  s  treasuri sinc januari of       the middl panel depict the daili volatil of u s  treasuri on a roll    day interv basi  annual   you can see the rather extraordinari spike in the volatil of    and    year note after the russian moratorium that was associ with the unwind of long term capit manag   s posit   what is worth note is the littl blip in the red line on the far right side of the chart  show that for the first  e in eight year the volatil of the    year bond is higher than that of either the    year or the   year note   the bottom panel depict the correl of daili chang in treasuri yield   again on the right hand side you can see the extrem rapid breakdown in the correl of movement between the   year and    year issu  the dark blue line  and the    year and    year issu  the red line   on the one hand  look at this with the benefit of hindsight  we can say that this type of breakdown is an entir predict consequ of an invers of the yield curv   as         that process get under way  we would expect to see such a breakdown in correl within the yield curv   howev  while that is certain true  the market   not have the benefit of hindsight when it experi this   and the abrupt of these chang and the rapid of this breakdown are realli a veri dramat alter of price relationship that the market has reli on for mani year   so  i think the sudden of the breakdown need to be understood as part reflect the fact that the market is not see this breakdown in relationship to the    year bond as a transient event  as perhap some of the other episod of volatil across the page were   there is a real question in the mind of market particip as to whether relationship with the    year bond will be re establish to level that have been the norm for the last quarter of a centuri   in the top panel on the next page are three credit spread to the     year treasuri   a corpor spread  use the merril lynch a   index  is shown in red  a swap spread is in dark blue  and an agenc spread  with the bloomberg index of noncal debt  that is  their straight    year debt  is in light blue   you can see that recent these spread have widen out to and beyond the level they reach in the fall of        look now at the whole eight year    worth of data  the adjust of spread sinc      look to me much less like a one  e shock or even a seri of shock and a littl more like a reset of spread at higher level   inde  sinc the fall of       all three of these spread have trade at rough doubl the averag that had prevail from      to august        it   s a littl under that  but a rough approxim is that those spread have almost doubl   clear  some of this can be attribut direct to the declin in treasuri yield result from the cutback in treasuri issuanc  particular more recent   but i also think there is an indirect impact of the suppli demand imbal on the confid with which market particip price credit risk   one way i have tri to think of it is that the chang suppli outlook for treasuri has introduc a fair amount of nois into the treasuri yield curv   as a consequ  the effici of our most basic measur devic for credit risk has been signific disturb   and in that environ  one might expect a heighten uncertainti premium to be built into all credit spread   and at least in part  i think that is what we are look at in the top panel   in the middl panel i have depict the correl of week chang in the spread of the corpor swap and agenc index to the    year treasuri   again  you can see that the treasuri agenc breakdown is rather abrupt   in the bottom panel is depict what i            think of as the    intramur correl    of the three index  the privat credit  to each other   and there the breakdown is even more extrem  particular for the corpor agenc index   what i want to be clear about is that this result did not surpris me when i look at chart like this for the    year area  given what has happen to    year rate with the invers of the yield curv   but this is the    year sector   i think the extrem of these move and the breakdown in the intramur price of credit within the privat sector is realli an extraordinari shift for the market to adjust to   some of this may reflect market effort to take on agenc in lieu of treasuri as a hedg devic  thus creat a fair bit of nois   but i think that   s a veri imperfect part of the stori on which to rest too much of the explan   there are also veri complex interact between the swap curv and the agenc market  given how much the agenc reli on the swap market for lay off their durat risk and their callabl debt risk   so  this is an area where these relationship are break down  and market particip realli are not certain when more normal spread can be expect to reassert themselv or in what form predict relationship might come back into play   turn to page    the top panel show the yield curv for   year     year  and    year treasuri secur sinc      as background for the bottom two panel   in the middl panel are the mean bid ask spread for    year and   year treasuri   you can see the spike in those spread in the fall of      after the russian moratorium   and it is clear that sinc the end of last year they have been drift up again  with a veri sharp spike on the day of the quarter refund announc  which was also the day of your last meet   so  these spread are widen a bit   shown in the bottom panel are the    day move averag and    day move averag treasuri overnight repo rate less the fed fund rate   the question this panel address is   how mani basi point relat to each morn s fed fund rate   treasuri collater in the repo market command   as you can see  we have been get lower low  somewhat more volatil  and in general slight more valuabl treasuri collater relat to the morn fund rate over the last six or seven month compar with most of      and        turn to page    as i explain in my memorandum to the committe of march   th  in order to serv the system   s portfolio object and to avoid exacerb the suppli demand imbal for treasuri secur  it is my recommend that we should take            sever step   first  i believ we should begin to moder our relianc on net addit to hold of treasuri secur as the sole mean of accommod the upward trend in the asset size of the system   s balanc sheet  we should evalu all plausibl asset class and oper techniqu that could be appropri altern to treasuri secur for the system open market account  soma    as i outlin in my memo  i think we would want to look at both the advantag and disadvantag of individu asset and care consid them from the system s perspect in term of how well they suit our purpos   and separ  we need to consid the impact our oper in those asset would have on the evolut and behavior of credit market   until the committe can thorough consid altern asset alloc for soma  my recommend is that we should reli on long term temporari oper to meet the growth and under reserv need that cannot comfort be met by further outright purchas of treasuri secur   in so do i would recommend that we distribut our demand for collater as broad as possibl so as to minim our impact on spread relationship   on page   i have outlin some specif plan that were also set forth in my memo   i suggest that we set a target of no more than    percent  and a firm ceil of no more than    percent  for system hold of ani one issu of treasuri bill  and i would manag our auction particip accord   this buffer would allow for the up and down of treasuri issuanc from quarter to quarter  as you know  there is some volatil there   at this point  i would plan no outright purchas of bill   howev  after we get through the april tax season and look at the like size of bill issu  we could evalu whether we would be abl comfort to acquir more of those issu of which we hold signific less than    percent   i want to say that this is a possibl to consid cautious becaus i don   t think we want to whipsaw the bill market by come in and buy an issu onli to run it off at the next auction   in coupon hold  i suggest that we continu to roll over exist hold at auction but monitor the impact of the treasuri s buyback program and the chang in note and bond size on our percentag hold of individu coupon issu   as my memo explain  i don t think that is an immedi concern  but it is someth that we need to keep an eye on   also  i suggest that we adopt a tri and see approach to meet a portion of our under reserv need through outright purchas of around     billion over the rest of this year  spread even across the coupon curv   and final  i suggest that we meet the balanc of under reserv need with the roll book of term repo  accept treasuri secur  straight agenc debt secur                and mortgag back secur as collater and price them separ as we have sinc last octob   final  on the last page  mr  chairman  i reiter the question i pose in my memo for committe member to consid   first  are there particular issu or concern that member think the studi that don and i are plan on altern asset for soma should address   if so  we would welcom ani comment of suggest regard particular asset that should be look at or topic that should be cover   second  are member comfort with my       rule for bill hold   and third  what are member    view on the desir of further coupon purchas this year   in particular  are member comfort with the approach i have spell out   at this point i am seek vote on two propos  mr  chairman  first i ask that the suspens of paragraph   through   of the guidelin for the conduct of system oper in feder agenc issu  adopt on august           be extend through the period until the first fomc meet in        second  i request that paragraph   c  of the author for domest oper  which permit the use of revers repurchas agreement  be retain as a perman amend to the author   my suggest is that i attempt first to answer question on my present and my memo   then the committe could vote on the issu of the guidelin  the first of these two propos   after the discuss and vote on that issu  i would then cover the more technic question relat to the use of revers repurchas agreement
as i listen to you and as i read through the materi  technic speak you are request onli a temporari extens
that is correct
as a practic matter  though  you are set up a framework that would make the rescind of that extens virtual imposs at the end of the day   i exagger onli in part   if  for exampl  the committe were to decid at the behest of the u s  treasuri that our heavi commit in agenc issu was not conson with the basic polici it was administ  the way this is set up could lead to a confront with the             treasuri   we would have to decid whether we would acquiesc in their view or come to a compromis  or someth of that natur   what disturb me is that the concern of the treasuri with respect to agenc issu are not without merit   we are all acut awar of the role of agenc issu in the financi market and the increas signific of what are essenti larg subsid entiti effect take over the mortgag market  or i should say that part of the market that issu conform mortgag debt    i want to be sure that we are in a posit at the point when those decis have to be made that we can in fact make them and that we do not find ourselv irrevoc commit   with a lot of these ratio  the portfolio would be built up in such a way that in order to revers what we have done we would fo  a major wrench of the financi market   it would be unfair to the agenc  for exampl  if we sudden were to liquid signific posit that we had held for a consider period   it is that issu that i would like you to address
i have tri to structur this propos in a way that allow for an exit strategi  but i take your point  mr  chairman    mayb i did not say it blunt enough in my written materi  but i see the committe as have a veri difficult choic to make   one choic is to creat a wrench and strain experi for the u s  treasuri market current by place the entir weight of our demand there  which would caus disloc in credit market more general   but that has to be weigh against the scenario that you spell out   i don t deni at all the plausibl of your concern and the treasuri   s concern  the scenario that you laid out is one that might come to pass   but in my view  if we put the full weight of our demand on the u s  treasuri yield curv for the next six or seven month  we could creat equal disturb  or perhap greater  stress than those that would aris from a gradual roll off of diversifi rps in agenc secur
as a practic matter  what altern do you have to treasuri   what substitut are you plan to employ in our portfolio other than agenc  if ani
there are no substitut   there is u s  treasuri debt   there is straight agenc debt  which we have been take for a long  e  that is  the debt secur of freddi mac  fanni mae  and other agenc   and there are mortgag back secur  includ ginni mae  which we have onli been take sinc octob of last year   so for us to go back and place the full weight of our demand exclus on treasuri would be unwind much more than just what we have done sinc last octob   that would involv unwind practic that have been use sinc  i couldn t give you the date   i was probabl trade basebal card
let me ask you this   suppos we were to urg the treasuri to conclud it evalu  which it is current go through  at a particular rapid pace   how much  e do we have befor you get to the point where such a larg block of your portfolio is in agenc issu that we don t have an exit strategi
i have reserv need by june of     billion   the hypothesi you are offer is reli exclus on treasuri to meet this
no  i am mere ask you at what point in your fund requir do you reach a point from which it is veri difficult to work back   for exampl  if treasuri could get these issu resolv in three week  or six week  or two month  would that provid a basi for a solut   if you can give me an order of magnitud or a  efram  i may be abl to get a treasuri resolut of this issu   what i don t want to see happen is for the treasuri to go down a veri specif path and soma to go down a veri specif             path and end up with a collis   it is veri appar to me that at some point we could get involv in a veri difficult confront   i want to avoid that   i want to see the issu resolv befor we make major chang and then look for an exit strategi   if you said there was an exit strategi  i did not hear it   all i heard was that we have two particular problem
we would creat  if the committe approv what i m suggest  a roll book of           and    day forward rps of rather modest size   small amount would matur everi day  so we would ladder in what we would accept in each case of treasuri  agenc debt  and mortgag back collater   and we would take the relat price that the street give us to avoid disturb the spread  our experi with longer term rps is that we get main agenc debt and mortgag back collater but veri littl treasuri collater   in fact  our abil to get treasuri collater current decay after overnight   that is  we get most overnight treasuri collater   as soon as we are talk about   day or   day rps  the street   not want to give us treasuri collater   this involv just a roll buildup and it could be unwound  i think  without caus ani shock over ani one week or even a one month period   it would roll off rather grace  if that is what the committe want
so you are suggest to me that there realli is no  efram in which it would be particular use to you to get this issu resolv
we have a     billion under reserv need now   we face signific reserv demand in april becaus of the tax season   i would hope to have this issu resolv befor we hit the tax season  frank  to give us some flexibl
when do you think the tax season begin
you want this issu resolv  not the issu the chairman   s refer to
yes  my issu   i would like the flexibl to take a look across all the asset and have a broader pool
we have no problem  or at least i have no problem   get that issu resolv today   that is not what i am concern about   my concern is whether  have creat the author  which is essenti what you are request  we will have an exit strategi   and in what specif  efram would that exit strategi be viabl  if at all  for exampl  if you told me that it would be veri help to get this issu resolv with treasuri by april  st  i could put on a full court press and probabl get it resolv
let me just make sure i understand   in this case by    issu    you mean the issu of the treasuri   s sen ent toward feder agenc issu on the feder reserv   s balanc sheet
correct   vice chair
mr  chairman  it has struck me in watch   and don develop this work that even if the issu were not resolv until the first meet of next year  the hold of agenc issu in the repo book would be of a size that would permit an order unwind   we could do that if we were to decid that in addit to treasuri and agenc there are other thing that we would be abl to take as collater   that is the exit strategi   now  would it be better if the treasuri were to reach a conclus on the agenc issu earlier than that   probabl   i share the concern that you have rais and have been discuss with     but my own view is that as long as we approv this today  the  e we realli need to decid what our exit strategi should be  and that is what the staff will be work on  is no later than the first meet of next year   if it could be done earlier than that  it would be better becaus the size of the book would be smaller
my general concern  assum that the committe author this  is that it not be perceiv as perman  as inde are all of the other author we approv in februari   the latter are legal temporari but for all practic purpos they are perman   i want to make certain that this author is not perceiv in the same light
no  it will not be perceiv as perman   it is don   s intent and mine to tri to get back to the committe as soon as we can in the fall with a complet studi and to put this whole subject on the tabl   we think there is a lot of staff work to be done   it will involv the disciplin task of compar asset and come up with the principl and criteria regard what asset the system should hold   our intent is to put that on the tabl as soon after labor day as we can   and our understand is that the outer limit will be the first meet of       put asid the relationship of the agenc to the feder reserv   s balanc sheet  one other aspect that motiv my request in my memo and present is that i think we have to begin to moder our exclus relianc on treasuri secur for the under growth in the asset side of our balanc sheet   that has noth to do with the agenc   that has noth to do with repo versus outright purchas   we have by tradit reli on outright purchas to meet the growth in demand for currenc in circul  which as it grow forc the growth on the asset side of our balanc sheet
i would suggest  just for the record  that you say you are presum that the surplus that are current project in the unifi budget will inde persist through the year ahead   i say that becaus five year from now you will not want to look back and find that you did not take account of that project
mr  chairman  i am refer to this year   we would be buy somewher between     and     billion of treasuri if we follow our previous norm   that is not a way out forecast   that is a reason number in the circumst   last year we bought     billion   the treasuri market explod on februari  nd when the treasuri announc it was go to buy back     billion of it debt   the japanes have bought     billion over the last    month   the collect monetari author keep siphon asset out of this market and that contribut to veri bizarr behavior   that is my biggest worri   i urg the committe to understand that
i don   t think there is ani question about that   we are all observ that phenomenon   it is crucial that we confront this problem and get it resolv befor it get resolv inadvert by our failur to act   i want to make certain that the  efram on both the treasuri   s side and our side is such that this issu can be appropri resolv
mr  chairman  i think     s and my view was that it could onli be resolv from the feder reserv s perspect in the context of what are we go to do with our balanc sheet   we felt we need to look at all the altern sinc we can t reli on treasuri issu
agre   i just want to put this issu on the tabl
and veri correct so
mr  chairman  walk into this meet  i had an uneasi about this issu similar to what you have just express   so i will make my comment a bit briefer   i             know we have an immedi problem   but  depend on what we assum go forward about the treasuri   s plan and budget surplus  and what happen in the immedi futur regard the demand for treasuri secur  there is a question of the mechan in term of how the feder open market committe will choos to implement it polici in the futur   what you are suggest impli i think a broader studi that is commiss by the feder open market committe regard our abil to implement polici in the futur   we are now be ask about that frequent  what are the best avail option and how do they affect the mechan of monetari polici   so  in addit to   and don  i would suggest that two or three other  either member of this committe or reserv bank director of research  take a look at this issu at the broad level  especi if we are talk about put off the complet of the studi until either late this year or next year   i think it would be veri benefici to us to have a broader particip in a studi that is commiss by the full committe
don  what are your plan at the moment
we were go to meet after this meet and formul them   for my part  i have ask dave   to play a major role in coordin the studi here at the board  but beyond that  we do not have specif plan
can i ask committe member to respond to presid hoenig   s suggest   if you have ani idea on that  pleas come forward   presid jordan
thank you   i read through this materi  of cours  thought about it  and gave it to a coupl of peopl on my staff to read it   one reaction from my staff was along the line of   well  you don   t have ani choic but to approv this   i don   t like to be in situat where i feel that i don t have ani choic   in addit  they said   onc you do this  of cours  you             will never revers it  so just recogn that you re head down a slipperi slope   that   not leav me veri comfort at all  one way of think about what we do when we conduct oper of the system open market account is that we are monet govern debt  the liabil side of our balanc sheet is in effect non interest bear govern debt   on the asset side we hold interest bear govern debt that has effect been cancel   when you were in boy scout     wright patman use to say we could burn the bond we hold and nobodi would know the differ   but that is true onli if it is govern debt that has in effect been cancel by our activ   onc we broaden what we are will to monet  we are do someth quit differ and that leav me veri uncomfort   so  if there are some altern rather than continu these oper in agenc  i realli would like to pursu them   anyth   i would almost rather we monet state govern debt  i think  but i m not so sure of that either
that   s certain one of the altern   it would be possibl for the committe today to give the desk the author to go to the full extent allow statutorili   the feder reserv act would permit us to do foreign currenc swap  it also allow us to take on state and municip debt in anticip of revenu  so there is a limit set on state and local debt  we could do all those thing   you could author that   i   m not sure i could go out tomorrow morn and actual begin to carri out such a decis  given the mechan of the market  and i   m not sure we would know what the consequ would be   and that  i think  is don   s point and mine   we care about the consequ  there are some other altern  but we want to be care to avoid the law of unintend consequ in jump into them   we have been take agenc debt  the straight debt  for mani  mani year   and ad mortgag back secur to             that actual let us bring in ginni mae mortgag back secur  which are the equival of feder govern debt  we had not been take in ginni mae befor last octob   so bring in the mortgag back collater at least partial correct a slight imbal in our previous behavior   if there is an altern that we could implement tomorrow morn  i am all ear   but i   m afraid i don   t have one in my pocket
thus the studi
thus  we need to think about other asset
i would just follow up on what jerri jordan said with a brief comment aim at what you contempl do in the studi  don and     i certain understand the situat we are in and the need to look at option  but i would hope that in do that we keep in mind the fundament basic principl here   we must be abl to conduct monetari polici independ in order to maintain low inflat   and if we re go to do that  we have to maintain our financi independ  that is  our off budget status   for that reason i think it is essenti that we not be perceiv in ani way as misus our off budget status  whatev the impetus may be  for fiscal purpos that depart from our basic monetari polici mission   so  with that in mind  i think the choic of asset that we hold in our portfolio ought to be made with a view to minim the likelihood that we could be drawn  inadvert  into fiscal matter involv credit alloc or credit enhanc or subsidi or anyth of that sort   and the absenc of such involv in fiscal issu is what is so wonder about treasuri and whi we have had a prefer for oper in treasuri secur for so mani year   so i am hope  and i think this is what jerri was say  that we will do everyth we             can as a first step to work with the treasuri to get them to tailor their debt manag procedur in a way that would help us meet our need
how do you stand with respect to presid hoenig   s suggest   what i am hear here is a suggest that there be some sort of consult subcommitte of the fomc  which would not tri to get into the detail of the discuss and work go on  but would have a broad oversight role in look at the process   i don   t know whether i got a repres sampl of the committe but that is what i   m hear from presid hoenig and a few other   if there is a differ of view among other in the committe i would appreci hear it express becaus this is a far more import issu than strict the technic oper of the desk   i think it is import that that be understood and that we don   t get  as presid broaddus said  inadvert consequ    this should not in ani way forestal the abil of the desk to carri out our direct   we cannot just arbitrarili say to the desk that our target for the fund rate is x  do it   well  the question is      how      we have to keep in mind that there is not an infinit set of possibl here   but we also have to be awar of our interact with treasuri  which is effect rais the same issu in a differ context   we have to make certain that our decis as we go forward are consist with the purpos of the committe and our fundament monetari polici prerog   i am tri to draw out member to address these issu and see where we are   presid pool
mr  chairman  i certain agre that we need a thorough  ongo studi of these issu becaus they are much more than just technic issu   i also think that we ought not to prejudg the outcom of that studi   as much as we may be uncomfort with have impact on the treasuri market in the mean   i think the least riski altern for us is to continu to conduct open market oper in the style that we have histor   we are             not go to run out of treasuri debt between now and septemb or the end of this year  or whenev we get this studi complet   i would rather see us take the risk of have some effect on that market that we would prefer not to have than to find ourselv slip for technic reason into someth that we do not fulli understand
we do  rememb  still have over      trillion of treasuri debt held by the public
there is quit a bit left out there  yes
sever week    salari for some of us   governor
i think it is more than sever week for me
how about a month
i am in favor of a thorough studi  overseen on a consult basi by a subcommitte of the fomc   i think we are in a difficult posit   frank  i have noth wise to add on this  but i do have a question   as i understand it  the problem with get more into the repo market  which get us into the agenc market  is that we do not in ani way want to reinforc the so call feder subsidi   that is the real risk   and  as i understand it  that   s the treasuri s problem   there is municip debt out there  which appar is part of our legal author to purchas   but if we got into that market  either through outright purchas or use such debt as collater for repo  wouldn   t that generat a similar kind of subsidi for the state and local market   there is alreadi a tax subsidi in that area  so  sn t that make the whole problem a lot wors   am i miss someth
no  i don t think so   the problem is that wherev we sit down we displac a lot of water   it  sn   t matter whose oblig they are   and the further problem is             that we have to sit somewher   at the present we are give the subsidi to treasuri and agenc debt and to mortgag back bond  it is spread around   if we were to settl in on municip debt  we would give that market a littl kick as well   we cannot avoid the consequ
in the end the amount of subsidi we give depend in part  i presum  on the size of the market  right   if we re buy or hold as collater just a tini proport of a given type of oblig  the subsidi is much less
so  when you and don and whoever els get into this  i think a relev number to determin and consid might be the amount of the subsidi  if you can convert them into basi point  given that we cannot be total purist and we re go to have to subsid someth   what i am a littl at sea about is exact how import the subsidi is  given that there is go to be some subsidi   as i say  i have no answer   but i think that is the question unless somebodi can persuad me otherwis
i also am in favor of a studi of a broader rang of asset that we may or may not find use to includ in open market oper   i thought that was what don and   were suggest   and if some of us or some of our research director can be help in that regard  i am total in favor of that   in a way i feel kind of like alic in wonderland here  on the one hand  the treasuri is concern about the gses   on the other hand it is restrict the avail amount of    year bond and is effect creat a brand new market for freddi mac and fanni mae to get into with    year benchmark secur   it seem to me that they cannot have it both way
that is their problem
yes  that is their problem
but that is where we could come in   in other word  in this negoti one of the thing we could put on the tabl is for them basic to increas the    year fund   the reason they don   t want to do that at the moment is that they have this project that the debt will disappear in the year      or        and whi would they want to be buy back    year issu  which still have matur of    year  at some signific premium  that is a much smaller issu as far as i am concern than this other problem   and it may veri well be that the solut to this dilemma for the interim period is to induc the treasuri to alter it debt manag polici in a manner that make it easier for   and the desk to function
i   m not so sure it is a realli good idea for the debt to disappear
well  there is a simpl way we could avoid that   we could have the feder reserv bank of new york accumul as fiscal agent of the treasuri a lot of privat secur   and they would be issu public debt on the other side   or we could think of some expenditur program  if you like    laughter
no  i know that is not a good idea either   but when one think about the liquid of the u s  govern secur market and all that it   as a safe haven  a store of valu  and so forth  i don   t know whether it is such a good idea to have it all disappear
i certain am in favor of the studi and i think the suggest that tom hoenig made was construct   to deal somewhat with the issu bill pool was rais  is it possibl to have the temporari suspens extend for a shorter period   in other word  is this studi of suffici import that it ought to be done much more expediti and then perhap our decis could be reach much more quick
let me suggest that that is probabl not a good idea  the reason is that we   d have to report the extens in the minut becaus it involv a formal chang to one of the committe   s instrument  the author for domest open market oper   it would creat more attent and discuss of this issu than i suspect we want   i think the import consider is not what we do here formal but what we conclud our polici is move toward   how it is offici handl is far less import than our general sens of where we are go   so  i would prefer that we not truncat   s author in this regard becaus he presum will do as the committe request  and we are meet everi six week
may i ask the question a littl differ   let me ask   and don the question   do we need to extend this temporari author befor the studi is complet   is it so import to the effect conduct of open market oper that wait until the studi is done befor we address this issu is critic   that was my basic question in term of the studi
i   m sorri if the memo did not speak clear enough on this point   if the temporari extens laps  it is a veri narrow issu   it is schedul to laps on april   th and thereaft i would not be abl to take ginni mae   i could still take freddi mac and fanni mae issu  both straight debt and mortgag back secur   now  for mani year we have taken the straight debt and  therefor  we have been do a    favor    to freddi and fanni and none to ginni   so if the current author laps  we will go back to that status of just take the straight debt of freddi mac and fanni mae and the other minor agenc and take noth of ginni mae   given the concern  that seem to be one of the more pervers way to go   so it is in part to avoid that pervers outcom that we want to extend this author   as i tri to spell out at the veri end of the memo  the most ration and perhap pure of heart way to proceed would be for the committe to issu me a new guidelin say that i can onli take             treasuri and ginni mae   if the committe did that in the current environ  i promis you that would be a molotov cocktail in the credit market   i wish it weren   t  i wish you had that freedom   but it is my advic to you that that would be throw a match into a room full of gasolin   i regret where we are   i understand jerri jordan   s frustrat that there is a sens of limit option  but that is where we are   and that is whi the laps of the author now is so awkward
we can tighten polici and get rid of all of our bond   laughter
let me just comment that i think what   just said is import  and in some sens  respond to bill pool s thought  i think we have to be care not to collaps both the tactic and strateg decis here simultan   my sens is that the way we can do the least harm is to handl the tactic issu  which is basic to provid this temporari extens to   while the studi goe on   anyth other than that strike me  and   just said this  as be high riski and perhap send all the wrong messag   at the same  e we should recogn that the studi that need to be done has broader implic  as the chairman has indic   but i would be a littl concern if our broader strateg concern forc us to withdraw the author that is alreadi there  which could send veri confus messag and have who know what reaction   so  i think the least harm action is just to continu the temporari author and do the studi   and then some  later this year we will have to make a broader strateg decis
yes  i think that is wise   let me suggest the follow  one  i will take it upon myself to see if i can expedit the treasuri   s decis on this process and have them made as quick as possibl   i will communic to them what our concern are             and what our problem are   i will consult with don and other on the format of a subcommitte of the fomc to overse the broader question and interfac with   and don as they work on this studi   and then we   ll keep the studi under continu review becaus it is truli a profound import issu for this committe   it should not be  as we tend on too mani occas to think of it  a tactic question   there is a deep seat issu here of the role of a central bank as a financi intermediari   and how we handl that role is not without major implic   the issu  effect  has not come up for a veri  veri long  e so we have been lull into somnol on this question   it is a deeper issu than we have been communic and i think it is import for us to recogn that   so i would recommend that we move forward and accept     s request and immedi form a committe within the next week or two and keep the matter on the agenda as is relev   and  hope  when we get the report  after labor day did you say
as soon after labor day as we can  given the sequenc of meet and topic
we should then be make a lot of major decis  but it is quit import to make certain as we move toward that point that we leav ourselv the flexibl to make those decis  which was my origin point   governor
i have no problem with that   i think it is a good resolut of the issu   but i have a question  and that is   who say what to the public about this
there are two point at which that will come up   the market is awar that our author to take a broader pool of asset laps on april   th and that our reserv need peak around that last week of april and into earli may   the other point will be the minut of this meet   it would be desir for me to say someth so that the market is not surpris if             we start do some rps that roll into may   if we do a    day rp at that point  we wouldn   t want to get a big market distort   so i think we will have to say someth to clarifi our author to undertak such transact   the minut would come out somewhat later
are there ani further question for   or comment on this issu   if not  would somebodi like to move   s recommend
is there a second  speaker      second
all in favor say    aye     sever      aye
oppos   the    aye    have it   thank you
i have a second issu on which i need a vote   i hope this will be quicker   mr  chairman  i sent a separ memo to the committe on march   th ask that paragraph   c  of the author for domest oper  which give us the author to do revers repurchas agreement  be retain as a perman amend   when i say perman  though  pleas understand that of cours you can chang it at ani  e you want   as i explain when we were ask for that amend last fall becaus of our y k concern  we thought we might need to have this author technic in the y k environ and the tri parti world  howev  as i mention then  this is a practic that the market has move to   our outsid account have been urg us to move to revers rp account   our own intern account peopl  both here in washington and in new york  would prefer a move in this direct   we are now in the process of instal a new trade system   it would be a shame not to lock this in place so we can avoid the troubl of custom a lot of softwar and line up with what             everyon has want us to do all along   so my second request is to retain paragraph   c  as a perman amend to the author for domest oper
this mean that until you have the new system in place you will continu with the tri parti arrang and so forth   have you ever use them   did they work satisfactorili
the tri parti arrang have work reason well   they do involv more complic than our regular clear system  but we are work on includ that capac in our new system as well   so i want to separ that issu   we did not do revers rps via tri parti  we never found an occas to do revers rps  so we did not test that   we may at some point want to test that   the issu here is that if we leav this paragraph in the author  we will essenti have the author to do both match sale and revers rps go forward   at some point  about two year from now  when we have a new system in place and we see where we are  we may end up drop the match sale author  but that is off in the horizon
let me ask one follow up question   one of the reason you want to go with tri parti custodian was that they were more capabl of price the broader rang of collater you were go to be take   also  it gave you the capabl to do oper later in the day to mop up reserv  a capabl we did not have in our own system   will the new trade process system do all of that
our new trade process system we hope will facilit such transact   one of the reason we did not use the revers rps to drain reserv had to do with the clear bank system   but the clear bank system did do the valuat of the collater              which simpli would have been imposs for us   so  i want to be clear that we couldn   t be accept this collater if we were not use their valuat system   i don   t recal precis whether we focus on late day drain in our trade process system  but we are at this point acceler the configur of our system to accommod tri parti arrang   that is one of the issu that is in front of us now
so  you have not made up your mind whether you are go to
we are go to push for that   it is a question of how mani dollar we spend on it
yes  or whether you continu to reli on the clear bank   but you have not yet made up your mind
further question for     if not  would somebodi like to move his recommend
move approv of the second recommend
is there a second  speaker      second
without object   thank you veri much   we put you through a lot of work today   let   s move on to the econom situat  and i call on     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman  the econom pictur remain the same in mani respect as it has been for some  e   the now record long expans has continu to outstrip most analyst    expect  includ our own  meanwhil  inflat  apart from the price of energi  has remain relat low   beneath these broad trend  there   s the usual abund of interest sector detail  but sift through them  as we did in the  book   sn   t seem to add a great deal to the stori   certain  it provid no clear indic as to when this extraordinari perform might end            obvious  a key element in the continu of the favor pattern has been product   just as the chairman predict  the incom data have prompt us to rais our sight on the pace of structur improv in output per hour   we   re now put it at     percent per annum for the nonfarm busi sector this year and next  two tenth more than the alreadi elev figur embed in our prior forecast   while the better than   percent fourth quarter gain in real gdp is to some extent suspect  even when we pare away the question defens surg  we   re left with an impress increas in product for the year  close to       percent   some of that probabl was cyclic  in the sens that it reflect a stretch of the work forc in a period of surg demand  anyon who went to a retail establish dure the holiday shop season and had to wait in a check out line will attest to that   but we also think that the sustain improv in effici come from the use of more and better capit equip and from oper chang like are come at a fa  pace   the result has been an absolut declin in unit labor cost that evid has restor most of the squeez in the profit share of gdp that occur as the world economi weaken in the wake of the asian crisi   at the same  e  competit pressur have translat a portion of this reduct in cost into subdu core price inflat  especi in good market  where at least physic plant capac remain ampl here and abroad   the unment factor in this arithmet is wage   it seem to me that the anecdot account in the beigebook and elsewher are tell us that it   s cost employ more to hire and retain staff  if not in straight wage  then in bonus  stock option  and other fring benefit   still  the aggreg statist data we have in hand don   t reveal ani signific pickup in the pace of compens increas   perhap it   s a reflect of the measur problem to which we   ve repeat call your attent   but  when we look at the behavior of price and profit  it realli is rather difficult to argu that the data have been give us a mislead signal about the general direct of labor cost   this is not to say  howev  that there are no inflat risk in the near term outlook   it   s quit possibl  inde  in our view probabl  that the report of compens pressur will be mirror in an acceler trend of wage and benefit in the come month   apart from the tight of the labor market  we would expect the now       percent year on year cpi inflat to show through in the wage set process  and there are no sign of an abat of the step up in medic insur premium               the run up in oil price was  of cours  the major factor in the cpi acceler i just mention   we   re hope that the price of crude has crest  but even if that   s so  there   s the possibl that  apart from the wage effect  the increas cost of fuel and energi input will begin to show through more than they have to date in the price of finish good and servic   there are mani report of transport charg be rais  and the imprint of higher petroleum cost is visibl in a wide rang of materi price  but one is hard press at this point to identifi the pass through at the consum level  asid from airfar   this is someth that bear close watch  howev   and so  too  are indic of inflat expect  in this regard  friday   s preliminari result from the march michigan src survey  show a notic rise in averag short  and long run price expect  may be a worrisom sign   speak of worri  the src survey also show a drop off in the overal index of consum sen ent   that said  though  peopl still appear to be in an extraordinarili good mood   and the downturn in fuel price that we   re anticip will begin in a few month should help buoy their spirit  and their real incom   the moder in domest demand in our forecast thus continu to hing larg on the influenc of the less accommod financi condit that we   ve anticip     has cover much of what has occur of late in fix incom market   i won   t subject you to anoth lengthi recit of my jaundic view of what has been transpir in the equiti market  i   ll just say that  despit some movement toward reconverg in recent day of    old economi    and    new economi    stock  i still find the valuat of mani so call tech compani  and the rational analyst give for them  rather wacki   the fact is  though  that at ye day   s close the wilshir      was up fulli   percent from the        level prevail a week ago  when we lock into our  book assumpt of a flat stock market through the project period   whether this is just nois or a signific signal of a differ direct for the equiti market than we   ve assum  i   ll leav for you to judg   as you know  we   ve judg that it could well take a substanti further increas in the fed fund rate to rais bond yield appreci and hold the stock market down   it   s possibl that consum demand will soften even if share price exceed our expect  there undoubt have been some acceler type effect at work in the case of home  motor vehicl  and other durabl  and these could abat more quick than we have anticip              but we remain persuad  even if some other analyst are not  that lag wealth effect are import  and so we would expect that  bar a sizabl stock market correct in the near futur  the tendenc will be for household spend to remain robust   abund capit that is view as cheap relat to the anticip return is also support busi invest   consequ  we think that a consider tighten of financi market condit is like to be need if this economi is not to overheat more as a stronger rest of the world economi begin to leav it mark on our trade balanc over come quarter   with that set up  let me turn the floor over to

i have a short question for    or what could be a short question  the discuss in the  book seem to put primari weight on the current account as the under factor in the forecast for the dollar   i would think that you would want to put a lot more emphasi on the capit account and condit affect it   we are in a rise interest rate environ   the economi remain veri strong   my tendenc would be to tilt the dollar forecast in the other direct   that is  look ahead over the next year or two  condit in the unit state would suggest at least continu mainten of the dollar at it current level or  if anyth  a stronger dollar   could you respond to that
that is whi in fact we have littl tilt either way   there are factor on both side   look forward  in some sens we see the u s  economi slow  at least that is the maintain hypothesi in the  book and in so mani other forecast of late  and we see the rest of the world get stronger and stronger   so on those ground  i   m not sure that the edg in a relat sens  in term of the pace of activ and the explor of new opportun             and the capac to attract invest so to speak   sn t still lie abroad    grant  that   s a relat type comparison rather than an absolut one   on the one hand  the slow in the u s  economi that is depict in the  book aris larg from higher interest rate and a tighten of financi condit more general   becaus those are the drive factor  one might argu that we should continu to attract capit inflow   on the other hand  those higher interest rate could achiev a stock market outcom that seem less reward to capit inflow  in essenc  we don t have an answer as to which of these mani compet element will domin and over what part of the forecast period   we ve chosen an almost flat  though not quit flat  outcom for the dollar just as a mean of say that we can identifi forc go one way and we can identifi forc go the other way
how would you character the degre of monetari restraint in the year      in this forecast versus the januari forecast   i ask that becaus nomin rate are about     percentag point higher in the latest forecast and inflat rate in overal price indic like the cpi are up by almost the same amount  but the core rate are about the same as in the previous forecast   i m not sure  in your deliber and the way you look at this  how you formul your view about real rate   and i was curious about how you see the differ in this forecast versus the previous one
real rate have been more difficult to gaug than usual in this period becaus of the distort  if i can put it that way  that have occur in the fix incom market  we ve seen treasuri yield come down substanti  while movement in other rate have been someth of a mix bag   but in mani case long term rate have actual come down a bit and run below our expect   in term of inflat expect  there are some hint  but onli             some  of an upward movement  larg in respons to what has been occur in the oil market  and there are some counter indic  too   the tip spread  for exampl  certain hasn t been move up late   again  that might be confound by the treasuri market illiquid    so it is rather difficult to gaug   bottom line  we felt that while the stock market seem to be on the track we were anticip  at least up until the  e we fix the number for our assumpt here  interest rate develop certain were not on the tighter side of what we were anticip   the economi was show more momentum come into the year   and we felt that some greater tighten of polici probabl would be requir to keep aggreg demand and suppli in a balanc similar to what we had in the prior forecast   at this point  we have what i would perceiv to be a rather similar degre of tighten in the real fund rate becaus we do have a somewhat higher inflat path   we have ad onli a     point on the fund rate   we have long term rate go up more than befor in the corpor market  in part becaus my sens was that we realli had too much yield curv flatten befor and more tighten will be need in the long end   perhap it will take more tighten in the short end in order to impos an upward restraint on the economi and bring aggreg demand and suppli back into balanc
so there isn t a major chang
it   s not a major chang   i d say  on balanc  that the pictur might be a littl tighter in term of the overal fix incom market assumpt
thank you   i want to ask a question about the altern simul   as a general comment  let me say that i like have the altern simul  nevertheless  those that are now includ in the  book and all of the other supplementari             one that you have been send to us are start to tax my abil to absorb the inform and know what i m learn from them   the one i want to focus on is the one that assum fa  product growth   at the last meet there was a simul in the chart show show that fa  product growth set in motion some dynam that result in accommod monetari polici and an acceler in nomin spend  especi if the forecast is extend out veri far   so it struck me when i saw in this one that the fa  product growth result in a littl fa  output growth from      to       it   s up      but the pce rate of inflat drop by       that suggest that nomin incom growth is slower under the fa  product growth scenario shown here than in the baselin   so that say to me that this particular simul   not have built into it  at least for this horizon  an accommod monetari polici
i   m not sure which number you are look at   the fa  product growth simul has substanti higher real gdp growth  it   s     percentag point higher in      and     percentag point more in        so nomin gdp growth is much more rapid in the high product simul
in      i agre  but then it slow in        i   m not sure what kind of lag are go on here becaus your fa  product growth has gdp growth up     but inflat down     in        i thought you were say that with this lag effect of an accommod monetari polici  nomin spend growth acceler   and that at least is not what is shown here
could i interrupt   one of you is look at the differ between the simul and the baselin  the other is look at the year to year chang
yes  i   m see that   i perceiv this as a situat where polici is veri accommod   it is take this favor shock in signific part through higher output and a             downward movement in the unemploy rate   over  e we will find ourselv in the situat where the labor market has gotten tighter   peopl will perceiv that they have not been get their share of this fa  growth of the pie and there will be a tendenc for inflat to pick up   and thus you will need to tighten monetari polici signific relat to the baselin path   this simul is generat by the exact same model that generat the other simul  it is the same stori we ve told all along   that you have a choic in the short run of how to respond  how much you are go to take in lower unemploy or how much you might take in a perman lower of the inflat path by hold the line on resourc util with a prompt tighten of polici
well  i thought it was someth like that   that say  though  that the inflationari dynam that you see are beyond the forecast horizon
yes  that is almost alway the case in these exercis
that mean that this simul is of limit use to me if i am go to assum fa  product growth as i formul my think on polici   by this alon i can t tell what i m get myself into
for us  the basic rule is that in the long run monetari polici is go to determin the inflat rate   if you want to achiev the baselin path  while you might have to be fleet of foot here in adjust polici  presum you could do it   but you would have to move prompt or els you will get this short run dynam
i   d like to explor jerri s question a bit differ   as i read the  book and the comment you made today  three factor seem to me to be in play   how we weigh those factor in a sens ration whatev polici we pursu   one factor relat to             how we judg the posit of real interest rate in the context of the budget surplus we talk about earlier   anoth is the product issu  which is more domin and has a veri import role in how we think of the economi go forward and whether we are take the right action   the third factor is the output gap on which the model is base  and the cyclic factor and the nairu that are influenc it   would you discuss for a minut how you weight these factor   i   m wonder which one is domin your think in this model becaus that affect how you ration your posit go forward
it is a veri complex question  and i ll tri to be as brief as possibl   let me cite our basic premis   one is that real interest rate and financi condit in general are not evid so tight as to be veri restrain on the growth of aggreg demand   i think what we have been observ in the perform of the economi is consist with that   second  we do believ  more so than was the case a few year ago  that we are in a period in which product growth has improv and may well improv somewhat further in a fundament and sustain fashion   and that may be give us some favor short term dynam in the sens of an effect lower of the nairu in the short run   the third basic point is that we think the labor market are unsustain tight   if we were to maintain labor market as taut as they are now  we think that over  e  and fair soon  we would begin to see the real wage pressur creep into the actual outcom for compens growth   and we believ that would tend to put upward pressur on unit labor cost and ul  on price  but there are uncertainti in all of these   and what these simul hope were go to help you assess was what the outcom might be if one were more op ist about some of the assumpt   one might look  say  at the period sinc the middl of last year  when the economi has grown veri rapid and we ve seen a sustain low core inflat rate and a             relat stabl unemploy rate  and view that as consist with even higher product growth than we   ve put in this altern simul   or we could be see the result of an even lower nairu than we have contempl   is   percent a sustain unemploy rate  we don t have a way of answer that question   we ve wrestl with this   we ve look at how much can be explain by various model on altern assumpt and so on  and this is our best guess   but we can t by ani mean rule out more op ist view of the current thrust of product or of sustain lower level of unemploy   we are pretti sure that current financi market condit are reason support of an expans of household and busi spend   there is no shortag of credit avail   there are still peopl will to throw money at ipo to financ just about ani idea that anyon can come up with   moreov  the cost of equiti capit seem to be veri low for mani firm and there are onli hint that the rise in mortgag rate has begun to bite on hous  the most interest sensit segment of demand
i had a question on the inventori sale ratio      as we look back  those ratio have been improv for some  e now and i view that as a sort of structur improv due to improv manag techniqu  some improv technolog  and better communic   in the  book this  e you talk about    b b    internet connect as one of the reason for the improv   i m wonder if you see that as someth special that has happen or as just a continu of this longer term trend that we ve been see for some  e
i don t think the b b internet connect stori has been a veri big factor to date   there have been closer connect between firm and their supplier for a while  it is an ongo process that has employ various technolog   our sens is simpli that this             isn t just talk  that mani firm are enter into b b internet arrang that will facilit a continu of this process   it will enabl them to have tighter control over inventori and continu the downward trend that has emerg in the inventori sale ratio in the last few year
so it s more of the same  a structur chang
it s use a somewhat differ technolog  one that has more flexibl   it seem to be envelop an increas proport of our busi firm
further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   presid parri
mr  chairman  the twelfth district economi enter the new year with consider momentum   the pace of job growth in the district has pick up in recent month  further widen the gap in employ growth relat to the nation   the acceler was most pronounc in california  where payrol expand at a       percent averag annual rate in januari and februari  about     percentag point fa  than the pace of growth in       employ growth in the fastest grow state  nevada  arizona  idaho  and california  current is averag from   to over   percent on a    month basi   in other district state employ is expand at or below the nation pace   but in all but utah econom activ has pick up in recent month   robust gain in construct and servic have continu to drive the district economi   collect those two sector creat about    percent of net new job ad dure the past twelv month   job growth in construct has been broad base  boost by strong demand for both residenti and nonresidenti build  in the servic sector  rapid expans among provid of internet and softwar servic remain the key compon of growth   but recent provid of servic relat to popul growth  health care is one exampl  and to tourism also have ad job at a brisk             pace   strong job growth over the past twelv month has further tighten district labor market   the district unemploy rate fell to       percent in januari  down     percentag point from the averag in        howev  as of yet  tight labor market have not result in greater wage inflat in the district   in fact  data from the eci point to slower wage growth in the district in      than we experienc in        this pattern of declin unemploy and slower wage growth owe in part  we believ  to three factor   first  increas in the use of altern and uncount form of employe compens such as stock option and hire bonus  and also job reclassif of worker receiv pay rais  second  a declin in wage growth in high tech manufactur associ with slower employ growth in that sector  and third  the rapid movement of less qualifi worker into exist job classif at lower wage  look forward  some of the factor temper wage growth in      may be revers in the come year   for exampl  improv demand within district high tech manufactur has begun to boost employ growth  make further deceler in wage growth in that sector unlik   also  data for california indic that the number of potenti worker is diminish  the flow of new entrant into unemploy is slow  and unemploy rate among subgroup with lower than averag skill level are fall  turn to the nation economi  the data releas dure the past month show no slacken in domest demand   real final sale rose about   percent at an annual rate dure the second half of last year and our forecast is for much the same pace of growth dure the first part of this year   this rate of sale growth most like is unsustain and is especi a concern given the current level of resourc util   therefor  our forecast assum a signific further tighten of financi condit over the next six month   this tighten includ a             rise in corpor and mortgag rate  a flatten of broad stock market valuat  and   underpin these develop  a gradual increas of    basi point in the fund rate   such financi restraint help to slow real gdp growth to   percent this year and       percent next year in our forecast  still  even with the slow of real econom activ  our inflat project is disappoint   dure the past few year  the core pce price index has risen about       percent each year  which is somewhat abov my view of price stabil   unfortun  our forecast anticip that core pce inflat will rise to almost   percent by next year  give up the gain made toward price stabil sinc the mid     s   as we all know  there are mani risk to such an inflat forecast   in particular  we are uncertain about how much and how fast energi price will pass through to other price  about how much demand will increas from the economi abroad  and about whether stock price or product growth will surg or fall   howev  despit all the possibl scenario that could be construct  the under tight of labor market and the recent extraordinari growth in demand impli a veri high risk that core inflat will rise at a fa  pace this year and next   thank you
thank you   in convers with director and advisori council member and other  one remark of a general natur  at least until the recent switch in the stock market with the dow jone up and the nasdaq down  was a veri frequent lament about the pervers behavior of the stock market   that compani like feder and kroger and some of the bank and other firm in our district are have record earn and their stock are tank  it was just a few year ago that the rap on corpor america was that it was shortsight  care onli about current period earn and not at all about the futur   and now onli the futur is             reward  even if a compani   s earn are expect to materi some  e in the far distant futur  and there   s no reward at all for good perform today  there is a uniform expect that this year as a whole will be stronger than last year  in bank  all loan categori  with the except of mortgag refinanc activ  are report strong   one of the larg region bank said that they had surpris strong deposit growth in the first two month  surpass even the growth of their earn asset   that same bank report to us that it own profit plan for this year includ an increas in interest expens that would be consist with a rise in the structur market interest rate of    to     basi point  again it was report that bank stock invest fund have been experienc substanti redempt  which are forc them to liquid signific block of their hold  throughout the region there is a substanti new amount of retail space under construct   peopl comment on it with the usual observ that overbuild is occur  though each one of the individu project seem somehow to be ration   public sector construct spend  for new stadium and the like  as well as residenti construct spend point to activ this year be abov that of last year   howev  the new stadium under construct in cincinnati and pittsburgh are said to be head for major overrun  as was the case with the cleveland stadium   contact in the construct industri claim that deliveri  e for b  is now up to one year and they say we can expect drywal shortag this summer  asphalt and roof materi price are up sharpli and paper price are quot at level    percent abov those prevail last summer  in the distribut busi  along the line of what   also note  freight cost are said to be skyrocket   packag materi and insur cost are report to be    to    percent higher than at this  e a year ago   retail indic that there was no post holiday             drop off in sale   they came into the new year with lean inventori  so there was no pressur at all for markdown sale in an effort to move out merchandis   a manufactur of sport apparel said everyth was sell veri well and price seem to be no object   some retail had record earn for the fourth quarter and they expect earn this year to exceed those level  on the other hand  a major restaur chain that is headquart in our area said that their labor cost as a share of their total menu price have risen from    to    percent just a few year ago to about    percent now   and they find that they frequent have to rope off part of their restaur becaus they don t have adequ staff   labor cost for deliveri  warehous  and retail staff are report to averag    percent higher than a year ago  with entri level wage up    to    percent  i   ll cite one particular report on inflat  and price power  i guess   a director who is involv in the sport and entertain busi said that for a recent concert by the back street boy in the gund arena the broker resel ticket were abl to get      per ticket  most of the report about health care cost were the same as we have all heard befor  with increas in the doubl digit rang   but with increas frequenc  both director and advisori council member told of action they have taken to shift cost to their employe  which rais some question in my mind about how labor cost are report   what happen  accord to them  is that they get a quot from their medic care processor supplier for a doubl digit price increas and they don t want to pay that   so if they had co pay befor  they rais the co pay amount   if they didn t have co pay  they introduc them  both for the offic visit and for prescript drug   also  they are rais the deduct   so  one might assum that the cost of the health care benefit provid is unchang where in fact it has been shift from the employ to the employe as a way for the compani to avoid incur a higher benefit cost   that seem             to me to be a reduct in the real wage of the employe   i don t know how that would ever get report or captur in ani of the data that we look at  let me make some comment about the nation economi and the way we think about and talk about monetari polici and what we are tri to accomplish   we all see these newslett and press report with statement about how the feder reserv want to push up interest rate in order to hurt interest sensit sector  and those who incur interest expens  household or busi or other  think that isn t fair   this remind me of a lot of the    vic  sector    type of discuss of old  back when ed   attend his first meet almost    year ago  that we some  heard   the theme was that the purpos of rais interest rate was to hit hous  which in turn  with multipli and rippl effect  would affect the rest of the economi  instead of think about action on the overnight interbank rate as someth design to push up other market interest rate and affect the economi through that channel of influenc  i think there is a differ way to think about this   the issu in regard to the interbank rate versus the structur of other interest rate is whether we have it calibr at the right level or not   when we have signific increas in product and the pace of technolog innov has pick up  that   mean in an import econom sens that there is greater wealth be creat in the economi   usual we have use label to refer theori or framework that talk about how peopl s percept of their abil to consum over  e is influenc by someth over and abov chang in their current measur incom or cash flow incom   we have such construct as the perman incom hypothesi  the life cycl hypothesi  and  from one of my teacher  the standard incom hypothesi   we use these theori to think about whi it is that at  e observ consumpt spend  sn t move up or down as             strong as measur incom or measur cash flow incom   peopl are ration in a longer  e horizon than what that paycheck number say to them  but we can revers that kind of analysi and think about a situat in which the perman incom has move up relat to measur or paycheck incom  creat the percept on the part of household that their abil to consum over  e has increas compar to what they thought befor   and they can see that in a number of way   with a credibl anti inflationari monetari polici  they see it in lower nomin interest rate   they can refin their hous so they have more discretionari dispos incom left over after they have paid the mortgag and other interest expens   they expect  after a sustain period of rise incom and sustain employ  that that will continu   they see that their employ   s retir plan is enhanc relat to what it was befor   their own     k  may look better than it did befor  so they perceiv that they can live better in retir than they use to think  which mean they don   t have to save as much now for retir as they thought earlier  so  there is a whole varieti of way that suggest that consumpt expenditur by household would like increas   demand would be expect to increas in a period of rapid product gain and increas financi innov   and at the same  e  those same factor mean that the margin product of capit has improv  move out to a higher isoqu  so that claim on the current resourc util to enhanc futur abil to consum have increas   that mean that real interest rate have risen  by definit  whether we can observ them or not    both forc at work simultan say that the real level of interest rate is higher  now  in the gold standard world that is not a problem becaus the price level fall  so there is no need for an increas in nomin interest rate   real interest rate go up becaus there is a             declin inflat compon  or mayb even a negat inflat compon in there   the same is true with a disciplin final demand or monetari growth kind of regim  in an interest rate peg regim  though  it s differ   if the whole structur of interest rate is under upward pressur becaus of rise real interest rate  then a failur to move the overnight interbank rate up mean that we have to inject high power or central bank money at a fa  rate through open market oper in order to maintain the same fed fund or overnight rate as otherwis   so the purpos of rais the overnight interbank rate is not necessarili becaus we want to push up other interest rate   the purpos is simpli to slow the pace at which we increas total liquid in the economi that accommod that acceler in nomin demand that would occur if we didn t push up the fund rate   i don t view it as an exercis in tri to seek a vic  sector or tri to penal somebodi by rais interest rate  i just want to slow the growth of central bank money
mr  chairman  may i just put in an inform note here   i think the eci is design to captur the kind of medic cost phenomenon you describ  presid jordan   it s veri difficult  i suspect  to get it just right  but it may be one of the reason whi we have not seen an acceler of medic insur cost in the eci commensur with the huge price increas that we ve heard busi talk about
thank you  mr  chairman   the overal pace of activ in our district  which was alreadi strong  may actual have acceler a bit over the last sever week   and the strength we see is pretti much across the board   just to summar quick  our latest retail survey  which we do month along with a manufactur survey  suggest that consum spend in our district is veri strong   auto sale in our region  as elsewher in the             countri  are quit robust  as are depart store sale   moreov  the strength in retail sale now goe beyond the discount like target and wal mart  which have been do fair well all along  and extend to mid price store and specialti shop as well   in manufactur  shipment and new order are veri strong in our region   our sens is that a good bit of this reflect increas export activ   elsewher  new residenti build permit were down a bit in the fourth quarter  but all of the anecdot report we hear on hous suggest that the sector remain quit healthi   despit all of this evid of except strong demand  we don t yet see ani broad sign of an acceler in price beyond those that are direct affect by higher fuel price  with respect to expect  busi peopl in our region are veri op ist at this stage about their futur prospect   i don t want to be too anecdot  but perhap the best exampl of this op  is the amount of invest in new golf cours and  in our region in particular  stock car race facil   it is just astonish   i think it reflect a veri broad base bullish in attitud in our area   this op  in our district seem consist with what i sens to be the prevail attitud at the nation level  as i interpret the recent data  they continu to show ever more dramat the effect of the increas in trend product growth on both domest demand and suppli in the u s  economi   on the suppli side  as     mention  product growth came in at     percent in        that is     percentag point higher than the project in the januari  book   and the staff has now rais it es  of under structur trend product growth to     percent   on the demand side  there   s a host of veri strong number   we now know that real gdp grew at a   percent rate in the fourth quarter   that is almost a   percentag point upsid surpris compar with the es  in the januari  book   that has been             carri forward to the project of gdp growth for the first quarter  which is now     percent higher than in the last  book  and for the second and third quarter  the project is about     percent higher   i have been involv with these meet for mani year  not as long as ed  but for a long  e  and those are veri big revis in my experi here  even more remark  privat domest final purchas  a good measur of aggreg domest demand  are now project to grow fulli   percentag point fa  than was expect in the previous  book   moreov  the imbal between the current growth of domest demand and current avail suppli seem to me ever more appar   job growth in januari and februari was onli slight below the averag month growth in job last year  and that unfortun was well abov trend pace   and onli a big increas in import prevent the domest spend surg from put even more pressur on domest suppli  in ani case  with that as background  the key question for us  and i assum everybodi know this  is whether we have suffici strong restrain forc in place so that we can expect to see this imbal diminish and ul  go away   in that regard  longer term interest rate rose a percentag point or so last year as household and firm borrow against their expect higher futur earn to purchas good and servic   and that rise in rate was help becaus longer term rate help bring demand and suppli back into balanc by make it more cost to consum current those thing one can consum in the futur   in other word  it make peopl more patient   with that and the veri robust data we are look at in mind  along with the higher project for futur growth not onli in the  book but among other forecast as well  it look to me as though real longer term interest rate need to rise further to correct the current imbal   as it happen  though  if one look at the data over the last sever week  there realli hasn t been much movement in long term interest rate   we are not get             that kind of support effect   of cours  treasuri rate are down   but other long term rate  even the bbb corpor rate  have been basic flat for the last sever week  i think expect about futur fed polici and mayb some chang nuanc in expect are play a role in this   as i believ somebodi alreadi mention and as the first chart in the bluebook show  impli futur fund rate at least for the second half of this year are now actual lower than they were at the  e of our last meet   so it may well be that the market are expect us to tighten less aggress now than they did earlier  given the good behavior of some lead indic of futur inflat like unit labor cost and so forth   sinc long term rate are an averag of expect futur short rate  at least up to the term premium  this would tend to keep longer term rate lower than they otherwis would be  in my view  mr  chairman  that s a problem in term of help us creat the sort of expect climat we need in order to correct the demand suppli imbal in a reason smooth manner   i would hope that we might give that issu some attent when we talk about polici later on in the meet
thank you  mr  chairman   the region economi in the philadelphia district continu to oper at high level  with moder growth and tight labor market but with few sign of acceler inflat   there is a hint of possibl slow in the hous area  but the rest of the region economi  includ retail and manufactur  continu to exhibit strong demand   although there are exampl of outsiz wage increas  wage growth general remain moder   onli the cost of health care benefit is rise notic fa    product growth for the most part  howev  is still hold down the cost of product even with the higher benefit and energi cost              turn to the nation  the stori remain as it has been  veri strong growth in demand press on suppli   there is littl evid to suggest a slow in momentum   there is also littl evid that core inflat is acceler signific   nonetheless  in my judgment the balanc of risk is still clear on the side of excess demand undermin the expans   some further brake action from monetari polici is need to help sustain growth  low inflat  and job creation
thank you  mr  chairman   growth in the southeast remain reason well balanc and appear to have moder just slight from the veri strong pace and high level i report six week ago   the modest moder we sens is most obvious in real estat where not onli is residenti activ below year ago level but we are now see the first sign of some slow in nonresidenti market   in both case  though  activ is still at quit high level   the agricultur sector remain distress  and problem are be compound by a drought that is now project to extend into the summer month  manufactur activ is at good level but not quit as strong as in januari   some sign of new life are show up in the energi sector where the rig count is now at the highest level sinc the summer of       but activ is not as strong as we would expect given spot price   the major firm are report focus more on stock buyback and relat merger activ rather than on domest drill  two import sector that are not show ani sign of slack or slow are retail  where sale have continu to exceed expect  and tourism  where current and futur book are quit strong   loan demand remain quit high and we re not pick up ani sign of broad credit problem   in fact  bankruptci in the district are actual    percent below year             ago level   i was bother by a comment made to me last week by a larg commerci real estat develop in south florida who said he and his competitor have recent been get more unsolicit knock on the door from peopl want to push money at them  labor market are as tight or even tighter  if that s possibl  than ever   wage are report up   to   percent  with notic more report of higher increas in certain skill labor area   there seem to be more report of emerg price pressur on the import side but that has been the case for a long while   competit is limit the pass through of virtual all cost increas  includ energi   i detect a bit more frantic tone in the continu quest for cost save and product gain to protect margin  profit  and stock price  at the nation level  i read the data as suggest that we ve seen littl  if ani  slowdown in the first quarter   i won t be surpris if first quarter gdp come in even higher than the  book forecast   inde  virtual all driver of aggreg demand remain strong  and product gain have so far been suffici to keep suppli in reason balanc   i have the sens that busi peopl are look hard for some earli sign  and are expect  a slow in econom activ  given our tighten move   but  like us  they are not find much evid  contrari to those wish to forestal further polici tighten  when i look at the various inflat measur  includ the broader chain weight measur like the implicit deflat and the pce deflat  i see the prospect of a gradual upward creep   our bank   s forecast show a further deterior although  sinc our model is not as depend upon an histor base nairu or uncertain output gap measur  our outlook is not as pessimist as the  book s   as alway  there are list of unknown and risk   the slow in construct may turn out to be just anoth paus  aggreg demand may again be even stronger than we             expect  and the price of oil and it implic is the new wild card   i believ the risk are such that a still tighter polici is call for   our staff s latest work suggest that get the fund rate up to       percent or so by the third quarter may be suffici to get inflat head back to the level i believ we would like to see   financi market are clear expect some more tighten and should we not deliv that in this case we almost sure will get an unwant    it   s parti  e    respons   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   new england continu it pattern of steadi growth  veri low unemploy  and a somewhat higher rate of inflat than in the rest of the countri  particular in the area of medic  hous  and fuel cost   the annual benchmark revis to employ data contain some good news  at least for those who are observ the region economi   prior to the revis  our employ growth had been thought to be lag the nation s by almost a percentag point and mani believ that the lack of labor was realli constrain region growth   the revis indic  howev  that over the    month end in januari employ grew at about the same pace as in the nation  which is a good strong pace for the region  suggest that employ were not as constrain as we had thought   unemploy rate continu to be low and drop to     percent in januari for the region as a whole  measur inflat has pick up in boston   consum price rose fa  over the    month end in januari than at ani  e over the last few year and fa  than they did nation   as note earlier  fuel  shelter  and medic cost are the primari driver   i mention at our last meet that one of the area   s largest and best regard hmos was in receivership and could fail  put region hospit and doctor at risk   it now appear  after consider effort             on the part of public offici  that this hmo will come out of receivership and  after renegoti it rate  has a chanc at surviv   it is expect that it premium will rise by    to    percent over the next two or three year and that massachusett will increas it regulatori oversight to tri to insur that this   not happen to this or other hmos again   no matter how you look at it  medic insur cost are on the rise in new england and probabl elsewher as well  reflect this  report to us that wage bargain discuss at recent meet of                                      were focus on the inadequaci of annual increas of       to   percent   he note that wage gain in that percentag rang had seem suffici over the last sever year  given the low rate of inflat   but now  particular in the face of rise medic and childcar cost  that rate of general wage increas simpli didn t seem to be enough  it was interest to me that he did not mention oil as a factor in the discuss but rather medic and childcar cost  local contact in the temporari employ industri report that busi is quit brisk   while labor shortag make it difficult for them to fill posit  shortag also bring in busi as client find it increas difficult to hire on their own   there is a grow demand for worker in the internet relat sector  and the internet is increas be use to recruit technolog savvi staff   wage are rise fa  in the temp sector than in manufactur or retail  at least as we hear it  but temporari firm are manag to pass on these wage increas  anoth director  the chairman of what is consid to be one of the top talk about the stock market at a recent director meet   she note that  in her experi  ceo of major firm             across the nation are now more concern about the stock market than they ever have been   she note that this phenomenon goe well beyond stock and stock option that they might receiv as compens   senior manag seem to look at the stock market as the ul  arbit of success and they spend  e   e that in earlier period might have been spent sole focus on the busi  on financi engin relat to the level of their compani   s stock   it was an interest convers becaus it seem to suggest that today   s period of stock market ebulli has similar to the period of the late    s and earli    s when inflationari excess affect corpor and consum decisionmak  on the nation scene  there continu to be littl doubt about the strength of domest demand   it is obvious in auto sale  in the continu strength of hous  in oil price  in labor market  in rise consum and busi debt  and in the ever widen trade deficit   we no longer have the luxuri  if you want to call it that  of slow growth in the rest of the world as a restrain factor   the  book   s forecast of foreign strength is about on target with our own and  if anyth  recent data would suggest that we might have more rather than less export growth than is expect in the  book   domest demand could slow on it own   we agre that consum satiat  the effect of higher interest rate and rise oil price  and slow wealth effect could work in that direct  as suggest by the  book   but i would be a bit cautious on that front  sinc we have expect demand to slow on it own for some  e and it has yet to do so  the real issu continu to be on the suppli side   noth about current labor market data suggest that the assumpt that we are run out of worker is ani less true now than at our last meet  quit the contrari  despit the vagari of the month data   i think question do exist  howev  about the degre to which increas product will continu to keep unit             labor cost low and support strong corpor profit   the  book address these issu   i continu to find it assumpt about product and potenti op ist   but the overal forecast  with it embed need to tighten more now than is expect by the market  is hard for me to disagre with

thank you  mr  chairman   the ninth district s economi remain healthi   construct activ is strong as is consum spend   we have a coupl of auto dealer on our two board of director and we ask them whether energi price were affect auto sale   their answer was not so far as they could tell  auto sale continu to be robust  labor market  of cours  remain veri tight   and there is a bit of an unusu inventori problem develop  by that i mean that the problem is get the inventori from the back room or the basement to the shelv   in some retail store  the shelv are onli partial stock  and retail tell us they just can t hire the staff to keep up with shelf stock   a coupl of our director have report that they see sign that inflat is stir   these are peopl who sit on a varieti of corpor board  and they are bring to us report that input price are go up and also that to some extent those compani are start to implement price increas on their own that so far are stick  as far as the nation economi is concern  i realli don t think there is veri much new   i continu to believ that the expans of aggreg demand is secur and that  therefor  the outlook for real growth is posit   i continu to be relat op ist about futur product gain  but i don t have a convict about whether that will lead to domest aggreg suppli keep pace with aggreg demand or not   in my view  what might be the decis factor here is financi condit and how accommod or restrict they turn out to be   we did ask sever of our director to check with their sourc to see whether the higher interest rate that have appear in the marketplac over the past year or so have had ani effect             on spend or on futur invest plan or other such decis   and in general the answer we got back were    no  not to this point
mr  chairman  activ in the tenth district  as in other district you have heard from  continu to be veri strong and is littl chang from last  e   on balanc  there has been less of an impact than we might have expect from the higher interest rate and from the higher fuel cost   labor market remain quit tight and wage pressur exist  but to date we have not seen ani strong move upward in the wage settlement   part of our slow labor growth may reflect the fact that our unemploy rate is so low  mani firm are have difficulti find labor for some of the avail job   higher interest rate  as i said  have not realli produc ani slowdown   the hous market and retail sale continu veri strong in the district  and auto sale remain brisk despit the higher oil price  in term of price increas  competit remain veri strong and we hear a lot of discuss about the need to move price up as cost increas   but the busi peopl i have talk with continu to say that they are unabl to make price increas stick  and that that is a problem for them   the farm economi remain in a slump   farmer have receiv the subsidi we   ve talk about   they are awar of that  but they are also awar that peopl are begin to question that   in some sens that make them all the more concern about next year   there s a note of desper in some of their voic as they talk about it   and now there is talk about drought condit  and that has onli exacerb their concern   i think we re hear more  not less  from some of the agricultur sector in the district  let me turn to the nation scene and polici for a minut   my outlook remain virtual the same as it was at the last fomc meet   in my view part of the strength we saw             late last year and so far this year reflect the fact that we were slow to unwind some of the rate decreas we took in the fall of        still  look forward  i see some modest slow in the economi  primarili due to an expect settl down of the stock market  perhap  and the limit suppli of labor  the higher real interest rate  and some elev price   have said that  though  i do expect inflat to rise this year as a result of develop that are now in train  includ the unwind of some of the past favor factor and continu strong demand in this economi   i think the rise in energi price is have some effect on the psycholog in the marketplac   and if we do see higher inflat expect begin to emerg  i think we will see that built into wage and financi price expect  i am not convinc  howev  that we need to be tighten aggress   i think the gradual pace of tighten that we have follow is wise   in fact  becaus of the uncertainti surround the project  it would be of some concern to me if we began an aggress tighten program   an aggress mode has it own set of risk that i think we ought to be awar of   so  i remain orient to a gradual cours of polici action as we go forward   i think histori has shown that to be the prudent approach   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for the past few meet i have run through an inflat target exercis to see what that would show   today i will give just a quick summari   the model approach from the  book clear indic that a tighten of polici is necessari to stabil inflat at present level   the pipelin approach  focus main on unit labor cost  is ambigu becaus the sharp recent rise of product has actual caus unit labor cost to declin   in the past i have refer to the ppi as anoth             pipelin measur but i have had some communic indic that that measur actual   not forecast veri well  so perhap we should not give it much focus  as was true at the  e of our last meet  the blue chip forecast are not predict much increas in inflat   but  as with the  book forecast  they get to that by assum higher short term rate  show that they realli think monetari polici has to be tighten to avoid acceler inflat   for the first  e in a number of year the michigan consum have begun expect higher inflat  but that chang may not be wholli indic becaus these consum may be one who have just fill up their suv with expens gas  the treasuri bond market has also revis it outlook for inflat and is now indic somewhat less futur inflat  as measur by the spread between the nomin and    year real treasuri rate   but this declin spread may not be wholli indic either  becaus nomin rate have been influenc by the treasuri   s buyback program  perhap more than real rate  the overal stori is rough the same as it has been for a while now   some inflat target approach suggest that polici should be tighten  some do not   in the end i suppos i favor a model approach  and for about a year now that approach has clear suggest that tighten is in order   that carri the day for me   one can buttress the case by look at what i will call an equilibrium approach   in a true equilibrium growth model with real interest rate of about   percent and stabl inflat at about a   percent rate  nomin interest rate  short and long  should be in the vicin of   percent   a bit more tighten would get us to that level  were we to lean against the wind becaus of the upsid inflat risk  we would have to do more tighten than that  to me the real question is   how much more   are we look toward a whole seri of rate increas as in the  book scenario or just a few more   yogi berra onc said that             predict is hard  especi about the futur    laughter   ignor yogi   s caution  let me hazard a few comment  as far as i can tell  the amount of lean against the wind we are like to have to do depend on the answer to three question   one is whether the economi s unemploy rate is now near nairu   the second is whether the product shock will be sustain and  inde  whether there will be increas in the rate of increas  the second deriv issu to which the chairman has often refer   the third is whether the suppli impact of ani product chang will outweigh the demand effect   if the answer to each question is    yes     we may not have to rais rate much more to stabil inflat   and i actual think there is a chanc that the answer to all of the question is    yes     we have talk about nairu a lot here and i have noth to add this morn other than that if the economi   s unemploy rate were serious below nairu  i think we would have seen more acceler in inflat by now   the second question involv the s curv that the chairman has talk about   while i   m certain no expert in that area  it is obvious that the combin of comput and the internet   open up vast new technolog possibl  and the economi could veri well be at the bottom foothil  or whatev we want to call it  of the s curv  with more posit product shock to come   governor   rais the third question about demand and suppli at the last meet  and while i don t have ani verdict on it  i have been think about that issu   it strike me that ani product shock should  if foreseen  rais expect earn and actual stock valuat befor the shock is felt in real output chang   henc  i would think that ani particular product shock would be greet by an initi rise in the wealth incom ratio  follow by a revers to normal as the shock rais the growth of incom   therefor  it seem like  or at least possibl  that the demand effect could             be larg relat to the suppli effect right away  but that the suppli effect would domin over  e   if we have s curv product and at least some market forecast of this product  thing get much more complic becaus demand keep on shoot up and suppli may not be abl to catch up   pessimist one could read this as say that s curv product realli will not help inflat even in the short run   op ist one could read it as say that soon the suppli impact will catch up and domin the demand effect  this uncertainti more than anyth els bring me around to the merit of what i will call our    tip toe strategi      as we sit here today  polici should be tighten  perhap fair notic   but there has been both rapid and increas product chang and that on balanc has seem to damp inflat in the recent past   should the favor trend continu  we may not have to be rais rate for veri much longer   should they not continu  and  of cours  we have to be alert to that possibl  we may have to rais rate much more   what we have to do in the short run seem pretti clear to me   what we may have to do in the long run   not seem clear at all   thank you
i   m go to make some scattershot comment here to convey particular point   in the eighth district we have a clear sens of slow employ growth  but it seem to be the result of labor suppli constraint   the largest state in the district by popul  illinoi  indiana  and missouri which  of cours  are share with other district   enjoy unemploy rate that are at or below the nation averag and labor forc particip rate abov the nation averag   so i don t think there is ani question  as we hear from our contact  that the reason we are see less employ growth is a consequ of the suppli constraint   the peopl just aren t there to hire              my second comment is that a recent meet of health care profession reinforc the fact that there is tremend strain in the health care busi   that is an area that is veri distress  and the problem in that sector are go to continu for a long  e  let me make a few comment about the nation situat   my fedex and up contact both report continu veri strong condit abroad  especi in asia   up is run at capac   that compani   s plane are full come into the unit state  and up is acceler it addit to air capac  up also report continu pressur on the avail suppli of entri level labor   the compani reli a lot on colleg student and relat low skill worker to    throw box        the way i like to put it  and up manag are find it more difficult to fill those posit   up has ad fuel surcharg  as we all know   when i ask my contact whether he see ani resist to those charg  he said    no      their custom all understand that there have been big increas in fuel cost and are accept those fuel charg  let me make a comment about the stock market   i have not gone back and look at the data systemat  but i certain have the impress that the negat correl we are see between broad index  the nasdaq and s p      for exampl  are realli unpreced   that it is a veri  veri odd circumst   histor  broad index are veri high correl  and to have them move in opposit direct is veri unusu   i will offer a specul as to whi   and i mean the word  specul  becaus i don t think i understand what is go on   what may be go on is a phenomen commit to invest in equiti somewher  so that when peopl come to question one part of the equiti market they shift into some other part of it   of cours  on ani given day there is no way that peopl can disinvest   all that happen is that secur get repric   the effort to move out of certain sector just repric these secur as investor tri to shift from one area to anoth   histor  of cours  we have             seen that process more between equiti and bond  let s say  rather than across sector of the equiti market   we haven   t gotten to that point yet   we haven   t seen general chang in equiti price   there have been sector effect  but no general shift   histor when we start to see peopl question the equiti market as a whole  of cours  the effort to get out of equiti depress their price as peopl tri  but in the aggreg unsuccess  to get into other invest  i agre with ned     i don t know how far this tighten process is go to go  but i have the sens that we are at a pretti earli stage in this process   i also have the sens that money growth  although it has slow  has not slow anywher close to the extent i would have expect  given the interest rate increas we   ve had   if one look at some episod of substanti tighten in the past  and i would suggest look at some chart depict                   and       interest rate rose a lot and money growth just plummet   by the end of all those period i cite  money growth was down to zero or below on a    month basi   so i have a sens that we are onli a short way into this process   and the reason i want to emphas that is not that i know where rate are go to go or how far we are go to have to move  but becaus i think we are go to see increas strain and pressur in the market as we pursu this process   i believ the market are go to be vulner to shock that come from the outsid  my lead candid  and there are a zillion of them that might materi  would be shock come from japan becaus i think the japanes financi system is veri stress and in serious difficulti   i don t think investor in japanes secur have realli awaken to how vulner that situat is   right now interest rate are onli about where they were in       and yet by everi measur the japanes economi is substanti more stretch than it was at that  e              i get question from the press and we see specul that the oil price increas are go to serv to slow the economi   i think that is also a fals hope   i view the situat as almost entir a relat price disturb   the consum spend that is suppress by peopl have to fill up the tank on their big suv is  after all  incom to oil produc   and those produc are go to be spend it   that includ the foreign produc who may be spend some of it in this countri or elsewher   in term of ani aggreg demand effect  as a first approxim i think it   s simpli a wash   therefor  we ought not to look at oil price as a possibl sourc of reduct in aggreg demand pressur   so  those are just some random comment that strike me about our current situat
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the question befor us today  as other have suggest  is whether the data and the forecast are strong enough to catalyz an unexpect reaction from this committe   i postul that they are not   i believ we should stay on the same moder cours that has becom a part of our strategi for the last sever year  clear  the economi has continu to exhibit surpris momentum   reflect this  the staff has chang it expect for four quarter gdp growth quit substanti  as other have note   the engin for this growth have not chang  howev  sinc our last meet  consum spend is still outpac gdp growth overal  and that includ spend on both durabl and nondur   in addit  capit spend also continu unab   while we are use to see this in the tech sector  capit spend outsid of the tech sector is also strong   i sens that we are probabl just at the begin of this product surpris   the outcom in the real economi is driven both by high level of consum op  and by financi market that are inde somewhat accommod to strong growth   clear  in my view  this outlook             embodi the old statement about monetari polici      bad news is bad becaus it is bad  good news is bad becaus it might be inflationari      but the question realli is   how inflationari is the good news   and in that regard i think there are some import chang sinc our last meet  first  while the likelihood is that the unemploy rate will continu to hover near the low that we are current experienc  i do sens at long last that we are start to see some tighten in other measur of resourc use   the labor forc particip rate and the capac util rate seem to be tick up  both had been remark subdu   i think they are both like to start trend upward   that might be  as i think     indic  a set for a stronger upturn in inflat and some acceler trend in the wage process   similar  inflat expect have made a bit of a worrisom move in the wrong direct as well  howev  i tend to believ that with ongo vigil on our part through a    gradual tighten    program clear signal in our statement  we can return balanc to the economi   we have alreadi rais rate about     basi point and that has occur in the last year   and if we assum that the lag are long and variabl  as we say  perhap some more slow will come from action we have alreadi taken  in addit  central bank in most of the industri world are also in the process of tighten  as    son indic  with the obvious except of japan   that would suggest that those economi are not like to overheat and  therefor  it is unlik that more rapid increas in foreign activ will creat a problem from the standpoint of ad to pressur on our resourc   final  the main sourc of higher measur inflat thus far is current oil price  which mani observ expect to return to a more normal suppli demand dynam befor have a major impact on inflat expect here   in addit to those three             factor  most forecast and the market do not signal ani immin outbreak of inflat against the background of a gradual expect tighten on our part  in sum  i would say that tighten at this meet is probabl appropri   i do not believ  howev  that we are behind the curv  and i do not believ that we have lost credibl  in that circumst  we should continu to valid market expect and maintain the pressur that come from clear communic   but to me the incom data and the forecast  at least at this stage  do not suggest that we should chang our approach to polici   the data at the next meet may suggest that a more hurri pace is warrant  they may not   i think that judgment wait for the next meet   at this stage i believ we should continu to valid market expect
thank you  mr  chairman   in my judgment littl has chang in the outlook and henc the appropri cours for monetari polici sinc we last met   let me emphas the three featur of the outlook that  in my judgment  support an increas in the feder fund rate target today and suggest that further increas will be warrant over the cours of the next sever month  first  the growth in aggreg demand continu to outpac the growth of aggreg suppli even allow for the recent upward revis to the product trend   mani appar have had difficulti with the stori that the product shock itself could generat an increas in demand that outpac the increas in suppli   but this link onli provid a possibl explan for whi demand growth is exceed suppli growth   i believ this link is plausibl   but all that realli matter for monetari polici is that the growth in demand is exceed the growth in suppli at a  e when labor market are alreadi veri tight   perhap the more import point is             that whether or not demand grow fa  than suppli follow a product shock depend critic on the monetari polici respons to the product shock  a point that presid jordan made veri effect earlier   i find it veri plausibl that hold nomin rate constant in the face of a product shock that rais the real equilibrium interest rate will result in an excess of demand relat to suppli   the test of whether or not demand growth is in fact exceed suppli growth is what happen to resourc util rate   the unemploy rate has been declin by an averag of almost     percentag point a year sinc the end of      and has declin at least     percentag point each year  confirm that demand growth has been exceed suppli growth   the  book project a declin of about     percentag point by the end of next year to     percent in the absenc of further increas in the feder fund rate  second  while core inflat remain well contain  i agre with the  book forecast that it will soon begin to rise  reflect the secondari effect of the recent rise in oil price  the dissip or possibl revers of various favor price shock that restrain inflat earlier  and the effect of veri tight labor market   monetari polici tighten today would clear be preemptiv and appropri so  third  slow the economi to trend is unlik to contain the risk of higher inflat  i veri much doubt that stabl inflat is compat with a   percent unemploy rate  slow the economi to trend may  therefor  be just the first step   it is an import step  but it may not be  inde  it is unlik to be  enough   we should therefor be especi determin to slow the economi at least to trend quick and to be aggress reactiv to increas in core
governor    inflat
thank you  mr  chairman   while the data are move around a bit  as they alway do  it seem to me that the situat face the committe today has chang veri littl sinc our last meet   as has been the case for some  e  as we all know  we see extrem strong demand drive the economi toward overh on the one hand  but on the other we see to date onli the scantiest evid of rise price pressur as a result   howev  it continu to appear high like that at some point strong demand will forc heighten price pressur   consequ  i see littl choic but to stay the cours that we have been follow  thank you
mr  chairman  the second district   s economi continu to expand at a rapid pace and rise cost of energi and other input have yet to show up in core finish good inflat   employ has risen at a brisk pace in earli       despit persist job loss in manufactur   and what had appear to be a difficult employ situat in upstat new york has been wipe away by the revis in the job data   it now appear that in fact job have been increas quit nice there  by     percent last year in buffalo and     percent in albani   so  all is well in the second district  turn to the intern area for a moment  i would note that even the most steeli eye investor who go from the unit state to japan return starri eye   the reason is that  although they see the macroeconom situat as difficult  they are perceiv what a veri good investor might have perceiv in the unit state in the mid     s  which is that at the level of the firm thing are realli begin to chang   i am go to be in japan next week   but on the basi of report i   ve heard from other  i am veri inclin to think that japan is begin to             recov  or some peopl who don t tend to be confus on the op ist side are veri confus inde   so  i think that is certain someth worth look at  in the domest economi  it seem veri clear to me that we have the basic  rather nice problem  but it   s a problem nonetheless  that even though the suppli side of the economi can grow more rapid  the demand side of the economi is simpli too strong   there are a varieti of reason behind that  and we may have made our job a bit more difficult by concentr on one or the other aspect of the explan   my pet observ is the veri larg size of the current account deficit  which i don t view as sustain   but it is a symptom  not a caus   we may talk about the wealth effect but if we talk too much about it effect on the stock market  i think we are take upon ourselv the challeng of decid what is the right level of stock market price  as we seek to bring them down   and sinc life is a solemn circl that never stop  if we decid that we can control the market at the top  certain somebodi is go to remind us that we ought to be abl to control it at the bottom and get it to go up   in my view  we have to be veri  veri care in that regard  especi sinc the tool we have  monetari polici  get at those institut that have a cost of capit relat to the real world   the most ridicul overpr stock are those of new technolog compani that have never made ani profit   so in effect their cost of capit is zero   we can t get at them   onli the logic of the marketplac will get at them   and i believ presid pool is right that special institut investor want to stay in the market   and if so  if they either take profit or just rotat out of the tech stock  they are go to go into the valu stock becaus that   s where there is to go   so i think that phenomenon is like to continu  i have no question that the path we are on of restrain the demand side of the economi through tighten monetari polici is the right one and that caution is appropri   i             emphas the need for caution becaus there continu to be a lot about this economi that is veri difficult to understand
okay   i call now on don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman  the inform becom avail sinc your last meet has onc again indic somewhat stronger growth of both aggreg demand and potenti aggreg suppli than had been anticip   the behavior of the unemploy rate  essenti flat for five month now    not suggest that under labor market pressur have intensifi   but  absent a continu of the almost astonish product gain of the second half of last year  there is a clear risk that those pressur will mount in come month   on that basi  there would seem to be littl to deflect the committe from carri through on the intent that mani of you express at the last meet to rais the feder fund rate again today   financi market continu to incorpor an extend period of gradual firm  with    basi point expect at this meet  and anoth    to    basi point by earli next year   the level and behavior of longer term interest rate and the yield curv  even after allow for treasuri suppli distort  suggest that market see this degre of firm as consist with keep inflat pressur contain  inde  over the intermeet period  market particip have mark down a littl their expect of the ul  extent of feder reserv tighten   this revis appear to have reflect market particip    take on incom inform bear on the economi  a sens of greater vulner in equiti market despit their reach new high  larger expect govern budget surplus  and good news on product and core inflat   the key issu for the committe today would seem to be whether the restraint now built into financi market has a reason chanc of be suffici to accomplish your object for restrain inflat  if it    you can valid prevail expect by tighten by    basi point   if it   not  if the risk have shift signific further toward higher inflat  you might consid surpris the market with    basi point of firm   in principl  the escal price of oil may be one import chang in econom condit over recent month that has a bear on this issu   as you know  a rise in oil price tend to produc effect with contradictori implic for the stanc of monetari polici  at least when that stanc is express in term of the real feder fund          rate   lean on the side of higher real interest rate is the potenti effect of an increas in oil price on under inflat rate   the rise in energi price tend to get propag into core price measur  in part through the effort of busi and household to rais price and wage to protect real earn   the strength of these effort and the ul  pressur on ongo inflat are influenc import by the behavior of inflat expect   on the side of lower real interest rate is an increas in econom slack as more domest incom is sent abroad to pay for import oil  which  howev  help to hold down the overal price increas   whether real interest rate should be rais or lower in respons to an increas in oil price depend in larg measur on the relat size of these two effect and the relat weight the committe put on short run deviat of output and inflat from their long run valu   in fact  the effect of the chang outlook for oil price sinc your last meet may not be enough by itself to caus you to alter your plan for real interest rate materi   the upward revis to the expect path of oil price in the  book and in futur market has been limit by the forecast that they will return to a lower level befor veri long   moreov  the role of oil in the economi has diminish consider over  e   still  the analysi   suggest some import risk to the outlook that you might need to weigh now or in the futur  especi if oil price do not look as if they will follow their predict downward track   on the one hand  evid that higher energi price were begin to undermin consum or busi confid or equiti price might suggest that less polici tighten was now necessari to align aggreg demand and suppli  on the other  sign that oil price increas were becom embed in fa  increas in compens or in higher longer term inflat expect would indic that more polici firm and weaker output would be need to contain inflat   in ani event  should short term inflat expect rise  a higher nomin feder fund rate would be requir at some point just to hold the real fund rate on cours and prevent a destabil s ulus to output and price   in the current circumst  these consider might suggest that the rise in the price of oil has  on balanc  increas inflat risk at least a littl   short term inflat expect have alreadi move higher in recent quarter  evid in reflect of higher oil price  and a further increas is a distinct possibl unless oil price soon begin to revers   moreov  the committe might be concern that  with labor market alreadi tight and equiti market and consum confid ebulli  the effect of higher oil price are more like to             be weight toward rais inflat expect than toward weaken demand   some other develop over the intermeet period may also be seen as point toward the possibl of higher inflat   in particular  the further increas in the broadest measur of equiti wealth will add to aggreg demand at a  e when strength in demand is alreadi threaten to lead to tighter labor market   and  a slight lower expect path for polici tighten has reduc intermedi term borrow cost a bit  contribut to the greater dispar between the market   s expect of what tighten will be requir to stem inflat and those of the staff   an import sourc of that dispar seem to be a judgment on whether the economi is now oper in level term abov it long term potenti   the long term interest rate in the market  even if high enough to bring the growth of demand into align with the growth of suppli  seem much less like to be restrict enough to rais the unemploy rate   if the committe believ the economi is now beyond it sustain potenti  an appreci tighten in financi condit would seem to be need to slow growth enough to keep core inflat from trend higher over the next few year   henc  oil price increas may be ad to the risk that can stem from pursu a gradualist strategi  in particular  that tighten would be too sluggish   if such a polici allow an economi that may alreadi be oper beyond it sustain level to increas resourc util further  or allow longer term inflat expect to begin to deterior  control of inflat ul  will requir a larger or more prolong damp of output below it potenti   if the committe saw a substanti risk that the prevail restraint in financi market  premis on sever more    basi point tighten move  has becom inadequ to forestal these outcom  it might consid undertak a larger move of    basi point   such an unexpect action should help to bring about a configur of real interest rate  exchang rate  and equiti price more suit to damp stronger price pressur   howev  the committe may see these recent develop as confirm that the balanc of risk after a    basi point increas will remain tilt toward higher inflat  rather than as press enough to warrant a    basi point firm at this meet   in that case  you could opt to continu on the gradual path of tighten  at least for a  e   if oil price revers as market expect  short term inflat expect also should come down  leav core inflat and long             term expect larg unaffect by the most recent run up in oil price   moreov  the path of firm in market may well turn out to be suffici to restrain the growth of aggreg demand to that of sustain suppli  given that the full restrain effect of the committe   s previous tighten action and the appreci rise in long term interest rate over the last few quarter have not complet play themselv out   so long as under cost and price data remain favor  the committe   s most immedi object might be to balanc the growth rate of aggreg suppli and demand  reserv judgment about whether it need to rais interest rate enough to elev the unemploy rate   in light of uncertainti about the cours of demand and the level and growth rate of potenti suppli  the committe might want to see firmer evid that market particip had underes  the requir degre of tighten befor take action to chang these es  and expect   moreov  as   note  recent data have led the staff to rais it es  of structur product growth  which  if valid  should help to contain cost pressur for a while   inde  the possibl that product may continu to acceler also may weigh on the side of caution in tighten   eventu  higher product growth probabl must be balanc with higher real interest rate   in the near term  though  the implic for polici action are not so clear   financi market may alreadi have incorpor expect of a further pickup in product growth into the unusu elev long term real rate now prevail  so that all the committe need do is valid those expect   even if real privat long term rate still have more to rise  the acceler in product  so long as it continu to keep pace with ani pickup in the rate of increas in nomin compens  would keep inflat damp for some  e at prevail interest rate  even if the unemploy rate fell a bit further   by forgo more rapid tighten for a while in the face of acceler product  the committe in effect would continu the strategi of recent year that allow the economi to realiz an extra benefit of unanticip product increas in temporarili higher output instead of lower inflat   in sum  so long as under inflat pressur remain damp and financi market expect are not clear out of line with continu contain of price pressur over  e  the committe may prefer to continu it gradual pace of tighten   this would allow the committe to calibr it firm action as new inform accumul about the respons of aggreg demand and financi market to past increas in interest rate and about the evolut of potenti suppli   a precondit for the success of this strategi is that                the market understand your concern and intent  so they can react appropri as new inform becom avail   in this regard  the ongo strength in demand and taut of the labor market  along with the inflat threat from higher oil price  suggest that the committe would probabl want to associ an increas of either    or    basi point in the feder fund rate with languag indic that it view the risk to the outlook as unbalanc toward higher inflat
question for don   if not  i will proceed   let me say at the outset that i think the balanc of risk clear indic that we are on the right polici path  accord  i think we should be move anoth    basi point today  retain the sentenc in our press releas express the view that the balanc of risk remain tilt toward inflat  and continu on a tighten path until there are problem with that path  as i have comment befor  someth veri unusu is go on in the economi  and i   d like to spend a moment or two on what i think may well be happen   first  the avail data clear indic that product is still acceler   the second deriv is still posit  moreov  if we disaggreg the product data we find that  for the first  e that i can recal  near all the measur are show veri signific increas   for exampl  we are get a       percent increas in fourth quarter over fourth quarter product for nonfinanci corpor and for noncorpor busi  and i think a rough compar increas for the farm sector  the onli area that actual look weak is financi sector product  and i suspect that reflect a statist problem  not a real problem   if that is the case  it would impli that we are in fact underes  the overal pace of product growth  clear  the number that we have thus far for the second half provid onli limit inform on product develop  but there is no evid in those number that the pattern of acceler product is slow down   inde  one possibl explan for the             remark perform of the nasdaq in relat to the dow  this extraordinari negat correl that bill pool put his finger on  is that we have in the market   s evalu process for exist capit a clear indic that capit is move out of the older technolog into the new   the onli question is whether we also see that develop in current cash flow   in other word  are the save in the economi inadequ to fund the new technolog  if so  we would expect a drain of fund out of the older technolog into the new   so the question is whether the cash flow are consist with what we are observ in the stock market evalu process  there are a few clue   one mention by bob   is that despit the cash flow in the oil industri  cash is not be plow back into that industri to the extent that ordinarili would have occur in the past   those big cash flow could be show up in various way  as dividend  which i doubt  as stock buyback  probabl in part  or as invest in financi asset   ani of the three add to the financ pool that s avail to the high tech industri  moreov  the dramat amount of stock buyback  which involv almost wholli the old technolog stock  is also ad to the overal financ pool   we are tri at this stage to develop a detail flow of fund evalu that separ high tech from low tech   and while we don t have result at this stage  it is fair clear from earlier inform that the proport of capit invest in the high tech area that is financ from extern fund is higher than that in the older technolog  and inde the proport is rise in the high tech sector   obvious  high tech is still a veri small part of the system  depend on how one defin it  and it is veri difficult to draw ani firm conclus as yet from the cash flow  nevertheless  it is interest to observ that we are get the type of evid we would expect if product is still acceler  name  an inadequ capac to financ rapid rise capit requir from intern cash flow   we know that if we take the ratio of             the nasdaq to the s p     and compar it with the share of produc durabl equip order that is go to high tech  and we defin that sector broad so we are pick up a big chunk of the capit invest  it appear that the ratio of the nasdaq to the s p     lead movement in the high tech order share  this suggest that the trend toward ever increas invest in high tech capit  not onli by the produc of these type of innov but by everybodi els  is begin to pressur the market in a manner that is creat a rate of econom growth that is higher than we are use to  in respons to bill pool s comment that money growth has not slow as much as might have been expect  i would suggest that recent money growth may not  in fact  be inconsist with under condit   we had a discuss in februari about whether we should be rais the money suppli target becaus structur product was rise  acceler product would lead us to expect fa  money growth than otherwis would be the case   we would expect fa  increas in hous and motor vehicl than otherwis would be the case   even the interest sensit area of the economi would be expect to show less respons than ordinarili would be the case if product is continu to acceler  so as far as i can judg just look at the data  it is not evid that we are see  as yet  a crest in the growth of product   obvious  there is an upsid limit  i guess  but i don t see ani evid that we are there   mere employ histor pattern strike me as not over use in analyz this type of phenomenon  the question that we have to ask ourselv in evalu the interest sensit area of the economi is not whether they are declin  but whether they are declin as a share of the total   i think the evid here is mix   some data suggest that the share is flatten out or             go down  other data suggest that it is not   i agre with those who suspect that first quarter gdp is go to be a lot higher than ani of us have in our forecast at this stage  there are technic reason whi we would expect growth in the first quarter to be slower than in the fourth  as     point out quit correct  but we don t have enough of the first quarter data to realli be quit convinc of that   the forecast of   to       percent gdp growth impli a quit signific slow in the growth of product  but it may just mean that growth is fall below the recent trend and not necessarili that the trend is flatten out  the anecdot evid we are observ still strike me as not consist with ani real slowdown  the question in the real world is whether the expans is slow   let me say that  irrespect of what the gdp data show  i don t think ani slowdown is occur  i don t see ani evid of it  and i suspect the major reason the expans is not slow is that product continu to acceler   there is no way to avoid that conclus   the rate of gdp growth is equal to the growth of employ and the workweek plus the growth of product   in think about employ growth  i suspect that to a larg extent we are underes  immigr   this mean that a good part of the problem that we have in explain what is go on may be resolv when we get the      census  which may show a higher popul level   we may find that  among other develop  household employ is grow fa  relat to payrol employ than we are current es   all in all  what i am basic argu is that what is go on now is not simpli explain   i reiter that it is not evid to me that this economi is heat up   i do not deni that the growth rate are veri high and may be acceler and may be signific underes  in the  book   but overh has to mean that we are get strong             inflationari pressur   i don t know how you may want to disaggreg the cpi or the ppi or a lot of the commod index   as i have indic befor  the question in my judgment is not one of price but more an issu of unit cost becaus unit cost are what engend inflationari pressur   if price don t move with unit cost  obvious profit margin fall and the capit good boom begin to fade   and for the first  e in a long  e in the fourth quarter  unit cost for nonfinanci corpor were zero year over year   they are up     percent for total nonfarm busi on an incom base es    we can talk all we want about the fact that we see this price go up and that price go up   unless our data system are realli defici in term of the under cost structur as we measur it  i find it hard to reconcil these cost number with a belief that there is ani acceler of inflat  yet   i do not deni that we are still get a declin in the number of peopl seek work   we are still get a rise in the net trade deficit  and those safeti valv cannot continu indefinit   some   somewher  at some point  we will experi inflationari pressur unless those gap close  all i am say is that i do not see the evid at this stage   i suspect that if the gap continu to open up  someth will happen   but i think we have plenti of  e to worri about that   if we continu to move in    basi point increment  after a while we realli will begin to move the interest rate structur   we alway have the capac to doubl up the rate increas and to do someth between meet   but for the  e be it strike me that we are right on the mark with a    basi point move   i think that the desir of move at meet and move in a consist pattern is veri help in term of promot market stabil   i believ such a pattern reduc risk premium and volatil and  other thing equal  it probabl reduc the equilibrium interest rate requir to maintain maximum sustain growth              so i   m where i was at the last meet   i guess it took me a long  e to say that  but so be it   presid
are we start the go around
a while ago lean against the wind was mention   i note earlier that we recent had a meet of our advisori council on small busi and agricultur  and i learn at that meet that on the plain of the texa panhandl a fair constant and fair strong wind prevail most of the  e   all of the chicken have gotten use to lean against that wind to remain upright   and one day last month the wind quit blow and all the chicken fell over    laughter  i agre with your recommend for a     point increas in the fund rate with asymmetri   i think that is the correct move for now   i just hope that we will take it one step at a  e and not say too much public between meet  scare littl children and the financi market
i agre with your recommend and the reason behind it  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   i think we need to leav the view in the marketplac that this is the strategi  that we will have    basi point increas until the data convinc us that a further increas is no longer necessari  i want to reinforc someth that don kohn said about the import of the market understand what our strategi is   the market should know that our aim is to focus on what i             would like to call the medium term inflat rate   we are tri to keep the rate of inflat on averag  over a two year horizon or someth like that  at a low and stabl rate   all the other measur that we talk about such as the unemploy rate  nairu  the stock market  or anyth els are all deriv in that we   re tri to follow whatev inform we can to achiev that inflat object   but the object is alway the inflat rate  i think the possibl of a    basi point increas has noth to recommend it   let me put the point this way   suppos we knew what the ul  end was go to be in term of where interest rate were go to go   that would pin down where the    year bond rate was go to be   and whether we put off the other    basi point by six week or not make no differ whatsoev to a    year bond rate or to a longer term rate   but  of cours  when we say right away what our understand is about the ul  end of this process  well  of cours  that rais the problem   and if we were to do    basi point  we would rais all sort of question about where we were go and what we were do   it would be veri hard for us sit around this tabl to predict what the respons would be   on the one hand  some peopl might look at that and say that we think our job is over for now  we are do one more increas  doubl up the amount this  e  and we don t intend ani more in the futur   that would be one possibl interpret   other would say that we feel a great sens of urgenc and we have to move more aggress to keep thing under control   in my view    basi point would produc a veri unstabl expect environ  and we would have great difficulti in predict what the respons would be in the market   i think it is veri danger to take a polici action when we have so littl idea about what the respons will be   so  i would be veri  veri oppos to consid a    basi point increas unless we had sit right in front of us some crisi             situat demand respons   but we don t   everyth is go along veri much as anticip  with differ onli nuanc from what we expect last  e
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman  for the reason you ve outlin
i agre with the recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  but i would also like to see a     point increas in the discount rate as a way to reinforc the messag that we are tri to send   thank you
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman   i do want to make a comment   when you say    strategi     given the level of uncertainti that we ve talk about here  i want to clarifi that our strategi is not necessarili that we are on a cours to continu increas the fund rate   i favor a strategi that say we know there are upsid risk and are prepar to move  but one that   not assur peopl that we re go to move in the futur  depend on how that is view  i think there can be quit a differ in term of the messag that we would be deliv   it wasn t clear to me what conclus in fact we may be come to here  up side
i think we are say that the balanc of risk is on the
that is a probabilist statement   and assum everybodi agre that the balanc of risk is on the up side  i suspect that we have a veri wide distribut of what peopl think that probabl is
right   with this move we will have move     basi point sinc last june and    basi point from where we were at the start of the year   it may be appropri to move again in the futur  but by say the balanc of risk is on the up side  i also want to be clear that it is not a sure thing   our strategi isn   t to move these interest rate up     point until whenev
no  i think that s right   the way i put it last month was that that would be the impli strategi if inde we continu to see the type of imbal that we were see   but should that chang  and inde  we hope and expect it to chang  that will obvious affect our decis over the longer run   or if the inflat outlook get wors  i would suspect the consensus of this group would be to acceler the pace
but i don t see how ani of us can forecast that at this particular point
i agre with your polici recommend  mr  chairman   i certain agre with the asymmetri   i probabl could have gone with    basi point  too   i don t find a move of    basi point all that scari and i think it might not be a bad idea sooner rather than later to do someth that express more concern about the imbal that we see in demand and suppli   i don t necessarili feel  particular in the environ that we have been             in  that the smoke gun has to be a rise in inflat that is realli notic in the pce or the cpi or whatev measur we are look at   as you and other have mention  the imbal that we see in consum    continu willing to spend more than they are bring in and to get into increas amount of debt play out in what presid   refer to as the symptom of the trade deficit   i believ those are all indic that demand is grow at a rate that is not sustain and ul  could be danger  depend on what happen in the futur   also  i would hope that we can soften the link between our polici and the level of the stock market  becaus i think that is pretti t i to do  and get back into the analysi that look at suppli and demand   so  i am in favor of where we are go   i realiz that we don t know exact where we will stop  but i think it is go to take more than this
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend   i  too  am where i was at the last meet   i believ the gradual approach is a veri wise way for this committe to proceed  on the interpret of the balanc of risk  i just want to add one littl footnot   in our discuss of this approach when we adopt it  we made it veri clear that we automat reexamin our posit at each subsequ meet base on the new data that have come in and the forecast   so there is noth we say that is forev  obvious   everyth is automat reexamin at the next meet   i thought we all understood that when we endors this polici
presid parri  strategi
mr  chairman  i support your recommend with regard to the fund rate   i also think it is import to reinforc to the public that we are focus on the heighten inflat risk for the futur
i support the recommend   i ll admit to bill and other that i have had privat mental dallianc with    basi point  but i ll get over it    laughter   on the other hand  i have to say to don that he was so convinc about the case for move    basi point today that i actual thought for a moment that he might even believ it    laughter
presid  n
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  becaus virtual ani reason framework that i can think of impli that in current circumst real interest rate should go up
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend   but let me make a quick comment   i have some of the same feel that ned   and other have express in that i worri a littl that we may get a bit too comfort with this increment approach of     point increas   that may be enough to do the job  but it may well be the case  and there is a good chanc in my view  that more forc action are go to be requir sooner or later   and i think we need to keep that in mind go forward   as i said earlier in the meet  long term rate  at least current  are not support the move up on the short end of the yield curv   also  i think it is worth point out that back in      we tighten polici rather aggress and we contain inflat and had a soft land without a recess   so              mayb that will chang peopl s attitud about the impact of our current polici   it   s almost as though we have too much credibl  in a sens    laughter  also  on the issu of rise product growth  i agre with you that the second deriv may be posit   but as i understand it  the econom implic of that are in the direct of even higher real rate  peopl are go to extrapol the acceler in product and tri to bring the attend higher expect futur earn forward   the way to cut that off is by an increas in real rate  and that might argu for an even more aggress polici  in ani case  again  i can agre with your basic recommend   but with respect to my good friend tom hoenig   s comment  i would put the opposit spin on the asymmetri   i think i said last  e that i want asymmetri plus   mayb this  e i should say i want asymmetri with a vengeanc    laughter   i think we need to make veri clear that we are prepar to turn up the heat quick if we need to
al  i was anticip your comment  that   s all
vengeanc is mine saith the lord
i need to read the bibl more
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend   i think a good case can be made for the kind of gradualist polici that we ve been follow   howev  sinc we are obvious into confess today  i should say that i  too  didn t come to this conclus without some intern debat of my own              i mention at the last meet that i thought it was import  in term of the decis we made on the fund rate and our announc on the tilt  that we make sure that the bond market continu to build in appropri assumpt about futur interest rate increas   but in fact  i think there has been some decreas in the extent of the expect rise in short term interest rate in the bond market   i didn t read the incom data as support that conclus   the  book didn t read the data as support that conclus   and that suggest that a  e may come when we are go to have to surpris the bond market   now  the question is   when would we like to do that   would we like to do it today when the perform of the economi is in some sens unblemish and befor inflat start to rise   or would we like to do it in the midst of rise inflat and when econom growth may have alreadi slow somewhat   it s possibl that we could improv the perform of the economi and do a lot to reinforc the credibl of monetari polici if we decid to move more aggress  well  that was the    percent case  i m still with the    percent that argu for a gradualist polici today   but in come meet if the  book forecast is correct and we do see a rise in the core inflat rate  i think we will have a veri good reason to move in a larger increment
i support both halv of your recommend   and sinc we are confess  i will confess that my heart is pure    laughter
you re obvious not a cathol    laughter
that is also true  i do think a    basi point move is appropri today  as i said earlier  a    basi point move may be appropri later
you know what happen to those whose heart are pure   their strength is as the strength of ten
he has to turn his collar around the other way    laughter
mr  secretari  would you read the appropri languag for    basi point and the balanc of risk toward inflat
i ll be read from page    in the bluebook    the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent    the balanc of risk sentenc that will go in the press releas read    against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat heighten inflat pressur in the forese futur

chairman  span  vice chairman     presid broaddus   governor   governor       presid guynn   presid jordan   governor   governor       presid parri yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
may i suggest that lynn fox distribut a draft press statement  and i ask the member of the board of governor to join me in my offic as we go into a temporari adjourn of the fomc   recess
the fomc is back in session   the board of governor just vote unanim to accept the request receiv thus far from almost all of the reserv bank to increas the discount rate to     percent   you have in front of you a draft statement  which essenti replic the februari statement     anybodi have ani comment on it
i think it s an accur statement of where the committe is  mr  chairman  speaker     i agre with you
i have one question  mr  chairman   the first sentenc in the second paragraph make the statement that condit and consider are essenti the same as when the committe met in februari   i suppos if one interpret the word    essenti    quit broad  that may be true   but the project in the latest  book are much stronger   i see a chang toward greater recent strength and greater expect futur strength in real activ at this meet compar to the last meet   so my prefer would be to take that sentenc out   i don t think it add veri much and it may be a bit mislead
i grant you that that is your point of view  you ve held that view   but as i heard the discuss  i think this probabl captur the posit of the major of the member   frank  it s a veri minor issu and i don t realli want us to get into a debat on it   as i read it  it captur the general view of the major   if we took a vote  i think that s how             we would come out   so  if you don t mind  let s leav it as is   if that is inde the case and if there are no further question  we will releas this statement at      p m  today
