thank you  mr  chairman   i am go to be refer to the handout in front of you   it seem to be get thicker at everi meet   sinc the june fomc meet  financi market have been character by two distinct phase   until the middl of juli  share price weaken substanti  and credit spread widen   the financi sector   s difficulti were at the forefront as hous price declin continu to pressur this sector   the indymac failur led to uninsur depositor take loss  and this roil the region bank sector   the equiti price of fanni mae and freddi mac plummet  and their ongo viabil was call into question   the passag of hous legisl that provid support to the gses then led to an improv in investor sen ent and a modest recoveri in share price   as shown in exhibit    financi sector share led the recoveri  howev  the overal improv in the broad market index was veri modest  both in the unit state and abroad  exhibit      moreov  no meaning improv was evid in the corpor debt or cds market   cds spread have not chang much  and spread of asset back secur have begun to widen again  exhibit   and      despit intermeet news that i would character on balanc as more bad than good  this news did not trigger the type of risk reduct spasm by investor that have sporad plagu financi market over the past year   exhibit   and   compar the correl of daili asset price chang across a broad array of asset class in juli to the correspond period in march   the blue box denot correl with absolut valu of more than       as can be seen  asset price movement have becom much less correl   although the mood is slight improv today compar with a few week ago  the under news  especi from the financi sector  remain quit bleak in most respect   in particular  there is littl convict that financi share have reach a bottom   this can be seen in the unusu high volatil of financi share price  exhibit    and the posit skew in option price for financi firm  in which the price of a put has been much higher than an equival out of the money call  exhibit      financi market particip are pay more to protect the downsid than to particip on the upsid   merril lynch   s recent experi is reflect of the challeng environ face by financi firm   merril lynch rais new equiti capit and announc that it had sharpli reduc it net ab cdo exposur   investor were initi pleas that the compani had bitten the bullet  and the share price ralli in respons   but further consider temper the initi enthusiasm   and there are more articl on this in the wall street journal today   a closer look reveal some troubl aspect of the transact   first  merril lynch took an addit      billion of cdo write down from the june quarter end valuat date   merril lynch sold cdo exposur with a par valu of       billion to lone star for      billion   at quarter end  these posit had been carri on the book for       billion   second  this transact result in a drop in net cdo exposur of onli      billion becaus merril lynch    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     provid    percent nonrecours financ to lone star   merril lynch gave away all the upsid on these asset in exchang for a payment equal to   percent of their par valu   third  merril lynch   s equiti issuanc report result in    percent dilut to exist sharehold   the dilut was exacerb by the term of an earlier share issuanc agreement with temasek  a singapor sovereign wealth fund  this agreement grant temasek a    make whole    provis if  within    month  common stock was issu at a price below temasek   s     per share invest   this result in merril lynch   s pay      billion to temasek  which temasek then roll into a new      billion share invest   over the past month  the troubl of fanni mae and freddi mac have taken center stage   rise loan delinqu for prime singl famili mortgag caus share price to plung   this erod confid that the firm would be abl to rais new equiti capit and rais concern about the viabil of these firm   this  in turn  intensifi the downward pressur on share price   as a result  investor began to lose their enthusiasm for the firm    debt   investor in short term discount note were uninterest in take on ani potenti credit risk   as a result  issuanc volum fell  and discount note rate climb  exhibit   and       some investor in the firm    longer term debt oblig   includ some major foreign central bank   becam unwil to add to their long term agenc debt and agenc mbs posit  and one or two of the central bank actual cut their posit somewhat   howev  longer term debt spread did not chang much becaus the loss of central bank demand was offset by buy from u s  fix incom asset manag  who believ that the implicit treasuri support of gse debt was like to be harden  exhibit       fanni and freddi respond by issu less debt   to husband their liquid  the two firm have back away from purchas agenc mortgag back secur for their own portfolio   the remov of this bid was one factor that caus the mortgag basi   the spread between the option adjust yield on agenc mbs and other benchmark yield  such as treasuri and interest rate swap   to widen signific  exhibit       the congress respond by enact hous legisl that includ provis that harden the implicit govern guarante and  thus  reduc debt rollov risk  the treasuri now has author to lend the gses an unlimit amount of fund  the magnitud be constrain onli by the debt limit ceil   in respons  discount note issuanc cost have fallen in the most recent auction   howev  enact of the legisl has not generat ani compar narrow in the mortgag basi or resolv the longer term outlook for the gses   the mortgag basi remain wide in part becaus fanni mae and freddi mac have few incent to expand their balanc sheet   although their regulatori capit is still well abov minimum level  these capit standard are under review   moreov  becaus further loss are like in come quarter  it is unclear how long this excess capit will be avail to support portfolio growth   of cours  the two firm could respond by issu new equiti   howev  the low level of these compani    share price make this option unattract   to rais suffici fund to ensur long term viabil would caus massiv dilut for exist sharehold   to put this in perspect  the current market capit of freddi mac is onli about    billion   this compar with a book of busi in term of it portfolio and guarante book of      trillion  becaus the gses will like remain reluct to expand their balanc sheet in the near term  the mortgag basi will probabl remain elev  keep mortgag rate high   this will intensifi the downward pressur on hous activ and price  which in turn will lead to greater loan delinqu and loss   the consequ will like put further pressur on fanni   s and freddi   s capit posit   so what   s the bottom line   in my view  the legisl has help to avert   at least for now   a meltdown in the agenc debt and agenc mbs market   but the passag is no panacea for ensur the viabil of fanni mae and freddi mac or in enabl the two firm to provid signific support to the u s  hous market   one consequ of the gse relat turbul was a temporari pickup in demand in the most recent schedul   tslf auction  on juli     exhibit       as term mortgag agenc repo spread widen relat to term treasuri repo rate  the cost of borrow via the tslf becam more attract   this illustr how the tslf program can act as a shock absorb and reduc volatil in term repo rate   with the except of the juli    auction  the tslf auction continu to be undersubscrib with relat stabl bid to cover ratio   in contrast to the turbul evid in the financi sector  the bank term fund market have been relat stabl sinc the june fomc meet   as shown in exhibit    and     the spread of one month libor and three month libor to oi remain elev in the unit state  europ  and the unit kingdom   howev  this mask the fact that forward fund rate appear to have risen signific   as shown in exhibit     the forward three month libor   oi spread has risen about    basi point over the past three month   this spread is now anticip to remain elev at around    basi point on a one to two year  e horizon  indic that market particip expect term fund pressur to persist for the forese futur  befor the crisi  the spread was about    basi point   the u s  taf auction also show a stabl trend   as shown in exhibit     the bid to cover ratio remain around     to    and the stop out rate has been quit steadi over the past five auction   in contrast  as shown in exhibit     the bid to cover ratio for the ecb dollar auction continu to climb   as i note in an earlier brief  part of this rise reflect the fact that the ecb auction is noncompetit   the bid are prorat  and the bank pay the u s stop out rate   larger bid by european bank in the ecb auction do not affect the interest rate they pay for such fund  and that encourag more aggress bid   convers with the ecb staff indic that they are concern that the outcom could be a bid spiral   individu bank could keep rais the size of their bid submiss to ensur a stabl amount of dollar fund   it is possibl that these pressur could eventu encourag the ecb to switch to a swiss nation bank type of multipl price auction   this would elimin the incent to bid more and more aggress on the part of the european bank   howev  such a chang probabl would result in a higher stop out rate in the ecb auction compar with the unit state or switzerland   ecb offici might not be fulli comfort with such an outcom   earli reaction by primari dealer and depositori institut to the two refin to our liquid facil   the     billion program of option on the tslf and the introduct of the longer     day  matur taf auction   have been favor   we recent   last friday and this monday   complet an extens set of interview with the primari dealer communiti about the tslf option program and will be propos final term  within the set of paramet approv by the fomc on juli     by the end of this week   of cours  we will keep you fulli appris as we go forward on this   as you know  our liquid facil have place signific demand on the feder reserv   s balanc sheet  as the chairman mention   as the liquid facil have been expand  we have reduc the size of our treasuri portfolio  we do this to drain the reserv ad by our liquid program   the use of our balanc sheet to  il these reserv addit has rais question about whether suffici capac is still avail to meet prospect demand   especi a larg unanticip rise in pdcf or pcf borrow   exhibit    illustr the transform of the feder reserv system   s balanc sheet over the past year  out of treasuri into non treasuri lend   as shown in exhibit     the non treasuri portion consist main of      billion of taf loan  the     billion  in steadi state  of foreign exchang swap execut with the ecb and the snb  and our     billion    day matur  singl tranch repo program   although the amount of treasuri held in the soma portfolio still total      billion  a major of these secur are encumb in one way or anoth   as shown in exhibit     from that      billion we need to alloc     billion of treasuri to collater the foreign central bank repo pool  retain     billion of on the run treasuri secur to keep avail for our tradit treasuri secur lend program  and set asid      billion for the tslf program and now an addit     billion for the tslf option program  top    when the option program is includ  we have about      billion of unencumb treasuri avail to offset addit pcf and pdcf borrow or to fund further expans of our liquid program   obvious  further expans of our taf or tslf auction or singl tranch repo oper would be at our discret and  thus    not pose a meaning problem in term of reserv manag   we wouldn   t expand these program if we didn   t have the abil to conduct offset reserv drain oper   howev  what would we do if face with a huge rise in pcf or pdcf borrow   an inabl to drain the reserv ad by such lend would caus the feder fund rate to collaps below the target   fortun  we have a number of altern that would enabl us to offset veri larg demand for pcf or pdcf borrow   first  we could sell our remain unencumb treasuri hold or use them to engag in revers repo oper with the primari dealer communiti   this could be augment by the     billion of on the run treasuri secur current set asid for secur lend   togeth  these two sourc could be use to drain more than      billion of reserv   second  we have made arrang with the treasuri so that  if the need aris  the treasuri would issu special treasuri bill into the market on our behalf and take the proceed and deposit them at the feder reserv   put the proceed of such t bill sale on the fed   s balanc sheet would drain reserv from the bank system   the potenti scope here is larg   the hous legisl rais the debt limit substanti   there is now about      trillion of headroom under the debt limit compar with onli about      billion previous   third  we continu to press for legisl that would acceler the  e of the feder reserv   s author to pay interest on reserv  be abl to pay interest on reserv would put a floor under the feder fund rate  in this case  an inabl to drain addit reserv from the bank system would not result in the feder fund rate collaps toward zero   final  we continu to explor the legal and oper feasibl of expand our balanc sheet in other way   for exampl  could we engag in revers repurchas transact use the collater obtain from our singl tranch repo and from our tslf oper   i wouldn   t say i am confid that we can handl ani eventu   after all  the triparti repo system provid trillion of dollar of fund to the primari dealer   in the unlik event that it all came to us  we wouldn   t have the capac to fulli offset it at present   but we could accommod hundr of billion of dollar of demand if that prove to be necessari   that said  i want to go on record that ani veri larg unanticip demand for fund from the feder reserv by dealer or depositori institut might take a few day or more to offset by reserv drain oper  thus  in such a circumst  the feder fund rate could temporarili trade below it target   turn now to interest rate expect  monetari polici expect have revert back to the veri slow path toward tighten that was evid befor the april fomc meet   as shown in exhibit    and     the feder fund rate and eurodollar futur curv have shift down sharpli sinc the june fomc meet  our current survey of the primari dealer show an even slower anticip pace of tighten   as shown in exhibit     the averag of the dealer forecast in our most recent survey anticip no tighten until the second quarter of        but the chang in the dealer    forecast sinc the june fomc meet is more modest than the shift in market expect  compar exhibit    and       look at the probabl of differ rate outcom impli by option on feder fund rate futur in exhibit    and     one see that there has been a steadi trend upward in the probabl that the fomc will keep it polici target rate unchang at both the august and the septemb fomc meet   note also that the probabl assign by market particip to further eas is lower than the probabl assign to tighten   the past month has been mark by a signific declin in commod price  as shown in exhibit     although the energi complex has led the way down  agricultur and industri metal price have also declin signific   these declin have spur a larg declin in breakeven rate of inflat measur by the spread of nomin treasuri and tip yield  exhibit       as shown in exhibit     longer term market base indic of inflat expect have increas a bit  both the barclay    and the board staff   s measur of five year  five year forward inflat impli by nomin treasuri versus tip yield have drift upward sinc the june fomc meet   howev  both measur remain well below the peak reach in earli march   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the june fomc meet   as alway  i am veri happi to take ani question
thank you veri much  bill   ani question for bill  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   bill  at our recent intermeet call  i wasn   t expect the character of the financi stress to sort of backtrack to the point that it feel like march   mayb somebodi said it was as scari as march   i have notic in a lot of our speech that mani have note that financi condit have not return to normal  and i have alway kind of wonder what    normal    would be   with hundr of billion of dollar of loss at major financi institut  i guess i am wonder whether we can reason expect that this distress and adjust will be allevi over some reason short period of  e   we are    month in   isn   t this like to take    more month or longer   financi institut have a lot to digest   what do you think financi institut and market have to do to signal a return to accept function   what are we look for  and what chang in fundament are like to occur that would deliv sustain liquid improv
okay   that is a big question    laughter
i think this is a good  e to revisit our strategi and what we are think about accomplish here   it is my understand that the chairman has ask you to look at unusu and exig circumst
i think the first thing we can say is that market particip expect this to last a long  e   the fact that the forward libor   oi spread are elev  look out a year or two year  suggest that the market view the balanc sheet adjust process as take quit a long  e   second  i would say that how long is realli go to depend in part on how the macroeconomi evolv   if the macroeconomi evolv in a favor way  then the loss that will be born by the financi sector will be discret smaller  and so you can get through this process sooner   in contrast  if the economi has a bad macroeconom outcom  then obvious this is go to be a lot wors   we don   t realli know the answer to that yet   part of that is also go to be veri sensit to what happen in term of individu institut over the next   to    month becaus we are put a tremend amount of strain on the financi sector   if there is littl breakag  then the chanc of our get through relat quick  say in    month  is pretti high   but if that stress creat failur and system contagion becaus of those failur  then this could last quit a long  e   so the answer is that we don   t realli know yet   i think there is a long way to go   we are about one year in  by my measur   i date this back to august    when the ecb did their massiv reserv intervent   so i wouldn   t want to make a bet on what inning this is  but it is definit not the ninth inning
pleas  no basebal analog    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to follow up on that a littl becaus it seem to me that  over a year ago now  there was a lot of discuss by various parti that had to do with risk premium be veri low   peopl were worri that the economi and the financi market were underpr risk   now  all of a sudden  these spread have increas   if you look at the oi spread that you refer to  the one to two year out  is there a possibl that this is perman   that in some sens the level of spread in the price of the risk is just now higher and it is go to stay higher  mayb not as high as the peak but at some higher level   if that is true  then use those spread as a measur of how distress the market is could be veri mislead   as a consequ  it would seem as though you would want to be ask question not just about the price and the spread but also about volum in these market   mayb  bill  you can elabor on what volum are do   certain in the near term  the overnight  and the one month interbank fund market   are volum back to their level even though the spread are higher   i think we have to be a littl care that  if this realli is a perman shift in risk premium  look at these thing may be the wrong metric for assess what is go on   if you have ani observ about that  i would like to hear them
i think it is a fair point that we shouldn   t assum that    normal    is return to the libor   oi spread that appli befor august       so we have to look at a broader set of indic   for exampl  i think that it would be worthwhil look at the spread between jumbo mortgag rate and conform mortgag rate as evid of the degre of the shadow price of balanc sheet capac   i think that  onc financi institut either rais suffici capit or stop take loan loss provis or write down asset so that they have enough capac to expand their balanc sheet  we will be get to the end of this process  anoth thing i would say to add to the answer i gave earlier to presid   is that the trajectori of hous in all of this is go to be huge import   one thing that may signal the next phase  mayb the begin of the end  is when peopl realli do get a sign that the hous sector is start to bottom  probabl first in activ and then in price   onc that happen  the huge risk premium embed in some of these mortgag relat asset will then collaps   that mean that the mark to market loss in a lot of institut will start to fall   so i think that is go to be a veri  veri import metric onc hous start to realli bottom and peopl get some visibl about how much home price will go down   you know  when the argument is about whether home price are go to go down    percent or    percent  that will be a veri differ argument from the argument now  which is whether home price are go to go down    percent or    percent
how about volum
i think that the market function has vari  frank   in the middl of the gse turmoil  the agenc market was basic shut down   with the passag of the legisl  it has improv   haircut are still quit elev   liquid is certain not as good as it was back befor this crisi   the cost of fund through the fx swap market is still veri elev relat to libor   i think thing are improv  though  in the sens that shock are not as broad contagi as they were befor   the reason is that peopl now are pretti cogniz of what the problem are  and so when there are new  bad piec of inform  peopl aren   t quit as shock  and they don   t revis their outlook to the same degre about a whole varieti of asset class   but i think that is whi the correl slide that i show you in the exhibit show less of a correl between differ asset class   we are still get tremend amount of movement in asset price  but it  sn   t seem as though  if someth happen in one sector  it necessarili rippl through to other sector
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m just follow up here   i mean  as much as i love exhibit         and      and i have use a lot of them myself when i talk about the economi   it is not realli appropri to look at these as measur of stress   you could just say that these are the equilibrium price in an economi that is adjust to a big shock   you could have a complet flat line here that would indic stress in market becaus these price aren   t move around appropri to the risk that have develop and open up   so a lot of the concern around the tabl has been exact that  when market freez up  you can   t do ani trade at ani price  and for that the volum data would seem to be a much better indic of the kind of thing that we are worri about   i think that this is condit a lot of our think about the economi   you look at this pictur  and you natur think it has to go back to    basi point befor the crisi is over   that probabl is not go to happen any  soon and mayb never   thank
i thought that part of presid     s question was whether market are back to normal for a period in which they are adjust to hundr of billion of dollar of loss on mortgag loan   so i would be interest in your character of how market are work relat to how well they ought to work in that circumst
i guess we don   t have a lot of observ to know what normal is in that environ   i think that the market are general do somewhat better  as i said  relat to the flow of new inform   i don   t think the inform flow has improv  but i think the market are respond a littl better to the bad inform   that is how i would character it
if i could follow up  the reaction you describ sound warrant by the inform come in   the market is digest inform about the locat and magnitud of loss and the extent to which hous is go to recov
i think the market is react pretti appropri to the inform it is see  although i would say that the risk premium are still high in a pretti broad array of asset relat to what one would think would be normal   haircut are high  and market liquid is still impair   we are definit not back to normal market function in a pretti broad array of asset class
but when you use    normal    in that sentenc  you mean a  e period without hundr of million of dollar of loss that we don   t know quit the magnitud of  right
yes   it is hard to benchmark how market are suppos to behav in a period with hundr of billion of dollar of loss   becaus how mani  e have we actual gone through this experi
so if i could just follow up   in these graph  what would you point to as the effect of our action or our lend
the effect of our action have been to mitig the rise in term fund pressur and to somewhat mitig the forc liquid of collater becaus of the inabl to obtain fund   becaus of that  our action have help prevent the kind of pernici margin spiral that we saw in march  when volatil was go up and haircut were go up  which was then caus mark to market loss  which were caus forc sell   so i think our action have mitig those to some degre   now  obvious  we don   t know what the counterfactu would have been in the absenc of our action  but i believ   and most market particip believ   that our action have been help in those respect
thank you   i guess i would comment that there is an asymmetri here  which is the possibl of system risk   there are situat in which failur   major collaps of certain market   can have discontinu and larg effect on the economi   we have seen that in mani context across a larg number of countri   these stress do reflect the work out of equilibrium given fundament loss  which we can   t do veri much or anyth about   but they do creat machineri that is less flexibl and less abl to respond to new shock  and that rais system risk   that is the risk that we want to tri to minim  even as we allow the market to work their way through and to price the chang we have seen
we have never argu that the role of our facil is to prevent the adjust   we have alway argu that the role of the facil is to allow the adjust to be order rather than disord   that is what we have been go for
i would be interest in see a model  mr  chairman   thank you
certain   ani other question for bill   if not  let me turn to     for the econom situat
thank you  mr  chairman   in put togeth the econom outlook for the current  book  we confront three main chang in circumst relat to the situat as it stood in june   first  the labor market look distinct weaker than we had anticip   in the employ report that was releas in earli juli  payrol employ declin by more in june than we had been expect  and the unemploy rate held at     percent rather than drop back as we had anticip  follow the increas of     percentag point in the previous month   the fraction of the labor forc work part  e for econom reason had move up sharpli  and claim for unemploy insur were trend up   the second major chang in circumst that we confront was a second quarter increas in real gdp that appar continu to outpac our expect  in last wednesday   s  book  we project growth at an annual rate of     percent in the second quarter    percentag point stronger than in the june  book   at that pace  gdp growth would have slight exceed our es  of the rate of growth of potenti output   the third major chang was a financi sector that look more hostil to econom activ  on balanc  than at the  e of the last meet despit the improv dure the second half of the intermeet period that bill   has just describ   when we put the  book to bed  the stock market was about   percent lower than we had expect as of june  a varieti of spread remain wide or had widen further sinc the previous  book  and concern had been heighten about some key institut   in addit  the latest read from the senior loan offic opinion survey point to a remark widespread continu tighten of term and standard for both household and busi   these three factor   a weaker labor market  appar stronger aggreg demand  and a more hostil financi environ   did not easili fit togeth   to resolv the situat  we began by rule in favor of the profil present by the labor market and heavili discount the greater vigor be signal by the spend indic   in our judgment  the stori be told by the labor market seem by far the more credibl one  what with hous price continu to declin at a rapid pace  consum sen ent drop into sub basement level  energi price remain high even after their recent partial revers  loan offic report a pervas tighten of credit term and standard  and other measur of financi stress flash at least amber   moreov  while quarter to quarter discrep between gdp and ip are commonplac  the near   percent drop in manufactur ip dure the second quarter fuel our skeptic that the economi was on a fundament sound foot   as you know  for sever  book our gdp project has been substanti weaker than it would have been if we had kept in line with the advic from our forecast model   we were motiv to impos this judgment weak part in recognit of the possibl that we might be enter a recess  and recess are  e when spend tend to fall short of the level that would be indic by the fundament   we also were motiv by the restraint that we think financi market are impos on real activ and which our model are ill equip to captur   in the current project  we had to modifi these assumpt in light of the chang circumst   in effect  we interpret the greater than expect strength of real gdp dure the second quarter as reflect an error of  e with respect to the judgment weak that we had built into the forecast but not a misjudg about the overal magnitud of that weak   implement that interpret involv three step   first  we respond to the unexpect strength in first half gdp growth by shift some judgment weak into the second half   second  we deepen the overal amount of restraint that we impos in light of the less favor financi climat   third  we stretch out the period of financi recuper   wherea previous we had financi market condit essenti return to normal by the middl of next year  in this project we have the period of recuper extend into        these adjust left our project for real gdp growth     percentag point lower over the second half of this year and     lower next year  despit the offset from lower oil price and a slight greater dose of fiscal s ulus  reflect the introduct of extend unemploy insur benefit   for the most part  the avalanch of inform that we receiv sinc put out the  book last wednesday has corrobor our project   this year   s revis of the nation incom and product account threw us no real curv ball    sorri for the basebal analog     laughter   the growth of real gdp was revis down by an averag of     percentag point per year   the revis to the pce price index  both core and total  were veri slight   while the bea has given us some homework to do between now and the septemb meet in fold these data into our think  ani adjust that we might be prompt to make  includ to the suppli side of our forecast  are like to be slight   on the face of it  the advanc es  of real gdp growth in the second quarter of this year seem to hold a bigger surpris   the bea   s es   at     percent  came in   percentag point below our es  in the  book   howev  as best as we can tell   base on still incomplet inform   the miss was attribut to lower es  by the bea of farm inventori invest and of valu ad in the trade of use motor vehicl   our preliminari read is that neither of these error carri ani signal for the forward momentum of the economi move into the second half of the year   friday   s employ report was likewis merci well behav   at least in the narrow sens of conform to our expect   privat payrol employ declin an es         in juli  togeth with small downward revis to may and june  that left the level of employ in juli veri close to our forecast   in addit  the unemploy rate came in onli a few basi point higher than we had expect   the onli real news sinc  book public came from the motor vehicl manufactur   on friday  they report that sale of light vehicl in juli were at an annual pace of      million unit  much weaker than our alreadi weak forecast of      million unit   moreov  they knock their assembl schedul for the third quarter down from     million unit to     million unit   take their schedul on board would slice anoth    percentag point from our es  of gdp growth in the third quarter   the manufactur have alreadi announc increas in incent  but it remain to be seen how vigor consum will respond in the current environ and how great the financi wherewith of the manufactur will prove to be to sustain such move   in ani event  the drop in sale and product is certain larg enough to give renew urgenc to the question as to whether a broader retrench in spend might be in train   turn to the inflat side of the project  our forecast for core pce price over the remaind of this year is near unchang from the june  book   we still have core inflat step up from a littl more than   percent dure the first half of this year to a littl more than     percent in the second half  as the surg in price for import  energi  and other commod pass through to retail price and as some compon that saw unusu low read earlier in the year acceler to a more normal rate of increas   next year  with the pressur from import  energi  and commod price diminish and with slack in resourc util becom a littl greater  we have core inflat drop back to    percent   the project for next year is also the same as in the june  book  as the influenc from lower energi price and slight greater econom slack are rough offset by the pass through of higher import price   the more dramat chang in our inflat outlook came in the noncor piec  not surpris  the plung in oil price sinc the june meet caus us to whack our forecast for retail energi price inflat over the second half of this year   for next year  howev  we mark up pce energi price inflat a littl  part becaus natur gas futur price have a more posit tilt than they did befor and part becaus gasolin margin will still have some recov to do   at the same  e  we have becom more pessimist about the outlook for food price inflat   the cpi for food in june came in at     percent  much higher than our forecast of     percent  becaus we have most been surpris to the upsid thus far this year  we decid to move closer to our food price model  which has been call for larger increas than we were previous will to write down   the net result  as you saw in the  book  is an outlook with fa  food price inflat despit the fact that futur curv for both livestock and crop have move down sinc the last meet   all told  we now have headlin pce inflat run at an averag annual pace of     percent over the second half of this year  near   percentag point slower than in the june  book   for next year  we have mark up total pce inflat by a few tenth in light of our reassess of the food price situat and the slight greater rise in energi price that we now see next year   with regard to the risk in the outlook  my sens is that the downsid risk to econom activ have increas sinc the  e of the june  book   that view is inform by two main factor   first  while we have factor the more unsettl natur of the financi environ into our baselin outlook  the situat seem more fragil than befor  and the implic for real activ of a sharp deterior in financi condit could be quit larg   the first altern scenario that we present in the  book   entitl    sever financi stress      updat our period attempt to assembl an integr macroeconom and financi scenario   second  the deterior in the motor vehicl sector now  to my eye  more convinc take on the profil of what we usual see in the cours of a typic recess   dure the intermeet period  we will be on high alert for evid suggest that the weak in vehicl sale is a harbing of a broader shortfal in consum spend   as for inflat  the upsid risk have  in my view  diminish somewhat   again  two factor inform this assess   first  the downtick in the long term inflat expect measur in the reuter michigan survey is somewhat reassur  second  the drop in oil price is a welcom relief from the steadi drumbeat of bad news from that sector and suggest a somewhat diminish probabl that persist high toplin inflat will be reflect in a more serious eros of household expect  with all the advers implic for monetari polici that would entail   to be sure  even with those favor develop  upsid risk remain   we illustr one such risk in the scenario entitl    inflationari spiral     in which we posit an initi shock to inflat expect of    basi point follow by an advers feedback loop that caus actual and expect inflat to chase each other up near   percentag point abov baselin   monetari polici eventu bring the process under control but onli over a lengthi period of  e  part becaus the rule that we use in the simul has polici respond to actual but not to expect inflat     kamin will now continu our present
for the next coupl of week  million of peopl around the world will be watch the olymp game in beij   for those of us charg with forecast the global economi  of cours  china watch is a year round task   but notabl  the most salient develop sinc your last meet have arisen outsid of china   chief among them  of cours  have been the precipit fluctuat in the price of oil   when the last fomc meet conclud on june     the spot price of wti crude oil was run at      per barrel   it soar to over      by mid juli befor plung to about      as of this morn   the     per barrel drop over a three week period was the largest on record in nomin dollar term  although in percent term  the    percent declin we   ve seen has been exceed on a coupl of occas in recent year   notabl  mani other commod price  especi those for natur gas and mani food crop  also declin sharpli   it has been hearten  and a welcom chang  to see oil price undershoot rather than overshoot our previous forecast   but it would be prematur to pop open the champagn   we   ve seen sever other steep declin in oil price in recent year that gave way to renew upward surg  and it remain to be seen whether an import shift in the suppli   demand balanc has occur   saudi arabia ad a total of         barrel a day to it product of oil in may and june  and there are indic that it product rose in juli  too   howev  these increas bring total opec product up onli to their level in earli       and the world economi has grown consider larger sinc then   analyst have cite gloomier forecast of global econom growth  and thus global oil demand  as contribut to the weaker oil price  but those forecast have been come down for the past year with littl appar effect   although oil consumpt in the industri economi clear has slow over the past year  we have yet to see either a concert buildup in u s  oil inventori or ani indic that oil demand among develop countri is slow  therefor  a further lurch upward in oil price is a distinct possibl   moreov  with spot and futur price have first soar and then plung sinc your last meet  the relat flat path of oil price that we are project is onli about     per barrel lower  on balanc  than in the previous forecast   in the mean   indic of foreign growth have come in a bit weaker than we expect  and inflat read have been on the high side   these gloomier aspect of the intern outlook counterbal  to some extent  the improv tone of oil and other commod market   clear  prospect appear weakest in the advanc economi   consist with our earlier forecast of a sharp deceler in activ  we es  that growth in all four of our largest industri countri trade partner   canada  the euro area  the unit kingdom  and japan   came in below   percent in the second quarter   in the unit kingdom  a sharp contract in the hous sector appear set to drag the economi into a mild recess in the second half of this year   the remain major economi should skirt recess but remain quit weak in the near term amid slacken export perform  continu stress in financi market  tighten credit standard  and veri sharp eros in busi and consum confid   whi are the foreign industri economi slow about as much as in the unit state  when the subprim crisi origin in this countri and the major drag on the u s  economi is the slump in a nontrad sector  hous   clear  part of the stori involv the intern financi linkag that have led foreign market and institut to share in the stress and loss induc by the u s  subprim crisi  anoth part of the stori involv a common shock   the global boom in oil and food price   that has cut into real household incom and spend around the globe  third  even as the persist declin in the dollar sinc      has buoy u s  export and growth  this has come at the cost of trade perform and econom activ in our trade partner   final  the foreign industri countri have enjoy littl or none of the substanti monetari and fiscal s ulus we   ve seen in the unit state over the past year   we es  that growth in the emerg market economi also slow further in the second quarter  to a pace of rough   percent  where we have it stay for the remaind of the year   obvious  this is well abov the growth rate of rough   percent that we   ve pencil in for the industri economi  but it is still below their like potenti rate as mani develop countri struggl with soften export demand and rise food and energi price   notabl  howev  even after slow in the second quarter  es  chines growth power on at about    percent   by       we see both foreign advanc and emerg market economi acceler as financi stress eas  the u s  economi pick up  and commod price stop restrain the growth of real household incom   this recoveri scenario depend crucial on our project that headlin inflat start move down within the next quarter or two  so that substanti monetari tighten is not need   the recent declin in oil and other commod price provid some comfort that this scenario will materi   howev  we saw some surpris sharp increas in consum price in june  bring    month headlin inflat to around   percent in the euro area and the unit kingdom     percent in mexico  and   percent in brazil  in most of our major trade partner  inflat exclud energi and food price has remain better contain  and in china  headlin inflat has actual move down from it februari peak of     percent  regist     percent in june   even so  until we see sever quarter in a row of declin in aggreg measur of inflat  we will not be out of the wood   so far  the imprint of slow foreign growth and rise foreign inflat on the u s  extern sector has been limit but not neglig   turn first to price  core import price inflat has move up sharpli  from about   percent last year to    percent in the second quarter  this was the fastest quarter increas sinc       most of this acceler was concentr in materi intens good  such as food and industri suppli  and was like due to rise commod price rather than to more general price pressur abroad   howev  inflat in import finish good also increas this year   as we note in a special box in the  book  price of import from china have been move up brisk as a result of increas in domest cost and in the valu of the renminbi   this step up in the so call china price explain less than one fifth of the overal acceler of core import price but about one third of the run up in inflat for finish good import   even so  assum commod price stabil go forward  we expect chang in overal core import price to slow quit substanti in come quarter   so far  u s  extern sector perform has held up well in spite of the slow global economi   net export ad    percentag point to real gdp growth in the second quarter  the largest quarter posit contribut sinc        admit  much of this reflect a   percent declin in import  which were drag down both by weak u s  demand and the quirki season pattern in the data on oil import  even so  export expand at a veri healthi     percent  support both by the depreci of the dollar and by continu robust demand for commod   go forward  we anticip export growth hold up at a still healthi   percent or so  as foreign econom growth pick up right around the  e that the boost from previous dollar depreci start wear off   the contribut of net export to u s  gdp growth should move down  but this will chiefli reflect a recoveri in import as the u s  economi pick up   thank you     and i will now be happi to address your question
thank you   question for our colleagu   presid
in term of the relat benign outlook for core inflat now and for headlin inflat  i   m wonder what your assumpt are about margin compress and for the abil of corpor to pass through price increas   by the way  i found the core revis somewhat alarm becaus they   re well abov   percent  but less alarm than what i think i heard you say about headlin inflat project   if my memori is correct  over the past two year there has been a wider spread between core and headlin  and part of that has been due to the abil of firm at least to restrain or not to exploit ani perceiv price power   if you   re assum that core will be relat well behav over  e  some assumpt must be in there about margin and margin manag  and i wonder what they are   then i have a question for   on the intern side to follow up on that
by our high imperfect measur of margin  which we see through the filter of the nation incom and product account  margin at this point are somewhat abov the averag over the past    year  and we have them come down for the nonfarm busi sector  we have them come down a littl  but not veri much   so we have some slight eros in margin  but they remain abov averag   in the corpor sector  which is measur a littl differ from the overal nonfarm busi sector  margin are about averag at the moment   so i would not say that a big move in the markup of price over cost is a materi drive factor in our inflat outlook
obvious the implic of this more dire outlook for econom growth is that movement of the top line will be veri  veri difficult  so again  more pressur come into the margin side to see that one can satisfi sharehold that thing aren   t as bad as they might be  that   s realli the natur of my concern   i don   t know if we   re survey or get a sens as to the pressur that peopl feel   i   m go to talk about some of that  but you may be do this more formal than i   m abl to do to get a sens of what kind of pressur are occur on margin  on the intern side  mr  chairman  if i may      i   m curious about these chines inflat number   as i understand from the chines ministri of human resourc  the averag wage of urban worker rose    percent year over year in the first half of        and yet they report an offici inflat number that i believ you say is   or   percent of someth   how do you squar that corner
well  the short answer is that we don   t have enough consist sourc of data to squar it   but you certain point to a factor that mani peopl have talk about   the rapid increas wage  particular in those industri area on the seaboard that are respons for most of the manufactur   it   s hard to squar the relat limit data that we have on those wage with movement in overal cpi   but there  too  is a limit   those cpi number that are cite from china are main for urban area  so it   s hard to know how compar those are with the other   as you know  there   s also an extrem larg food compon in the chines cpi   so becaus basic food is probabl less labor intens than the type of manufactur in which most of the worker are work  that   s part of the way to squar that   in some sens  the food price aren   t reflect those high wage as much   then a final wild card is that there are differ view on what   s happen on both the level of profit margin in china and what they   ve been do   a lot of anecdot report suggest that profit margin are razor thin and that they are be squeez   other analys  includ some of the world bank   s  suggest that those profit margin are still pretti ampl   so i think you correct allud to an import phenomenon   the rise wage becaus of high demand for worker   but we   re still busi sort out the data to figur out exact how that map into price
thank you   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two question   first  on the  book forecast  one thing that struck me is that there was a fair larg revis in your forecast for nonresidenti structur go forward   in fact  after a pretti good show in the first half of this year  you mark down the second half of this year for that and mark down substanti        in the last  book  you had structur actual grow posit in       now it   s minus   percent  someth like that   is that driven by someth in the model  or is that some adjust factor that was ad in   if so  what was the rational for that  or whi might it be come out  whi do we have that chang   then i   ll follow up with anoth question
we don   t quit understand whi this sector seem to have resembl the cartoon charact that keep run along when we think there shouldn   t be ani support underneath it    laughter   we are staunch negat about the second half for this sector  and that view is inform by the precipit drop in the architectur bill index   that   s one of the relat few indic that give us ani purchas on what   s go to happen in this sector   it   s a help indic of spend about six month ahead   we think that financi condit are pretti tough in this area   we   re get a lot of anecdot evid that peopl are have greater difficulti financ project than was the case befor  and we   ve seen some uptick in vacanc rate as well  so we think all of those are factor   i guess i would say that we   ve heard veri persist negat report from our supervis colleagu as well about what   s go on in that area
but the chang is not just in the second half of this year   you   ve got a big chang for        too
if we think about the phrase that peopl use      financi headwind      and the credit problem that we see  my interpret of how the staff has model that is on the demand side   of restrain credit limit demand   but i can also think of the financi sector as have been hit by a veri signific product shock  if you will  where the product function for intermedi has taken a huge product shock to it   so in think about a model in which that has happen  you might find yourself think about the consequ of that  particular how that affect the path of potenti output over the near term   if you think that type of shock is drive potenti output down over the near term  depend on the magnitud of that  it is go to affect your es  of the gap and therefor your es  of inflat and what the economi look like go forward   so i guess my second question is  have you thought much about this  or is much of this incorpor in the evolut of your output gap or your potenti output measur  work through that channel   if so  what might be the ramif for inflat and polici go forward
i   ll take that becaus we did have a bit of an intern debat on that issu awhil back   in particular  spencer dale  who was visit us from the bank of england  was basic make exact the same point you   re make and rais that issu
so mayb i   m not so kooki after all    laughter
but we sent him out of the countri    laughter
one test is whether in previous period of financi stress like this  we saw what might be more upward inflat pressur than we otherwis could explain or product perform that we had troubl explain   after look at the experi dure the earli     s in the headwind period and tri to think about the like magnitud of the effect of such a product shock come out of the financi system  we decid that you could see a negat product shock of that sort go on but that it effect are overwhelm by the fallout from it effect on demand   so although there might be some negat product shock  on net it turn out to be more of a disinflationari effect   but we also had difficulti see it show up in product data   that said  that would be extrem hard for us to find   you know  it could be there  and we just couldn   t find it
so in the way you   ve model this in your forecast  are you think of yourselv as model that net effect  or do you think of yourselv as model and forecast just one side   have you made ani effort to incorpor both side of this potenti effect   even though it may be small  the question is how small it is
we   ve made no explicit adjust for that in the potenti output assumpt we have go in   look back  it was hard to see that there was much  if ani  effect  but that   s a risk know that there could be some product effect and it   s just hard to find
may i just augment my earlier answer   i spoke about the nonresidenti build sector   anoth factor take down overal nonresidenti spend is that the lower energi price trajectori reduc our expect for drill and mine expenditur  which have also fallen
thank you  mr  chairman   a question for     could you review your thought process on core import price and comment on how sensit our inflat project are to the assumpt of  i believ  moder in core import price in
sure   as i mention  core import price inflat shot up veri rapid to over    percent in the second quarter  and our approach toward model and predict core import price inflat focus on three main sourc of increas   first are increas in foreign cost pressur  which we proxi by cpis  which have not been a particular import driver of core import price as of late  though they are not neglig   then the other two  which are more import  are declin in the dollar  which push up our price  and final increas in commod price becaus a lot of our import  even core import  which exclud oil and high tech product  still have a lot of commod input into them   for the past few year  our experi has been that the pass through of declin in the dollar into core import price has been relat moder   it has definit contribut materi to the increas in core import price but not as much  we feel  as the run up in commod price  which has had a pretti substanti effect   one way that we can sort of confirm that impress is that we know that the price of import materi intens product that have the most commod input have gone up much more rapid than price of finish good  and that has been true over the past year as well   so for all of those reason  we feel that commod price have been the prime impetus for the run up in core import price inflat  go forward  we take our guidanc from the futur market  which indic that oil price and other commod price will flatten out   as a result  we anticip that  relat short  core import price inflat also should start to declin   at the same  e  our anticip is that  compar with the past few year  the dollar will fall less rapid go forward than in the past  and that should be anoth factor support our view that core import price inflat should diminish
you might want to defin    core import price inflat     it   s not analog to the other core
right   so  yes  thank you   in the case of core import  we exclud oil  which is veri import  as well as comput and semiconductor
i have a question similar to presid     s   both the financi shock   the hous adjust   and the big relat price shock you could say all in differ form could hurt the rate of growth of the economi   s product potenti   you could say that they all might  in some dimens  reduc the near term expect path of potenti growth   i guess my question is that you have this    cost sector realloc    altern scenario   do you attribut ani effect on potenti growth over the forecast period in your baselin to the combin effect of the hous adjust and the big relat price shock from energi
no   one of the fact that we learn from microeconom data about  for exampl  job flow is that there is alway a huge  astonish amount of churn   job destruct and job creation   just astonish  and that   s true even in normal macroeconom  e   so the background radiat level is not zero   but we haven   t incorpor in our baselin ani allow for greater cost  and that   s what this altern scenario was intend to illustr  make a pretti generous allow for the potenti effect of that sector realloc on the product capac of the economi   but it   s a serious question
there   s one minor qualif to what   just said   we do keep track of rough es  of what we think that the rise in energi price over the past few year is possibl do to trend product  and we   ve come up with es  that mayb it   s       we think that effect has been ongo  and it is built into the data   in some sens it   s occur  and so in some sens it   s in our trend es    it is not as though our trend aren   t implicit take in the fact that there   s an ongo loss in product associ with rise energi price
i was just go to say that i thought the interest thing about that scenario was that it  sn   t realli chang your view about the appropri path of monetari polici go forward   it   s basic at the baselin   so even if you were to build in a materi chang in potenti growth  becaus of the effect on demand go forward it  sn   t affect your view about the appropri path of polici
the reason is that it oper like a classic suppli shock  which present monetari polici with just simpli a less pleasant polici menu to choos from  and in the context of that cost sector realloc  the economi is run closer to it product capac   let   s see  i lost my train of thought here
well  basic you can just stop there    laughter   it   s the tradeoff between the two   obvious  if you were more concern about inflat outcom than real activ outcom  you might tilt it a differ way
isn   t it true  though  that chang in potenti growth also have demand effect as well   to some extent offset
yes   it mean that it   s anoth way of say that you wouldn   t expect the es  of the now prevail equilibrium real fed fund rate to be higher  not to stretch this too far  but anoth way of say whi the like expect path or the appropri path of polici  sn   t chang in term of the nomin fed fund rate is that we have these offset effect on demand
thank you  mr  chairman   regard a comment that bill   made about hous price  for financi institut  it   s go to matter a lot whether we   re look at a declin from    percent to    percent or from    percent to    percent   hous inventori  unsold home  are veri high  and i guess i   m wonder again   we have gone over this a few  e   what factor are like to get hous advanc if it   s not a sharp declin in hous price   i   m have a hard  e understand whi the expect would not be for a relat sharp declin   i   m translat the  book ofheo number to bill   s number  and i   m not sure  but it seem to me that financi institut ought to be think that a signific adjust must still be in train if we   re not expect demand to pick up all of a sudden   the mortgag origin challeng are there   or is this disequilibrium just go to sit there for an extend period of  e
i guess i would push back on the premis that we don   t have a pretti signific adjust in hous price built into our baselin   we have hous price as measur by ofheo declin   percent this year and anoth   percent in       and i wouldn   t anticip ani rebound in        you know  our abil to measur where that would leav hous price relat to some notion of fair valuat is incred imprecis   but one regress base indic that we follow suggest that it would have hous price relat to rent swing from a relat high valuat to a notic low valuat   charl fleischman illustr this ye day in his pre fomc brief   the major factor that provid some reason for op  is that construct start are now low enough that builder are make progress in chip away their inventori of unsold home   the month    suppli figur remain extraordinarili high becaus the denomin is veri low  but in term of unit of unsold home  my recollect is that we   ve chip away about half the run up in term of absolut number of unit in inventori   we also have start continu to come down materi from their current level   so we think that the process will begin to get inventori into a more normal align
the staff has been way out front in project the hous declin  and that has been veri help   is there ani disson between what bill said and your pretti substanti expect of hous price declin
i don   t think so
was it    to    or    to
i think what make it complic  though  is that there   s a nonlinear   if the hous price declin do turn out to be on the higher side  it then put more stress on the financi system and on credit avail  which then lead to a weaker economi  which then put more stress on the hous sector   so small differ in the path get amplifi
i agre with that chain and those risk  but what i thought i was hear from   was that the staff es  has in it quit a substanti adjust process in hous  and then i would expect financi player to share that assess
i wasn   t realli address the point es  of where hous was go as oppos to the uncertainti around that es    i would argu that the uncertainti around that es  is still quit wide   at some point it will be resolv   when it is resolv  that will be a favor develop  but i don   t think we   re there yet
i would just augment bill   s comment with two other observ   there   s plenti of probabl mass out in the tail   i think it actual is two side risk   we illustr one side of that risk in our    sever financi stress    scenario   the other point i would make is that our project for nation hous price declin of    percent cumul in      and      make plenti of room for a veri much more sever declin in florida  california  and other high stress area  and we have attempt to take that region divers into account   it   s a rough exercis  to be sure  but we   re not oblivi to the fact that some area are do much wors than the averag  that is the natur of averag
vice chairman  did you have an intervent
i was just go to say this   i think that you can do crude es  of like total loss across the u s  economi and credit market in a scenario like the baselin scenario in the  book  and if you use nelli liang   s studi or the stuff done in new york  there   s a huge amount ahead still   even though financi market price now reflect an expect for hous price declin that are not signific more op ist than     s baselin scenario  i don   t think you can say with confid now that financi institut have alreadi provis for or written down loss to accommod that   becaus the trajectori of hous price will depend in part on financi behavior   the avail of credit   as financi institut catch up and adjust to that and adjust capit and asset growth  et cetera  there is some risk that you   ll push that expect path of hous price down further from where it is   so if institut have to prepar for the possibl that you   re go to have a much weaker econom outcom becaus there   s some probabl around that  then there   s a risk that they will produc that outcom through the combin effect of their behavior  which is whi we   re live with such a delic balanc
they do seem to be take out a lot of insur on the downsid  right   like your merril lynch put option
they   ve had to pay a lot for not veri much insur in the case of merril lynch
presid     sorri   presid    an intervent
thank you  mr  chairman   just to point out that it must be the case that lower hous price have a posit effect on the homeownership rate   so there must be some mitig  some good effect   we   re obvious get to where we need to get eventu   the question i have for the staff about this is  have you thought about the sequenc   i mean  it strike me that we   re like to get to a point of stabil in price and construct activ befor we get month    suppli back down to some histor norm   becaus it   s sort of a stop variabl  are you guy expect it to converg smooth  and have you thought about what measur of activ you expect to see stabil first
we expect start to stabil next year  and that will be follow by a pretti consider period of sever quarter with hous price final stabil   but we think that builder will look ahead and see that they   ve cut their addit to suppli by enough to make even more rapid progress against their inventori of unsold home   the question of the dynam of hous price is a t i one becaus it depend on what model of expect one assum that homebuy will have   if everi homeown were a ration econom be  then it   s pretti unambigu that a lower level of home price would elicit greater op  on the part of home shopper that  gee  the valuat is better compar with ye day  i should be more enthusiast about get into the hous market  i should be happier today than i was ye day   i think it   s at least an open question as to whether expect aren   t more extrapol than that   we haven   t seen ani diminut in  for exampl  the michigan survey in respons to what homeown expect to happen over the come    month  and i think it   s a serious possibl that they look at their recent experi and extrapol that forward and conclud that over the next    month the user cost of own a home is go to be realli high   we just don   t have a veri good grip on exact what the dynam of price and hous demand will be
i just want to point out that we hear a fair amount of anecdot feedback suggest that just determin what is the net real price for a hous is not so easi becaus of incent  particular in multifamili but also new home in general   you pay list  but you get a merced and a year   s worth of gasolin and your lawn mow and a lot of thing thrown in for the seller to hold the price close to what the list is   so i don   t know how these thing are actual measur to take into account those kind of incent
i don   t know what the ofheo   to captur the qualiti of automobil that come in the driveway    laughter   i suspect that there   s no adjust for that
on the inventori and the sequenc  which i think is veri interest becaus of how it play out  i learn recent   and you can correct me if this is wrong   that  in the inventori of new home for sale  the way that   s count includ permit that have been issu even though there   s no home that   s been built   so a develop may get permit but may not have start the home yet   it may just be sit on a pile of permit   so if that   s correct  and i think it is  it mean that  if you think about the sequenc of what   s go to happen as demand begin to turn around  those permit don   t have to get bought  but they may start build on permit that they   ve alreadi been issu and they haven   t start build yet   is that a correct way of look at the data
i don   t know what the stori is with regard to permit that you   re mention   i do know that the cancel rate of new home sale has declin a bit   previous we were emphas that the high level of cancel that the builder were experienc was actual caus the suppli situat to be even wors than one would infer from the census bureau data   now the cancel rate have come down  and so that situat is not as sever as it was six or nine month ago  i believ
presid    you have been patient
my question is for     there have been judgment adjust to the domest forecast reflect financi headwind in the unit state   i   m wonder if we made the same adjust for financi headwind in europ   you highlight that residenti invest look a bit differ in europ  but they do have a lot of capit loss in their bank system   their libor   oi spread is quit elev  and at least in some european countri   ireland and spain as well as the unit kingdom  which you mention   hous has been quit soft   are you do judgment forecast to reflect those headwind  or do we do it on the domest side but not for the european outlook
as you correct point out  europ  in particular    inde have a lot of financi stress  and some part of europ  particular the unit kingdom as well as ireland and spain  are look at some veri serious weak on the hous side   so we are  inde  kind of in parallel but not exact the same as our domest colleagu build financi stress into our outlook   we don   t necessarili increas or decreas the amount of financi stress in our forecast in lockstep with the domest side   in particular  the european financi situat has probabl gotten a bit wors over the intermeet period  but some indic haven   t deterior to quit the extent that they have in the unit state   nonetheless  we have built in a fair amount of financi stress  one factor that   s worth keep in mind is that we built it into our outlook fair earli on   so we haven   t adjust downward the outlook for europ by that much compar with the last coupl of  book  but we had alreadi built in quit a bit of weaken of activ  and a lot of that   reflect both the direct effect of financi stress as well as their knock on effect on tighten credit standard for bank
i have presid    and then if it   s okay with everybodi  we should probabl start our go round   presid
veri quick  i want to come back to the hous issu   you know  i   ve been more pessimist than i think anybodi around the tabl from the standpoint of peak to trough correct  and i find the number you mention veri benign relat to my expect   one issu that i   m tri to understand a littl better in term of it like effect is that the real bulg in reset come in      to      becaus that   s when the alt a reset kick in   we talk about this mani  mani moon ago  the ultra poor document on those type of loan  in particular  and i   m wonder to what degre you   re factor this into your outlook go forward  particular for those out year
we   re certain awar of that   to my eye the number look astonish negat   for foreclosur  we have     million foreclosur this year and anoth   million foreclosur next year   we have a veri bleak landscap built into the project
on that happi note  mr  chairman  thank you
thank you  presid     the go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the contour and basic outcom of atlanta   s forecast are similar to the baselin of the  book forecast   so i want to focus my remark this morn on the under assumpt in both forecast   assumpt that i view as pivot and if we miscalcul could result in a longer term polici error  it seem that at everi meet there   s great uncertainti around the outlook  and this junctur is no differ   i perceiv consider uncertainti and debat assumpt in the base case scenario   as i see it  the key assumpt broad are that hous stabil  perhap as indic by hous price  in the second half of         inflat pressur intensifi in the near term but then abat becaus of econom slack and lower commod price and  as discuss  core import price  recent declin in oil price stick  and price remain more or less flat   certain sinc the  book was publish  we note the fluctuat just in the past few day that were refer to earlier  and i also can   t dismiss geopolit risk and the potenti of a sever shock   final  financi market stress will persist for some month but diminish next year   these assumpt  use the respect term    assumpt     have the feel to me of    bet     not so respect a term   the polici assumpt integr to both the  book and the atlanta forecast could be ad to this  and that is that rate rise start in      won   t choke off improv growth and will be enough to blunt remain inflat pressur  so i   ll devot my comment to input from region and other contact that either serv to confirm or cast doubt on these assumpt   we orient this cycl   s question to our atlanta and branch director to  first  evid of wage pressur and pass through of higher cost   in interpret the feedback  we note some confus between a busi   s manag of it labor cost versus general wage pressur   we heard that busi are work to keep their total wage bill in check by rais wage for key talent but let less critic employe go or cut their work hour as an offset   the reduct in hour is attribut to some combin of weaker product demand and increas averag product   rise unemploy appear to be keep wage demand in check   there are except  such as the oil field servic industri  for which qualifi staff are in short suppli  and certain skill industri and busi trade in which local bottleneck exist   in busi enjoy strong export demand  some employ are util bonus rather than commit to perman wage increas   so our region contact did not indic the develop of broad base under pressur on labor cost reflect wage demand   as for inflat pass through  our contact report widespread and grow effort to pass through higher input cost   pass through effort appear to be the rule rather than the except  as one branch director put it  peopl are pass through cost like crazi use high energi cost as cover  the report of my supervis staff regard bank condit indic a continu declin in asset qualiti and a veri nervous interbank fund market   foreclos properti  both singl famili and condo  are make up the major of hous sale and slow the absorpt of the oversuppli of new home   some contact are veri concern about the prospect of a second wave of foreclosur as option arm mortgag borrow  most concentr in larg state like florida and california   these are borrow who are current pay less than the accru interest   run up against maximum loan to valu ceil   new  higher gse standard are result in fewer borrow be qualifi  put downward pressur on hous price and bring more foreclosur   virtual all compar for florida residenti valuat are base on forc sale and foreclosur  we are told   beyond the deterior in real estat portfolio  bank are report grow problem in credit to food distributor  restaur  truck  and other petroleum fuel or input intens industri  base on my call with financi market contact  it seem that   no surpris   much of the attent in financi market has shift from privat fix incom market to fanni and freddi  fix incom market for privat secur appear to have improv relat to their low sinc the current financi turmoil began   although signific concern remain  it appear that leverag loan deal are get done   volum is down  spread are up  and the deal are veri conserv  but deal are get done   that said  one of the pattern in my call over the past year has been that  everi  e one concern abat  anoth seem to jump up and take it place  although the recent legisl appear to have allevi concern about the fanni and freddi senior debt  my contact indic that there is widespread uncertainti about what will happen to junior secur if the treasuri inject fund   furthermor  more than onc i heard the view that foreign holder of gse debt are concern that their posit are not as safe as they believ   one contact mention that the    month term of the guarante is report affect some holder    matur choic   in respons to my question about the relat weak of european bank  one contact suggest that they have book much of their troubl asset in the    hold to matur    account  suggest slower recognit of loss and difficulti ahead   we confirm with one larg region bank cfo signific deterior of heloc in their portfolio and  by implic  broad among region bank   the option arm problem  by contrast  is perceiv to be possibl the next shoe to drop but  as i said earlier  not uniform distribut across the countri   final  we heard the view that market perceiv bank as face protract difficulti rais capit  to conclud  the downsid risk to growth have not diminish in my opinion   on the flip side  i agre that the upsid risk to inflat are obvious a serious concern   in particular  i put a fair amount of weight on the possibl that inflat will not moder suffici without a more substanti tighten of monetari polici than that project in the  book baselin   my intermeet intern and extern discuss make it difficult for me to dismiss some of the altern scenario in the  book  specif the    sever financi stress    scenario  the    typic recess    scenario  and the    inflationari spiral    scenario  and in a high uncertainti environ  i don   t view ani of these scenario as exclus of anoth   that said  i see the risk to both the inflat and the growth object as veri rough in balanc at this  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   overal there has been littl chang in the sen ent of my busi contact sinc our last meet   most are still report sluggish domest demand with littl evid of ani improv over the near term   on the price front  everyon continu to cite cost pressur   manufactur have long list of materi cost increas  while retail note larg increas in wholesal price of import consum good   everyon discuss how they are plan to continu pass these cost along to custom in second round effect  undoubt weak market condit will limit their effort  but i suspect that mani will be success in rais price signific  turn to the financi situat  to start i should note that i did hear some good report with regard to liquid in chicago financi market   a contact at the chicago mercantil exchang told us that they conduct extens liquid review for their largest clear member  with special scrutini of firm that had substanti volum of hard to valu asset on their book  the clearinghous was veri pleas with the result  find that these firm had good access to liquid  overal  howev  my financi convers this round were relat downbeat   i did hear some interest detail  though  about the dynam of the restructur of credit intermedi   with commerci mortgag back secur market effect shut down  a high rate owner develop of high end shop mall describ his increas difficult attempt to find fund for his regular flow of balloon payment on mortgag properti   he has gone from restrict loan from life insur compani to attempt to put togeth his own structur debt securit   they want to issu bond back by the revenu generat from a pool of their high qualiti properti and sell them to major fix incom invest fund   this is one exampl of what economist like kashyap and shin es  will be a reduct of at least    trillion in lend to nonfinanci institut due to mortgag relat loss at u s  financi institut   it is also an exampl of how firm are tri to find workaround for the function that intermediari use to do for them   but such restructur must be rais the cost of financ in way that are not obvious amen to mitig through liquid polici  turn to the nation outlook  the inform we have receiv over the past sever week has contain mani crosscurr  but overal our forecast for output growth is littl chang from our june project   with regard to price  i am concern that inflat risk continu to grow   the most recent news on core price has not been good   oil price may be come off the boil  but they are still scald   price are still down onli to where they were in may   my impress from my contact call is that the ul  pass through to final product price of earlier increas could take a disconcert long period of  e   furthermor  i continu to think that the current fund rate in conjunct with our enhanc lend facil repres a quit accommod monetari polici stanc  even given the disrupt in financi market   if the polici path remain as accommod as futur market expect  then improv in inflat will most like requir fortuit favor develop in inflat expect and more restraint from resourc slack than we might have otherwis expect  this bring me to three consider that i would like to highlight as we evalu the risk manag posit under our view on appropri polici and our econom project  the first factor is that  accord to mani econometr es   the    to   percent unemploy rate envis in the project would provid onli veri modest restraint on inflat   in addit  cost realloc could lead to less resourc slack  perhap temporarili drive the nairu abov   percent   you know  when i talk to my staff  they assur me that there are veri good reason  demograph base  to believ a nairu under   percent   but i tend to think i   ve read a few too mani paper on polici and polici mistak where that   s exact the issu   when you think the sustain unemploy rate is lower than it actual is   so that   s a risk  i think  the second factor is that mani individu and busi see the larg relat price chang in oil  food  and commod as precursor to more persist inflat   whether or not their assess are analyt correct depend on their expect of our polici respons   a substant respons may be necessari to prevent self fulfil price increas and keep inflat under control   word can take us onli so far  the third consider is the potenti diminish return through our effort to mitig distress financi market condit   it is my interpret that our current accommod monetari polici and suit of lend facil are set to mitig sever downsid risk and the system risk that you mention earlier  mr  chairman   this is help under the assumpt that reduc liquid strain will assist financi market to return to normal oper and prevent a perman impair of our financi infrastructur   but financi condit seem unlik to return to our previous percept of normal  at least for some  e   thus  i see a risk that extra accommod intend to greas the financi wheel could be left in place too long and prove counterproduct for price stabil   inde  the old percept of    normal    like is not the correct benchmark for us to use in look for whether we are experienc structur chang in the intermedi process in which new liquid provid are play enhanc role in the lend process and in which risk standard are chang   so when think about market function  it would be use to discuss this within a longer term framework of what we can feasibl expect from market function and what central bank liquid has the abil to use and appropri influenc   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i may have to leav the lunch earli   so befor i start  i do want to bid   adieu      i rememb describ you as charm in one of our earli meet  you have charm me by your intellect and devot   anyway  i   m go to miss you   so i want to say that in case i do have to leav earli  mr  chairman  in the intermeet period  i spent almost as much  e in presid     s district as i did in my own   part as vacat but the rest consult with some advis and mentor in the peopl   s republ of cambridg at my alma mater    laughter   i mention this becaus i want to underscor that  in argu a perspect  i tend to move away from the rather felicit circumst that prevail in my district   even though thing are slow  we still expect employ growth to come in a littl short of   percent a year  and our bank situat thus far is hold up rather well  in term of my nation sound  and you know the list and the group is familiar with it  the anecdot evid from everyon   from the banker to the credit card compani to retail to fuel produc  food produc  energi compani  shipper  equip manufactur  homebuild  and entertain compani   confirm report of progress higher obstacl to grow their top line and continu effort to drive down their cost of good sold through reduc their head count  run veri tight inventori cycl  tighten their oper expens  and reexamin and in mani case cut back signific on cap ex   nation i expect continu anemia on the growth side   we are  as you know  not at the extrem but at the low end of expect for econom growth   i would expect zero growth as we approach year end   as i said earlier  from our perspect we   re onli about two third through the peak to trough correct on hous  and i view that as a continu weak influenc   so the summari is that most of my contact are plan around expect of a prolong u s  and advanc countri slowdown and have a rather woeful outlook as to the growth side  at the same  e  there is also a woeful concern with regard to price pressur   intensifi cost pressur affect their margin at a  e when the stock market is most unforgiv of peopl who miss their mark   even in the first district  i might note   i want to quot the beig book report from boston      almost all contact manufactur voic concern about elev       cost        respond general have rais their sell price in recent month        over one half of contact expect to increas their sell price further in the second half of      and or earli          it went on to say that  while some contact express worri that price increas have led or will lead to loss of market share  other indic that   and these are the key oper word      custom have becom more recept to price increas becaus they see them as a consequ of general cost pressur      mr  chairman  that passag captur the messag that i   m receiv from my ceo and cfo contact around the countri   by and larg  we appear to be transit from vigil on the price front to acquiesc   inflat expect are  i think  becom unmoor  and i believ they are  if not alreadi adrift  at risk of drift  on the small busi front  i do like to look at bill dunkelberg   s recent report from the nation feder of independ busi   his most recent report indic that the percentag of small busi owner cite inflat as    the number one problem they face     rose to    percent in june  the highest rate sinc       and that    percent of his respond report rais sell price   at the other extrem of size  to put this in perspect  wal mart   s ceo for the unit state report last week   and i quot this      my biggest concern is inflat   this month we had an experi that wal mart has never ever      that   s liter what he said      had befor  which is that a major supplier told us we need a   percent increas or we will not suppli you at all      now  he did not mention the name of that supplier   it could have been unilev  which saw the volum of good it ship slip     percent year over year in the second quarter   yet accord to our convers but also quot in the wall street journal on august    unilev   s ceo report that he    rais averag price on his thousand of product     percent     and then ad that he     sn   t plan to revers ani price increas      or it could have been one of the largest snack food compani  whose cfo has inform us that  after take and have stick a   percent increas in price in march   i report this at our last meet   they will effect anoth     percent increas in octob  here   s the pithi quot he gave me      thus far we   ve been bleed out price increas to our custom   now our strategi is to bludgeon them   to broadcast our increas in the expect that competitor will do the same      i doubt the supplier to wal mart was kodak   last week the new york  e report that    hurt by higher manufactur and materi cost  the compani said it will combat these cost pressur by pass on to consum and rais price on some product by as much as    percent     i have lot of exampl of similar respons   presid   indic similar pressur  presid   did too   i   m not go to go through them   i will add  by the way  the one thing that surpris me   despit disney   s brilliant annual report of record earn  they  too  plan to rais their singl day price by   percent  to      in the next quarter   there is also a grow feel  which i haven   t heard befor  among semiconductor manufactur that  after year and year of constant price deflat  they expect that there may   and the oper word is    may      be a bottom out becaus of the raw materi price they face and the wage price and pressur they are receiv in china  which has becom a major semiconductor manufactur  one might take heart from the recent correct in commod price   i agre with   that we have to be veri care about that   my smartest energi contact have been expect a correct in price   market were overshoot   natur gas price have react to recent develop like the barnett shale and  even more import  the so call haynesvill play in louisiana   the    oili    note that increas saudi suppli hit our shore with the normal six week lag   they were talk about product increas in may and june  and those have just hit our shore recent   so they   re not surpris at the price reaction at the pump   but none feel that the basic demand   suppli situat has been dramat alter   much as you argu      and most expect structur price to obtain at or near current level   now  what      at or near current level    mean in term of price impact   i had a long convers with the ceo of burlington northern  and just for data purpos  in term of what they call their rcaf   an automat cost adjust contract that cover    percent of the good ship by their rail   their third quarter rcaf is    percent   the    percent of product that are not cover by that automat contract are subject to a fuel surcharg   that fuel surcharg at      a barrel is a    percent increas for the third quarter  one might also take comfort in the purport calm in compens growth seen so far  along the line of what i read in the financi  e by mark gertler on juli      i don   t hear confirm of that benign argument among busi oper   first  as presid   and mr    point out in our last meet  labor compens is not a good predictor of inflat   i rememb dave said that it   s not that labor cost  which are a signific chunk of busi cost  don   t matter but that you can   t necessarili take comfort from the well behav compens thus far that you are not go to confront some inflat problem go forward   now  the last anecdot i want to give you illustr that point   ye day i had a lengthi visit with the cfo of general mill   until their fiscal year        which end in may  they price over mani year an averag increas of   percent   they took     percent as the year end  and they   re take anoth   percent this year   they are have to reexamin their elast model  he said   here is what he said that worri me the most   they are find those model less predict becaus  a     everybodi is rais price     and  b  consum percept is that inflat is back   so  again  vigil is give way to acquiesc  mr  chairman  i do want to comment veri briefli on someth i mention last  e  which regard calcul the cost of good sold   i am hear more and more from compani that have shift product to china a verif of the    percent number that the ministri gave us  whether it   s a hospit produc whom i talk to in california or a black   decker tool assembl in china  they   re complain not onli about cost increas of    to    percent  depend on whether you   re oper in the north or south  but also about the employe contract law that was just put into place  which in essenc allow for almost an old fashion scala mobil italian french model  which feed a wage   price spiral  and it is begin to infect their wage cost and inject rigid into their abil to oper in china  so overal  mr  chairman  i am concern  obvious  about econom growth   i think we  as presid   mention  are in a veri difficult spot   we have three enorm worrisom scenario face us   i think we have to be veri care how we word ourselv on inflat   last night at      nation public radio open their marketplac report with this headlin      the fed fuel your pain      we have a percept issu that we must address  and there are two way to do it   one is by be strong in term of how we argu the case of inflat   the other is to act by rais rate   i   m go to listen veri  veri care becaus  frank  i   m undecid here as to what the right approach is   but i think we have to be care when we state a balanc of risk  which are enorm  that we don   t underst the fact that inflat is now be accommod in the mind of the marketplac   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    i   m go to ask you a veri innoc question   you   ve given mani chill anecdot over the last few meet about increas in price  but the offici statist just don   t show anyth like that outsid of oil  gas  gasolin  and the direct commod price increas   do you believ that the cpi is not an accur measur
well  i do see the cpi rise   the month report was not encourag   the last    month have not been encourag  and i think what worri me is the spread between core and headlin   core is rise as well  by the way   even our own es  indic that   i do see it in headlin number   the number i saw that were just report i thought were quit alarm  you are see the pass through   you   re hear evid of this in the anecdot report   i do believ  mr  chairman  that it   s visibl in the data   i   m just tri to report what i   m hear from the field against the background of much more sophist analysi  which i respect enorm  what i   m worri about is the percept  i do believ that the data are veri imperfect on inflat expect   i notic that   said that about the further out expect in the michigan survey   if you look at the reliabl of the data  the one year survey  which has risen signific  has been quit reliabl over  e   the five to ten year   i don   t know if they   re talk about ten year  five year  or somewher between the two  and i don   t think statist that   s been a veri accur indic histor  but i   m not sure about that   so we have veri imperfect hard data on inflat expect  and i think that   s when anecdot evid may be help   all i   m tri to do  mr  chairman  is report to you what i   m hear from the field  and not from my district  and i hope it is use in the deliber
i think there   s no question that headlin inflat is veri high right now  clear  when you get these kind of increas in energi price and food cost  you   re go to have to reflect them in current price   in fact  that   s exact what you need to have happen so that relat price shift   the realiti is that high oil price have to mean that real wage fall   peopl have to conserv and not drive as much and so forth   so this is a normal process  and monetari polici   not control these relat price shift   what i think is more critic is that  although there are some problem in term of core  the effect has actual been quit limit given the incred rise in energi price   while it   s import to think about headlin in the long run  the inform from core is veri use in term of think about polici becaus it tell you whether this is spill over into under inflat  one of my concern about go to anecdot inform and whi i think we need to use an analyt framework in think about what is realli drive the inflat process is that we do need to focus on the longer run becaus that   s what monetari polici can control   i get a bit nervous about these anecdot concern  which i think can tell us someth about headlin   then we have to ask what they tell us about the longer run context but not put too much weight on them   that   s one reason that i think some of the analyt framework that we   ve develop here are veri use for think about these thing   thank you
well  in term of the weight  again  i   m just one of    or     and i would weigh it accord   but i am worri that we   ve had a spread between headlin and core for a long period now   i am worri that we   re see core expect pick up   modest but they are begin to pick up   i am worri that core expect are abov   percent   and i am particular worri about develop on the global wage front in term of how it affect the cost of good sold here in the unit state  one last thing that i just start to detect   and again  it   s all just hearsay   but i   m increas hear report of concern of peopl who oper compani about the welfar of their employe and about their abil to pay transport cost  pay food cost  and maintain the valu of their     k  plan and  as presid   report  some way to tri to manag  if not through formal demand on wage  at least to tri to cushion their welfar   these are margin influenc  and i don   t disrespect the analyt side   i do worri that data captur histori  and i   m tri to give myself a sens for what is happen at the margin in term of microeconom behavior  and the report is onli what it   s worth   it   s just one input in the mani   thank you
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the eighth district has remain rough stabl dure the summer   activ in the servic sector has increas slight  and except for the auto industri  manufactur activ is also stabl to slight higher   automot contact report a varieti of plan to lay off worker or to idl product  and at least three automot part supplier will close plant in the district   contact in the auto industri are not op ist that product will increas in the short term   retail and auto sale have soften in recent week  and some district retail contact have express concern about summer sale   mani contact continu to emphas commod price level as a key factor in busi decis   they are concern both about the necessari busi adjust  given the new price structur  and about the implic for the overal level of inflat go forward  the residenti real estat sector continu to declin   across four of the main metropolitan area in the district  home sale through may declin about    percent compar with       wherea singl famili construct permit declin about    percent   the number of foreclosur in the st  loui area in the second quarter increas to about       file  up about    percent from last year   i am impress  howev  with the region in the foreclosur situat  as some area of the nation continu to have far higher foreclosur rate than other   in contrast with the general posit report in commerci real estat activ for the earlier part of       recent report have indic more uneven condit in the nonresidenti real estat sector across the district  turn to the nation outlook  i was encourag by the recent gdp report for the second quarter  which show growth at an annual rate of     percent   real final sale increas at an annual rate of     percent   it now appear that the worst quarter associ with the current episod of financi turmoil was probabl the fourth quarter of       when the economi abrupt stall  the slow  or no growth period was through the winter  with the economi gradual regain foot through the spring and summer   if there were no further shock  i would expect the economi to grow at a more rapid rate in the second half of this year   but there has been anoth shock   name  substanti increas in commod and energi price   i think it   s import to be care not to confus the effect of this latter shock with the effect of the hous sector shock  my sens is that the level of system risk associ with financi turmoil has fallen dramat   for this reason  i think the fomc should begin to de emphas system risk worri   my reason is as follow   system risk mean that the sudden failur of a particular financi firm would so shock other ostens healthi firm in the industri that it would put them out of busi at the same  e   the simultan departur of mani firm would bad damag the financi servic industri  caus a substanti declin in econom activ for the entir economi   this stori depend critic on the idea that the initi failur is sudden and unexpect by the healthi firm in the industri   but whi should this be  onc the crisi has been ongo for some  e   are the firm asleep   did they not realiz that they may be do busi with a firm that may be about to default on it oblig   are they not demand risk premium to compens them for exact this possibl   my sens is that  becaus the turmoil has been ongo for some  e  all of the major player have made adjust as best they can to contain the fallout from the failur of anoth firm in the industri   they have done this not out of benevol but out of their own instinct for self preserv   as one of my contact at a larg bank describ it  the discoveri process is clear over   i say that the level of system risk has drop dramat and possibl to zero  let me stress that  to be sure  there are some financi firm that are in troubl and that may fail in the come month or week depend on how nimbl their manag are at keep them afloat   this is whi mani interest rate spread remain elev and may be expect to remain elev for some  e   these spread are entir appropri for a financi system react to a larg shock   but at this point  failur of certain financi firm should not be regard as so surpris that they will caus ostens healthi firm to fail along with them   the period of substanti system risk has pass   of cours  we have also endur a bout of system risk worri stem from the oper of the gses   howev  my view is that the recent legisl has address the system risk compon of that situat as well   becaus of these consider  my assess is that the chanc of uncheck system risk push the u s  economi into a sever downturn at this point are small  no larger than in ordinari  e   unfortun  while the threat from this sourc is retreat  anoth threat is upon us   name  a substanti shock from increas energi and certain commod price  which is lead mani to forecast slower growth dure the fall   real automot output subtract     percentag point from real gdp growth in the second quarter   mani contact seem to attribut this larg to consum reaction to increas gasolin price   if this is true  then it seem to me that some of the most visibl reaction to this shock may have alreadi occur  be pull forward into the second quarter  labor market have been weak  but i am not as pessimist as most on this dimens   so far this year  the u s  economi has shed about         nonfarm payrol job as compar with a drop in employ of         job dure the first seven month of      or         dure the first seven month of        neither of these latter two episod is associ with the recess label   these two year might provid better histor guid to the behavior of today   s economi than those associ with the recess label  such as                 or             this is one reason that i think the label game can mislead us in our think about the economi  the main contribut that the fomc can make to the economi is to keep inflat low and stabl   the headlin cpi inflat rate is run close to   percent measur from one year earlier  the univers of michigan survey of inflat expect one year ahead reflect this realiti with the most recent read at    percent   the june cpi annual inflat rate was a     s sound      percent   of cours  much of this is due to energi price   still  with these kind of number we   re go to have to do more than talk about inflat risk   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   develop dure the intermeet period have heighten my concern about downsid risk to econom growth and slight allay my concern about upsid risk to inflat   let me begin with growth   the moder growth rate regist in the second quarter was disappoint  especi becaus it benefit from the temporari effect of the fiscal s ulus packag   moreov  the pattern of consum spend dure the quarter  with weak in june  is worrisom   with all the public surround the rebat check  household may have put them to work earlier than usual  especi sinc they were face signific higher price for food and gasolin   this interpret   not bode well for activ in the current quarter   assum no chang in the fund rate this year  we have lower our forecast for real gdp growth for the second half of the year about    percentag point  to just   percent  and project a correspond higher unemploy rate  our forecast for weak second half growth reflect not onli the unwind of fiscal s ulus but also advers financi sector develop   the credit crunch appear to have intensifi sinc we last met   evid of tighter financi condit abound   risk spread and the interest rate charg on a varieti of privat loan  includ mortgag  are up notic  and lend standard have tighten further   credit loss have risen not onli on mortgag but also on auto loan  credit card  and home equiti line of credit   as a consequ  the list of troubl depositori institut is grow longer   indymac and first nation will not be the last bank in our region to fail   inde  the declin in broad stock market index is part a reflect of the market   s concern about the health of the financi sector   mani financi institut are deleverag their balanc sheet and reduc loan origin   for exampl  a larg bank in my district has begun now in earnest to cancel or cap outstand home equiti loan and line of credit  despit an ongo concern about alien consum   tighter credit is affect demand   anecdot report suggest that the plung in juli car sale part reflect a tighten of credit standard for auto loan and leas   a larg bank report a substanti drop in demand for mortgag credit in respons to the recent rise in mortgag interest rate  and the anecdot report that we hear support the  book   s negat view of the effect of credit condit on invest in nonresidenti structur  the hous sector is of consider concern   hous price have continu to fall at a rapid rate  and futur price suggest a further declin of around    percent over the next    month   this forecast seem reason given the overhang of home for sale  the recent rise in mortgag rate  and the tighten of credit   unfortun  the risk of an advers feedback loop from tighter credit to higher unemploy  to rise foreclosur  to escal financi sector loss  to yet tighter credit remain aliv and well  in my opinion   inde  stress test conduct by some of the larg financi institut in our district reveal an except high sensit of credit loss to both home price movement and unemploy   the    sever financi stress    simul in the  book illustr my concern   it is not my modal forecast  but it certain seem well within a reason rang of outcom   the probabl of such a scenario has risen  in my view  sinc we met in june  one partial mitig factor that should help to support consum spend is the drop in the price of oil sinc our last meet   but to the extent that the declin in oil price part reflect reduc expect for global growth  the net impetus from stronger domest spend will be offset by weaker export growth   continu declin or even stabil in oil price will  howev  be good for inflat   we have revis down slight our forecast for core inflat as a consequ   moreov  the fact that we were not onc again surpris on the upsid by oil price has had a small favor effect on my percept of inflat risk go forward   that said  inflat risk obvious remain   even with the recent declin  energi price are well abov year ago level and are not onli push up headlin inflat but also spill  to some extent  into core   higher headlin inflat could undermin our credibl and rais inflat expect   if the public conclud that our implicit inflat object has drift up  worker may demand higher compens  set off a wage   price dynam that would be cost to unwind  fortun  the report i hear are consist with the view that no such dynam has taken hold   my contact uniform report that they see no sign of wage pressur   they note that high unemploy is suppress wage gain   growth in our two broad measur of labor compens are low and stabl  and take product growth into account  unit labor cost have risen onli modest   i tend to think of the chain of causat in a wage   price spiral run from wage to price  but it is certain possibl that the causat also  or instead  run in the opposit direct   either way  though  fa  wage growth is an inher part of the process by which under inflat drift up  and at present we see not the slightest inkl of emerg wage pressur  growth in unit labor cost also remain at except low level   i would also note that i have look for evid of some increas in the nairu due to sector realloc by examin the beveridg curv  think that if there were sector realloc we might see an outward shift in the beveridg curv   i have detect no evid of such an outward shift  these fact provid me with some comfort   moreov  various measur of longer term inflat expect suggest that they remain relat well contain   when we met in june  the michigan survey of inflat expect five to ten year ahead had recent jump a coupl tenth of a percentag point   i argu then that the respond to that survey typic overrespond to contemporan headlin inflat   sinc that meet  oil price have come down a bit  and so have the michigan survey measur   assum that the fund rate is rais from   percent to   percent in       my forecast show both headlin and core pce inflat fall to about   percent in that year   so  in summari  dure the intermeet period  my forecast for econom growth has weaken  and that for inflat has edg down slight   i consid the risk to our two polici object pretti even balanc at the present  e
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   my outlook for econom growth and inflat over the next few year is broad similar to the one that i held last meet  although i think that the prospect for both inflat and econom growth in the near term have deterior sinc june   to a close approxim  my outlook end up look veri similar to the  book   s baselin scenario  the most signific chang i am make to my outlook is to mark down the prospect for busi fix invest this year and next  base on the report that i am hear from the manufactur in my district   there is an interest short term long term dynam take place in the manufactur sector   the manufactur ceo with whom i have spoken say that over the long term they are veri bullish on america   the dollar depreci  increas transport cost  and rise wage in china all favor more u s  base product   a senior execut from alcoa told me that  in his    year of work in the manufactur sector  he has never seen the fundament point so strong toward the unit state as a profit locat for manufactur   the short term  howev  present a more mix pictur for manufactur  although some industri  such as power generat equip and aerospac  are run flat out and expect to continu do so  compani in other manufactur industri have receiv or expect to receiv order cancel   in particular  the manufactur that suppli the automot and commerci construct sector are report a worsen outlook   perhap the best way to summar the sen ent that i am hear from manufactur is to say that they see a bright futur but they see challeng condit over the next    month  we all know that hous market are extrem weak   hous price began their declin earlier in cleveland than in the rest of the countri  and we are now see some stabil in hous price   despit that hope glimmer  we have not seen ani pickup in home sale  base on this experi  it seem that we still have a long way to go nation befor we see ani pickup in residenti construct  in regard to financi market  my chief concern is that lend is go to be constrain by lender need to maintain sound capit ratio in the face of asset write down and loan charg off   balanc sheet constraint and a declin risk appetit on the part of banker mean that some worthi borrow are go to be ration out of credit market  further restrain econom activ  turn to inflat  i anticip that price pressur will intensifi further befor we see some relief  just as the  book baselin scenario depict   manufactur are still rais their price in respons to rise price for raw materi that they purchas   some compani have had fix price contract in place for five and ten year  and as these contract matur  the compani are pass on huge price increas to their custom   consequ  i think that even after a point at which energi and commod price flatten out  price at the wholesal and retail level are like to adjust upward for a while longer  i just said that manufactur are expect some challeng  e ahead   one reason is that mani of them are caught between weaken demand condit and soar input cost  sherwin   repres an extrem case  but i think it illustr the situat pretti stark  the ceo of sherwin   told me last week that their busi is down more than    percent in sale channel both to new construct and to exist home   they have been in busi for     year  and the last  e this occur was dure the great depress   despit these dismal sale  they are have to rais price   the ceo told me that the compani typic rais price onc a year  but in juli they announc their third price increas this year   in the entir histori of the compani  they have never befor had three price increas in one year  so i continu to see the risk to my project for output as be to the downsid for the reason that we have been discuss for some  e   high energi price  sever financi stress  and a depress in the hous market   the risk to my inflat outlook is weight to the upsid becaus i am concern that inflat could remain elev for too long  potenti destabil inflat expect   the  book baselin scenario expect the near term inflat pictur to worsen in the second half of this year befor improv gradual over the entir forecast period   this pattern is a concern to me   in that environ  i worri that inact on our part befor next year could be seen as complac on our part   so when i stack up the two risk against one anoth  i regard them as fair equal right now   but my outlook is condit on a feder fund rate path that begin to increas about a quarter earlier than call for in the  book baselin   i will speak to the relev of this factor when we discuss monetari polici in the next go round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district remain relat weak  but they are not materi differ from what we and our busi contact have been expect for the past sever month   manufactur and residenti construct sector continu to show a slow declin   payrol employ in our three state fell in june  but it is still abov the level of where it was three month ago and so has been perform somewhat better than in the nation as a whole  the pace of retail sale seem to have been soften  and commerci real estat firm indic that most offic and industri market have weaken slight sinc the spring   my busi contact general expect weak growth for a while   manufactur do expect a rebound dure the next six month  but most other sector  particular retail sale  anticip onli soft or slight improv condit in the near term   residenti real estat is not expect to strengthen appreci in the second half of the year   bank expect somewhat sluggish growth in overal lend for the rest of the year  although compar with some region  bank in our district are in pretti good shape   there are stress  but they seem to be manag   credit  howev  is general avail to busi  and we hear onli sporad inform from busi that they are unabl to obtain need loan  for some  e my busi contact have express concern about rise energi and commod and transport price   our busi outlook survey   s price paid index rose yet again in juli  and it is now at it highest level sinc march        although the price receiv index edg down slight  it remain at a veri  veri high level relat to histor standard   the bos   s futur price receiv index rose to      percent  which is the highest level it has been sinc januari        this indic that rough half the manufactur firm that respond to our survey expect the price they receiv for their product to be increas over the next six month   to gaug the extent to which manufactur firm have been abl to pass on rise cost to their custom  we ask sever special question about product price in our juli survey  more than    percent of our respond indic that  sinc the begin of the year  they have been abl to rais price and pass along increas cost to their custom   about    percent said this took the form of increas in base price   almost half of them had increas base price   the rest said they have use either surcharg or escal claus and  in some case  combin those with base price increas as well   surcharg and escal claus are not like to go away any  soon and may even becom more widespread   about    percent of our respond indic that price escal claus and surcharg are like to be a part of their price in the futur   further  sinc a larg number of firm have alreadi built cost increas into their base price  it is not clear at all that price will come down quick  even if oil price stabil at a lower level  on the nation level  the incom data sinc our june meet have been mix but larg in line with my expect for the near term path of the economi   real gdp growth for the second quarter came in somewhat weaker than mani expect  although i will note that as recent as april mani peopl were expect negat growth in the second quarter and it is now almost   percent   but i think that the strength is a remark testament to the abil of this economi to weather shock from financi market disrupt  a sever hous correct  and surg in energi and commod price   nonfarm payrol employ has fallen an averag of        job per month over the last seven month   a weak number to be sure but not near as sever as the job loss over the last three recess  which averag near         job a month   sinc our june meet  we have taken further step to address fragil financi market that were manifest by the difficulti surround the gses and the indymac takeov  on balanc  my outlook for the economi is littl chang  although the financi market develop sinc our last meet have margin increas the uncertainti surround my forecast   i do see near term weak growth for the economi  but i continu to expect an improv in output and employ growth next year as the economi rebound closer to trend   unfortun  there has been a resurg in financi market volatil  especi on the part of the bank sector and mortgag market relat to the problem of the gses   the liquid in the interbank and primari dealer market appear to have improv somewhat relat to the first quarter of this year  i read the condit in the financi market and the wide spread on select asset as have improv somewhat on net and the spread we are see increas reflect real credit risk as oppos to dysfunct market   as i indic in my question earlier  we should not use such spread as the primari criteria for assess the fragil of the financi market   moreov  we must be cautious in use monetari polici or other tool at our dispos as a form of forbear that delay the necessari adjust in the price of various financi claim   i think we need a high hurdl   that there are real market failur   befor we interven to stem liquid desir on the part of trader or attempt to influenc the price of specif asset class   to agre with presid bullard   s comment  we should begin to deemphas and de stress the import of system risk becaus i think it is gradual dissip as firm adjust to the more volatil and riski environ  the current state of the financi market seem to me to bear some resembl to the financi headwind analog that mani peopl refer to dure the earli     s   inde  spread on mani form of busi and consum loan are behav now much in the way as they typic behav dure recessionari  e as credit risk rise   in the earli      s  monetari polici was less accommod than it is now   at least the fund rate reach a low point of   percent from octob      to februari        and dure that  e headlin pce inflat ran about   to   percent   the real fund rate  measur by a one quarter ahead forecast of the cpi from the profession forecast  was minus     percent over the six quarter from      q  to      q    current  the real fund rate use the same measur of one quarter ahead profession forecast    cpi stand at minus     percent  the inflat outlook remain a caus of concern   headlin inflat is higher  and there is evid of modest pass through to core inflat measur   inflat compens on the six to ten year horizon has risen modest   inflat compens at the near term has fallen with recent declin in oil price  but it remain volatil   the staff has suggest that a portion of the increas in the longer date inflat compens measur may reflect an increas in inflat risk premium   that is  market are uncertain about the long run path of inflat   this is not terribl comfort   it suggest that our credibl may be wane  despit the recent drop in oil price  i remain uncomfort with the longer term inflat outlook   inde  the focus of monetari polici must be on the intermedi to longer term  and we must resist the temptat to act as if our fund rate decis can manag the outcom over the veri near term   year over year inflat  headlin cpi and pce inflat  have now been consist abov   percent sinc octob        year over year core pce inflat has exceed   percent everi month but one sinc april        that is four year  busi are report an increas willing to pass on cost increas   near term  we might get some moder in headlin inflat  if the recent drop in oil price hold   this might result in less upward pressur on inflat expect  at least in the near term   of cours  as has been point out  oil price are notori hard to predict  and we may well see a resurg in oil price befor the year   s end  but we don   t know   more import  a drop in oil price will onli temporarili mask what i view as the under inflationari pressur   oil price have clear exacerb the recent number and may mitig them in the near term go forward  but my concern is that the real sourc of intermedi term to longer term inflationari pressur come from our own accommod polici  whose consequ for inflat will be felt onli over  e   we are unabl to control the rise in oil price and it consequ for inflat in the short term  but we must hold ourselv account for the longer term consequ of our choic   should we maintain our accommod stanc for too much longer  my view is that we are like to see higher trend inflat in the intermedi term and a ratchet up of inflat expect   if that scenario unfold  it will take a much more cost polici action to re anchor those expect than the cost of a preemptiv move to rais the fund rate in the near term  to be sure  shift polici to a less accommod stanc will be a difficult decis to make  given the continu volatil in financi market and the project near term weak in employ and output growth   howev  what has been refer to as the tail risk of a veri negat growth outcom has decreas sinc the start of the year  wherea inflat risk have increas   i think the enhanc we have made to our liquid facil should be suffici to address ani remain dysfunct in the financi market  but they will not address the credit or solvenc issu  nor should we expect them or desir them to do so   the market will have to do that admit heavi lift   i do not believ that we can wait until employ growth and the financi market have complet turn around to begin to revers cours   but by our aggress attent to short term risk to growth and financi turmoil  we do put at some risk our abil to deliv on our intermedi  and longer term goal of both price stabil and sustain growth   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   the boston forecast use for the june meet expect that the unemploy rate would peak at approxim     percent  unfortun  with the juli employ report  the unemploy rate has alreadi reach     percent  and we expect the economi is like to grow less than potenti for the next sever quarter   with the unemploy rate rise in the past three month by     percentag point and payrol employ declin for the past six month  i am concern that there remain a signific risk that the second half of this year would look a lot like the    sever financi stress    or    typic recess    scenario   my concern reflect the potenti impact of further deterior among financi institut and financi market that may creat a signific headwind for the economi and the likelihood that econom problem are grow in other countri  which would slow one of the few bright spot in the economi   export  sinc our last meet  much has been written about the problem at the gses   concern with the viabil of the gses and potenti futur loss has contribut to mortgag rate rise despit our past eas  the weak economi  and diminish demand for mortgag   with financi institut show littl interest in lend to subprim or jumbo borrow  the increas cost for individu that qualifi for conform loan is like to weaken the one part of the hous market that had been relat resili to financi problem to date   for potenti buyer  higher interest rate and the likelihood that hous price will continu to fall provid littl current incent to purchas a home  while the job loss are provid an immedi need for some owner to sell their home   we need the hous market and hous price to stabil  which i had hope would occur in the second half of this year  but now it look as though it will be defer until next year  fall hous price have creat signific collater damag   liquid problem that began one year ago remain in play   the capit constrain financi institut that are forc to shrink their balanc sheet may pose a signific addit problem in the second half of this year  while mani of the largest bank that suffer signific loss last year were abl to rais addit capit fair readili  the capit loss on newli issu bank equiti may have reduc mani investor    appetit for provid new capit for bank until it is clear that the economi is recov   the fall nation hous price and problem in commerci real estat in some sector of the economi are now affect region and communiti bank institut  mani of which are unlik to get equiti infus and thus will be forc to shrink   a reduct in the willing to lend  as repres by the senior loan offic opinion survey  has often portend a reduct in credit to bank depend borrow   as we get a more tradit credit crunch compound the liquid problem  i am concern that credit will be less avail to consum and busi and further slow consumpt and busi invest  sinc the june meet  the stock market has fallen   percent  and with the number of larg financi institut experienc veri elev cds spread and stock price in the singl digit  the failur of one or more relat larg domest or foreign financi institut is a real possibl   in such an environ  the assumpt of annual equiti price rise   percent in the rest of this year and    percent in      as assum in the  book would seem to have some signific downsid risk   elev unemploy rate and a flat or slight fall trend in wage and salari inflat suggest an absenc of the inflationari pressur in labor market that would lead to rise inflat onc energi and food price stabil  these factor give me some confid that we will see core and total inflat in      close to   percent   sinc our last meet  labor market have been weaker than expect  and oil price and mani other commod price have fallen  in part as a result of the concern with a slow global economi   although total inflat measur are clear higher than ani of us would want  these read appear to be transitori respons to suppli shock that are not flow through to labor market   in fact  evid from the labor market would seem to indic that the downsid risk to the economi are affect labor market through job loss but are not creat an environ in which labor tri to offset suppli shock with higher wage demand   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   befor i begin  let me add my word of welcom to betsi duke  welcom governor duke back to the feder reserv system   i say    back    becaus she has serv excel on our board of director begin almost   year ago  she   s a fast friend and strong support of the feder reserv system   i   m delight that the long wait for her instal is over  and i look forward to work with her  but i don   t want ani of my compliment to her to be detriment to her effect    laughter  the fifth district economi has remain weak in recent week   manufactur and servic sector activ fell   real estat condit remain sluggish   labor market remain soft   export activ remain the bright spot  with report of sustain growth in outbound cargo at district port  in a new develop  howev  manufactur    expect for the veri near futur turn negat in our most recent survey   this is veri unusu   respond are typic relat op ist about thing six month from now   retail contact indic that the declin in sale broaden in juli in our survey  and there aren   t mani report mention the effect of tax s ulus check   price expect for both raw materi and final good rose in our juli survey  and some of those measur are at record high  at the nation level  my outlook for real growth is broad consist with the  book   s this  e   i expect sluggish growth to continu through the remaind of the year  with a pickup begin some  next year   hous is like to continu to be a drag  though a diminish one  until then   consum spend is like to remain subdu  and busi invest is like to moder somewhat   i expect payrol employ to continu to declin for a while at about the current pace   a pace that  as other have note  is quit modest relat to what we typic see in a recess   i think the most like outcom is for us to continu to skirt an outright recess   i think there is some risk of a broader and sharper contract   i believ the magnitud of that risk is modest  but it   s not neglig to me   busi invest could deterior  a risk that   s most promin in the nonresidenti construct sector that we discuss earlier   but this is a small compon of aggreg demand  smaller than hous  and given the natur of gestat lag in this sector  i think a downturn is like to be gradual rather than abrupt   household spend probabl pose the greatest risk to growth at this point   consum spend has flatten out in real term  although that   s what one would expect given the increas in food and energi price that we   ve seen  given the difficulti of assess the extent to which tax rebat are prop up consum spend right now  we do not know how much q  consumpt is go to be affect by the s ulus roll off  potenti growth effect of credit constraint or financi headwind have gotten a lot of attent these day   i remain skeptic about the magnitud of the drag on consumpt and invest spend that credit market condit are like to creat   we have  of cours  seen report in the senior loan offic opinion survey of tighten credit term  but through june both c i and consum loan have continu to grow   i would note that we are hear in the fifth district concern from some of our smaller institut that some larg bank are bid aggress for deposit   this has been go on for sever month now  of cours   and as a result  the smaller bank are pay more to fund their loan   we   re also hear now   and this is a new report   of larger bank cut back on fed fund lend to smaller institut  no doubt out of a concern about possibl bank failur  what i think we   re see in bank market is more of a realloc of activ among bank   differ institut have been affect veri differ by recent event depend on the strategi they chose to pursu in the year preced this episod   as a consequ  intermedi is just shift from some institut to other   in fact  we   ve heard of bank pick up busi that other bank are shed   anecdot about particular bank cut back on lend thus need to be taken with a grain of salt  and i don   t think they   re necessarili repres of the bank sector as a whole   in fact  there was a realli egregi case in the new york  e of peopl not get credit from bank becaus of this credit crunch   in paragraph    one is introduc to their lead anecdot   a borrow at wachovia who was deni credit   in paragraph     we find out that he actual got credit two week later at this same institut   so i   m a littl skeptic about all of this anecdot evid about credit constraint   it   s undoubt the case that credit standard have tighten  but the environ is such that a lot of borrow have gotten genuin weaker  i mention all of this just becaus it influenc how i feel about argument that credit market condit make the current level of the real fund rate ani less meaning as an indic of the stanc of monetari polici   i just don   t find those argument convinc right now   the real fund rate use the  book   s forecast of overal inflat four quarter ahead is lower than it has been at ani  e sinc the     s   in fact  this measur is about     percentag point lower than the low it reach in      or       and i think this is to my mind a better way to measur the actual real feder fund rate than what   s plot in the bluebook  the  book forecast is that core pce inflat will rise to     percent for the second half of this year and then gradual subsid to    percent a year or so after that   this forecast is a veri riski path  i believ  becaus at ani point along that hump  higher inflat could well becom embed in expect   i think get back to price stabil after this episod is go to depend critic on the stabil of inflat expect  as mani of you have note   it is true that tip compens measur have been reason steadi for a few month and that wage rate show no sign of acceler as yet   but if we wait to rais rate until wage rate acceler or tip measur spike  we will have wait too long   i think that   s veri clear  and it will cost us too much to recov our credibl  accord  i believ that the biggest polici risk we   re go to be face in the month ahead is the risk of wait too long   in past episod of econom or financi weak  we   ve been unwil at  e to rais the fund rate until we were almost complet certain that econom recoveri would be sustain   i do not think that we can afford that luxuri at the present  e   the risk is too great that inflat expect will ratchet up again   we need to be prepar to rais rate even if growth is not back to potenti and even if financi market are not yet tranquil  and we need to be prepar to rais rate even if we think that we might have to revers cours   after all  we cut rate aggress even though we were not certain that a recess was in store for us and  in part  on the ground that we could revers cours if it prove that we cut too far  to insist on more certainti to rais rate than to reduc them would introduc a fatal asymmetri in our reaction function  let me add a comment or two inspir by some of the discuss around the tabl   i want to commend presid bullard   s discuss of system risk   you mention this earlier in your q a session  mr  chairman   this is a notori slipperi concept   in popular usag  it seem to mean an episod in which one bad thing happen follow by a lot of other seem relat bad thing happen  and as such  it   s a pure empir notion without ani content or use by itself as a guid to polici   it  sn   t say whether those other bad thing are effici   thing that ought to happen   or ineffici and prevent by suitabl polici intervent   to invok the notion of system risk to support a particular polici cours requir theori   i spoke about theori last night  but it requir some theori  some coher understand of the way you think the world work  the theoret literatur relat to system risk is relat young  and this isn   t the place to go into it   i   ve said befor that i think it would be use for this committe to learn more about this  the committe might be surpris that the literatur provid onli relat tenuous rational   i think is a fair judgment   for polici intervent   i hope  mr  chairman  that the group you   ve commiss to studi the mean of unusu and exig circumst can explor this terrain in a littl more depth   go forward  i think our deliber would be aid if we were to strive to put our theoret framework on the tabl when discuss how financi market work and what we ought to do about them  in case there   s ani suspens  for my own money   and this is just one man   s view   i haven   t seen a convinc case for the exist of polici relev market failur in the financi market in which we   ve interven  apart from the usual distort owe to the feder financi safeti net   we systemat expand that safeti net   i believ what we   ve done has been to subsid select borrow class and prop up price of various financi asset  and i think the problem we face now is the tremend depend of financi institut and market on our credit   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make just a few comment about the  book forecast at this point  which i found quit use for think about polici go forward onli in part becaus it is quit close  at least in broad overview  to the forecast i submit befor the june meet on the econom outlook  inflat  and so forth   in ani event  given the align in these forecast  i think there are sever characterist worth emphas   first  financi headwind persist   we have talk about this for quit a while   and the  book now assum more stress and more persist than it assum earlier   second  the inventori overhang in hous persist with negat implic for activ and for price in that sector   third  real growth is subdu over the next sever quarter at least   against the background of the  book forecast  growth over the balanc of this year in excess of   percent in real term would have to be consid a posit surpris   growth in excess of trend next year would have to be consid a posit surpris   final  with regard to inflat  headlin inflat abat after the current quarter  although overal both headlin inflat and core inflat remain abov   percent through       i realiz that there   s consider uncertainti surround all of that and that not everybodi share that assess  but i think it   s worth emphas those featur becaus we need to tri to think sever month and sever quarter ahead in term of the environ in which we will be make polici decis   if these forecast are at least in the ballpark   at the risk of perhap belabor the obvious   it seem to me that a major messag of those forecast is that the polici environ is like to remain signific challeng for sever more quarter at least   i could put that anoth way   it seem that evolv read on the economi and inflat are not like to line up appreci at all with either aspect of the dual mandat over the next sever quarter  thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  let me say that the tenth district probabl  on the whole  perform a littl better than the nation averag in the industri that we have  but in term of job growth  it has slow   at the same  e  we   re still ad job in the region  and our unemploy rate remain relat low compar with nation measur   although wage pressur actual do show some elev relat to our beig book survey  they have obvious eas a bit in recent month   but it   s interest that  as we talk and monitor the labor condit and we talk to some of the labor union  there is a great understand that they   re lose ground  they are go to begin enter contract at the end of this year and in the next year  and how they approach that is extrem import becaus  again  they are look and talk now about cost of live adjust and those sort of thing  which give me some paus   accord to our manufactur survey  our activ actual strengthen in juli  although the expect for futur activ have diminish somewhat   not surpris  manufactur produc energi and agricultur and in export relat market continu to oper at relat high level wherea the other area within the district are show some slowdown  let me talk just a second about oil   although oil price have declin  as was note  they are still high enough that capit spend and product remain elev and look to remain so in the forese futur   in fact  some of our industri contact suggest that  as long as expect price for oil remain in the     to     rang  there should continu to be a fair amount of invest in that particular sector   as you well know from read the wall street journal  we did have the semgroup go bankrupt in the tulsa area   it has had  i think  fair confin effect   one of our region bank took some pretti heavi loss   they   re veri well capit and did recapit some of it  so they   ve not been dramat affect by it   local produc are in the worst bind becaus they haven   t been paid for some of the oil deliv and there   s no other parti to contract with for futur deliveri   so that has brought a lot of uncertainti in the local area about where to provid some of this oil that they   re produc  in my discuss with busi around the district  it   s interest that there   s a lot more convers about and focus on manag your price strategi in this environ   as has been true for a while  fuel surcharg are preval  and firm are abl to pass those along with a fair amount of eas   in addit  busi are report that materi supplier are place    day to    day  e limit on their price quot   final  most price index in our manufactur survey remain near histor high level  and plan for futur pass through have actual intensifi  turn to the nation outlook  my outlook for growth has not chang materi sinc the last meet   i expect that growth will slow in the second half becaus of these higher energi price  some weak in the labor market  and sluggish activ in some of the manufactur sector   the fact is that the uncertainti regard the econom outlook is consider  and downsid risk to growth in the near term futur is there   these risk are be address  from our perspect  by our current stanc of accommod monetari polici   so we are address that uncertainti   the point i would like to make is that i   m less uncertain about the outlook for core inflat   we have seen eros in longer term inflat expect  and i believ inflat risk have actual risen   if core inflat rise in the second half as expect  there is a real possibl that inflat expect will becom unanchor  especi if we maintain our current accommod stanc of polici   an expect level off of food and energi price and slack in the economi could help moder upward pressur on inflat  but i do not think they will be enough to actual bring inflat down to an accept level   in fact  if we maintain the fund rate at   percent  i think inflat is more like to move higher than lower over the medium term  and that concern me   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   like the  book  our modal forecast show weaker real activ and slight higher core inflat over the forecast period  downsid risk to growth remain substanti  in my view  and have probabl increas relat to what we thought in june   risk on the inflat front remain weight to the upsid  perhap somewhat less than in june  but this is hard to know with confid   the advers growth risk are wors for sever reason   the labor market and labor incom are weaken more quick than expect   although there were some tentat sign of stabil of hous demand in the spring  demand seem to have fallen further sinc   credit condit are tighter and are expect to be tighter longer  and this seem like to produc a further deterior in overal demand   note  of cours  the reduct in credit for auto  the rise in mortgag rate  and the more conserv lend standard for consum and corpor credit   growth outsid the unit state seem like to slow further   of cours  fundament to this dynam  as has been true for    month  each shift in percept that the bottom in overal econom growth is further away produc addit stress for financi institut and market  ad to the intens of prospect financi headwind and to concern about downsid risk to growth  now  the advers tail on the inflat front remain signific   mani measur of under inflat suggest a broad base  if limit to date  acceler in the rate of under inflat   market  and survey base measur of long term expect are high   survey suggest that firm are abl to pass on some part of the acceler in energi and materi cost   on the more posit side  energi  commod  and materi price have declin signific  princip it seem becaus of expect of slower growth in global demand   growth is moder signific around the world  and it   s go to have to moder further in the most popul part of the world as central bank there get monetari polici tighter  the growth of unit labor cost has been and is expect to be veri moder here   profit margin still show plenti of room to absorb cost increas  and as   remind us  you can have a relat benign outlook for the path of core inflat without margin narrow veri dramat   inflat expect have not deterior meaning here  even with the flatter expect path of monetari polici in the unit state   of cours  it   s veri import that inflat expect and price power moder from current level   if some of the downsid risk to growth materi  this will happen  and inflat risk will moder   if  howev  the economi continu to prove to be resili to these downsid risk  then we will face higher inflat   on balanc  the rate of growth in under inflat suggest that growth in demand in the unit state will have to be below potenti for a longer period of  e if inflat expect are to come down suffici   this mean that we will have to tighten monetari polici relat soon compar with our previous behavior in recoveri   perhap befor we see the actual bottom in hous price and the actual peak in unemploy  howev  at this point  the risk to real growth remain critic   in my view  we need to have more confid that we have substanti reduc the risk of a much sharper  more protract declin in growth befor we begin to tighten   i think it is unlik that we will be abl or will need to move befor earli next year   short term market expect for monetari polici in the unit state seem about right at present   i don   t see a strong case for tri to alter those expect in either direct at this point   to tri to pull forward the expect tighten would risk ad to the downsid risk to growth and magnifi the risk of a much more sever financi crisi   on the other hand  if we avoid some of these downsid risk to growth  then polici will need to tighten more quick  perhap  than the expect path now price in the market  the evolut of monetari polici expect and of inflat expect sinc may illustr how uncertain the market are about what path of polici will be appropri   but the pattern of chang in both of these measur of expect suggest that the market believ we will get this balanc right   that we will do enough soon enough to keep under inflat expect from erod materi   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like other around the tabl  i made onli small revis to the central tendenc of my forecast go forward as a result of the develop of the intermeet period  mayb a slight reduct in the path of output and a quicker declin in headlin inflat owe to the oil price   but i think more import than ani shift in central tendenc is the sens that the inform tend to reinforc   to reduc the uncertainti around   the basic contour of a project in which the economi oper with a wider output gap and a lower inflat rate on balanc over the next    month or so than it has over recent quarter  about the output gap  the incom inform strong suggest that we are on a trajectori that at least for some  e will have the economi grow appreci below the growth rate of it potenti   the most obvious evid is the persist of a soft labor market   continu declin in employ and no sign of near term strengthen in the initi claim data   i agre that the declin in employ  as sever of you have point out  are not consist with a recess  but they   re certain not consist with the economi grow close to it potenti   you need anoth         or         job rather than minus         which is where we are now   so i think the economi is like to grow below potenti for some  e  even on the spend side  the declin in consumpt in june  when rebat check were continu to hit bank account  and a further sharp drop in auto sale in juli might be earli sign that household are begin to pull back under pressur from higher energi price  job worri  declin hous valu  and reduc credit avail   to be sure  one month   s consumpt data along with auto sale  which are subject to all kind of idiosyncrat influenc  are not enough to justifi a major chang in outlook   but as presid   note  household spend has for some  e been a sourc of downsid risk to the forecast   at some point  household spend could begin to reflect attitud  and this inform at a minimum seem to underlin those risk as well as to point to sluggish growth of spend in the third quarter  soggi econom news has extend to our trade partner  where actual activ and expect activ also have been mark down   the tone of news from abroad has been decid downbeat  as those economi feel the effect of weaker purchas from the unit state  continu financi strain  soften hous market  and higher energi price   much as in the unit state  attitud abroad seem weaker than the data  but the euro area did report a record declin in retail sale in june this morn  and my sens is that our trade partner are face larger downsid risk to growth as well as a markdown of central tendenc   the dollar hasn   t chang much on balanc for four or five month now   with a stabl dollar and weaker demand abroad  product in the unit state will be get a lot less cushion from net export over the next few quarter than it did in the first half of the year  final  despit the downward movement in treasuri interest rate and in the expect feder fund rate path  financi condit for household and busi have tighten sinc the last fomc meet   saver and intermediari have becom even more cautious amid concern about deepen loss spread beyond subprim mortgag  about the safeti of uninsur deposit at region bank  high volatil in market  and the possibl weaken of the under macro situat   lender are hunker down to endur a long period of rise credit problem and great uncertainti   i don   t think we need to reli on anecdot here   mortgag interest rate have actual risen on balanc  as have corpor bond yield across mani risk categori  and in mani of these case  the nomin interest rate are at least as high as or in some case much higher than they were last august when the feder fund rate was at      bank continu to tighten term and standard for near all categori of loan   equiti price have fallen  ad to the downward pressur on wealth from declin hous price  and i think these develop underscor the veri slow recoveri like in financi market and the possibl downsid risk relat to even that veri gradual improv that mani of us were expect   the tighten of condit is damp credit growth broad defin and will constrain  at least to some extent  spend go forward  delay the return to trend or abov trend growth  thus although uncertainti remain quit elev  i think we can be a littl more confid that the economi will be subject to further quarter of below trend growth and declin resourc util   furthermor  with hous price still fall fast  inventori of home still high  and financi market quit skittish  the downsid risk even to a slight lower central tendenc forecast remain high   greater confid that output will grow below potenti for a  e contribut to a littl more op  on my part that inflat will  inde  come down substanti over the come quarter   an environ of rise unemploy and declin capac util is not one in which busi or labor will find it easi to restor real incom or rais profit margin after the increas in energi price  with regard to that increas in energi and other commod price and how it affect headlin inflat  i like to differenti pass through from spillov   i think we can expect pass through   pass through to consum price of the higher energi and commod price is part of the adjust process by which demand get damp and by which consum realiz  unfortun  the lower real incom that they get from the advers term of trade   so the fact that busi are abl to pass through higher commod price and higher petroleum price i don   t find all that worrisom  provid that they   re pass through a one  e increas in price rather than a continu rise   i think we have some further evid that at least to date   thing could chang  i admit   what we are see is a pass through of a one  e rise rather than some continu increas   for one thing  commod price  as shown in bill   s chart  have flatten out or actual declin in the past few month   so presum that pass through is a one  e jump  if that   s what they   re do  pass through those price   second  i think we saw in the gdp chain type price index that the price of domest valu ad increas at an annual rate of onli     percent in the second quarter   which suggest to me that  at least through the second quarter  there was veri littl spillov from these higher commod and energi price to the stuff we produc here at home  also  labor compens growth  which could be a lag indic  at least to date hasn   t increas   if anyth  it has slow a littl further  which along with relat robust product growth is hold down unit labor cost   headlin inflat   the good and servic that peopl purchas   has been high   energi price are be pass through  but i think to date there   s no evid or veri littl evid that it   s spill over into other price in the economi   so this is about the adjust to relat price   obvious the declin in oil price  if it hold  will be help on the inflat front  both in it direct effect on headlin inflat and it indirect effect on inflat expect   we final have evid of two way risk in oil price  and that should make us more comfort with an assumpt of stabl price as a reason basi for forecast  other recent contributor to higher price level have also becom less avers   as i mention  other industri commod price have level out or declin  and the dollar has been relat stabl in recent month  although i feel a littl more confid about the expect of lower inflat go forward  i agre that upsid risk still prevail   core inflat has tick up   headlin inflat will be high for some  e and could threaten to spill over through increas in inflat expect  oil and commod price declin are larg an endogen respons to percept of weak growth  and if those percept turn around  so will those price   longer term inflat expect remain elev by some measur and are probabl less well anchor than they were a coupl of year ago  befor oil and commod price rose so much   in sum  i see upsid risk to both the inflat gap and the output gap as have diminish over the intermeet period  and we   ll get to the implic of that for polici in the next part of the meet
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i have no materi chang to report in my view on the overal state of financi stabil  growth  or inflat  but as i talk about at the last meet  it still is like to be a long  hot summer  and we   re onli about half over with it   i   ll talk first about financi institut   make mayb four or five point   and then turn quick to the economi and inflat  first  on financi institut  i think the bodi blow that the financi market and the real economi have taken becaus of the turmoil at the gses is not complet   it is easi for those of us in washington to forget that bill sign don   t alway solv problem   i   d say  if the last thing that happen on gses is that the bill was sign two week ago and action isn   t taken in the come week and month  then i would be surpris if we could get through this period without more gse turmoil find it way onto the front page   second  in term of financi market condit  the fall in oil price and the rest of the energi complex is  inde  good news  but it strike me that it has camouflag an even tougher period for financi institut than would otherwis be the case  that is  financi institut somehow look a littl more resili  but i think part of that is onli becaus of the negat correl that   s develop in recent  e between equiti price of financi and oil price   the financi institut themselv strike me as be in wors condit than market price would suggest  third  capit rais  as we have long talk about  is essenti to the fix among financi institut   the way i best describ capit rais over mayb the last nine month is that the first round of capit rais  which was in novemb and decemb  was realli the vaniti round   this consist of veri limit due dilig  sovereign wealth fund sign up  issuer reli upon their vaunt global brand  and capit be rais in a matter of day   the second round probabl took us to the spring  a round that i   d call the confession round    laughter   in this round  financi institut said     oh my  look at these real write down that i have   look at the need for this real capit rais  and here i   m tell you  the investor  all that i know      but the second and third confess usual have less credibl than the first   the third round is the round that we   re in the middl of  which i think of as the liquid and recap round  like to be the hardest round to pull off   it is like to forc issuer of new share or of new form of prefer stock to be ask of themselv and their investor the toughest choic   they have to assess the strength and durabl of their core franchis   i think that this will be happen in veri real  e  so the circumst of an invest bank that bill mention at the outset i don   t think will be the sole case of this   this liquid and recap round is later than would be ideal from the perspect of the broader economi  but it is absolut need   until we see how it occur  it   s hard for me to be much more sanguin that the capit market or the credit market will be return to anyth like normal any  soon  let me make a fourth broad point about financi institut   becaus of these differ phase of capit rais  i think manag credibl among financi institut is at least as suspect as it has ever been dure this period   even new manag team that have come in have in some way use up a lot of their credibl   it would be nice to believ that they have taken all action necessari to protect their franchis and their busi  but most stakehold are skeptic that they   ve taken signific or suffici action   at the end of the day  no matter where polici come out in term of regulatori polici from the fed and other bank regul or account polici from the sec or fasb  it strike me that those chang in polici are less determin of how thing shake out   that is  manag credibl is so in question that the cure is not like to come from account rule or regul but from the market    believ that what manag say is what manag believ and will act on it   as a result  i think that mani of these financi institut are oper in a zero defect world  which is pose risk to the real economi  fifth  let me make a final point about financi   we   ve all talk a lot about the effect of differ curv for hous price on the financi institut themselv   i don   t mean to give short shrift to ani of that  but i would say that the level of uncertainti and associ risk of their non hous relat asset are now veri much a focus   accord to juli      data  of credit current be extend by bank  onli about    percent is for residenti real estat   onli about   percent is for consum credit   so that leav the balanc in area where these financi institut and their manag team have to be ask themselv whether the weak that are emerg in the real economi will place uncertainti over asset that have noth to do with hous   that   s a major downsid risk for financi institut and has not been much of a focus of sharehold and stakehold concern  there are two open issu that will guid some of our think  at least with respect to these credit market   first  as we talk about a littl last night with the presid  are the embed loss so great at such a critic mass of institut with manag credibl so low that mani more than current expect might be unabl to surviv   this is a question that i   m not sure i know the answer to   second  despit the concern about the effect of the credit market on the broader economi that i talk about  our monetari polici may not be terribl well suit to be fix those problem  and financi institut may not be terribl sensit to the extent we decid that we should chang the stanc of polici  take all that into account  let me say a coupl of word about growth and inflat   first  on the econom growth front  given my view of what   s happen in the credit market  it   s veri hard for me to believ that the economi will get back to potenti any  soon   there are continu financi stress that could last through year end  and in there could be an upsid surpris   still  all thing consid  my base case has second half growth still abov staff es  owe in part to the product we   ve seen in recent month and the remark resili of this economi   if we look beyond that horizon  though  toward the  book forecast in      and beyond  i must say i don   t realli see the inflect point to take us back to econom growth of     percent or whatev the  book suggest   i think we   re go to be in this period of below trend growth for quit some  e   my own view is that  when the congress come back after it august recess  we will be in the middl of a big debat on    son of s ulus    and that the s ulus probabl have move up quit materi   howev  it is not at all obvious to me that it will do much in term of help the real economi   outsid the unit state  i share the view of governor kohn  which is that i   d expect global gdp  particular gdp among advanc foreign economi  our major trade partner  to continu to disappoint  make the remark addit of net export growth to our own gdp like to dissip  turn final to inflat  my view is that inflat risk are veri real  and i believ that these risk are higher than growth risk   i don   t take that much comfort from the move in commod price sinc we last met   if that trend continu  then that would certain be good news  but i must say i don   t feel as though inflat risk have move down notic sinc we last had this discuss   the staff expect food price to continu to be challeng  that is certain my view   the staff also expect core import price to fall rather precipit   i   m a littl skeptic of that view   i think it   s possibl  but i don   t realli see the catalyst for that given what we see about chang in input price oversea and given expect of the dollar in foreign exchang market  so with that  i think that the inflat risk are real  and i   ll save the balanc of my remark for the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   we have now had the first anniversari of all the financi turmoil  and how have the market celebr   well  we have had freddi and fanni go down and need one of the largest bailout   we have had indymac go down   the second largest bank failur in u s  histori and perhap the most cost bank failur in u s  histori   i am talk just in nomin term  i haven   t actual done the real adjust   also  we   ve seen a varieti of widen risk spread   at the last meet i went on with my standard metaphor of the slow burn and said that thing could reignit  and i think we certain have seen a few thing reignit   i veri much agre with governor   with respect to freddi mac and fanni mae that  although legisl has been pass  the devil will be in the implement detail   simpli becaus the treasuri has the capac to do someth  it is not quit clear what it will do or be abl to do or how the market will respond to that   obvious  freddi and fanni have been realli the onli game in town for mortgag securit   the jumbo market have not been work   the subprim market is not there right now   so until and unless we can be assur that they will oper proper  they still have a lot of potenti for more flame come out  there are also a number of other reason that i am still concern about financi market be veri far from normal   one  refer was made to a studi that we have done here at the board that nelli liang is take the lead on   new york has also done a studi  i think they use veri differ method but came out with similar number   the studi say that larg loss are still to come and that total loss associ with the challeng that we have been see will be on the order of      billion   u s  and european financi institut have taken about      billion of write down   not all of those loss will be on financi institut    balanc sheet  but there certain are potenti more loss to come   not onli in mortgag  in leverag loan  and in commerci real estat but also in the consum part of the portfolio and potenti other part of the portfolio   a fragil is there  which has to be taken into account when we look at capit ratio   if you simpli look at report capit ratio  they are off their peak of a few year ago   howev  if you were to do a more thorough mark to market on a lot of differ piec of the portfolio or if you did have to liquid   even assum it wasn   t a broad fire sale but just one institut that had to liquid now and it had no further consequ for anyon els   s expect  which i don   t think is accur   you would see those capit ratio be in fact much  much thinner than they appear in an account sens  a number of peopl talk about the oi spread and said that thing seem to be at    basi point rather than at    basi point   well  that is true not onli in the u s  dollar but also in the euro and in  l   if you look to the forward market  that number is increas   it is not stay the same   it is go up quit a bit  to about    basi point over a year period for the dollar to     to     basi point in  l and in euro   that suggest a lot more challeng to come   so even if    is the new     it is still a major challeng go forward   that put a lot of pressur on bank to generat earn to make up for the write down and other challeng  in the old day  when you could financ yourself at    basi point  the institut were undertak a lot of activ that would allow them to generat a lot of revenu  even if they kept take hit in certain part of their portfolio   but when fund is at    e that  or     e that  or     e that  a lot of activ that onc were profit are not profit   the margin are much lower  and their abil to earn their way out of this is much  much more of a challeng   i think that is go to be even truer for the european institut   that is actual one area in which i see it as more like that an import shoe might drop  not just in the unit state but in a major european institut   european institut haven   t been as activ in rais capit  and there are more constraint on their abil to rais capit  given the way right issu work   i think that greater challeng are go to come in the european economi and that the ecb face greater challeng in deal with the increas inflat threat that they have there and worldwid  while be abl to provid some polici accommod  third  securit market have certain not recov   we have talk about that  the infrastructur invest that will be need for these to come back in term of data  contract certainti  et cetera is go to take a long  long  e   it is not clear exact how long  but it is clear that recoveri will not be right around the corner   that mean continu pressur on bank    balanc sheet independ of all the other capit issu   if they just want to continu on  they have to keep a lot of thing on their balanc sheet   one bright light  just in case you see noth posit  is that we were abl to put off some veri signific chang in account   fas     and fin    r    they were on a veri fast track to make chang that could have brought liter trillion of dollar of asset back onto balanc sheet and would have made it extrem difficult for securit market to work   that has been signific delay  and i think they will take a more balanc and measur approach   not onli has that been put off  but also the institut will have more  e to deal with it   but this pressur is real   the senior loan offic opinion survey couldn   t be more crystal clear on the challeng that are there and that are like to continu to be there   whi is that   well  as a number of peopl have mention  it is becaus of challeng on the heloc portfolio and on the option arm portfolio and uncertainti about a lot of other piec of the portfolio   so given my view  i am realli glad that the  book baselin has taken on board much more of what was previous a    delay recoveri    altern simul scenario  much in line with what presid  n mention  but i continu to see that the situat is quit brittl and that small pressur potenti can lead to larg and rapid respons   the    sever financi stress    altern simul in the  book is certain not my central tendenc one  but i think that we can   t dismiss it too easili becaus there still could be anoth   what i have now taken to call  sinc i chair the supervis and regul committe   flare up with one of my problem children   mani of you know the problem in your district  but there are a lot of problem  unfortun  in all the district and around the world   i hope no one will ever hear about the problem that my children are have  but some  they do come out   as governor   said  one way to tri to deal with those is through capit   it is becom increas difficult to do that   in the old day the account rule were such that you could take over an institut through so call pool account method  so you would not face an immedi write down of everyth to current market valu   one challeng we have with the institut that are like to be fail over  e is that these account standard are no longer avail  so it is veri  veri difficult to use the kind of method that have been use in the past by the fdic and other regul to avoid the indymac type of problem   it is quit possibl that we will be see more peopl queu up  and more peopl pull money out of account  even though they are insur account   there has certain not been a general drain from the bank system   there has been a recent shuffl  as presid   said   but it also make a lot of institut much  much more vulner than they have been in the past  if you look at the    sever financi stress    scenario in the  book  what is interest about it is that it is relat benign   for someth that is sever stress  the macroeconom outcom in term of gdp and unemploy aren   t that sever becaus of the polici respons   take the feder fund rate down to   percent   i don   t think we can possibl do that in the current environ   it is not that i think that inflat expect have becom unanchor or are not contain  but i do think that our polici respons are contain precis becaus we can   t quit go there   if you look at the    inflationari spiral    scenario  it say that by      the fed fund rate would have to go up to     percent   i don   t think we are in that or anywher close to that   but if we had to respond as the  book said to bring the fed fund rate down below   percent  i think we would get close to that  and we would be in a veri  veri difficult posit  we have to be veri care about inflat expect   i think we have mix evid on inflat expect and inflat  although i am hearten that thing do not seem to have becom unanchor   some of both the market base measur and the survey base measur have come down a bit  although i think  as governor kohn said  that the situat is much more fragil   i don   t want to take on board too much comfort from the chang in commod price becaus we have seen temporari movement up and we have seen temporari movement down  it is hearten  but i think we have to still be veri  veri care on this issu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor    your swan song   laughter
well  i get one more chanc in the polici round   that is the one i am go to realli go for   i am sure that peopl are wait for it    laughter   my modal forecast has not chang appreci   clear  i am veri concern about the headwind as a result of the difficulti in recapit financi institut  which governor   talk a lot about  as a result  i think that we are go to have subpotenti growth for quit a period of  e  howev  the bigger concern is that i see downsid risk as have risen substanti   so let me first talk about the thing that are the less worrisom downsid risk   i think there are increas downsid risk just on the real side of the economi   in particular  the consum has been veri resili  but i am not as sure that that will be true in the futur   we just saw terribl auto sale   it could be just one month  and it could bounc back up   but it could be a precursor to much bigger problem  which would not be complet surpris given some of the other thing go on with hous price and credit restrict   that is one downsid risk   the second is that european growth may have shift down  and so the kind of problem that we are experienc here perhap are be experienc there  particular in term of lower hous price in some part of the euro zone   that could mean less demand for our export  and it would be anoth negat for econom activ   the third is that we have actual seen a backup in mortgag rate  and that can have a direct effect on hous demand   it is pretti grim when you look at what is go on in term of hous start  but it could get wors   it can   t go below zero  but it could get wors  so if that were all there was  i would say that there may be a littl increas in downsid risk  but it wouldn   t frighten me   but i realli am veri worri about the potenti downsid risk in the financi sector   i have to disagre veri strenuous with the view that  becaus you have been in a    financi stress    situat for a period of  e  there is no potenti for system risk  in fact  i would argu that the opposit can be the case   just as a remind  rememb that in the great depress  when   i can   t use the express becaus it would be in the transcript  but you know what i   m think   someth hit the fan   laughter  it actual occur close to a year after the initi negat shock   in this particular environ  we have to think about where we start   we were veri lucki that this financi disrupt occur when bank balanc sheet actual were in veri good shape initi   you know  thank our lucki star that it happen at that point  we are now a year into this   bank balanc sheet do not look veri good  for all the reason that we have been discuss   in fact  they look pretti grim   we have had some failur  and we are concern about other failur   so we have a veri differ environ   in that situat  if a shoe drop   and we have had big shoe drop  we had bear stearn  we had the gses  and we had smaller case like indymac   and if financi system are in a veri weaken state  realli bad thing could happen   i think that there realli is a serious danger here   in particular  we could have a dynam through a declin in demand for hous becaus of the backup in mortgag rate or other reason lower hous price and that spill over into the financi system in term of rais credit spread  which then lower demand  and we could get a nasti  vicious spiral   it is exact one of these advers feedback loop that we are all concern about   so this is not off the tabl  and it veri much worri me   i will talk about the implic of that for polici later  on the inflat front  although i definit see upsid risk  i think they may have diminish just a smidgen   there is a question about how larg those upsid risk are   in term of my think about what drive the inflat process  it is expect about futur output gap and expect about inflat over a long period  not a short term period   i see absolut no evid that  in the last coupl of month  we have had deterior in long term inflat expect   if anyth  they have gotten a littl better sinc march   if you look at the number   and bill had it in his pictur   basic there was some ratchet up when the crisi first hit   i would argu a lot of that had to do with inflat risk  becaus there realli was increas inflat risk   there has been a slight movement up   mayb a tenth  mayb you could say two tenth   in expect when you look at forecast  i am veri skeptic of consum survey becaus  exact what behavior econom tell us  there is frame   if headlin inflat is high  short term inflat expect go up  which should happen  but long term inflat expect also go up   when headlin goe down  then they will come down   there was a nice littl articl from the san francisco fed in one of those littl letter deal on exact this issu  which came up with exact this conclus   i recommend that you read it  and the good news is that it take onli four minut to read becaus the articl are meant to be veri short   so i realli do not see that there has been deterior  and   i think that this is veri import   it is whi i stress the issu of the analyt framework for think about the inflat process and what monetari polici can do   we can   t control relat price  but we can do someth about long run inflat expect and expect about futur output gap  so i haven   t seen a problem late that there has been deterior in long run expect   what about output gap   well  if anyth  they look as though they are expect to widen mayb a smidgen  not that much   we don   t have ani indic to expect that we will be overshoot in term of have output greater than potenti   again  that should not be rais inflat   it should  if anyth  mayb lower it a bit   final  of cours  oil price are lower   i don   t think that mean that they will stay low becaus the volatil is huge  but at least the fear that they are go to keep on go up and up and up   so it would not be a one shot chang but would be put into long run inflat   has  i think  diminish somewhat  so where do i stand in term of the upsid risk   there still is upsid risk becaus have high headlin inflat   have the potenti to spill over into inflat expect   all of us have that concern   but i want to emphas veri strong that it has not happen yet  i think that is veri import   i also think it is veri import to monitor this   one concern that member of the committe have is that we wouldn   t react fast enough becaus we have some  been inerti in the past   that is a serious concern   but i think there is a strong argument that  when you have veri big downsid risk to econom activ  you want to deal with inflat expect when they actual indic that there is some problem   and i just do not see that at this junctur   thank you veri much
thank you   governor duke
thank you  mr  chairman   i was advis to speak of thing i know  so all of my comment will have to do with commerci bank and the tradit bank oper within those bank   also  they are limit to the market area that i oper in   i was in a larg communiti bank   the primari competitor were   of the top   bank and   of the top    bank  i hope to expand that on the supervis committe  i guess the major observ i would have is that i can   t see lend growth ever resum until the market for financi stock improv   that market is not go to improv until it is clear that the credit risk is manag   i haven   t seen the confid in bank and bank institut this low sinc we were well into the s l crisi back in the earli     s   at the same  e  the credit number   or at least the commerci bank    part of the credit number   don   t look all that bad   at this point  we are share those credit loss with a number of other type of institut  and i think the bank got the better slice of that pie   so i do believ that the bank will be abl to manag through this  on the equiti side of thing  you have had equiti destroy through credit loss  and so those bank are certain reduc their lend   i don   t think there is enough capit in the system   i don   t think earn are strong enough   there is certain no extern capit avail to pick up that slack   so while you hear smaller bank say     we are get great busi now becaus the larger bank have cut back on their lend     they just don   t have the capac to take in that busi   no matter whi they are tri to rais capit  capit issuanc is view as a sign of weak   it is scarc   it is expens   the short sell has been just amaz   it has realli driven down the price   for some of the larger bank  it is run anywher from    to    percent of total float   it has even gotten down into bank smaller than    billion   i was look at one  and the short interest on juli    was     e that of april      it was run about   percent of float on a veri thin trade stock   i can   t believ that it has anyth to do with the fundament of the institut   it is just all be paint with the same brush  for institut that must rais capit or fail  my concern is that the capit that is be rais or be offer come with an exit strategi   i don   t think that the capit is go to have the patienc to wait for a longer term resumpt of lend   those that do have capit cushion seem to be spend them on small buyback or dividend increas in an effort to demonstr some confid in the futur  on the liquid side  central core fund is veri tight and incred uncertain   cd rate do remain high  and as one institut after anoth desper need money  they rais the rate   as one fall out of that situat  somebodi els pick it up again   after the full weekend of indymac coverag in the press  the phone just lit up everywher ask about fdic insur   now there is a renew interest in the cdar program   i didn   t realiz that these deposit are classifi as broker deposit   it will be interest to see if we have a big jump in broker deposit in the next coupl of quarter   the home loan bank are tighten their collater requir   they are introduc risk rate system  so that sourc of fund is not as avail as it was   nonconform mortgag are imposs to place  on the asset side  i talk to sever correspond banker  and they have been told to cut their overal fed fund line some  in half   it  sn   t matter who it is  just cut them in half   a number of the bank are cut home equiti line across the board and freez those line   the full relationship lend is prize  but even in that it is onli to the extent that lend is in some way self fund   transact deal are like hot potato  nobodi want to touch them  we had some call from other banker who were ask what liquid premium we were ad to our price  so there is clear a chang in the price  which may actual improv profit   howev  i think a lot of it is in order not to turn down the credit but simpli to price out the credit  so that the borrow make the decis not to borrow rather than the bank make the decis not to lend  on the credit side  the reserv addit have been incred dramat  but a lot of that is becaus reserv level were so low go into this   capit was strong  earn were strong  but reserv level were down at    or    basi point   i had not ever seen them below   percent until two or three year ago   that is becaus of the chang in the account for reserv as well as    year of no demonstr loss   odd enough  the charg off and delinqu rate realli don   t look all that bad   when i look at first quarter rate  they didn   t look a whole lot differ from what use to be the norm  at least in term of commerci loan   then  on the consum side  in this case it was mortgag loan versus consum loan  but still a    basi point loss on consum loan histor was actual normal  it is realli difficult to follow ani discuss of what is go on in term of credit loss becaus you get confus between what is mark to market loss  what is actual credit loss  what are charg off  what are reserv  and then who own those loss   i am not quit sure what the rate of deterior or the rate of resolut is   in term of collect  it take an aw lot of  e to ramp up collect and recoveri effort  and i don   t know where we are in that cycl  but i think we have a long way to go  the last cycl was all about commerci real estat  and nobodi could work up much sympathi for commerci real estat develop    laughter   in this situat  there is so much polit sensit around foreclosur that i think it is go to be much elong   when a borrow cannot or will not pay and you can   t restructur it to creat capac or willing to pay  then some form of forc sale is the onli thing that get you off go   i think that has been push out and push out   it is also the onli way to clear ani junior lien   this process is expens and  e consum  and own the properti is even more expens   so as the lender own properti becom a larger and larger segment of the properti for sale  i do think price declin are go to acceler signific  i will be watch the indymac resolut particular close   in the last cycl  if you will rememb  the properti that were sold by the rtc brought the biggest discount of all   so it will be interest to see what this theori of hold off on foreclosur and then at some later point have to move the asset actual   to price   the good news is that onc lender start sell  they do tend to move unit at whatev price it take   lender are go to have to do that   there is no justif for wast precious capit or liquid on dead asset   but there is also no justif for sell the portfolio at fire sale price if the net realiz valu of collect them is higher  and i think it definit is for the bank  final  if i could take one more minut  i did do some veri in depth person research on the hous decis of a reloc worker    laughter   i purchas a resid in januari       for a may       close and hit the peak   the current valu  i am told  is    to    percent of the purchas price  market  e   to    month   the purchas in the new locat   i did do the calcul   it was    to     e annual rent  but that didn   t matter   i had alreadi had all the thrill of ownership that i could stand and will be rent    laughter   the second thing is that  if i had financ this properti at    percent  i would have had no equiti to roll into a new purchas anyway  so there would have been no decis involv   the good news is that as long as there is no need to sell  the price  sn   t matter  and i could have wait it out veri easili   so the conclus that i came to is that this current elev inventori we have of hous includ onli those who absolut have to sell becaus nobodi in this market would choos to sell   so onc that begin to turn around  again  there just have to be a whole lot of pent up hous for sale  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   michell  what  e is our hard cutoff here
we can be pretti flexibl   we   re okay
you want it befor       though   all right   well  i spent a lot of  e through the meet and dure the break work up a crystallin summari of the discuss    laughter   but i am a bit concern about get to lunch and avoid the      hard deadlin  so if you would excus me  this  e i will just go direct to a few comment of my own  and then we can go to the polici round  we saw growth of about   percent in the second quarter  which suggest a campaign slogan for the republican     the economi   it could be wors       laughter   the question  though  is whether this higher than expect growth rate in the second quarter impli that we are actual look forward to a better than expect remaind of the year or whether this was in some sens a last hurrah of borrow from the futur   i feel that i am veri strong in the latter camp  unfortun   i do think that  for reason peopl have talk about  the remaind of the year and into next year are like to be quit weak   i don   t know how weak  but if you look at each compon of spend or compon of product  you see most veri negat indic  we have talk about consumpt   we know about all the fundament issu that are affect consum  and we have seen recent  i think both anecdot and in term of the data  some soft  particular in the auto area   in the labor market  sever peopl have note that the loss of payrol job has not been as rapid as  for exampl  in        the unemploy rate  though  has risen as quick as in previous episod  and ani look at the unemploy rate would suggest that this is someth close to a normal recess dynam  hous  of cours  remain veri uncertain   we don   t realli know when the bottom will be  although i would add  a point that i think bill   made  that there seem to be a grow confid that when we have reach the bottom in hous  whenev that may be  we will see a veri quick improv  both in the financi market and then  presum  in the economi as well   in other area  such as nonresidenti construct  architectur bill and other factor suggest slow there   we see slow in the other industri countri  although some strength is still in the emerg market   so just look at the tradit indic of growth and product  i think the best guess is for a slow second half  a slow begin of       and an unemploy rate that continu to rise from here  i do believ that the financi stress and it implic for credit avail are import in this whole dynam   i guess presid   and i keep talk past each other  but i don   t think that the feder fund rate is an adequ descript of the stanc of monetari polici   to give anoth exampl  in the past we have use money growth as an indic of monetari polici   if we use that indic  it would look quit differ   i think the appropri indic are the rate and term that are be face by the peopl make decis to spend in the economi   you can go through the entir list  and in everi case  as governor kohn suggest  the actual rate be face in the data by borrow are as high as or higher than they were last summer   mortgag  which are a particular sensit area  are of cours critic here  despit the declin in the feder fund rate  the spread between mortgag back secur and durat match treasuri is now about     basi point compar with     basi point last summer   in addit  for the spread between jumbo loan and conform loan  which in the past has normal been between    and    basi point  the offer rate is about     basi point  so there seem littl doubt   and we can check with governor duke about this   that  despit the lower rate on overnight bank lend  the rate that matter for econom activ are larg higher than they were a year ago   therefor  i don   t think it is evid at all that we are in a financi situat that is conduc to rapid  excess growth and inflationari increas a priori  now  go forward  of cours  a lot of what happen in the economi is go to depend on bank balanc sheet   i won   t spend much  e   in april  i talk about the staff   s es  of loss go forward   that has been updat   nelli liang is work with peopl in new york   the number are not too encourag under the baselin scenario  forget about the more sever scenario   the staff now project about      billion in loss for u s  bank and thrift in       and         that exclud invest bank   that exclud write down   if that occur  it would be about a   percent loss rate over the next two year  which would be abov the peak of      and        of cours  if the economi   wors  it would be even higher  relat to that      billion in loss  there are so far loan loss provis of about     billion  so it look as though we still have a long way to go in term of bank loss and write down  in addit  some of the biggest bank will take veri signific hit   this is veri preliminari  and i don   t want to make too much of it  but the preliminari analysi show that for five of the veri biggest bank  under a baselin scenario and look at the composit of their asset hold  their current tier   capit ratio will be reduc between    percent and    percent over the next two year   so there is a real concern about the avail of credit and about the cost of credit   i could go on and talk about a varieti of other area  includ the senior loan offic opinion survey  which suggest that credit will be a concern go forward  presid   and i have  i hope  respect   i respect him  and i hope he respect me  but we disagre also about presid bullard on system risk   i take his critic to be that it work in practic  but can it work in theori   system risk is an old phenomenon   there are liter dozen and dozen of histor episod that are suggest of that phenomenon   there is also an enorm theoret literatur   mayb it is not entir satisfactori  but certain mani peopl have thought about that issu   i  myself  have obvious work in this area  clear  it is not someth that we can tight explain in all aspect  but i do think it is a concern   we need to remain concern about it   although it is true  as presid bullard point out  that there is an accommod and a basi for anticip crise as we go forward  it is also the case  as i think governor   note  that after a year we are also face a situat of greater fragil  of much lower capit  and fewer shock absorb   those thing will make ani crisi that much more sever  should it occur   so overal i think there is still signific downsid risk to growth   i think the baselin of slow growth is right   i am hope that we will see growth restor earli next year  but i think it is veri uncertain at this point  on inflat  i do have concern  as everyon els     i think that the commod price movement we have seen are good news   they have been quit signific   besid oil price down about    percent and natur gas price down about    percent  sinc the last meet corn is off    percent  soybean     percent  and wheat     percent   those are not small chang  now  obvious  the level of price is still veri high   it has risen consider over the past year  we will continu to see that high level of price be pass through into the core  as governor kohn note  but i would argu that if   and this is a veri big    if      commod price do begin to stabil within the general rang of what we see now  i think that the inflat concern will moder over  e becaus they will have lost essenti their drive forc   we don   t realli have the condit to turn the commod price increas into persist inflat  absent continu pressur on that front and absent chang in inflat expect  of which there is onli limit evid at this point   so i want to be veri clear   i think that contain inflat is enorm import  and i think it is our first respons   we need to watch this veri care   i think there will be continu pressur even if commod price don   t rise  but i do think there is also a chanc that we will see a moder of this problem go forward  what els   i guess there has been a lot of discuss about the appropri withdraw of s ulus   again  i don   t think i accept the idea that we are current in an extrem s ul situat   howev  if financi market were to normal  for exampl  that would lead to a more s ul situat   i would like to say just a word about that   that is to say that the speed at which we remov the accommod   and i think it is clear we do have to do that relat soon   should depend to some extent on how inflat evolv   under the more benign scenario that i have just describ   if inflat   declin signific becaus of commod price   i think that we obvious have more  e   i would just note for comparison past episod   in       for exampl  the paus last    month  and the first increas in rate came two year after payrol began grow again   in       again  it was more than a year after unemploy rate start come down  and payrol began grow befor the rate start go up  now  i think there is a view  which is a reason one  that mayb in at least the second of those two episod we wait too long to begin to normal   that is entir possibl   but  again  it would be extraordinari if we were to begin rais rate without an immedi inflat problem with the economi still in a declin or extrem weaken situat   if inflat   in fact becom the problem that mani around the tabl think it is  particular if commod price begin to go up again or if the dollar begin to weaken  then i will be the first here to support respond to that   i do think it is incred import to keep inflat expect well anchor  particular to the extent that movement of commod price and the dollar seem to be deriv from monetari polici as oppos to thing like geopolit risk   then  i think we can   t treat them as truli exogen   we would have to respond to those thing   so i welcom the ongo discuss we should have about the pace of withdraw of accommod   i do think it depend veri much on how thing evolv  and i do think that our strategi should be to watch care and to make the right decis as we see the data come in  let me stop there and turn to the last round and ask    pleas  to introduc the polici discuss
thank you  mr  chairman   if you prefer  in the interest of  e  i can cut back my remark to focus just on the polici statement and not the general background   i will be refer to the version of tabl   includ in the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern     this version incorpor some small revis from the draft that was includ in the august bluebook   the tabl present two polici altern   under altern b  the committe would maintain it current polici stanc at this meet but in it statement would underscor it concern about inflat   under altern c  the committe would firm polici    basi point today and issu a statement indic that the action was taken to better balanc the risk to growth and inflat  the statement would be noncommitt about whether further rate increas were immin   the languag propos for paragraph   of altern b has been modifi a littl from that propos in the bluebook   most import  the first claus is now in the past tens  refer to econom growth in the second quarter  thus avoid an implic that the economi is continu to expand in the current quarter   in a chang relat to the june statement  export as well as consum spend are cite as factor that support growth   also  the sentenc begin with    over  e    has been move up from the risk assess paragraph   that shift is like to be seen as underscor a view that polici is current posit to fo  a gradual resumpt of moder econom growth  suggest that further eas is not like to be forthcom   that sens may also be reinforc by the omiss of the phrase    to date    after    eas of monetari polici      in paragraph    the inflat discuss for altern b give slight greater emphasi than in june to the committe   s inflat    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     concern  part by start with the flat statement that    inflat has been high    and by give less promin to the expect that inflat will moder   the slight chang to the final claus in paragraph   is propos for pure stylist reason   in paragraph    the first sentenc of the risk assess state that    although downsid risk to growth remain  the upsid risk to inflat are also of signific concern to the committe      while this sentenc   not provid ani explicit weight of the two risk and   not suggest that polici firm is immin  the statement as a whole probabl would be read as give a bit more emphasi to inflat concern and a bit less to growth concern than market particip now expect   thus  even though the absenc of a rate action today would be consist with market expect  the statement would like be view by market particip as a bit more hawkish than they anticip  and market rate could rise modest in respons   turn to altern c  concern about upsid risk to inflat could motiv the committe to begin firm the stanc of monetari polici at this meet   the first three sentenc of altern c  paragraph    are ident to those of altern b   howev  the final sentenc differ  part by indic explicit that the committe see the current stanc of monetari polici as accommod   also  by drop the phrase    over  e     which appear in paragraph   of the june version  the committe would suggest that it see moder econom growth as resum sooner rather than later   in paragraph    the committe would still note that inflat is expect to moder but  in the last sentenc of the paragraph  it would explicit cite the risk   and note it concern   that inflat might not fall as expect   final  the risk assess  paragraph    would indic that the committe firm polici today in order to better balanc the upsid risk to inflat and the downsid risk to growth   howev  the statement would avoid an explicit judgment about whether the risk were now balanc and would provid littl inform about whether further tighten was immin   even though the word of the statement for altern c would not indic that polici was now on a steadi firm march  market particip would like conclud that the firm process had been acceler consider relat to their expect   with the committe have tighten amid bad news about financi institut and in the immedi wake of the implement of a number of addit feder reserv liquid initi  investor would like conclud that the committe did not see financi stabil consider as rais a barrier to further polici tighten   they would view the committe as adopt a more aggress postur toward inflat   becaus it has been histor rare for the feder reserv to implement a one off tighten  investor would like see fair steadi rate hike over the cours of futur meet  and thus short  and intermedi term interest rate would  in all likelihood  move up sharpli after this action   yield on longer term fix rate mortgag might rise particular substanti  as premium for interest rate and prepay uncertainti increas and as mortgag investor hedg the increas in mortgag durat   such a develop could advers affect the price of financi asset that are close tie to hous market and mortgag perform   howev  yield on long term treasuri could declin  particular if market particip mark down their expect for econom growth and inflat
thank you   ani question for     presid
in term of the word in paragraph    if we do not rais rate  i am wonder whi the second sentenc that is now in altern c wouldn   t be more appropri for altern b  and i am wonder what your think is about that   in other word  if we don   t take action  that seem to be a more emphat statement than what you have current  assum no chang in rate      the committe expect inflat to moder later this year and next year     et cetera   wherea if we are tri to send a signal that we are realli concern and we do not chang rate  whi wouldn   t we have use     although the committe expect inflat to moder       the possibl that inflat may fail to declin as anticip is of signific concern      then  mayb take the word    also    out of the fourth paragraph   it just seem to me odd that if we act and describ the risk after act  the languag is even stronger   wherea if we don   t act and we want to emphas that we are remain vigil  whi wouldn   t we use that stronger languag   i am curious as to whi you chose the two or what you feel the tradeoff is there
i would say  presid    that the substitut that you are suggest seem plausibl to me  but i would also say that the first sentenc of altern b alreadi   suggest some pretti signific concern about inflat
all right   ani other question   let me start  then  with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern a   no chang in the fund rate and a balanc assess of risk design to leav market expect concern the path of the fund rate rough unchang   oop  i made a mistak  there is no a    laughter   so i propos to creat it by chang the word of the first sentenc of altern b  paragraph    to read     both downsid risk to growth and upsid risk to inflat are of signific concern to the committe      as it is current word  b    downplay the downsid risk to growth  which have intensifi sinc our last meet as the credit crunch has worsen and emphas inflat risk  which have moder slight as oil price have fallen   the assess of risk in altern b  as it stand  is unbalanc and   as   just point out and the bluebook   also   is more hawkish than the primari dealer and most market particip general expect  so it is like to shift the fed fund futur path and other interest rate upward  i see no case  at this junctur  for signal that we are like to adjust polici upward befor the end of the year   inde  there is a non neglig probabl  to my mind  that the next move will be down and not up   there is alreadi signific slack in the labor market  and with the economi expect to grow at a near recessionari pace in the latter half of this year  the unemploy rate is pois to rise further   this grow slack is work to contain inflationari pressur as evidenc by the stabil and low level of wage growth   i expect that grow slack will continu hold down wage inflat go forward   long term inflat expect seem relat well contain  and core inflat has been stabl for the past sever year   final  a major compon of the surg in headlin inflat   oil price increas   has final start to show some sign of revers direct   although the real fund rate remain quit accommod by the usual metric  we are clear not in a busi as usual situat   we are in the midst of a serious credit crunch that has  again  worsen dure the intermeet period  as exemplifi by the develop at freddi and fanni and the other thing that mani of you have point to in our last round   we are like see onli the start of what will be a seri of bank failur that could make matter much wors   given these financi headwind  it is not clear to me that we are accommod at all  i agre  mr  chairman  with the comment you just made on this matter  given my prefer for an inflat target of around    percent and equal welfar weight on the inflat and unemploy gap  i view the  book polici path and forecast as a rough op  trajectori to the attain of our goal   although core inflat exceed the level i consid consist with price stabil  unemploy also exceed the level consist with full employ   given our dual mandat and a forecast that envis a grow unemploy gap  coupl with declin inflat under the  book fund rate path  i see no case for jolt expect in such a way as to  in effect  tighten polici now   i feel especi strong about this in view of the major downsid risk to the economi from an intensifi credit crunch
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   a funni thing happen at my board meet the other week   i was all set to prepar them not for a rate chang recommend this  e but for one in the not too distant futur   by the  e i was done  they were ask what the procedur was for dissent from my recommend   so  in fact  they forward a recommend for an increas this  e around  you know  we can disagre over the inflationari consequ of a lot of this  but i think there is a messag from around the tabl and the public  our director  and whatnot  that they do feel that there is a concern about inflat   so i favor altern c  although i recogn the realiti of today   i am struggl with the fact that we lower the fund rate rather aggress  and thing have work out much better than we expect against the risk that we thought that we were face   we could disagre over that as well   i do take the point that uncertainti is veri high at the moment   but i think that we will need to increas rate sooner than current expect by market   we are count on a modest degre of slack and our credibl with the public to keep inflat and inflat expect contain while we leav rate on hold   but i am concern that there will be onli modest inflationari restraint from the slack that we see and that we may not be abl to convinc the public that they shouldn   t worri about high headlin inflat  i certain agre that bank balanc sheet were pretti good in       but i am concern that headlin inflat has been abov core inflat for quit a long  e   i am not sure our own balanc sheet would reflect that   so by follow a wait and see strategi  we are accept a larg baselin inflat risk   in addit  there is an enorm tail risk   that is  a return to much higher under inflat   also  i was a littl concern to see in the dealer feedback to the taf extens that some market particip think that we will not increas the polici rate as long as we keep the    unusu and exig    determin in place   i am not sure that is a good expect for them to have   fundament  it is my opinion that there has been a chang in the balanc of the econom rational and risk manag calculus that we use to lower the fund rate to   percent   it is not a huge chang  but i think there has been a chang   one year on  the economi has withstood the financi shock in a resili fashion  especi given the add on shock from oil   i don   t know what more we could have hope for from the vantag point of the fall of      and the loss that have been taken  i think the odd of prevent negat feedback loop that we took out the last    basi point of insur against are somewhat smaller than they were five to six month ago   part of our earlier logic to appropri lower rate to a decid accommod polici stanc was to guard against disord market condit that might perman damag our financi market infrastructur and destroy the financi capit stock in a real  product sens the way that i think presid   was allud to   but real forc have unmask dramat weak and fault in our financi system  and market will be evolv to a new intermedi structur  our polici can eas transit onli to a degre  but it cannot restor the previous financi status quo  nor should it be aim at do so  dure the transit  i would not be surpris if we revisit period of market volatil as the disadvantag player are repeat challeng to restructur to the new environ  counterparti are shi away from previous financi partner  in part becaus of uncertainti over the risk   return profil and the transit industri structur   these profil involv both liquid risk and credit risk   i think our lend facil allow a modest decoupl of the fed fund rate set to deal with this   in my view  the balanc of current risk call for increas the fund rate in the rang of     mayb     basi point within some reason short period of  e   if event chang import  i would certain advoc further adjust in either direct  depend on how those risk adjust   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   i would just note on the    unusu and exig    issu that there are two school of thought   the other school is the one you said  which is that have done this  we would have the freedom to rais rate  so i think it sort of cut both direct   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the interest of  e  i will be veri brief   i support altern b in substanc and concur with it word   i think we are in a delic rhetor balanc act at this stage  and as   describ  the slight greater emphasi on inflat is appropri at this  e   i think altern b has substanti captur the current situat and concern of the major of the committe  so i support altern b
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i appreci the fact that reason peopl may differ  and i do differ   in say that  i am not advoc a tight monetari polici   i am advoc a less accommod monetari polici   i recogn governor kohn   s point that relat price are adjust  and other have made that point   i think around that context is the fact that we are see a systemat increas in the price index  both total and core  and i don   t think we should ignor that   now  the core is creep up  but up nevertheless  and it is systemat in my view   i would feel more comfort that it was transitori if polici were not so accommod  which affirm the likelihood of further increas in inflat go forward  that is realli where i am focus  i guess is the way to say it  we introduc the polici that we have  as i think other mention  as an insur polici earli on  when we were more in an immedi crisi   i don   t negat or minim the tension that we are under  but i do think we have becom veri accommod in our polici with negat real rate   so here we are with this insur   we have this subpar growth   the subpar growth is not go to go away soon  so we are delay remov the insur polici   i worri about that   i think in the long run that   increas the risk of an inflationari problem of a sizabl magnitud later on   i know we have this immedi problem  but our role also is to take a long run view  and i think we would be wise to rais the rate now modest   it would still be an easi polici   the effect of that increas might be disturb to the market   on the other hand  it might actual give more confid to the market that inflat is go to come down becaus we are go to insist that it     i think there would be some good effect from that  so that is where i am come from on prefer that we move rate up slight at this point  thank you
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   i am go to make my remark a littl shorter here   my judgment is that the current situat is a difficult one for the committe  becaus of the veri appropri focus on financi market turmoil over the past year  our attent has natur turn away from keep the level of interest rate consist with longer term inflat object   this was done to avert particular extrem  but low probabl  outcom in which the economi would experi an especi sever downturn  as it turn out  the bad state did not materi  which i think will go down in histori as a success element of the committe   s polici over the past year   the abil to take on financi market turmoil of this magnitud and prevent it from do substanti damag to the economi   a recess of the magnitud of          let   s say   has been a real achiev   in that sens  all has gone accord to plan   at the same  e  we have move interest rate to a veri low level in the context of rise inflat and rise inflat expect   a sever downturn was unwelcom  to be sure  but it was also project to keep inflat in check   sinc that did not materi  we are left with low rate and an environ of cpi inflat run at   percent headlin  measur from one year earlier  and long term inflat expect creep higher  we face more risk now of creat a serious inflat problem than we have in a generat  to make progress  i think we should keep rate steadi today but with the plan of prepar market for an increas in rate at the septemb meet  condit of cours on incom data   this would be consist with altern b today  and with intermeet statement  it would move probabl mass toward higher rate through the fall and through the first half of        i have sever remark on a fall tighten campaign   first of all  move    basi point is by itself not like to have a larg effect on econom activ  nor   it bring the level of the feder fund rate high enough to have a meaning effect on inflat   the fomc start tighten in mid      but achiev a core cpi inflat rate below   percent in onli one month dure the entir three year period of             and        what the move would do is get the committe start on return interest rate to a more normal level  a level more consist with our inflat object   the committe could paus or even revers cours should particular advers data suggest that econom activ was weaken substanti   prepar for an increas in rate mean that we would be signal that financi market turmoil is no longer the paramount concern   on that  i think we can reason stress that we have provid accommod over the past year in the form of lower interest rate and innov liquid facil   we have bought  e for financi firm to repair and adjust   while all is not as it was  we do not want to creat an inflat problem in the aftermath of a shock of this magnitud  which may actual compound the situat and make it wors  longer term inflat expect have been creep higher  a fact that has been wide cite in commentari on monetari polici   i would like to stress that  in my view of a well function inflat target regim  these inflat expect would not be move at all  short term interest rate would be move higher and lower in respons to shock to the economi  and inflat expect would never move   this would reflect the confid that the central bank   s short term interest rate adjust were be accomplish in just the right way to offset disturb buffet the economi   becaus of this  i prefer not to interpret observ movement in inflat expect as evid of what we should or should not do with respect to interest rate   the short term interest rate would have to move to offset the shock to the economi even if longer term inflat expect never move   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i support keep the feder fund rate at   percent for now   i think that is consist with bring inflat down over  e   i agre that we   re go to have to tighten at some point   i agre with your analysi  mr  chairman   i don   t think we have a high accommod polici right now   not onli would i cite the interest rate that you cite  but i would cite the behavior of household and busi  which aren   t act as if they   re look at veri low real interest rate by make purchas of durabl good  capit equip  et cetera   the cost of capit is not perceiv to be low right now  and i think it   s for the reason you cite  in my view  over the intermeet period the inflat risk have narrow just a bit   the damper on inflat risk come from the declin in oil and commod price  the steadi of the dollar  and my percept that we can count on a more negat output gap go forward  which will provid some disciplin on price and wage   this is a difficult situat   there are no ideal outcom when you have this chang in relat price   we will have to live with higher inflat and higher unemploy temporarili   we have to keep our eye on the second round effect  not just the pass through but the spillov  and i think so far so good   that   s a tenuous situat  i agre  but my read of the incom inform is that we can be a littl more patient than we thought we could be six or seven week ago  as for the word of the statement  i could live with presid     s reword  but i think that this languag   suggest is okay as well   i   m actual not sure how the market will react to this   some of the commentari i read over the last coupl of week thought that we were tilt toward inflat last  e becaus of the way we word thing   i don   t think that the market reaction will be larg to this  and i agre that the first choic would be not to chang market expect substanti   i think they   re align pretti well right now  but i think the reaction will be small  and i can live with the altern b word   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   as i indic in the earlier go round  i found the balanc of risk to econom growth and inflat to be essenti the same   so other thing be equal  i might prefer to have risk assess languag that is even more balanc than the risk assess languag that is present in altern b   but i have a tactic reason for want to see word that express a stronger concern about inflat risk   i do  as i said earlier  expect inflat to worsen befor it improv   in particular  as we have been discuss  the core statist are like to worsen notabl dure the next sever month  and i could just shrug those wors number off becaus i have a project that call for those number to improv by earli next year   but i   m not confid that the public will shrug them off   as we have been talk about  the cost of longer term inflat expect drift up is larg   i believ that we can influenc those expect  and i think it is import that we do let the public know that we are serious about open the door to a rate increas if that becom necessari   we need the flexibl to move nimbl  and i think the languag that is contain in altern b put the market on notic   i think altern b enabl us to hold our present strategi of watch wait  but it   call somewhat greater attent to inflat risk than we express at the conclus of our last meet  so i find both the strategi and the languag of altern b to be quit appropri for the circumst we face today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b and the languag as display here   let me say a few word about the issu of withdraw of accommod  which i   ve been give thought to and will want to give more thought to over  e   earlier today i talk about the  book forecast and indic that i found it credibl   but anoth virtu of it  even if you don   t find it that credibl  is that the card are on the tabl   i mean  it has a path for the feder fund rate   it has a path for the foreign exchang valu of the dollar and so on and so forth   two of the key element  as i indic earlier  are  at least over the near term to intermedi term  that real growth is subdu and that headlin inflat abat after the current quarter  and i think that   s relev   given the current stanc of polici  i think we are well posit for that subdu pace of real growth   inde  even if we get contract for a quarter or two  i would argu that we have mayb not entir but larg alreadi address that  on the inflat side  it seem to me that the key part of that forecast is the diminut of headlin inflat start in the fourth quarter   what that mean as a practic matter is that in novemb  decemb  and januari  when we get those data  we   ll get confirm that it is either happen or it   s not   now  assum that there are no major  decis surpris between now and then   and that may be heroic   we   ll get confirm of whether that inflat outlook was the accur one   if we do  then it seem that the path of the fund rate inher in the  book look as though it could be accept   if we get disappoint on headlin inflat for whatev combin of reason  it call into question  at least in my mind  that path for the fund rate  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for my part  our exchang have in the past been predic on noth but the utmost respect   i expect that to continu   if i have done anyth or said anyth to contribut to ani other impress  i regret it  and i apolog
that wasn   t my intent  presid
in the interest of avoid talk past each other  let me say a bit about whi i view real rate as low   i recogn what you and governor kohn said about other interest rate   but when i look at the low real rate now and at  e in the past when it has been low and i look at thing like corpor borrow rate then  they didn   t fall near as much as the fed fund rate   if you plot them by line up the nber date  it  sn   t look as though what   s happen now with those borrow rate is out of line with past experi   so if we think now that real rate were low in        i   m led to conclud that i ought to think that they are low current  anoth way of say this is that spread alway go up in recess   we drive real rate down in recess   if consum and busi were spend with frenzi now becaus of low rate  to me that would be a reason that we have to rais them  get them up right away   you know  my sens of the econom of whi we push real rate low in recess is that the state of aggreg demand need it   it   s exact when consum and busi spend is sort of moribund that we have real rate low   i   m not sure that the fact that it   s moribund tell me whether they   re low or not relat to where they ought to be   that   s how i think about that evid  but i look forward to be enlighten further in the futur on this
you rais a good point   that we ought to look empir at the relationship between borrow rate and the feder fund rate in this episod and other episod  which we realli haven   t done   so we need to do that   thank you
i   ll dispens with the rest of my prepar remark and just say that i recogn the real risk ahead of us   we   ve experienc sluggish growth  and all the downsid risk to growth that have been enumer are veri tangibl and veri plausibl right now   i think we should hold off rais rate at this meet  but i   m veri concern about the inflat risk   i find myself lean toward a tighten campaign earlier rather than later  and i   d like to see the statement do what it can to prepar market for that   i like the first version of altern b  the one without the word    also      i think    also    damp the concern about inflat   it kind of make it a littl too balanc for my tast   i   m also concern   i should say    broad       that we seem to have left the impress over the past sever month  sinc the begin of the year  that our concern about inflat fluctuat   i agre with presid bullard   what we ought to view as ideal is an equilibrium where inflat expect are rock solid and don   t chang and  moreov  that peopl don   t perceiv our concern and worri about inflat or the weight we   re give in polici deliber as shift from  e to  e   so that   s an aspect of our communic that concern me   thank you  mr  chairman
i support altern b   i would actual prefer presid     s languag but definit believ that we should have the word    also    in there   tighten at this  e would sap more strength from an alreadi weak economi  and should the forecast look like the    sever financi stress    scenario or the    typic recess    scenario  it would be extrem poor  e   if the data indic that inflat is not eb as i expect and the economi is on a surer foot than i fear  then it would be appropri to begin what is like to be a seri of increas in the feder fund target   but the data to date don   t indic that  so i support altern b
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i   m alreadi out of the closet in term of my econom procliv   i realiz it   s awkward for some folk  but i haven   t heard enough today that would chang my view that we are run an over accommod monetari polici   i agre with your point veri much that the rate and the term be face by those who drive the economi count   as to governor kohn   s point that some of these key rate have not come down  i think that has more to do with risk premium  and i hate to see it migrat toward inflat premium  which i believ is a signific risk   i   m obvious driven by what i hear from my contact  although i respect the analyt you mention  governor     my long run think is as condit by global as it is by domest polici  and i just still have a great concern about the wage   price spiral that   s take place in some of our manufactur center in the develop countri  i think it would be wise  just to shift my analog here and think in canin term  to take a newspap across the snout and call for a    basi point increas   we   re alway talk about tighten at some point   i think it just becom increas difficult to take that first step   i grant you that the economi is weak   the financi situat is brittl   that hasn   t chang in my view  but the inflationari behavior pattern that i   m begin to hear about reinforc my concern about an updrift in the core and the headlin data   so i apolog  it perhap is be a littl too strong to say that we   ve becom unmoor or that mayb we are no longer anchor   i think that is nonetheless a real percept   i   m go to vote against altern b and for altern c   i may be a minor of one  but perhap i   ll be a sea anchor  if you understand the sail analog here  and assist the process of our commit to be focus on inflat as a risk just as we focus on downsid risk to growth   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as you can imagin  as we   ve discuss  this meet present a difficult polici posit for us   and for me in particular   i think we must pay care attent to the financi market volatil  and to the extent that it has consequ for the real economi  i   m certain sensit to that concern   i had a similar experi with my board of director that presid   did   i went into my board recommend no chang and got consider push back in discuss about how we dissent and what the consequ of do that are   they are concern about inflat  and i   m concern about our mandat to keep longer term and intermedi term inflat in check  we   re unlik  in my view  to get confirm or convinc evid about whether expect have becom unanchor until well after the fact   i agre there has been veri littl wage   price pressur to date   but that will be the last shoe to drop in this sequenc of rais expect  and by the  e we get to that  i   m afraid it will be too late   i think in the near term we might see some relief in headlin inflat  but as has been discuss  whether that will persist is high dubious  my real concern is that i believ that monetari polici is accommod  and with all due respect  mr  chairman  when i look at the data compar the level of borrow rate of consum and busi  both the level in real and nomin term and the spread  what we see in this period look remark similar to what we   ve seen in lot of other recessionari  slow growth period   so  again  follow the analog that presid   was use  i see this period as less atyp and more typic of what we see in slow growth period   i think it   s import that we begin to prepar the market for an impend shift to a tighter polici   i agre with presid hoenig   the request here is not for tight polici but somewhat less accommod polici  and if we choos to go with no fund rate increas today  i think the languag must help prepar the market go forward  i   m pleas with a lot of the discuss around the tabl   we are actual begin to talk  i think  about what our exit strategi is go to be from this   i think it   s veri import to have those convers  and i appreci them   i  too  share the observ that presid   had about talk with peopl who say     well  we can   t possibl remov accommod until we get rid of the facil      i think that is wrong   as you said  mr  chairman  actual have the facil might make it easier for us to correct monetari polici  and i think that   s veri  veri import  i guess my bottom line is that i can accept leav the fund rate unchang today as long as our languag is suffici strong about inflat   to that end  i was actual a littl more comfort with the draft tabl     i didn   t like the addit of the word    also      i thought that weaken the statement   i would prefer paragraph   without the    also      i also have one other  minor observ about paragraph    and that   s the first sentenc  which say that    inflat has been high  spur by the earlier increas in the price of energi and some other commod     well  i think that   s part true  but i   m concern that somehow it convey the impress that the problem with inflat is oil and commod  when in fact more correct my concern about inflat is not just oil   my concern is about the stanc of polici   so i would put on the tabl the possibl of say that    inflat has been high  part spur by high oil and commod price    to say  that it   s more than just the short term behavior of commod price   i think the word    also    mean that inflat concern there are ad as an afterthought  which is my read of the chang from the draft tabl   to paragraph     so i prefer that    also    be elimin   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be brief   i favor altern b as written and present   i think it strike the right balanc by highlight the risk that we see on the inflat front  and i agre with     s character that the capit market    reaction might be a littl surpris   it is hard for us in a  e like this to predict exact how the capit market are go to interpret this  but it wouldn   t surpris me to see some initi market reaction that is ostens negat   that  sn   t troubl me too much   ideal  the remov of polici accommod  which we talk about today  would be from a posit of strength not weak  but we may or may not have the luxuri of wait for that opportun   final  i think it   s import over this period that we not be perceiv to be lurch   i think altern b strike the right balanc of explain our concern and provid us reason option   that is  as you   ve describ previous  state determin rather than  e determin   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you   i support no chang  altern b   as i mention befor  i don   t want to put the commod price decreas and energi price decreas in the bank and say we don   t have ani problem go forward   but we also can   t ignor them  and i think that   take off a bit of the pressur   it also manifest itself in some of the survey number and some of the market base number in term of expect   so i think it allow a littl more  e  as someon said earlier  to be patient  to make the determin  given that i still think there are some veri real downsid risk  as i   ve mention  i think this type of statement will be larg consist with market expect  although i do think  and   can correct me  that this is one of the first  e that we have made a veri clear statement such as    inflat has been high      i think that   s a bit of a chang from where we have been   that   s a much stronger acknowledg of the inflat situat  which i think is appropri to be acknowledg   but i do think that it may send a relat strong signal to the market  and it make me feel more comfort about no chang today with the statement becaus it show a lot of concern about the level of inflat in actual character it as high   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   just let me talk a littl about monetari polici  and i   ll be brief there   but then i have to use my opportun to rais some issu for the committe when i   m not here   i do support altern b   as is obvious from my earlier discuss  i believ that the risk are balanc   i have one modif to     s languag becaus i think it is just simpler to say that    the downsid risk to growth and upsid risk to inflat are of concern to the committe      i don   t see the need for    both     but we   re actual on the same wavelength in term of this issu  what i   d like to spend some  e on   becaus i feel this is sort of my swan song  but mayb becaus i   m a classi guy  i   ll call this my    valedictori remark      are three concern that i have for this committe go forward   i   m not go to be abl to particip  but i have a chanc now to lay them out   the first is the real danger of focus too much on the feder fund rate as reflect the stanc of monetari polici   this is veri danger   i want to talk about that   second is that i think it   s absolut critic that we keep our option open in the current circumst  and so i want to talk about that   the third is on the communic issu  but it   s not go to be on inflat object   i   ve alreadi talk about that enough in public  so it   s clear to you one way or the other   i hope you consid it  but that   s someth that i don   t need to go into here  first of all  let me talk about the issu of focus too much on the feder fund rate as indic the stanc of monetari polici   this is someth that   s veri dear to my heart   i have a chapter in my textbook that deal with this whole issu and talk about the veri deep mistak that have been made in monetari polici becaus of exact that focus on the short term interest rate as indic the stanc of monetari polici   in particular  when you think about the stanc of monetari polici  you should look at all asset price  which mean look at all interest rate   all asset price have a veri import effect on aggreg demand   also you should look at credit market condit becaus some thing are actual not reflect in market price but are still veri import   if you don   t do that  you can make horrend mistak   the great depress is a classic exampl of when they made two mistak in look at the polici interest rate   one is that they didn   t understand the differ between real and nomin interest rate   that mistak i   m not worri about here   peopl fulli understand that   but it is an exampl when nomin rate went down  but onli on default free treasuri secur  in fact  they skyrocket on other one   the stanc of monetari polici was incred tight dure the great depress  and we had a disast  the japanes made the same mistak  and i just veri much hope that this committe   not make this mistak becaus i have to tell you that the situat is scari to me   i   m hold two hous right now   i   m veri nervous    laughter  the second issu is that it   s absolut critic that we keep our option open   this relat to the point that i alreadi made in my discuss   i argu that we don   t know where this situat of financi stress is actual go to head and that the potenti for shoe drop and bad thing happen out there is real   i think it   s like that it won   t happen  but it   s a signific probabl with veri serious negat consequ   in that situat  we don   t know exact the direct of where we have to go   i was actual veri pleas with presid     s comment     has been a good friend for a long  e  and he is one of the peopl i have tremend respect for as an economist   although we had a disagr in our view of monetari polici today  on the issu go forward i was pleas to see that you actual indic that there is a possibl   we hope it  sn   t happen  by the way   that thing go south and that we actual have to be much more aggress on monetari polici and on liquid issu   i know that there have been some concern on the committe about that as well  but no option should be taken off the tabl if bad thing happen  and we cannot get box in   i feel veri  veri strong about that  i would also say that the same issu come up in term of inflat   i have argu veri strenuous for nongradu in a situat like the one we   re in   we are in a differ world when we are in a situat of financi stress  and it   s veri possibl that we might have to rais rate veri quick   there   s a good news case and a bad news case   the good news case is that hous price stabil   that could actual turn thing around veri quick   i think  bill  if i   m not incorrect  you mention that possibl  and i think you   re absolut right   in that kind of situat  our polici would becom veri accommod   i do not think it   s too accommod at all right now   i think it   s balanc  it   s appropri   but if the financi market improv  it will becom much too accommod veri quick  and we then have to respond veri quick in order not to have inflationari consequ   i   d like to see that happen  by the way  the other case  which i would not like to see happen  is that inflat expect get unhing   i have seen no evid that long run inflat expect have gotten unhing  but there is substanti risk   if that happen  we would also have to move up veri quick   so i realli implor this committe to keep your option open   do not get box in   let   s hope and pray   let   s all get around in a circl and hold hand   that oil price fall  which will also help us not get box in   don  i told you i was go to be a littl color   he was wait for this one   i should mention that don was actual at a confer where he talk about constraint on peopl   s behavior as a result of the transcript be record  and he said     but not         laughter  the third issu is someth about which i am less constrain  which is communic   i would not have talk about this earlier  but it realli   worri me   we have a complic govern structur in this committe  which i actual think is the right govern structur  we have two type of group that vote on this committe   we have the peopl who are presidenti appointe and then confirm by the senat  who are board member  and i will soon not be one of them   i   ll be a civilian again   then we have bank presid  who are much more tie into the privat sector becaus your board of director  which are compos of privat sector peopl  recommend you   then we do have some role  but they   re the primari peopl who decid who becom a bank presid  i think that   s a veri good framework   it actual serv us veri well   i   ve been on both side   i   ve been on the other side of the fenc  not as a presid but as an execut vice presid  it serv us veri well becaus we have a link to the privat sector that we normal would not have  import  it keep us real in term of inform  and there   s a group of peopl out there who are not in washington or new york  becaus peopl also have a hard  e about new york  but who tend to be veri import support for us polit   so this is a system that i would veri much like to see preserv   it   have a problem becaus of the differ role here   what i have been veri concern about   and i have had peopl in the market speak to me about this   is that recent i had a veri promin central bank governor say to me     what in the hell are you guy do      the issu here is that we need to have a situat where bank presid and also member of the board can speak their view   they may have differ view  and i veri much encourag that in term of discuss  of where they think the economi is go  which is what we do insid  and i think that   need to be done outsid the committe becaus it show that there are differ view  that we   re think about it  that we   re tri to learn from each other  and so forth and so on   what is veri problemat from my viewpoint are the speech  discuss  and interview outsid  when peopl talk about where they think interest rate should head and where the polici rate should head   that   s where the critic has been come from   i have to tell you that a lot of peopl whom i respect tremend are say to me that it   s make us look like the gang that can   t shoot straight   i think it   s a realli serious problem   i understand that we want to keep the prioriti of speak our mind  but we have to work as a team  and i think that we   re have a problem in this regard  let me talk about whi i think this is danger   it   s danger in term of polici set  you can see this is veri blunt   clear  if you were in a multi period game  you wouldn   t be this blunt   but now i   m not go to be here anymor  so you can hate me   i don   t care    laughter  but this kind of cacophoni on this issu has the potenti to damag us in two veri serious way  one is that it weaken the confid in our institut  and i have to tell you that i love this institut   it   s veri hard for me to leav this place  but it   s someth i have to do   if the institut is damag in term of the confid that the public and the politician have in us  it will hurt us deepli   it will hurt us in term of polici becaus it will weaken our credibl  which actual will make it harder to control inflat   so i consid this a veri serious cost   the second issu is on the polit front   it is veri possibl that we   re go to have a reopen of the feder reserv act with the next administr and the next congress   the reason i think it is possibl is that we have to restructur our regulatori structur   there   s no way to get around it   we are in a brave new world on this   that could lead to an open of this issu   the problem here is  in that open  there are a lot of peopl in the congress who are veri uncomfort have policymak who are not presidenti appointe and confirm by the senat   two outcom could come out of that   one is that they could take the vote away from the presid  which i think would be a disast becaus then you   re not go to have good peopl go into the system   we won   t have board of director that will be good   we won   t have all of the benefit that we think we have from the current system   the other altern is that we then have presid who are actual appoint by the presid and then confirm by the senat   i think  again  that hurt the privat linkag  so i feel veri strong about all three of these issu  but i think that you   re go to come up with serious challeng in the futur that could be veri damag to the system   so i hope you think about this and still like me for be blunt  and also miss me becaus there will be a littl less amus   who els would have brought monti python into the fomc   thank you veri much
thank you  governor     governor duke
thank you   i support altern b   i don   t think that the    sever financi stress    scenario is out of the question right now
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b for the reason that you and mani other have alreadi state
thank you   i want to thank everyon for your comment today   i know we don   t have agreement around the tabl  but as somebodi onc said  if everybodi agre  then everybodi except one is redund    laughter   i listen veri care to what has been said   i understand your concern   i think hard about them   i do everi day   as we go forward  we will obvious continu to have these fruit discuss  i do think that we need to continu to clarifi this exit strategi issu   one point i would make  and governor   allud to it  is that we need to think of this as a state depend rather than a  e depend strategi   we need to be clear not so much as to whether we are or are not go to rais rate but under what circumst and whi and what our object are   on that basi  i reiter that my greater attent recent to financi and real condit has to do with my view of the risk rather than my object function  i recommend no action today and altern b   there were a number of suggest for chang   i think i will avoid them just to avoid further controversi   my reason for suggest altern b were well state by presid pianalto   it   s hard to judg   i don   t know what the market will make of this  but my intent is for it to be slight hawkish   to indic a slight upward tilt in polici   which has sever function   first  if we don   t move  it emphas our ongo concern with inflat and perhap provid some prophylact protect with respect to expect and so on   on the other hand  if condit do warrant action  and it could be quick action  at least we will have provid the market with some warn and some indic of our concern about this issu   so that   s my recommend   ani comment   would you call the roll
