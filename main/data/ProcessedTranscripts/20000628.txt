thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag of chart in front of you that begin with the chart on forward rate   in the top panel on u s  dollar forward rate you can see that for much of the last few month the   month forward and the   month forward   month rate have been trade right on top of one anoth   they are both down a bit from their level prior to the june  nd releas of the nonfarm payrol report and have return rough to where they were trade after the releas of the eci on april      look down the page at the euro forward rate  it is clear that their   month and   month forward rate have also been trade on top of one anoth for some  e   this lead me to the follow infer   notwithstand a great deal of verbal intervent from the offici sector in europ about how the growth differenti between europ and north america are like    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix      to narrow and revers over the come year  the short term interest rate market do not seem to share that assess   if they did  it would seem to me that the euro forward rate would show more forward upward lift than they do   at the bottom of the page  you can see that the japanes forward rate have begun to tick up again of late as the melodrama continu about whether the bank of japan will or won t rais rate some  soon   the specul regard a rate increas goe on apac and we see again the modest tick up of forward rate   turn to the second page  it is clear that over the last four mainten period the fed fund rate has behav rather well  trade right around the target with veri low volatil sinc your last meet   there realli isn t much interest or excit in our manag of the fund rate per se   as you can see on page    howev  behind the veil of a nice stabl fund rate is a rather differ develop have to do with the scarciti of treasuri collater begin to show through in the repo market   depict on the chart in red is the    day move averag of the spread between the repo rate on general collater for treasuri secur and the fed fund rate as we get a snapshot of it each morn   the solid blue line repres   month averag over the period encompass by those blue horizont line   clear  over the last two year that averag has been trend lower  with a widen of the negat spread at which treasuri collater trade under the fund rate   two develop have in all likelihood taken place here  one is the scarciti of treasuri collater  it is at a premium and will trade under the fund rate   there is also an element of defens among the major institut investor and money manag dure a period when the committe has been tighten  as they look for the safeti of treasuri collater   but to my mind the march down of those averag rate is impress  and i will note that one major dealer has said to me that they can fund themselv at    basi point under the fund rate with treasuri collater  so acut is demand of their custom base for treasuri as a safe haven cash manag vehicl   on the fourth page i have tri to summar our reserv manag oper this year as they relat both to the growth of reserv need and the mix between outright and rp oper  i use as my base here the februari  th mainten period  which get us out of the year end effect of the season and the y k    buildup of cash and to a reason start point for a base case  in the top part of the page i have shown chang in suppli of fed balanc from the februari  th period to the current june   th mainten period   autonom factor have drain a littl over    billion net over that period of  e  that   s overwhelm compris of currenc   we have had redempt of      billion sinc that  e  ad to reserv need   and      billion has been ad through soma purchas plus net chang in rps over that period  leav us a veri margin chang in the total of nonborrow fed balanc   let me first work down the page rather than across  i will come back to the figur at the upper right in a moment   the mix of activ involv in get to that margin chang includ outright purchas  here express in par valu  from the end of januari through june of       billion in treasuri secur  distribut as shown in the middl tabl on the page   move down to the next set of figur  we had a mix of a littl over     billion in short term rps of under    day and        billion of long term rps in the februari  th period  for a total of near     billion outstand at the begin of februari   we have decreas the amount of short term rps and increas the amount of long term rps  so that current the level of rps outstand is      billion under    day  but that number bounc around everi day  and     billion in longer term rps   at the bottom of the page is a memo item give the mix of collater that we had in februari compar with what we have today   current    percent of the collater we have in the    day or longer rps is treasuri collater     percent is agenc debt  and    percent is mortgag back secur   go back to the top of the page  at the upper right i have shown project reserv factor for the period from now to the septemb  th mainten period  which begin just about the  e of your next meet   we expect a littl over    billion to be drain by currenc  but over     billion to be drain as a result of net redempt  princip from the    percent limit be appli to bill   that leav us with a need to add about     billion on net from now until the begin of septemb   there is one other issu with respect to treasuri suppli that i would like to mention   it just occur to me that this is a matter that may becom public befor your next meet   for over    year the treasuri has given foreign central bank prefer access  if you will  to the auction process in treasuri    secur  provid a mechan through us for those institut to bid in the auction   they have an    add on    in that they can alway get their need fill in the auction   this has creat a problem for the treasuri in an era of declin issuanc in that the treasuri can end up with more cash than it actual want as the foreign central bank exercis their right to add on to the auction   the treasuri is veri anxious to find a way to end this process  which give them some uncertainti about the amount of cash they will rais   they are tri to cap the amount the foreign central bank can bid for in the auction at a set dollar figur  and they would like to cap that amount at a rather low level  no matter how you slice this  and we are work with the treasuri to come up with differ formula  the big account will have to find some way of bid for treasuri secur other than through the noncompetit foreign account mechan   that is someth we do for the japanes  for exampl   we at the desk are work with the treasuri to tri to find a way to take care of the veri small account  those of the develop economi all over the world that have veri small cash balanc and want to reinvest in bill   we are attempt to come up with a procedur that will ensur that those countri are taken care of through an automat process but one that will requir the big countri to look elsewher   this is overwhelm an issu involv the ministri of financ of japan   it mean find some way for them to deal with their rather larg invest need  which they like to park in the short end of the market   both the domest and the intern side of the treasuri have been work on this and we have been give them technic advic on differ way that it could be work out   i don t know how it will be work out  but it is like that the treasuri will want to announc someth in conjunct with their refund at the begin of august  at least that is when i understand they would like to move forward with this   so i just want to warn you of that upcom event   mr  chairman  we had no foreign exchang intervent in the intermeet period   i will need a vote to ratifi our domest oper sinc your last meet   we distribut copi of the draft announc summar the oper chang we discuss at the committe   s last meet and  as my note explain  we ve gone over these with the treasuri   in addit to ani question on my brief  i would be happi to take ani comment or suggest on that document  which the committe member may now have   thank you
question for   on ani of the subject he has address
i thought you were suppos to be veri nice to your larg creditor
we are go to be as nice as we can be to our larg creditor   we have for some  e  in our rather modest particip in the ministri of financ   s auction  had to compet direct by put in competit bid to buy japanes treasuri bill   we have had no preferenti treatment in japan   their procedur has been to we can onli submit bid through their dealer   we will still permit foreign central bank  even the ministri of financ in all likelihood  if they wish to submit a competit bid through us   we will accept it  but they will have to choos the rate   we will not give advic on rate or take part in that process   but it is a fact of life that the treasuri is now tri to find a way to work down it cash balanc and the amount they issu at each auction without end up with an uncertain and higher amount of cash than desir   it is a real mechan problem
are the amount from the japanes too big just to let them submit noncompetit bid
yes   the treasuri  i think  would like to have the total of foreign noncompetit bid be around    billion  sum up the need of all the small countri   the japanes ministri of financ is routin roll over                                                  in treasuri bill auction
what would happen if there were onli noncompetit bid
that is clear a problem   i don t think the treasuri can go that way  part of the answer here  no matter what els is done  is to get the big account into the competit process   obvious  they can   t sustain an auction process in which
i just thought you would be so imagin that you could figur out a way    laughter
i hit a wall there   i m open to suggest and i ll be happi to relay them to the treasuri   but if someon isn t prepar to put out a few price as to where they think the market will clear  i   m not sure we can get there
i am   i know you can   t    laughter    other question  if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the transact
move approv of the domest oper
thank you  mr  vice chair   without object they are approv   let s move on to what we use to call the    chart show    and i guess we probabl still ought to do so
i think we will   i  along with    son and larri    will be refer to the materi label    staff present on the econom outlook       your first chart provid a brief overview of our outlook for the u s  economi over the next year and a half   as you know from read the  book  we lower our project for the growth of real gdp a bit  in respons to our percept that the pace of activ may be slow a touch fa  than we had forecast in may   but the basic contour of the project have chang littl   we continu to anticip that past and prospect increas in the feder fund rate will lead to a substanti deceler in the pace of real domest spend  the red line in the upper panel of your first chart   domest spend  which has been rise at more than a       percent pace over the past two year  is expect to increas just       percent in          a copi of the materi use by mr     ms   son  and mr    is append to this transcript   appendix      continu improv in real activ abroad and our project depreci of the dollar combin to direct more demand here and abroad toward u s  produc   this mute some of the effect that slow domest demand might otherwis have had on the growth of output   as a result  growth of real gdp slow onli about a percentag point to       percent next year   pressur in labor market are expect to remain relat intens over the next year and a half   with some lag  our project of below trend growth result in an upward drift in the unemploy rate next year  but onli to a littl more than   percent   tight resourc util and some continu acceler in non oil import price provid a further boost to core pce price inflat  the red line in the lower panel  over the project interv   howev  the effect of that gradual pickup on the headlin price measur  the black line  is swamp by the sharp swing that we are project for energi price this year and next  the increas in total pce price step up to a       percent pace this year and drop back to a   percent rate in        the financi assumpt under our project are the subject of your next chart   we continu to believ that a further tighten of financi condit will be necessari to begin to reliev some of the inflationari pressur that appear to be build in the economi   the addit    basi point of tighten that we have assum would push up the real feder fund rate a bit abov the upper end of the rang observ over the past decad   but given the upward influenc of fa  product growth on    equilibrium    real interest rate  our assumpt on the fund rate impli less monetari restraint than it would have five year ago   the degre of addit tighten that we have assum would come as a surpris to market particip  and we would expect real rate on corpor bond  the middl left panel  to resum the upward trajectori that has been appar over the past year and a half   thus far  that rise has done littl to damp enthusiasm in equiti market   but  go forward  further increas in interest rate  coupl with a slow in the growth of corpor profit  are expect to hold equiti price flat at about the level they have averag thus far this year   in the lower panel  i have attempt to summar some of the financi crosscurr at work in our project with the aid     of a model simul   the most notabl of these crosscurr has been the strength of the stock market in the face of the consider increas in interest rate that has occur over the past year  the red bar in the chart plot the depress effect on the growth of real gdp that would be expect by the model to accompani the actual and project increas in the real feder fund rate sinc last june   these effect are calcul assum that the stock market  long term interest rate  and the exchang rate evolv accord to the model   s expect   as you can see  some effect on growth would have been evid in the first half of this year  with the restraint mount notic in the second half of      and in        of cours  financi develop are not unfold in the manner predict by the model   in particular  stock price have risen more than    percent over the past year and are project to remain flat go forward   by contrast  the model expect a drop of    percent over the past year and project a further declin in come quarter   the offset provid by this surpris behavior are shown by the blue bar in the chart   as can be seen  the resili of the stock market damp consider the restrain effect that normal would be expect to accompani a substanti run up in the fund rate   the total net effect of these influenc is shown by the black bar   focus on the black bar  this analysi suggest that  on averag in the first half of       there is littl reason to have expect much restrain effect yet from the chang in financi condit over the past year   but move forward  given both the lag in respons to past rate increas and our assumpt of some further tighten  the restrain influenc of financi condit should begin to show through more notic  with the effect turn negat in the second half of this year and becom more so in        in a nutshel  that   s the basic rational for our forecast of a signific  but not precipit  slow in activ over the next year and a half   the transmiss of this restraint to household spend is the subject of your next chart   as we note in the  book  the buoyanc of consum sen ent  shown in the upper left panel  has led us to discount the recent weak in the retail sale figur as signal the start of a more abrupt down shift in spend  that said  we do see the under determin as point to decid slower growth in consum outlay   although there have been some big up and down in the stock market thus far this year  for the most part price have move sideway  a trend  as i     note  that we are project will continu   as a consequ  the household wealth to incom ratio  the black line in the upper right panel  is expect to fall back and the person save rate  the red line  to drift up   that manifest itself in our project as a fair steadi deceler of consum spend this year and next  the red bar in the middl left panel   hous appear to be the area where higher interest rate are leav the clearest mark on demand   as depict by the red line in the middl right panel  there has been a signific deterior in consum percept of home buy condit  builder    rate of new home sale  the black line  also have becom less favor   as can be seen in the lower left panel  rise interest rate and higher home price have lift month payment relat to person incom over the past year   and  given our project of higher rate  this burden is like to increas further in come quarter   when combin with slower incom and employ growth and a diminish impetus from rise wealth  we are project total hous start to slide from      million unit in      to about a     million unit pace by the end of next year   in contrast to the reason clear sign of slow in residenti invest  the recent indic of capit spend by busi have remain veri strong   as seen in the upper left panel of chart    new order for nondefens capit good move up in recent month and have remain abov shipment   the accumul backlog of order should provid consider support for equip spend in come month   total real e s  shown on the right  is expect to slow onli a littl from it recent rapid pace   inform technolog is expect to continu to contribut the lion   s share of the growth in real e s  the red shade area in the panel  while outlay for other equip  the gray area  are expect to slow appreci   a sharpli declin relat price for it equip  shown in the middl left panel  should provid ampl incent for continu strong growth of invest in the tech area   the deceler of busi output that we are project  plot at the right  is like to leav a small mark on invest in inform technolog  but to be a more notic drag on other type of capit outlay   anoth area of spend that seem like to respond to the slowdown in output growth is nonresidenti construct      shown in the lower left panel   the recent boom in activ in this sector appear at odd with the slowdown in price appreci and rent that we have observ  especi for offic build and retail structur   in an environ of rise interest rate  somewhat less ampl provis of credit  and slower growth of output  we are anticip a consider drop back in the growth of activ in this sector    the enorm strength we have wit in busi and household demand in recent quarter has coincid with a steep drop in the inventori sale ratio  plot at the right   howev  there are few report that busi have felt uncomfort with these low level of stock  and we expect this ratio to drift down further  on net  over the forecast interv  and for inventori to be an essenti neutral influenc on the growth of real gdp     will now continu our present
your next chart review develop in  select intern financi market sinc the februari meet   as can be seen in the top left panel  the averag foreign exchang valu of the dollar in term of the currenc of

output growth in the industri countri will slow some over the remaind of the forecast period  but that slow is larg account for by japan   we continu to expect that domest demand growth in japan

your next chart present our product forecast   the upper left panel provid some longer run perspect  while the upper right panel magnifi the current situat   we are project that the rate of growth of

with more capit deepen  while ongo improv to how busi is conduct will show through to even fa  growth of multifactor product   despit the favor product perform  we still are forecast a build up of inflat pressur    focus on the upper panel of chart     you can see that both core cpi and core pce price have acceler recent  measur at either the three month  six month  or twelv month frequenc  the red  blue  and black line respect   in the case of the so call    pipelin    inflat indic  present in the middl panel  twelv month chang in both the core intermedi good ppi and the core crude good index have move up distinct over the past year or so   similar  the index of price paid in the napm manufactur survey show that sinc late last year a sizabl number of firm have report pay higher price for their materi and suppli   it should be note  howev  that industri commod price and the napm index have soften of late  as manufactur output has moder   dure the last two period of rise inflat pressur          and          widespread bottleneck and shortag were report as firm in a number of industri  for exampl  primari metal  textil  paper  and plastic  were oper at veri high util rate   current  howev  capac util is well below the level reach in those episod  and bottleneck and shortag seem to be few  appar reflect the rapid growth of capac dure recent year   to illustr the point  in the lower panel i have list a sampl of the item that purchas manag report to be in short suppli dure the two previous period of rise inflat as well as the complet list shown in the most recent napm survey  consist with the numer press stori on the subject  the purchas manag do report shortag of one critic group of product  electron compon  and  as note in the  book  those shortag are have an effect on comput price   but that   s pretti much it   there are no report of shortag for such basic materi as aluminum  steel  or industri chemic       so  where   that leav us in term of the outlook for inflat   chart    present part of the staff   s view   the first part of our stori has to do with sustain  or lack of it  to be more precis   one way of demonstr this point is illustr in the upper panel   the idea behind the pictur is one that the chairman has discuss mani  e and is base on a modif of the growth account ident   that is  arithmet the growth of domest demand equal the sum of the growth of product  popul  the particip rate  and one minus the unemploy rate  plus the contribut of net import   the chart show the role of three of those item   fall unemploy and rise particip  that is  a shrink pool of avail worker  as well as the widen trade deficit   so  for exampl  dure the four quarter end in      q   domest demand rose     percent  of which       percentag point was met by the factor shown on the chart   in term of the sustain issu  there are two way to satisfi abov trend growth of domest demand  we can make the good here or foreign can make them for us   if we make them here  we can do it by draw more peopl into the workforc or by increas product   but the pool of avail worker can   t be drawn down forev  likewis  the trade deficit can   t widen forev   the upper panel is one way of scale the extent to which we have been reli on these two    safeti valv    to maintain demand growth   by this measur  the growth of domest demand has been reli on these unsustain sourc for most of the past seven year  which has contribut to a widen gdp gap  the middl panel   inde  current we es  that the level of actual gdp is about   percent abov the level of potenti   the lower panel show the histor relationship between the gdp gap and price acceler  as well as the staff project   the horizont axi plot the gdp gap measur at the end of year    t      and the vertic axi is the acceler in core pce price dure year    t      although there are one or two obvious outlier  for the most part the point clu  around the fit regress line  plot in blue   the regress suggest that a   percent imbal between aggreg demand and aggreg suppli at the end of last year is like to be associ with a     percentag point step up in inflat this year   although the approach we actual use for project inflat is more complex than this simpl bivari relationship  the forecast suggest by     the regress is reason in line with what we   ve written down in the  book for the averag acceler in core pce price dure      and       the red dot on the chart   an altern  but certain not independ  way of think about the inflat process is present in chart      here i show a cost account of inflat for the nonfinanci corpor sector   this is just an extens of the tabl i send the committe short befor each meet   the logic of this approach is base on the ident that relat inflat to chang in unit labor cost  unit nonlabor cost  and unit profit  where output is measur in valu ad term from the incom side  the upper panel show fourth quarter to fourth quarter increas in compens per hour and product  the compon of unit labor cost   as you can see  with aggreg demand grow more quick than suppli and with labor market extrem tight over the forecast period  we expect hour compens growth to pick up   at the same  e  we think that product growth is like to slow  as employ catch up on some hire while output is slow   the result is an acceler in unit labor cost for the nonfinanci corpor sector over the next two year   the middl panel show the other two compon of the ident   we are project a continu of the modest increas in nonlabor cost post over the past year or so  primarili reflect higher interest cost   final  unit profit  which climb sharpli earlier in the expans  are project to drop back somewhat over the next year and a half  as a competit busi environ make it difficult for firm to fulli pass on higher unit cost   the bottom panel illustr how this all add up for the nonfinanci corpor deflat   note that becaus this is a sector wide price index  it includ energi and food   the jump in unit labor cost expect this year lead to a pickup in inflat from about     percent dure      to       percent over the four quarter of        in       howev  the further acceler of unit labor cost is offset by the project drop in profit  and price increas slow a bit   this contour is rough similar to the one shown for total pce price in the bottom panel of dave   s first chart
in chart     i offer a few shred of evid on the question rais at the last meet about whether we might be in the process of overdo this period of tighten to an extent that could result in a hard land for the economi      the upper panel dust off a statist techniqu develop by my colleagu   rudebusch at the san francisco fed when he was on staff here at the board   in brief  the techniqu analyz the index of lead econom indic and assess whether it recent behavior conform with pattern observ in period immedi prior to or dure a recess   i have plot here this model   s es  of the probabl that the economi is in or will be in a recess within six month   by this measur  that probabl is less than one percent   a somewhat differ approach is employ in the middl panel   in this exercis  we use our larg scale econometr model to produc a one year ahead forecast start in each quarter sinc        then  use stochast simul  we es  how vulner the economi was in each of those period to random shock   specif  we calcul the frequenc with which random shock are abl to produc two consecut quarter of negat gdp growth dure the one year forecast period   that es  probabl is plot here   as can be seen  this measur tend to rise prior to econom downturn   for the second quarter of this year  the probabl of encount two consecut quarter of gdp declin in the next year is about       percent   although the probabl has drift up over the past year  it is well below level preced past downturn  and even below the probabl that were es  for the      tighten period   while i hate to end our present on what might be consid somewhat of a downer for the staff  the lower two panel are intend to provid some perspect on how much comfort you should take from the upper two panel   i went back and look at the  book that were prepar six month prior to the busi cycl peak of      and        in the lower panel i have plot the project for real gnp growth taken from those  book  the black line  and actual outcom as report in the survey of current busi short after those period  the red line   in januari       the staff was project consider weak for that year and for        howev  we did not forese the onset of the largest recess of the postwar period  which began in the summer of      and gather forc that autumn   in the januari       book  we correct project a continu step down in the growth of real gnp  but miss call for a peak in activ that summer and the contract of      output that began in the fall   to be sure  no one was expect the invas of kuwait and the accompani spike in oil price   but that   s part of the point   it   s difficult to forese the shock that can knock an economi off track  and neither we nor other forecast have been veri success at that endeavor in the past   so there is probabl some justif for the sweati palm that a number of you admit to at the last meet   but in the end  we do not see the likelihood as high that the economi is in danger of overshoot on the down side   and  we remain comfort with our project of a steadi slow in growth this year and next   moreov  i would not want this analysi to leav the impress that we see the risk as asymmetr   this economi has demonstr much greater resili than most forecast had anticip  and  with total and core measur of inflat have move up over the past year  clear inflat risk are present   the final chart present your forecast for      and for        the central tendenc of your forecast anticip some slow in the growth of real gdp between this year and next  with the unemploy rate remain near or slight abov it current level   inflat  as measur by the pce price index  is expect to edg down next year
thank you   as an asid  the probabl distribut base on the lead indic look remark good  but my recollect is that about everi three year the confer board revis back a seri that did not work dure a particular  e period  so the index is accur onli retrospect   i   m curious to know whether these are the current offici publish data or the data that were avail at the  e   i know the answer to the question and it is not good     laughter
right   we use the data as they are current publish and the probabl per se as they are calcul by rees  the model on those data   though that index look reason good  it clear did not do veri well  even on these rees  data  in that      episod   even when we were in a recess  the index was still suggest that the probabl of be in a recess was onli    percent   so that was a relat weak indic  and i think to some degre the same critic could be level at the middl panel  which     probabl overst the abil of that model and techniqu to signal oncom recess becaus that also reflect the structur of the model as it current exist  es  on current data   so i think both probabl overst the probabl
the second  howev  is a more complex structur model from which we would expect someth like that   the alleg advantag of the lead indic  which may be view as a simpl reduc form small sampl forecast  is that they are suppos to do all the macro model is suppos to do   so in a sens they are lead us astray more than a lead indic should  if i may put it in those term  let me ask a question relev to a crucial conclus that is come out of all of this  how would the  book  and eventu the bluebook  look were we to do all of our simul with the nairu equal to the unemploy rate
in the bluebook i think there is a simul that has a nairu that   s basic the current unemploy rate
i am rais the issu  in a sens  more in the  book context   what i am tri to get at is how crucial the nairu es  we have now  which is       percent  is to the conclus that are emerg  that   s becaus  as larri point out  we are deal with unit labor cost  which essenti are move at a lower pace than at ani  e in the most recent period   on the surfac  the immedi respons is that the way to describ the inflat emerg in the context of that set of data is this   the gap between the nairu and the unemploy rate is put pressur on the compens number  which work through to a rate of chang that is in excess of product growth  and this lead algebra to an acceler in unit labor cost   the gap between the nairu  as defin in the model  and the unemploy rate has been veri larg for a veri long period   and  clear      we have not seen the process that is describ in the  book forecast emerg   the reason i rais the question is that how we structur polici  through what will be a veri difficult period in the month and quarter ahead  is go to depend crucial on how we view the various under forc that are emerg   i am just ask  with the evid that we have to date  how comfort you are with the conclus that the singl point es  of the acceler of inflat in the  book  which as you point out is in opposit to market expect  has a high probabl of occur
i guess the first thing i would say is that within the context of the  book forecast  in an economi with no addit tighten we would see the unemploy rate drift down a bit further from where it is current   so even if one were to take as the nairu the   to       percent unemploy rate that have prevail over the past year or so  our expect would be that we could be run below that level   so  unless one want to argu that the nairu may be move down even further  there would still be
i purpos defin it as be equal to the unemploy rate   let me stipul that   i don t want to go too far   the law of suppli and demand say that there is a level of the unemploy rate that must of necess drive compens increas beyond the rate of increas in product   but there is a crucial issu here  which is the specif of the way this process occur   it is quit differ from the general view  which is unquestion verifi true  name  that as the unemploy rate fall  the pressur on compens per hour must rise or the law of suppli and demand has no relev to anyth   it is the veri special specif of the structur of this model  which stipul that a specif gap exist  that has work rather well in year past   but the recent evid of that is at least serious question   and the reason i rais the issu is veri     honest becaus if i believ the  book forecast and if i believ the bluebook forecast  i would say that we are well behind the curv at this particular stage in monetari polici   and i don t believ that   in fact  due to great substant insight on our part and more import a great deal of luck  i think that is not the case  but it is terribl import that a precis specif of how a particular econom event materi rest at the base of the structur of our model   we have a veri larg  veri elabor  and veri sophist econometr model   but at the core of the conclus we are look at today  a specif of how the nairu is defin relat to the unemploy rate and the margin effect of that gap on compens per hour is a crucial drive forc in the forecast   if we were to creat a reduc form of this model  it would have this specif essenti at the core of the conclus   so the real question that i am ask is essenti the degre of confid we should have in this   i wonder whether there should be a wider rang of uncertainti about the specif  main becaus of the poor perform of these relationship over the last sever year   that is  the relationship between nairu  the unemploy rate  and hour compens have behav in a far less impress manner than they clear did in earlier year   the presumpt here is that the relationship will return to where they were  or at least i assum that is the case   that may well be true   inde  we have to be veri wari becaus that may in fact be the case   i rais the concern that i have in the form of a question main becaus i m tri to ask it more as the devil   s advoc than i may veri well believ in light of the fact that it is crucial to our deliber
let me make a coupl of comment   one  i would not want to overst how well this paradigm has work in the past either   it s not as if this    fit like a glove    previous and sudden someth has gone so far off track that we can clear see     evid of consider structur chang   two  to answer your question about how confid i am  i would refer you to chart   in the bluebook  which present confid interv around these forecast that are base  in essenc  on our econometr model  not necessarili judgment forecast   as you can see  those confid interv are realli rather consider  but i think that chart probabl is a pretti reason represent of the kind of uncertainti we think you are confront with in make polici   a    percent confid interv on the extens of the  book forecast could impli stabl inflat   even with an unemploy rate below the nairu  an inflat rate that run at just   percent  which is essenti where it has been run  is within those confid interv under the structur of this model
and these are pick up structur misspecif as well as exogen data input error
yes  in the sens that these are full confid interv
but i m tri to understand what the confid interv is in fact measur
it is measur all of the abov  the uncertainti about the model  base on how it has perform in the past  as well as the uncertainti about what goe into that model
in other word  in a sens  analyt it is the structur specif error  miss variabl  misspecifi coeffici  as well as inaccur exogen input into the forecast system
yes  pretti much   i suspect this   not includ the coeffici uncertainti about the paramet on variabl  it has a coeffici uncertainti in term of the intercept in the model   but as you can see  that confid interv widen out to over       percentag point on price inflat  so there is consider uncertainti   obvious  the staff forecast is a forecast of what we think will happen under a given path of the fund rate   it is not a prescript for polici or for how polici should be conduct when face with uncertainti about the structur of the model   in fact  i would interpret the committe   s behavior in recent year as have respond to the widen uncertainti about the structur of the model and the economi by react less forc to incom econom develop than you might have had you had full confid in the structur of the model   i think it is import to rememb that about the forecast  that it is not a prescript  but a forecast   and that forecast has consider uncertainti in a number of dimens   you have mention a coupl in term of the structur of the wage price sector   but the model has been off consider in mani other area that are also import for your consider  for exampl  the behavior of equiti market and how they might respond to further chang in the feder fund rate   it all add up to a lot of uncertainti and some pretti big confid span  and i would imagin it suggest caution on your part in interpret the forecast that we provid you
that is use   thank you
could i just follow up on that   i think the staff provid some veri good inform that in my view is quit respons to the chairman   s concern when they ran a simul with a nairu that is a percentag point below the staff es   mayb you would like to talk about that simul   i think it is a good way of deal with some of these question in term of see how differ some of these
i saw that  that was help
mr  chairman  on the same point  if i may   dave  let me ask the question the way i interpret the chairman   s queri  or mayb i don   t have quit in mind what he         suppos you set the nairu in the model simul arbitrarili equal to the current unemploy rate   that short circuit all of the wage price mechan that come from the gap    is there a mechan in the model that under those circumst will pin down the rate of inflat or the price level or howev you want to put it   or   the whole wage price mechan in the model flow from a gap
in a model in which the nairu in essenc was last period s unemploy rate  i think you would still be abl to pin down inflat   monetari polici will ul  determin the rate of price inflat even in a model with that specif of wage price behavior   i m not sure if there is a mechan
governor   actual had the floor   this is a veri import discuss  so let s do it in a sequenti manner   governor
the dynam are import here  and that is what i was think about   you don t need just the reduc form in some sens  the static one  you need the dynam process   and the disequilibrium process through the gap is the mechan that get you from one inflat rate to anoth   i   m not sure  but i think if you increas the rate of monetari growth in that model and you didn t have the dynam work through the gap  you   d have no mechan to get you from one inflat rate to the other   so  what i would urg
we do have inflat expect
well  if there is no mechan to generat higher inflat  whi would inflat expect go up
we didn t have it in the     s   we had stagflat  which did not involv a gap problem
you can alway produc a seri of shock
that s right   if you have an increas in the price level that s fine  but not if you have an increas in the rate of growth in the money suppli or some s ulus like that  you won t have a determin process
you can still produc a seri of shock for that model that caus the unemploy rate to chang and to creat in essenc a seri of temporari gap  which i think could move the inflat rate
the point here is that i think it would be danger to throw away a disequilibrium mechan that under the inflat wage dynam without have anyth to replac it   that s my concern   the issu is not the natur of the wage price dynam but what the critic valu of that is that give rise to the process   and  of cours  there   s a lot of uncertainti about that   but that   s whi i thought the simul was veri interest   actual  it was a bit surpris that if you put in a nairu that is a percentag point below the staff es   the qualit stori was not that differ
i would just say the reason for that in part is that we see the growth of structur product as requir some increas in interest rate eventu   that is not obviat by a low nairu   that is still there produc potenti inflat if the fund rate is held at it current level
i think there are two sourc of upward pressur on price in this low nairu case  asid from the fact that the current unemploy rate is a tini bit below even the low nairu   one is the depreci of the dollar   the assum depreci of the dollar is a pretti power inflationari forc in these simul part becaus it just continu on and on and on   it s power enough to rais the nairu by     point and probabl a littl more  we     round down to get that     point   so that s one thing that produc upward pressur on price  i suspect anoth thing is that there is some cumul pent up pressur here in the sens that real wage in the past haven t quit caught up with the increas in product   so  worker haven t realiz all the gain of the product increas and as a consequ if product stop grow or stop acceler and the nairu were lower  the labor forc would end up get a littl more in real wage   and that  at least for a while  would put some upward pressur on price   so i think we have some pent up real wage increas and also some further depreci of the dollar in here produc this uptick in inflat
the crucial assumpt here is that the second differ on product goe to zero
actual  i think it could occur if we put the third deriv negat  that is  product could still be acceler but if it were acceler more slowli over  e  the same mechan would work slowli
i grant you your algebra    laughter
i did have a simul run this morn with the op ist assumpt on the suppli side  a low nairu and acceler product  and no depreci dollar   and that is enough to stop inflat from rise  at least for a number of year   but we need all three to stop the inflat rate from rise here
my instinct is that in a model that run off the interest rate  there are no monetari quantiti pin down by this model  the polici assumpt run off the feder fund rate  the price level has got to be indetermin   it just has to be  if you short circuit the price set process by set the nairu alway equal to the current unemploy rate   it     can t be pin down by expect becaus expect have to be pin down by someth that determin the price level
which is usual the monetari author
which is usual the monetari author   so  one realli can t just run a simul on the fund rate and short circuit the wage price mechan
if i may argu  the fact is that the unemploy rate can onli go to zero and there is a gap   you can redefin a structur  which is the unemploy rate minus zero  as a gap and you ll get the same structur respons that you ll get from a nairu model   in other word  a fall in the unemploy rate will creat inflat even without advert to the exist of the nairu in the model   it depend on what you specifi the relationship of compens to   if you just put it liter at the unemploy rate with some coeffici  you ll get the same respons   you have to   the onli thing i am argu about is that where you put the nairu relat to the unemploy rate alter the extent and the rapid of the respons  but not the sign   and that is what concern me with this type of forecast in which i think the direct has to be right  but the order of magnitud is veri crucial to how we respond to it monetarili
clear this is a pretti complex discuss about the model   s properti under differ assumpt
but if you think about what our problem in monetari polici formul are  regrett it   get down to this level becaus we re forecast the futur   and how the futur will respond depend on how we defin the exist structur that is drive the interrelationship in the economi today   and i think it is veri import to be clear on where we as a group believ those relationship are
all i m say  mr  chairman  is that i think there is a differ possibl concept of how these relationship work  which i don t have fulli work out in my mind   i have a sketchi idea  and i don t think it all has to flow through this mechan
clear there are altern mean of do this   i was mere comment about the suggest that when you elimin the nairu  the wage rate and inflat becom indetermin   i don t think that s right  that s all i m say
i don t know whether   reifschneid would know the answer  but i m sure he could produc an answer for us   take a wage equat  dave  in which in essenc there is complet hy esi that say last period s unemploy rate is this period s natur rate   is there a determin inflat rate in the model
no  i don t think there is unless you pin down
pin down   well  the expect becom a function of that relationship
no  i think there is anoth way of do it   one way would be to pin down expect by an assumpt about the respons of monetari polici   but if you don t pin that down becaus you are specifi monetari polici in term of some  i ll just say    arbitrari     feder fund rate  then that  sn t solv out
that is absolut true
i think we are make this discuss more complic than necessari   we are not say     let   s throw away this whole wage dynam model     but rather the question is what is the valu of the nairu   that becom veri import   nobodi could disput that
i don t know if this is go to be help or not    laughter   instead of talk about the unemploy rate  which is a high visibl  high politic figur  i was go to cast the question slight differ   onc a month peopl in a govern agenc go out and take a snapshot of the inventori of individu who are count as will to work  they did someth to tri to gain employ  but were not work   that inventori is about       million peopl   there is a lot of churn in that inventori  a lot of in and out  we get all sort of other inform but we look at that number of       million  and the total stock is grow by about   million a year  and we say     well  that number of       million is too small      we think technolog  search engin  search techniqu  or effici of all sort in inform communic  has move down the inventori of mani item that are need for build car   but you are impli that this inventori of peopl not get a paycheck need to be up around       million  otherwis the price of good rise  or rise at a fa  rate  without repeat what you alreadi said  draw me a connect that tell me that the inventori of unemploy individu need to be       million instead of       million peopl
you have recast the question  but it involv a gross correl in the data that larri was point to  the gdp gap and the unemploy rate and the acceler of price   i would argu that our downward revis to the natur rate of unemploy  from the       percent or so that we had a number of year ago to       percent now  reflect our belief that some of the forc you just describ are inde at work in the labor market   that is  we can oper now with a thinner margin of excess capac  in some sens  that reflect this churn becaus of more effici job search techniqu  more use of temporari help  and a varieti of other factor that in fact have made the labor market more effici   at a macro level  all we are realli ask  in term of this pool of labor  is whether in     the past a certain pool has been associ with an acceler of wage and price inflat  and that s all these nairu es  are realli about   or we can recast the question in term of a slight more comprehens measur of labor market slack   the uncertainti that we show in those confid interv are just anoth reflect of the fact that there is a lot of loos in that relationship  which probabl reflect some of the effect that you are talk about  some of which may prove temporari and some of which may prove perman   we have made our best assess as to how much of that we think is like to be perman and how much has been temporari   but  obvious  there is room both for disagr and consider room for uncertainti
dave  the  book mention that core consum inflat will be boost this year by higher energi price   i assum that next year  as energi price come down accord to the  book forecast  core consum inflat would be reduc   could you give me some idea of the size or the precis effect of that on the core consum inflat rate
rough speak  depend on the particular model that we look at  we think between     and     of the acceler over the past year could be attribut to the indirect effect of acceler energi price   then  in      when those price retrac  we get some of that back  which is part of the reason whi in our forecast we see a more pronounc acceler in core inflat this year and not much further acceler next year  despit the fact that the unemploy rate move up
to tri to understand what is happen to core inflat  i think it   s import to make those adjust becaus  when the effect of energi price are factor in  it look as if we have a realli signific acceler that begin in
the acceler is a much steadier upward process than one see in our forecast  which might give a slight impress that thing are top out a bit in
that   s exact my point   thank you
more on this nairu issu   first  i assum that don kohn is go to talk about chart   in the bluebook   i guess i am one who   not want to throw away the whole nairu model  but i do wonder about the es    i ll point out two thing about chart     one is that the nairu there is about     percent  so it is still abov the unemploy rate we have now   look at the chart in the lower right hand panel  it look as if that differ   not matter all that much  compar to the baselin  for growth in pce price  so i think the other factor don mention may enter into this analysi more than i had thought  one of those  and now i   m go to switch to chart     present by larri    is that if we look at what s go on with unit labor cost in the project  there is actual more kick from the drop in product than from the rise in wage    i probabl should have recogn that  but that chart made it a littl more vivid than i was awar of   so let me ask the parallel question on that   how sure are we of that   what is the model use there   what s go on
as for how sure we are  the answer is our usual answer  there is a wide rang of uncertainti   the model that we use  as you probabl know  is the so call stock adjust model for the demand for labor   so our view  as i note and as we said in the  book  is that even though output growth deceler  hire will continu  as firm that right now are run with veri stretch work forc tri to get their work forc to more prefer oper level   that is the under logic   how confid are we that that   s what is go to happen   well  obvious  there is a wide rang of uncertainti around this cyclic     compon of our product project   it could also be the case that we re too pessimist about under structur product growth  particular total factor product  which could give us some addit boost to overal labor product
and this is a period where we still have a lot of invest come on stream
and an increas share of it is high tech
yes   the slow in overal labor product is all happen  in an account sens  as a slow in total factor product   the capit deepen compon is still surg ahead becaus we are at such high level of invest
in his comment a few moment ago  don kohn point out the degre to which this project also depend on the model   s forecast of a fair signific depreci of the dollar   the first quarter should remind us that the appetit of foreign for invest in the unit state seem to be huge   i doubt that anybodi in this room is more frighten about the current account deficit than i am   but it is not at all clear to me that the deficit could not grow to                 or   percent of gdp and we could still maintain a consider stronger dollar than in the model   there might still be enough peopl outsid the unit state who think this is a much more attract place to invest than the emerg market countri   or  heaven know  japan or even europ with it structur problem   that is just anoth area of uncertainti on top of the uncertainti about the nairu that make one rather humbl about the reliabl of the forecast   i must say that i commend the attitud of this discuss with respect to just how wide the confid interv are
if i might just put a footnot on that   from the point of view of  say  chart   or some of the other  the comparison of the baselin to the altern that is be depict is  loos speak  independ of what we ve assum about the dollar   how much differ the altern make to the baselin is what those chart illustr   the issu of the baselin path that we put in for the dollar aros becaus to get a longer term view  ask the model to extend itself in  e  requir that it not encount explos develop   the model just  sn t behav   and given the paramet driven by histori  we have to put in a sizabl dollar depreci to meet that  if you will  comput criterion   i don t disput anyth don said  but in think about the altern versus the baselin  the aspect the chart focus on  what we had to put in to get the model to resolv the current account problem is realli irrelev
i think a crucial element in here  which carri through to a lot of differ area  is whether we are still to a signific degre involv in technolog expans   if so  the ex ant rate of return on new facil is either high or still rise  and it   two thing   it engend a veri larg increas in capit invest and capit deepen which  other thing equal  move unit cost down   but at the same  e it attract foreign invest to financ the current account   in the simul i suspect we would find that if sudden we took that implicit ex ant rate of return down a few notch  it would creat some truli awesom imbal   in a sens it   s that propens to invest here that i think is a realli crucial issu   and it   s not onli foreign invest here   just look at the backlog of capit invest   it is realli impress at this late stage in the busi cycl  more than we may have even remot imagin   presid broaddus
dave  in light of this discuss  it might be help if you could just refresh our memori about your es  of the nairu as it is now and the kind of confid interv you have around it   i presum there   s an upsid as well as a downsid risk to it  despit the recent experi   it might be help to have that benchmark
our current point es  is about       percent   as i indic earlier  that is down from the       percent to   percent rang we had befor   we do see upsid and downsid risk to that es    in the paper by flint brayton and   reifschneid circul to the committe through don kohn a few week ago  i think they report a rees  of their wage and price equat  their work suggest a nairu of       percent even with the current set of data they   ve been look at   they provid in the paper a varieti of reason for whi we might have experienc this particular combin of low unemploy and low inflat   now  we have other judgment model that produc lower nairus   and we feel relat comfort with a number of the stori that  as i indic earlier  probabl have help to lower the natur rate   but the risk are not one side either
okay  can we start the committe discuss   who would like to begin   presid parri

thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our may meet  the number of report suggest slow in activ seem to have increas  but our assess is that the seventh district economi is still quit healthi given that the

report slow in sale of build materi but also tell us that sale of applianc  electron  and home furnish are still strong  reflect the typic lag in the hous market   light motor vehicl sale have come down from the first quarter   s record pace but are still at veri high level  with the auto maker current es  that june sale will be in the        million to    million unit rang  in term of manufactur  the latest chicago purchas manag    survey result show activ pick up in june  with both product and order move higher   this inform should be treat confidenti sinc it won   t be public releas until this friday  that report also suggest some modest eas in price pressur from may and indic that factori employ declin in june   a nation temporari help firm headquart in our district report that demand for temporari manufactur worker was definit weaker than a year ago  particular in the midwest  although overal demand for worker was still up   more general  our labor market are still veri tight  when give speech late i   m start to get almost as mani question about high gasolin price in the midwest as i am about interest rate   special factor seem to have contribut to larg but transitori price increas   inventori were low to begin with  particular for gasolin that met the area   s new reformul gas requir  and there were a coupl of pipelin disrupt in the midwest   and while few seem to mention this  consum demand for gasolin seem to be stronger than had been anticip   not unexpect  the increas in gas price has spark consider polit interest   the state of indiana has suspend it   percent gasolin sale tax  effect juli    and the governor of illinoi has call a special legisl session to consid do someth similar      last week the chairman attend our board meet at which our chicago and detroit branch director discuss the impact of e commerc and the internet on their compani and their industri   this was a follow up to a similar discuss that we had at our june      meet   and this year we will be compil and distribut a summari to you  as some of you request  the consensus among our director was that there has been a definit acceler in product in their industri over the past three year as a result of invest in inform process equip and util of the internet   their firm have shift their focus toward b b and away from b c applic over the last six to twelv month   in fact  it was report that the number of onlin marketplac nationwid has increas from     to      over the past year   most firm  especi the small and medium size compani  are just begin to scratch the surfac in term of realiz the potenti of the technolog to enhanc product and improv oper   one of our director told us about a new servic that his compani offer that would have been unprofit without the internet   they now make avail to ani use car buyer  whether a consum or a dealer  a complet report on the histori of ani vehicl in the system for a     or     fee   that report includ inform on major accid  retitl of the vehicl as a result of it previous have been total or been in a flood  and so forth   there are about    million use car transact in the unit state annual and about    percent involv car that had major mechan or structur flaw   this new servic is base on inform the compani alreadi collect  which track all motor vehicl titl and registr in the countri  the data are maintain on line and link via uniqu vehicl identif number   the new servic has grown rapid and now has        particip dealer and     other web partner   so  in summari  our director agre that the     new technolog has allow them to lower cost and provid new servic   although they found it difficult to quantifi the valu of these innov  they are convinc that they are veri signific  turn to the nation economi  our outlook for real gdp growth and core pce inflat is essenti the same as that in the  book  although our assumpt are somewhat differ   the intermeet data suggest a modest slow in the pace of econom activ  but i share the  book   s caution against give those data too much weight in the current project   if the next few month show similar sign of moder  then that would be signific  last week we conven a group of academ and busi economist at our bank to discuss the current outlook   the academ argu that monetari polici had been over expansionari throughout      and even perhap earlier   in their view  the current stanc of polici is onli mild restrain and is insuffici to remov the previous polici s ulus   on the other hand  some of the busi economist felt that monetari polici is current quit tight and is larg respons for the recent soften in the report data   a common element in each group   s discuss was uncertainti about the fomc   s current inflat goal   they felt that the committe   s recent shift in focus to the lower pce inflat measur instead of the consum price index had complic matter   but regardless of the measur use  our core inflat forecast are all tilt upward  and that   s troublesom   my own view is that inflat should be lower than our current forecast and that we need to articul that clear as we contempl further action
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in new england continu to be vibrant   the region   s job growth  though below that of the nation  is abov it long term trend  and unemploy in the area is the lowest of ani region in the countri  price as measur by the boston cpi rose in the latest month at a rate better than a percentag point higher than price for the countri as a whole  driven by shelter and fuel cost   in addit  hous price continu to rise more steepli in new england than nation  with vermont lead the region pack with a    percent increas between      and        so the question we   ve been ask is   where is the slowdown   local it seem more evid in the anecdot than in the data   to be sure  the manufactur sector continu to lose job region   export growth of manufactur good  which had acceler quit a lot in       flatten over the year end and the begin of        and studi at the bank indic that the region   s defens intens manufactur busi appear to be lose market share   on the anecdot side  one of the bank   s small bank director report just last week that auto sale in new hampshir seem to have fallen off a cliff   that is about the onli anecdot of slow that i have right now  as for anecdot on the other side  contact tell us that it remain difficult to find worker of almost ani type   plan wage increas are report in a bit higher rang than earlier  especi for high tech worker  and we have start to hear more frequent report of    to    percent increas for various class of worker   season inflow of worker  colleg student  for exampl  have not eas suppli constraint as they had in previous year   rather  as one temporari staff firm owner report     all the new colleg graduat were hire even befor they graduat  and that   s the first  e i   ve ever seen that     on the nation scene  we agre with the  book and just about everybodi els that there is a bit of slow in the work  includ slower consumpt growth  driven by the     interest sensit sector  especi hous  as well as sideway financi market   we talk about uncertainti in the forecast befor  and it was a daunt convers to get into  but there is a rang of uncertainti about a lot of thing   we have a rang of uncertainti about trend product  as well as the nairu and the implic of the trade deficit for the dollar   if we put a lower rate of trend product growth and a lower nairu into what i   m sure is a simpler model than the one use at the board  and assum no further monetari tighten than we have alreadi  we get a slow of real gdp in      to about   percent  that give us a slow to       percent in the second half of this year and growth at about that same rate in        howev  under those assumpt  unemploy remain low and inflat  whether measur by the cpi or the pce  pick up   thus  our sens of the appropri path for monetari polici involv further tighten  though probabl not as much as reflect in the  book  larg due to our lower es  of the nairu  now this forecast  like ani forecast  has risk associ with it  but we think the upsid risk are predomin   first  there is some expect of a slow in pde invest  and while such slow make some sens in the context of the model  i think there certain are some risk that busi invest will grow at a fa  pace than we have in our es   even more import  there is a reason possibl that the sign of slow in the second quarter are a statist aberr born of the mild winter and season adjust that work in the direct of make current data look weaker than they realli are   perhap  as some privat forecast have note  it would be sensibl to keep in mind that if the first quarter and project second quarter number are averag togeth  the growth rate for the first half of the year would be abov near all es  of potenti gdp   that measur may be a better reflect of the current momentum in the economi than the veri latest high frequenc     observ   so the issu to me is not whether the economi is slow now  and good know we want that to happen  but whether this is simpli a paus or the begin of a pattern  our model and the  book forecast suggest that it   s a pattern   but in the last two year we   ve seen second quarter paus   thus  it is probabl wise to be a bit agnost about whether the long await slowdown is final here   and if one is agnost about that  then there may be room for a greater level of concern about the up creep in the price data and about the downsid risk that might be associ with less than vigil monetari polici at this point
thank you  mr  chairman   i would now character econom growth in our southeast region as moder strong  with some emerg sign of slow   let me first indic what is differ and what feel differ from the situat at the  e of our last meet   the most obvious and persist sign of slow are in our residenti construct industri   that industri is extrem import to our region   in fact  two of our state  florida and georgia  are among the five state that produc    percent of the nation   s new hous unit   both the data and anecdot report from director and other contact confirm a slowdown in the pace of construct  which is most pronounc at the low end of the market   other industri in our region that feed off the region and nation hous industri  carpet  applianc  and build materi  for exampl  are also feel some impact from the slowdown in construct   while less of a trend at this point  our contact are now also report some notic falloff in consum spend for big ticket  high end product  our financi institut are tell our lead bank examin that their best day in term of credit qualiti may be behind them and  consequ  there are more report of tighten credit standard and more cautious and less accommod lend   one banker     note that fortun there seem to be few sign of stupid competit   there has been a notic pullback in lend to margin compani  includ real estat deal where the tenant are to be dot com compani   in contrast to these sign of some moder  other sector where we continu to see good to veri good growth includ tourism  most manufactur industri  includ auto maker and auto supplier in our region  ship build  oil product  and commerci construct  while our region employ growth continu to outpac the nation   s and our labor market remain tight  we are get a number of report of some emerg relief in the sector where we first saw tighten  the construct trade   my develop and builder contact say that subcontractor who were often too busi even to return phone call are now begin to call in search of futur work   the new tightest area for skill worker seem to be nurs   the point of greatest price pressur remain the same   clear  health care cost  includ pharmaceut  are escal at a fa  pace and that is expect to continu   and price of petroleum deriv product and transport surcharg have clear risen   basic wage increas are still general constrain  although i continu to hear mani peopl say that the soft cost of various perk and concess to worker are probabl not be fulli measur  on the nation front  i see some of the same earli sign of moder   those appear to me most obvious in residenti construct  where the pace has level off or even slow   two week ago i had occas to make a present and to stay for a candid roundtabl discuss among the director of the harvard univers joint center for hous studi  which is part of their school of govern   that group of some    ceo and other top offici of the largest nation homebuild and their supplier report a mark slow     in the pace of build and futur commit to build   again  the slow is most evid at the low end of the market   that group also report some evid relief in the avail of labor and the percept of some new buy power over their supplier of construct materi  i   m also encourag to see some evid that consum spend is slow  at least somewhat   but if incom gain and confid remain strong  and if asset valu do not erod further  it is not like that consum spend will drop precipit   busi invest spend  at least for equip includ comput and telecommun equip  is like to remain strong   and the relat posit outlook for most of our trade partner suggest to me that demand from the foreign sector could offset some of the slow in domest demand   for me  as other have alreadi suggest  the key question today and tomorrow are whether the tentat sign of slow we see are like to persist and where we are in term of the lag respons to the tighten we   ve put in place over the last year   it   s my sens that the    basi point of tighten that we did at our may meet got peopl   s attent   a moder in some sector and some less accommod financi condit are now show through  as some of our model had predict and as we had hope to see  while i remain concern about the appar upward drift in most measur of core inflat  i continu to think we   ve been at least modest preemptiv   moreov  our bank   s latest model work suggest that we should get a signific further bite from the tighten we   ve put in place   while there is probabl a better than even chanc that we   ll need to tighten at least a bit more  given the upsid risk  our staff work   not indic the need to take rate quit as high as the  book suggest or to hold them so high for so long   i think we could reason stand pat tomorrow and not tighten further  allow us  e to get a better read on     where polici is  so long as we don   t inadvert signal that we   ve conclud tighten and that our work is done   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   some sign of slower growth have begun to emerg in the district   s economi sinc our last meet  most notabl in manufactur   the region   s manufactur activ slow sharpli in june base on report concern both shipment and new order   other sector where modest sign of slow have occur includ retail  bank  and both residenti and nonresidenti construct   employ growth has also slow recent   nevertheless  the district   s economi overal continu to oper at a high level and labor market remain veri tight   unemploy rate in the district are now slight below the nation averag   anecdot evid suggest that tight labor market are increas perceiv by busi as a constraint on growth   our district   s ocean resort area  which normal reli on u s  student to fill summer job open  have need to bring in foreign worker and to recruit senior citizen to offset the shortag of avail student  busi continu to report upward pressur on wage   in addit  increas in health care cost are often mention as an even greater concern   manufactur continu to report rise input price  but mani still note the inabl to pass on these rise cost becaus of competit pressur   some manufactur  howev  have been abl to put through what they call select moder price increas and some have report ad surcharg to their base price base on specif input cost increas   other manufactur have respond to higher input price by search for lower cost supplier  primarili through the use of the internet  as a way to maintain profit margin      comment from busi peopl around the district suggest that good econom  e have made peopl less wari about the riski of some busi ventur   a princip with a ventur capit firm report that there are still plenti of investor look to put their money at risk and plenti of entrepreneur  primarili in technolog  look to take investor    money   but  there is at least some greater attent be paid to how those ventur might becom profit   our contact said he believ the day of irrat exuber are over and now we just have exuber   a banker note that he believ the economi is near a turn point base on his invest index   he observ that when one see doctor and lawyer invest in and open new restaur  a slowdown is usual around the corner    laughter  other banker have note that busi borrow are more frequent fall short of their revenu target and profit project than they were a year ago   despit these concern about risk take and despit recent sign of slower growth  most busi are op ist that the region   s economi will continu to grow at a good pace dure the rest of the year  turn to the nation  our econom outlook for the remaind of the year and for      is similar to the  book   s in term of real gdp growth and the unemploy rate  we are slight more op ist about core inflat but agre that monetari polici will have to tighten further befor we are through   the sign of slower growth in the recent month econom data for the nation are encourag but not conclus   in past year in this expans we have seen sign of a slowdown and then the economi has rebound and grown veri strong again   so  it   s too earli to say that the economi is definit slow to a sustain pace and that inflationari pressur are abat   most measur of inflat over the past twelv month are higher than they were a year ago  suggest that we ought not be complac that inflat will not acceler   what   s more  the most recent increas in oil and gasolin price     will mean higher cpi and ppi inflat figur in the month ahead   in my view the risk of greater inflationari pressur  potenti lead to expect of increas longer run inflat  remain our primari concern   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid jordan
thank you   the best way to summar the sen ent of execut of older manufactur industri in our region is    hostil       follow the surpris strong demand that we saw in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year  it was probabl inevit that the inflect from that  when it came  would catch at least some manufactur by surpris   and they are embarrass  one might say  about have extrapol a pattern that was clear unsustain   as i   ve note befor  manufactur employ in our district is much higher as a share of total employ than the nation averag  and that in turn is concentr primarili in motor vehicl and their supplier   so when truck and auto sale are rise and rise rapid  order book are fill up and everyon is happi   but when truck sale start to declin first  and they have  and then auto sale eas back somewhat  as they now have  inventori rise and new order are weaker   product level in the current quarter are go to be report out as quit good  probabl at record high   but manufactur are veri grumpi about the order book outlook for the second half of the year   steel product in the current quarter and the entir first half was veri high   but in that industri inventori level also are high and rise  and weak incom order togeth with those inventori are put some downward pressur onc again on steel price   a nationwid distributor of carpet and other floor cover has report that sale in this quarter are run about   percent below sale in the same quarter a year ago   that   s in line with what jack guynn was say about hous relat industri   a banker claim that he   s seen a notic slow in commerci loan     demand and he expect overal growth of earn asset to be veri slow to nonexist in the second half of the year  general  labor market in our region were describ by our contact as less tight this spring than previous   a survey of tourist destin around the region  notabl the amus park and other place that typic hire thousand and thousand of young peopl  or increas retire  to work dure the summer month  said that they did not have difficulti hit their hire target this year   they   ve step up their program for recruit foreign employe  up to about one fourth of their total summer labor forc is compris of foreign student they bring in for the summer   it   s now report that one can hire construct worker in ohio   they are avail as long as the employ speak spanish   anoth director report that all the hors farm worker he see in kentucki are spanish speak   we have flexibl labor market  let me turn to the nation economi   a year ago at this  e  get readi for the midyear meet  i was bother by a general lack of caution on the part not onli of banker but their custom  though the banker would usual attribut that attitud to their custom   we would ask the banker how well posit their custom were for an upward shift of     or     basi point in the yield curv   they said their custom    respons would be     you don   t get it   interest rate can never go up again becaus inflat can never go up again becaus we have a new economi a new era    and so on   and even if the banker made a sincer effort to instil a bit of balanc to the custom    perspect of the risk that were involv  the messag was difficult if not imposs to convey   i don   t sens that at all now   i think we have deliv a veri effect and import wake up call to peopl that there are various risk associ with their busi behavior and their household behavior   i think that is healthi and     i believ it will help to sustain this expans   even the post may meet commentari about how high we might have to see rate go  as wrong as it turn out to be  was construct to this process of rebalanc peopl   s assess of the risk   peopl have learn that stock price can go down   they have learn that ipo can fail and that even dot com compani can go out of busi   some busi have learn that sale can declin   and we are probabl go to see that worker will learn that layoff can and do occur   all of that i think is healthi to the kind of decisionmak that we ought to be see  the surg in nomin spend growth in the second half of last year  which carri into the first quarter of this year  was not forecast and was probabl unforecast  unfortun  we may have accommod more demand than we would have like   but it didn   t continu   at our may meet it was onli conjectur that the acceler might have been moder  but the data in the week sinc the may meet have gone in the direct at least of suggest that we may have had an inflect there   while i agre with cathi     s comment about not over interpret the data of recent week or the coupl month of the spring  they do at least point in a slow direct and we ought to be awar of that  and the anecdot stori that i   m hear in my part of the countri suggest that the second half is go to be quit a bit weaker   as we know  surpris can have negat sign attach to them as well as posit sign  let me make a coupl of comment on oil price   even though oil overal is a smaller percent of our gdp than it was    year ago when we were hit by the oil price shock  it   s still a signific factor  when oil price to ani import countri go up  and go up so sharpli  if the wealth lost to us in term of trade is chang there are wealth redistribut effect intern   but probabl more import  there are redistribut effect within     our countri  by sector  by industri  and certain by region   the effect are not at all uniform  a coupl of year ago manufactur in our part of the countri were quit happi with oil price of     to     per barrel   in bob     s and jack guynn   s district they weren   t quit so happi with those price   well  the situat has turn around   mayb it will turn around again  i don   t know   but for the moment we are see a lot of disloc that i think will take some  e to work through the economi   quit asid from the direct and indirect effect of energi price are the effect on various price statist   there are differ implic for consumpt and product  as for inflat trend  i suppos i   m not as worri as some of the comment i   ve heard today seem to be that inflat is definit on a rise trend   that may be becaus a coupl of year ago i never believ that the core inflat rate was as low as indic by some measur   we may have regret that we didn   t lock in a sustain lower inflat rate in an opportunist way  but the domest and intern situat simpli didn   t allow for that  nevertheless  the movement up may be simpli a return to the kind of trend that was actual built in base on basic monetari fundament anyway   so i   m not as convinc that inflat is acceler from where it is
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani other who have comment this morn  in look at the region inform we   ve receiv sinc our last meet i   ve tri to focus particular on whether the district evid is consist with the nation evid that the expans may be slow a bit   and to some extent i think it is   but i have to tell you that the report are still veri mix      in order to get a closer look at residenti construct activ  we contact last week a fair sizabl number of real estat peopl and builder to see what they could tell us  and it   appear that residenti sale and build activ may have peak some  earlier this year in our district   sever builder told us  as did the peopl you talk to  jack  that they have project a big drop in their firm    activ for the remaind of the year   but other told us that to date they have not experienc a substanti soften in demand   a coupl said they still had more work than they could handl   and though i don   t have good hard data on this  the anecdot inform i get on sale of exist home is consist with the nation number releas ye day   sale still seem to be fair strong and price are rise   in the nonresidenti sector  one of our director                                  report that he is undertak a project on which the bid receiv were much  much higher than had been anticip  main becaus the general contractor to whom they are talk can   t find adequ subcontractor  so  that   s the hous and construct part of it   again  the report are mix and do not give us a veri clear pictur at all  probabl the strongest evid we have of diminish activ in our district is in sale of car  furnitur  and other consum durabl   from a number of car dealer we talk to and from our director we have report of weaker car sale  and in one or two case  signific weaker sale   but  as other have mention  it   s veri hard at this point to get a clear sens of whether this is like to be a persist declin or someth more temporari  follow the extraordinarili robust sale increas we had in the first quarter   labor market are still veri tight in our district   report unemploy rate at the state level have drift up slight in some of our district state  so that may mean that the situat is not get ani tighter   but overal we don   t have a sens of ani real sea chang in labor market in our area      my final comment on the region is that we   ve had a lot of report that busi peopl general are much less op ist now about near term prospect than they were earlier in the year  due to all of the thing one would expect  rise interest rate  real estat price  and so forth   but i have the sens that sen ent could turn back up pretti quick if we got a break on fuel price  i think the rise in those price is play a larg role in attitud current  my view are similar on the nation outlook   there are sign that demand may final be moder somewhat  but at this point i think we have to regard these sign as essenti veri preliminari   it   s not at all clear to me  and other have said this  whether the moder is go to persist and we will see a declin in the under trend growth of domest demand or whether it   s just a temporari deceler   in that regard  i think it   s veri import to rememb that we had a    percent annual rate of increas in domest final privat purchas in the first quarter  and in a seri like that  some offset in the next quarter would be expect   so  i think the  book project of real gdp growth at close to potenti for the remaind of this year make a lot of sens   and while the recent data may indic that the risk to the project of real growth may be a littl better balanc than they were two or three month ago  i believ they are still probabl skew to the up side   in contrast to jerri jordan  though  what i see in the price data in a somewhat longer term context is an emerg trend of higher core inflat and deterior prospect for inflat that i find worrisom   i certain would acknowledg that we   re not confront with ani kind of breakout in inflat yet   but as i see it  both the core pce and the core cpi now appear to have move to a higher under pace than in recent month   the baselin scenario that we were discuss a bit earlier show that in a fair number of differ scenario  and in a coupl of case even with a signific further tighten in monetari polici  we get a continu increas in core inflat   further     increas in trend product growth go forward may bail us out   but all in all my guess is that the risk on the inflat front are higher now than we   ve seen in some  e   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   as far as the ninth district economi is concern  the object measur of econom activ remain veri posit   let me just give you one fair familiar exampl of this   over the past year employ gain have continu to be substanti  and unemploy rate in virtual all district state are at the same level or lower than they were a year ago  and they were quit low a year ago   furthermor  this has occur with some sizabl gain in the labor forc   other object measur  whether we look at manufactur  construct  or consum spend  all remain quit posit   the anecdot evid is a bit more mix  i think  and the doubt or concern are come princip from the busi communiti   i would not character the consum in this way  but a number of busi peopl i   ve talk to recent have express some concern about financi market develop   they obvious know that interest rate are higher   they know the cours that polici has been on   they know that equiti valu have level off and in some case declin  i think that has inject a note of caution into part of the busi communiti that i at least didn   t detect a few month ago  as far as the nation economi is concern  it seem to me that the outlook for real growth remain at least satisfactori   for what it   s worth  our var model predict real growth of       to   percent over the next sever year which  if anyth  is a bit below the  book forecast   we also calcul the probabl of a recess with our var  and the probabl are all veri low   so  it take on the    hard land    scenario is the same as that present by dave   and larri        as for the inflat outlook  i   m not sure that nairu is the right framework for assess that   i   ve been struggl with that concept and have been express some reserv about it for some  e   it certain has not distinguish itself recent and i   m not sure that it has distinguish itself much over the past    year or so   but i don   t have anoth framework to offer at this point except to say that  presum  what   s go to happen to inflat over the next year or two is larg bake in the cake alreadi  apart from whatev further sharp gyrat we may see in energi price or someth like that   what will happen to inflat over the next four to six quarter at least is larg bake in the cake and  though it may not be popular to say this  beyond that it seem to me that the money suppli ought to matter increas   that may not have ani unusu polici implic   that is  if one think about what rate of monetari growth is appropri with this kind of econom outlook  the interest rate implic may be about the same as they are if one believ in the nairu framework   but i haven   t work out that exercis  so i suppos i have to leav that as a question rather than a conclus
mr  chairman  my anecdot inform from the eighth district suggest that the situat is larg as it has been  except for some modest  and i emphas modest  slow in the hous sector   i found the report from my contact at fedex and up interest becaus both of them talk a lot with custom about their like volum requir in the fall  which is of cours the busiest season for both firm   in each case they are expect volum to continu veri strong and  if anyth  stronger than it has been   my contact at up said he believ that particular in decemb up is go to be press on capac   the compani plan to work with the firm for which it ship good in order to tri to     move the ship schedul up a bit  but up expect demand to be pretti vigor   i heard the same sort of messag from fedex   my contact from both firm also mention the pressur from rise fuel cost   fedex has had a fuel surcharg in place for some  e and see no effect on it volum from ad that surcharg   of cours  these report from both firm are confidenti  but i was told that up is expect to announc soon a fuel surcharg on it packag shipment  a fee it has not as yet had in place  both firm emphas the difficulti that they continu to have in find entri level worker   although that situat is not new  it continu and  if anyth  has becom a bit more intens   my up contact gave me a realli good sens of what this has meant at his firm  most of the entri level peopl  who sort packag in their hub locat  are part  e colleg student   in fact in louisvill  as some of you may know  up has an arrang with the univers of louisvill for class to be held in the afternoon so the student can work in the middl of the night for four hour unload and load plane   the straight wage for these employe are probabl in the neighborhood of                                                     on top of that for sign bonus  attend bonus  if they stay employ with up for six month or whatev  and tuition reimburs   so the wage cost that are not explicit  those not go out in the paycheck  involv supplement that have now risen to                          which i think is pretti amaz for peopl who are earn                                as the standard wage   and this same contact in louisvill said to give you an idea of the labor forc shortag that they are deal with   i had a similar kind of report from fedex   my fedex contact said that they also are have problem sign up middl manag employe   final  both firm expect their volum to continu to be veri strong  both in their intern and u s  busi      let me go back to our discuss of the nairu and make a few comment  obvious  in a macroeconom model  everyth is simultan determin   so i want to start off by say that i understand that   but i think there are two differ concept of nairu that more or less have the causat run in opposit direct   the tradit nairu formul view the wage price process as run off a gap  a gap measur somehow as the gdp gap or the labor market gap   and the direct of causat goe pretti much from someth that happen to chang the gap that feed through to alter the cours of wage and price chang   i think there is an altern model that view this process from an angl that is     degre around   it say that in an earlier concept  either through a determin of a monetari aggreg or through a feder fund rate polici  monetari polici pin down the price level or the rate of inflat and  therefor  expect of the rate of inflat   then the labor market settl  as it must  at some equilibrium rate of unemploy  where the labor market settl is what milton friedman call the natur rate of unemploy   but the causat goe fundament from monetari polici to price determin and then back to the labor market rather than from the labor market forward into the price determin   i certain view the causat in that second sens   i think it is the willing of the feder reserv to stamp out sign of rise inflat that ul  pin down expect of the price level and the inflat rate   now  the labor market has been clear at a level that all of us have found surpris   but i don   t think that necessarili has ani particular implic for the rate of inflat  provid we make sure that we are will to act when necessari   as long as inflat expect remain well under control and we are will to move  i think that pin down the rate of inflat in an adequ way   i understand that everyth is determin simultan  but i think there are two rather differ direct of     causat that peopl have in mind   in the macroeconom model use here  if we can count on some way to arbitrarili pin down the expect rate of inflat  we can then solv the model quit satisfactorili   again  that   s an assumpt that one put in the model  but i think it flow from the monetari polici that is be pursu   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   let me begin by note that econom activ in the tenth district is still veri solid   have said that  it is also true that we are see mount evid of slow trend within the region   it start with manufactur  which certain has slow  with firm clear report smaller usag of capac   our latest survey of purchas manag in the region  in the front rang of colorado  suggest that manufactur activ is slow fair substanti  at least more so than the nation averag  also  in some of the convers we   ve had  busi execut have indic that some project are be defer   we are also see evid that retail sale have soften   in addit  hous activ  which had weaken in april and may  is report to have weaken in june as well   nonresidenti construct activ remain relat strong  but mani of the execut in that industri are tell me that a more cautionari attitud has emerg and that they are expect some slow as recent interest rate move begin to have a greater effect on them   our energi sector is benefit from the current level of price  especi the gas drill area  which is fair activ   but in that industri  of cours  there has been a downsiz from earlier period  so it is harder to get skill labor for drill oper and  therefor  activ is come up rather slowli   one                                                                 involv in gas drill in a fair signific way say that inventori are low now   consequ  if demand were to     be strong as we go through the year  he feel there will be a surg in price of natur gas as we move into the winter  district labor market still are tight   we don   t hear quit the sens of urgenc about that situat as befor but labor condit clear are veri tight   and price pressur are similar to what we   ve report in the past  there are some effort to rais price but still a lot of competit pressur hold them down   our farm industri  especi on the commod side  remain weak   but with recent addit to govern payment  farm incom will be steadi overal  turn to the nation scene  recent indic  in conjunct with various develop in the district that i   ve mention here  leav me with the veri clear impress that the economi will slow and that recent inflationari pressur should eas over  e  specif  i have revis down my outlook for growth this year and next and am now project about       percent for gdp growth over the forecast horizon   that is onli slight below es  of trend growth   howev  unlik the  book  we get those project with a fed fund rate that remain at it current level   there are a number of reason for this like slow  in my view   one is the moder in stock market gain  anoth is the increas in real interest rate   certain  the elev oil and gas energi price are a factor   and most import from my perspect are our recent increas in the fund rate and more restrict monetari polici   while the evid we are see is still mix  i think we do have more hard statist evid of a slowdown   also  i am hear more view from busi peopl  as in the exampl i cite earlier  that higher interest rate have led to a slowdown in econom activ and a chang in busi sen ent that i think is import      regard the inflat outlook  i am awar that the effect of our previous accommod monetari polici and the passthrough of oil price to the non energi sector are continu and will put some upward pressur on core inflat in the near term   but i am also convinc that we will not necessarili see an acceler in core inflat becaus we have move to a more restrict polici over this past year and that tighten has not had it full impact on the economi as yet   as long as we remain restrict for some period of  e  the increas in inflat should be temporari  i think  rather than perman   i   m look for inflat this year to be under   percent  as measur by the core pce  and to rise somewhat  of cours  as we go into next year   but i don   t see an acceler in inflat   i think we should be mind of that as we contempl polici   thank you
the economi in the eleventh district has begun to show the same sign of slow as the rest of the countri   retail sale deceler in may  which contact attribut to higher interest rate and weak in the stock market   privat employ growth has been weaker  although this may be the result of census worker crowd out growth in a veri tight labor market   higher interest rate continu to further the slowdown in the texa construct industri that began earlier this year   despit the slow in these interest sensit sector  the texa economi overal has been chug along nice   a strong forward momentum stem from the rebound in the energi and high tech sector   the energi sector continu to respond to higher oil and natur gas price   oil price fluctuat have grab the headlin but the strength of natur gas price is the key to the health of the u s  and texa energi industri   environment regul is prompt electr util to stay with natur gas even as it price has risen   consequ  spot price for natur gas have risen sharpli and     the futur market suggest that current price will be sustain until earli        in both texa and the nation natur gas continu to domin drill activ  which should remain strong in the forese futur   on the oil side of the energi industri  strong crude oil price and low inventori of gasolin have combin to push up gasolin price   refineri will be run at capac to keep up with the demand for the durat of the summer   these forc have help the texa energi industri to recov from the depress level of activ in late      and much of       the high tech sector continu to rebound with the resurg of the asian economi   anoth surg of invest in new chip make capac is get under way  especi in austin   that has prompt the austin chamber of commerc to devot it effort to recruit worker instead of compani to move to austin   the wild card in the outlook for the texa economi is mexico   the mexican economi has been quit strong  but the usual uncertainti  and then some  surround their presidenti elect on juli  nd   for the first  e in over    year  the outcom of the elect is too close to call   and the possibl of polit turmoil is contribut again to concern about capit flight and a subsequ devalu of the peso   the cash manag of our san antonio branch recent visit sever border bank and report that mexican are hold increas level of u s  dollar  most like in anticip of anoth peso devalu   if there were to be a correct in the peso   s valu  it would hope be smaller this  e around becaus the central bank has a much higher ratio of foreign reserv to it monetari base  in contrast to the situat they had at the  e of the last crisi   this year   s run up in oil price  of cours  is also help the mexican economi  turn to the nation economi  our project for growth and unemploy this year are pretti close to the staff forecast   but i do see less inflat becaus of continu     product gain and no subsid of competit pressur on price   for next year our outlook is for a continu of growth at a rate compar to this year   s  but with no acceler of inflat   from a polici perspect  the economi is at a delic stage  interest sensit sector are show sign of a slow in demand growth   given that we   ve recent put addit tighten into the pipelin  there could be consider benefit to wait a while to judg the impact of what we   ve done   core inflat this year is about where it was prior to the asian crisi   and absent the inflat spike that show up in the number for march  the inflat trend thus far in        not seem alarm   given that the inflat threat is neither sever nor immedi  the risk of adopt a wait and see postur seem minim
thank you  mr  chairman   it seem to me that this meet is much more about nairu than ani of the other meet we   ve had  at least in the recent past  until now the real economi has been rocket ahead at a seem unsustain rate and there was at least a whiff in the air that under inflat was pick up   now real growth has slow  quit quick in fact  and the sign of acceler in inflat do not look so strong either   it is at least possibl that the fed has alreadi done enough tighten and that we can stand back and examin our work  there are ground for think that we have done enough alreadi   if the long run core inflat rate is about   percent and the long run real interest rate is around   percent  which can be read from either the tip market or inflat correct nomin interest rate  the nomin feder fund rate should be at least   percent for a balanc economi   throw in    basi point for lean against the wind or adjust for the balanc of risk and we are at the     present fund rate   in forecast out at this fund rate  the  book es  that real growth slow to     percent for next year  arguabl close to the staff   s es  of the growth of aggreg suppli   henc  the unemploy rate drop onli slight in the flat fund rate scenario of the  book forecast   even though the  book as a whole   not point to the wisdom of this particular polici approach  it suggest that there is at least the chanc that such an approach to polici will generat stabl  noninflationari growth   but such a monetari polici would be veri unwis if the economi   s unemploy rate is still below nairu  accord to the  book forecast  and even more the frb us econometr model  nairu is still abov   percent  well abov in the case of the frb us model   if nairu realli is that high  we should view the present lull as just a temporari phenomenon and we should still be tighten polici  while i strong believ that monetari polici should be preemptiv and have been general on the hawk    side of the issu when real growth was rocket ahead  for a while now i have not been convinc that the economi   s   percent unemploy rate is much below nairu   in the econometr research you have all heard about  most fix coeffici es  give a nairu of   percent or higher   the kalman filter variabl coeffici es  of brainard and perri has nairu down to   percent   but when the staff tri a similar approach  they still get nairu es  abov   percent   stock and watson  and i suppos  span  find the whole exercis quit unconvinc and argu that whatev the es   it has enorm standard error   much as i like econometr  i   m afraid that i   m on the skeptic side on this issu   the unemploy rate first dip below the  book es  of nairu in late       three and one half year ago   and yet the sign of acceler in either price or wage are still rather scant   we have talk about these sign often and i worri about them as     much as anybodi  but i think    scant    is the oper word   some temporari factor slow the core inflat rate in      and      and these factor have now revers  show up as somewhat higher core inflat in earli        abstract from this revers  there has been some but not that much of a rise in core inflat   unit labor cost have deceler up until now  though larri   gave a disquiet forecast of this measur for the futur   at the same  e he also gave some quiet inform on item in short suppli  nobodi has mention long term inflat expect  but they have been remark stabl  remark unrespons to the oil price increas   in addit  the treasuri nomin real interest rate spread look as if it was increas last month  but it has move back down to fair accept level  let me make one further comment on the hard land scenario   while the risk of recess was the last thing on everybodi   s mind last month when the economi was rocket ahead  the sharp drop in real growth at least rais this issu   given the strength of the present invest boom  i am inclin to downplay ani risk of recess   but the committe should be mind of the risk of overshoot   polici should be preemptiv on the down side as well as the up side  put all this togeth  it is possibl that the fed has alreadi done enough  that the fund rate is alreadi high enough to stabil the economi   but i emphas the word possibl becaus there is still signific risk that the nairu could be in excess of   percent and then inflat could begin to heat up or  in bill pool   s term  that the fed won   t be perceiv as be tough enough on inflat   for now at least  i   m fair comfort revert to our previous watch wait mode  give strong signal that we still think the balanc of risk is     on the up side and that we are prepar to take appropri action if the data becom disquiet   thank you
thank you   mr  chairman  we   ve been seek a slowdown in the expans for a long  e and perhap we have it at last   often when the economi move into what could be a paradigm shift  this committe must go through a period when it is uncertain about how to read the cours of event   this appear to be such a  e when polici decis have to be made   pleas be patient with a    second review of recent histori   in the fall of      we eas polici not becaus a weaken economi call for it  but rather in respons to a loom intern crisi that requir quick  strong action   the pre exist level of the fed fund rate was restor over the second half of       but the eas was no doubt a factor in the strong surg of growth from mid      until now   so far this year we have taken rate     basi point higher  with half of that done onli a month ago   today the eas of    month earlier is go away and the increas of the past five month are kick in   if we believ it is certain that further tighten will be requir  it might be best to push ahead right now   altern  if we believ the opposit  we ought to tell that to the market with a symmetr statement and a no chang direct   but it is probabl not that simpl   we are in what i would call    mayb     e   mayb product will continu to be so strong that cost will stay in line and overh avoid for some  e to come   mayb the nairu in this era is a lot lower than we thought and consequ the danger we perceiv from it is a lot less than we believ  mayb the consum  have bought everyth in sight and run his and her debt servic load back up to the old record level in the process  will continu to buy but at a more subdu pace and thus will extend the moder consumpt pace of recent week   of cours  all these     supposit could flow the other way   mayb consum spend  capit expenditur  and the stock market  join now by export  will go ballist again   mayb  mayb  mayb   all these mayb plus    will buy you a grand size latt at starbuck    laughter  but the good news is that there are some import certainti and near certainti   in my opinion  near certainti number one is that inflat like will creep up further but is unlik to explod in our face over the forecast period   near certainti number two is that sale of hous and auto  two larg cyclic sensit sector  are both slow from their peak and seem like to stay at lower level for some  e   near certainti number three is that the feder surplus is burgeon and will provid a drag on growth at least through the earli month of the next administr  which is our forecast horizon  certainti in my opinion includ number one  while we know littl about it as yet  that there is a slowdown of unknown magnitud present under way   certainti number two  as we know of cours  is that there is a substanti addit impact still in the pipelin from tighten alreadi in place   and certainti number three is that by our august meet we will be in possess of a larg amount of invalu addit data   we will know all about the second quarter  includ gdp  eci  unit cost  and corpor profit   and we will have june and juli employ report  data on consum spend  and inflat number  among other thing  all of this tell me  mr  chairman  that befor move ahead we are in need of more data and some  e to assess it   fortun  both econom condit general and the calendar seem to be readi to accommod us   thank you
as you know  i love talk about macro model and i love talk about nairu  and i like talk about the outlook too   but first thing first   let me start by respond to presid pool s comment about whether there might be two differ model of the causal process of what determin inflat   i think there is onli one model  i may not convinc you of that  but let me tri to explain my reason   the phillip curv is not a model of what determin inflat   the vertic phillip curv tell us that inflat is indetermin in that model   all the phillip curv tell us is when inflat is constant  when it is rise  or when it is fall   it s a model of the dynam of the inflat process  but it s incomplet as a full model  what about the causal from money to price   well  that s veri import   that s an equilibrium relationship  which help to pin down where along that vertic phillip curv inflat will realli be   but what get you from one inflat rate to anoth when money growth chang   we have to have that dynam model   that is what the phillip curv    we need both part   so the problem we have is that even with all of the skeptic about nairu  we should understand that if we throw that concept away  we don t have anoth model at this point  as i think presid  n suggest   that s the problem   now we can still question what the valu of nairu is  but let s think for a minut what would be the situat if we realli believ that nairu was   percent   then i would have to be ask myself   how come inflat is so high   a core cpi inflat rate of     percent on a methodolog consist basi would be the same as it was in        now  dure that period sinc       the unemploy rate was abov nairu   we had all kind of relat price shock that were lower inflat   we got a product shock that was lower inflat   so  how come     inflat is so high   one thing to keep in mind if we don t believ this framework is that it   s not clear whi we would bother to tighten if we want to slow down inflat  let   s move on to the outlook    i think the slowdown that s clear in the second quarter rais two import question for the committe   the first is whether it is a paus or a more sustain slowdown   and if it is more sustain  the question is whether it is suffici to achiev our object of contain the risk of higher inflat   now  i describ the may employ report as incred  mean liter that it is not believ   it is not believ that privat payrol in effect fell off the cliff in may  a cliff that was elev by the sharp increas over the previous two month   that s not to say that there isn t inform content in that report  but it make sens at least to smooth the data to get a better sens of the under realiti   grant  we don t know whether we should smooth it backward or forward   usual smooth it in both direct will be the norm   i think there is plenti of reason to smooth it go backward becaus the economi soar in the previous three quarter to a degre that was unanticip by forecast and their model   so part of this slowdown could simpli be a smooth out of growth to an averag more in line with fundament  in the process take it below the under rate for a while  now  as a privat sector forecast  i have to admit that i was frequent confront by unexpect data  data that contradict my forecast   and in each case i had to decid how much to respond by alter my forecast and chang my stori   i develop two rule that i believ serv me well   now  certain  one could chang the current quarter forecast   the question was what to do about the forecast over the next year or two   rule number one was that when the data disconfirm your forecast  initi you ignor the new data and defend the old forecast   this is not simpli stubborn   well  it s stubborn to a degre   laughter  but     it s not onli stubborn   it also involv the recognit of the volatil in high frequenc data  the difficulti associ with season adjust  and the potenti for revis or revers in the data   rule number two was to know when to say when   that is  when the data continu to contradict the forecast  it is  e to chang the forecast   otherwis  client tend to chang their forecast   and of cours  realli good forecast know when to shift from rule one to rule two  as a forecast  i m still oper under rule number one  and i think the staff appear to be follow the same strategi   as was just note  some slowdown was expect  whether begin in the second or the third quarter  after the unexpect and inde inexplic surg over the previous three quarter   now  part of this slowdown could also be the cumul effect of monetari polici tighten   but i think chart   in the staff s outlook packet suggest that tighter financi condit cannot explain much of the second quarter slowdown  presum  there are good rule of thumb for how policymak should respond to unexpect econom develop   in this case  i don t believ rule number one would be to ignor the new data and continu to set polici base on the old forecast   the new data at the veri least rais the degre of uncertainti about the forecast   and this high order uncertainti may reason justifi a more cautious polici respons to the old forecast   this differ reflect the fact that the forecast is the mode of the probabl distribut associ with the outlook  while policymak should take into account the full probabl distribut associ with the forecast  let me turn to a few comment on the inflat outlook   i was also quit surpris by the veri small increas in averag hour earn in may   it alter my stori  and i hate that      and it interrupt what appear to be a definit chang in the trend in the seri  base on the fact that averag hour earn had increas at a       percent annual rate over the first four month of the year  follow a       percent rate over        with the may data we have a     percent rate over the first five month  so the case for a chang in the under trend is less definit   it seem to me that this stabl pattern in averag hour earn contradict the anecdot report  which have been suggest that pressur for wage chang are build  this contradict was driven home in this room not too long ago when i had a meet with state banker as part of one of the state bank associ meet   it was a day after i had given my last outlook talk   the head of the banker group took out a newspap articl about my talk  which began by identifi me as an inflat hawk   it then went on to report that i had said the data did not yet indic a clear pattern of rise wage gain   he want to have a littl fun with me  obvious  so he said   what kind of a hawk is it who can t see the clear chang in wage pressur in the real world   i m go to help you out  he continu   we   re go to go around this tabl and we re go to let everybodi straighten you out   so  everybodi at the tabl gave his or her stori about how much wage were go up  how mani worker they were lose  what percentag wage gain those worker were get when they move to their next job  and what it meant for recruit and train cost to busi firm   to be sure  their view was that what had happen to date was rais wage pressur and compress profit margin  not increas price   so  i think it s interest that on the wage side the anecdot stori seem to have becom clearer but the data remain mix  on the price side it s just the revers  the anecdot stori about price leverag still suggest that price perform remain fair good   but it seem to me that the data on price are clear and that inflat is rise   it is rise whether one look at overal inflat or at the core     inflat measur   i think presid parri made a veri good point that the increas in inflat to date  in core measur as well as the overal rate  can be pretti well attribut to the primari and now the secondari effect of higher energi price   so the impact of these rise wage pressur has not been definit felt yet on inflat   but in the staff forecast it will be  and that is my judgment as well   therefor  in the context of tomorrow s polici decis  the tentat sign suggest some slow in the economi of yet uncertain persist and dimens  but still with veri tight labor market and alreadi rise trend in inflat
thank you  mr  chairman   i suppos i m fortun that i have never tri to make a live as a forecast becaus it s easier for me to look at the incom data as oppos to tri to throw it out   and base on what i ve seen  my view is similar to what other have said in that i believ there are some earli sign of slow out there   they have appear in the interest sensit sector of hous and motor vehicl   also  and i think import  the most recent incom data suggest that consum confid is start to wane a bit  to me one of the major question about the second quarter has come up a coupl of  e in this discuss   and that is whether what we are see is simpli the slowdown that was to be expect after veri rapid growth in the first quarter  whether it reflect some residu season  or whether someth els is go on   one of the thing i did dure the recent intermeet period was to ask the staff to give me at least a sens of ani evid of residu season   they ve done that   and in what they ve shown to me  at least look at this over longer period  there  sn t seem to be ani systemat trend for the second quarter to be much slower than ani of the other quarter dure the cours of a year   so i think we can probabl     rule out ani systemat season here   i think it is still possibl that what we saw in the second quarter may have been a bit the result of weather relat chang and some other special factor that we can t pick up econometr   but have said that  i d still put a littl weight  and perhap other have as well  on the fact that we see some earli sign of a slow   the other place i would look for evid of slow is in the yield curv from the privat sector where  again use a normal mode of interpret  those in the privat sector seem to be tell us by their behavior that they are see some slow as well  the final thing one might look to for evid of a slow is the interact between these veri high gas price and what one might expect from consum behavior   again  work with the frb us model  it seem as though the increas we ve seen in oil price amount to somewher between     and     billion less money avail for consum to spend go forward   and the effect of that might start to show up as soon as in the next quarter   so i think there are two or three reason to feel that perhap the begin of some slow is actual in sight here  have said that  as other have indic  there also are clear some sign that the slow is not as certain as one might like   obvious the most recent signal that we ve seen with respect to the hous data suggest some uncertainti about this   anoth factor that might give rise to some uncertainti is that financi market condit between this and our previous meet have becom  if anyth  a littl more accommod   net corpor borrow  driven by bond issuanc  seem to have pick up again dure the intermeet period   final  as other have note  there  sn t seem to be much let up in resourc util  particular with respect to the labor market   so we have sign on both side that i think we need to be mind of as we deliber      i have two other point to make here   one is that it   seem  as governor   said  that there is a bit of good news in that most of the indic of long term inflat expect haven t move up veri much dure this period   so i think that give us some sign that we have a littl  e on our side   and final  as the staff present point out and as governor   also note  it is unlik that what we ve seen thus far reflect the full impact of the tighten that has been undertaken   so there is  i believ  a certain amount of tighten impact still left in the pipelin  in sum  there is a sens that some slow is in train   it might well continu if one believ some of the market indic   while it   appear  as governor   indic  that there is some pickup in inflat  it  sn t seem as though a break out is immin or that inflat expect have gone against us   nevertheless  sinc we have work so hard over the last year with respect to interest rate  we may have to do some more tighten   but at this stage i think we could comfort take a bit of a paus  look at the incom data a bit more close  and judg whether or not the slow is one with which we are comfort   in do that we should be care not to signal that we re done  becaus in fact we don t know for sure if we re done   nevertheless  i think we can take a bit more cautious attitud toward possibl further tighten at this stage   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  econom growth in the second district is minusculi slower than it was the last  e we were togeth  but the slow is almost impercept  as i interpret the comment of other reserv bank presid  i think the slowdown in the second district is not as much as that in other district      on the energi question  i had the good fortun to spend about an hour and a half today with the energi minist of                                        and i think his insight are worth share   he feel that there is inadequ emphasi place on the effect from the period of veri low price in two respect   first  the high cost margin supplier were put out of busi and will stay out of busi  so a part of the avail suppli simpli has shut down and will stay shut down   second  the normal level of invest in new suppli was reduc consider  therefor  until about two year from now  when the current invest in new suppli of petroleum and other energi sourc come on stream  he believ we will continu to have a fair high price  unless the gulf produc decid just to increas their output   in his es  they would have to increas product by about       million barrel a day  which   not seem particular like   i note that the gentleman repres a point of view which would prefer that the energi price be in the     to     per barrel area  and he is not veri op ist about see that for anoth    to    month  as for the nation economi  some slow appear to be evid  but i think we have to be a bit care becaus the data gave fals signal of a slow in the second quarter in both      and        that   s not unrel to the fact that we haven t had a serious winter in this countri sinc      and  therefor  the season tend to give off some funni signal   howev  i think we can assum that the likelihood of some slow is there   all of the research we ve done  go back to the earli     s  on how long tighten take to be effect would lead one to believ that veri littl effect of the tighten we ve done so far is in play   that   s especi true if one agre with the view that the first    basi point involv a correct or undo of the eas that we implement  for understand reason  in the fall of        so  if we see some slow alreadi  with veri littl of the tighten have taken hold yet  then i     think it would be reason to believ that the economi will continu to slow over the futur  howev  in my view  the main point is that we should conclud that we have  e to watch and reflect as develop unfold  it seem to me that over the last sever year our best judgment has been that we have been will to be reflect when we have been uncertain   yet at the same  e  becaus of our firm action in      and      and our firm action in the present cycl  includ the most recent increas of    basi point  it seem to me that the feder reserv has maximum credibl   and that give us an opportun to watch and wait when we think that that is the right thing to do  on the nairu  have becom an arch skeptic about it use  i went back and remind myself of what i had said in our discuss in      when i certain sound like a veri true believ in the nairu   so if i have turn agnost  it is a recent chang and the question  therefor  is whether it is endur or whether i think the nairu is on vacat for a while   i think it s probabl the latter and that in fact the nairu is a use tool  which we will find more use in the futur when we are a bit more certain about how it is function and where it realli is  i bring this up larg becaus i think we have to be veri care in our statement about the nairu and about an ideal level of unemploy   if one listen to the discuss today  everybodi here  whether skeptic or believ in the nairu  view it as a tool and not as a polici goal   yet i think mani observ  especi journalist  cannot make that distinct   when we discuss the nairu in our public remark  either in speech or interview  in some case at least we are come across as if we believ that we need to have an unemploy rate of    x     which is consider higher than what we have now  and if we     don   t  there is someth wrong   the congress of the unit state never put us in the busi of have a certain unemploy rate as our goal   so if we want to use nairu as a tool  as i think we certain did in the past  some still wish to  and probabl most of us will in the futur  we ought to be veri care that we re talk about it as a tool and not as a goal   veri clear  and i think unwis  we will lose the support of the american peopl if they think that what we are tri to do is to increas the number of unemploy peopl by       percent of the workforc

there will be sever vehicl   we will see you all at dinner and then again tomorrow morn at      a m   meet recess        morn session
good morn  everyon   we have arriv at the agenda topic relat to the long term rang for the monetari aggreg   as you know  this topic stem from the humphrey hawkin legisl  a term we no longer use except in an histor context   don propos put the long run rang for the monetari aggreg on the agenda as a placehold   but it is my intent  if it is all right with everyon  to forgo both a discuss and vote on these rang   we are no longer legal requir to do that   the committe  as you know  has not been use the rang for the aggreg to guid polici for mani year   inde  in recent year the rang have becom even more question benchmark for money growth at price stabil becaus of the uncertainti about long run product growth and about what exact we mean by price stabil   the rang were a report and account mechan in a part of the feder reserv act that has now expir   and it now seem that the most like outcom of a propos to renew such legisl will requir that we provid semi annual report on monetari polici to the congress but will not includ a requir for annual rang  so  unless i hear object  i propos that we take advantag of this opportun to stop do someth that i sens all of us have becom uncomfort with over the year  establish money rang of question use that no one take veri serious  or at least recent has taken veri serious   it is quit conceiv that such rang may at some point be use again   but i person feel uncomfort engag in an activ of this natur when we do not actual employ the rang for the specif purpos of formul our monetari polici   i think we have to monitor the various monetari aggreg becaus  inde  there is inform in them   and it is conceiv that at some point they will emerg again     with some veri use relationship with respect to opportun cost and incom veloc   at that point  obvious  we will make more use of them   this is not to say that money is not relev for the economi   for a central bank to say money is irrelev is the deepest form of sin that such an institut can commit  the problem is that we cannot extract from our statist databas what is true money conceptu  either in the transact mode or the store of valu mode   one of the reason  obvious  is that the prolifer of product has been so extraordinari that the true under mix of money in our money and near money data is continu chang   as a consequ  while of necess it must be the case at the end of the day that inflat has to be a monetari phenomenon  a decis to base polici on measur of money presuppos that we can locat money   and that has becom an increas dubious proposit  so  unless somebodi has comment or object  this is the way i believ we ought to proceed  but that clear is at the committe s discret   i am mere put the issu on the tabl for discuss
mr  chairman  could i make a quick comment   i don t disagre with your propos   it is certain true that in these meet the oper import and signific of the money target has diminish steadili over the year   and it is tempt to think of drop them as a sort of non event   but i think it is import to keep in mind the role that these target play in a longer term histor context   given the degre of long term correl between money growth and inflat  one can look on the adopt of these target initi in the     s as a sort of implicit agreement between the congress and the fed that the fed was ul  respons for contain inflat   in a sens one can think of these target  as i do  as the closest thing we have to a formal mandat for low inflat   and even     though we have not use them in ani signific oper way recent  they have provid an occas for us to take a longer term  more strateg view of our polici object at least twice a year at these meet   and they have provid at least a whiff of quantit institut account   we lose this  i think  with the laps of the requir that we set these target   in a formal sens it put us in an almost total discretionari oper mode
actual  i agre with that   but i think we can resolv that issu without go through the formal process that has been requir under statut   i don t see ani reason whi we can t have someth on the agenda  which essenti involv a discuss of the long term inflat imbal or whatev we want to call it   don  let me ask you a question on this   we formal went to two day fomc meet for those meet preced the humphrey hawkin tes oni   is it contempl that for the futur we will still have two day meet   do we still need two day   what will we be do in the addit  e at these meet   is there ani reason  for exampl  whi we can t put on the agenda instead of the long term monetari aggreg someth that cover this area in a more generic way so that we could have a present by the staff and a committe discuss
no  there is no reason we couldn t do that   i actual thought we wouldn   t chang the format of these meet signific sinc the committe has been spend at most a half hour or so on the monetari aggreg   just in term of prepar for your congression tes oni twice a year  i thought the committe might want to take a bit longer view  as dave     and larri help to do ye day  and look a littl more deepli below the forecast   i thought the committe would want to continu to do that
so there is no reason whi we can t util the half hour we use for argu about the number and how they are perceiv and instead talk about the real substanc of inflat
yes  there   s absolut no reason
that would certain help me a lot   i think that would be veri desir for the committe to do   i would go one step further   just speak for myself  i would rather see a formal institut substitut for the topic of the money target rather than just a discuss  although i certain think the latter would help   i know we can   t agre on that this morn   we have talk about inflat target befor   that is now a procedur that a number of other industri countri have use with at least some success   there is a pretti broad consensus  i think  in the profess that it is an idea worth look into   we have now had a sustain period of the coexist of low inflat and rapid growth   that experi may have begun to erod the popular attent that for so long has been given to the phillip curv   so  i think this would be a good  e for us to revisit that issu and consid as a committe recommend the adopt of an inflat target at some point
you mean a recommend to the congress
yes  after due deliber and consider here   even if it  sn t fli  it would still provid you with an opportun  mr  chairman  to restat and reinforc a view that i believ is a wide held consensus in the econom profess   that view is that put inflat first give us not onli the best inflat outcom  but also the best output and employ outcom as well
i agre with that last statement   but it is still too soon to make a judgment as to whether offici inflat target actual work   and we won t be     abl to make that judgment unless such target is tri by a divers group of countri and we can determin that those with offici inflat target did better than other   at the moment  one cannot make such a distinct becaus inflat has been down everywher and the result are not suffici dispers statist for us to say that offici inflat target actual matter   that is a distinct issu from that of endors a general overal philosophi  larg base on the last statement that you made  rather than a formal process   but  clear  if we get into a period where inflat rate start to differ among countri and it is evid that those with offici target are do better than other countri  i think we will all grab onto inflat target as an obvious solut   it is veri difficult at this stage to make that case up on the hill   make that effort can t do ani harm  but what will happen then is that those who are realli not all that enamor with keep inflat under control will argu against it   they worri that we can trade off inflat against employ  and there is still a lot of that kind of think up on the hill   so at this stage i don t think we could success move toward a statutori inflat target with the evid that current exist   i suspect that if we eventu get diverg inflat outcom across a rang of countri  with those on offici inflat target regim experienc signific more favor inflat result  then it would be an easi sell   i don t think it is now
i certain respect your point of view  mr  chairman   i would simpli hope that we would keep some inflat target propos at least in our back pocket  or mayb even in our front pocket   i   d look for an opportun to advanc that view becaus for me at least it is an uncomfort situat not to have some kind of institut anchor like that   i think such an anchor is high desir and we do not have one now
i fulli agre   i think the way the statut is written is essenti the result of a congress that over the year has had consider diverg view that they could not squar   and what we got was a statut that was design to do all thing for all peopl so long as it was good   i would be the first to go up to the hill and tri to get someth done if i thought it was even remot feasibl   right now a bill which specif and exclus restrict us to an inflat target would not get through the senat bank committe and probabl would not even get to the hous bank committe for discuss  that   s my view of the state of play   we are go to need more evid befor we move forward on that
we have to build a case
mr  chairman  i was go to make a comment veri similar to the one that al  broaddus made   i think the discuss of monetari target has been a high imperfect way of nevertheless get at an import point on which we ought to have some agreement around this tabl  name  what the inflat target is that the committe itself has in mind   i believ there are diverg view around the tabl as to what the inflat target ought to be   i would rather see our discuss focus on the inflat target itself   whatev the attitud in the congress  we need to have some work assumpt   at the present  e we have differ work assumpt around the tabl as to where we would like to go  say  in the medium term  or in what direct we would like to work   there are some peopl around the tabl who would like the inflat rate to be lower than it has been and is like to be   i would count myself in that camp   i think there are other who are quit satisfi with the current rate or would be will to see it go somewhat higher befor we come down veri hard  in polici term      to tri to do someth about it   so  although high imperfect  i think the discuss of the monetari aggreg has had implicit in the background a focus on the committe s long run object for inflat  which i think it would be desir to clarifi
actual  i   d character the nuanc that are involv in a slight differ way   if we took a vote on whether  all other thing equal  we around this tabl would like to see the inflat rate lower than it is today  i bet we would get unanim   where the differ will show up is at what cost or tradeoff  that   s where the differ will aris   i don t think the issu is a lack of commit on the part of ani of us to get as close to stabl price as possibl   i would presum we are all pretti much in agreement that at stabl price  other thing equal  we get maximum long term sustain growth   the issu  howev  is that there are differ view in this committe regard the actual mechan that is involv and what the tradeoff are with respect to various aspect of the economi  at differ rate of inflat  employ  interest rate  and the like   i agre with you that there are doubtless differ around the tabl on what the cost benefit tradeoff is under certain condit   and until there is a squar of a conceptu framework to which we all adher  there will be differ  for exampl  take the discuss we had ye day about the model   suppos we all agre that that abstract of realiti was a wholli valid view  in a reduc form  of the way the world actual work   in that case  we would all by definit have exact the same view as to where price should be  what the tradeoff are  and the exact mechan that enabl us to get there   my view is that we all have differ idea about how to alter that model  and that exact replic the differ around this tabl on the question of the role of inflat in our complex economi   i see no way to resolv this in ani sensibl manner other than by impos     some artifici number   but everyon around the tabl will be qualifi that number in the back of their mind in one form or anoth   and i   m not sure that help   i do think the basic view among committe member is that inflat is fundament a destruct forc in an economi and a societi  that inflat destroy job  and all other thing equal that a stabl price level  howev defin  contribut to maximum sustain growth  what i   m say in effect is that on a whole seri of general proposit the philosophi of the member of this committe is remark uniform   the differ we have are far less than those in some earlier fomc on which i and some of you have serv   so in that regard we are closer togeth than ani earlier fomc i have been associ with   but ani effort to enforc a sharp  singl  reduc form focus on a specif price level  irrespect of what is requir to get there  will creat margin differ among the member of this group   i don t think we can work with that sort of focus becaus it won t stick   unless we can reach agreement on a veri explicit  reduc form model of the way the economi work  and we all sign off on it and say our monetari polici vote will be determin exact by that particular model  the best i think we can do is to reiter our basic concern about inflat  argu with each other at the margin  and hope get closer to agreement   i do believ that the discuss we have had around this tabl have affect all of us  in the sens of bring us closer togeth   but i would be veri hesit to tri liter to reach agreement on a formal inflat rang of  say    to   percent  or   to   percent  or zero  or what have you  larg becaus i don   t think it is go to add to the effect of the committe   at least that is my view   vice chair
mr  chairman  i agre     percent with the substanc of what you said   let me suggest a procedur   i think there is great benefit to our practic of discuss the goal and strategi of monetari polici in detail twice each year   i say     that becaus at most of the other meet  even though we wander in and out of discuss of strategi  main what we are do is talk about tactic   i would suggest that we not indic in the minut of this meet that we are plan to discuss a formal inflat target   first of all  i have a veri strong view that that is the purview of the congress  not of the fomc   and if it were made public that we were go to establish an inflat target  i believ mani peopl in the congress  and i would be one if i were in congress  would say     well  if you   re go to talk about that  pleas come up here and discuss it with us      i think that would be high counterproduct   i also agre veri much that tri to pinpoint a number that we all agre on would be a specious exercis in precis   even though some of us come at it from differ direct  i realli do believ that the degre of unanim on this committe is quit extraordinari   and in my view argu about a number would be counterproduct  not product
i alway look forward to these opportun to have broader discuss on long term goal and strategi  and i agre with the vice chair that it would be good to do this on a regular basi at each of these two day meet   let me give you a few thought on both the monetari aggreg and inflat target  i agre with presid broaddus and pool that one of the desir featur of our discuss of the monetari aggreg rang was that there realli was in that process an implicit inflat target   so  while we are not prepar to have an explicit discuss and pin that target down  we did it implicit when we set the rang   second  i am one who still believ that there is inform content in monetari aggreg and that they are veri much worthwhil monitor   i quit agre with the chairman s propos   if we no longer have to set     rang for the monetari aggreg for congress as part of the humphrey hawkin process  it would be reason not to set rang becaus we don t pay enough attent to them as a committe to justifi that   as for myself  i do pay attent to the monetari aggreg   i get a brief on them befor each fomc meet   and i m go to ask the staff now to prepar a packet as part of that brief with rang that i feel are more reason and from which the inform content can be extract visual   so i think that is still use to do  in term of inflat target  i make a big distinct between inflat target as strategi  particular when it mean go to a singl object for monetari polici  and set an explicit target for inflat as part of our present dual mandat   i think it is a veri big distinct   there are also distinct about inflat target today as a methodolog  it is an approach to hit inflat as well as a procedur that has a numer target for inflat   i am veri much commit to a dual mandat   i think that is the right way to go   but  as you know  if we think about that dual mandat and how to achiev it from the perspect  say  of the taylor rule  we are forc to put some number in there for our inflat target   i am alway amus to get the    rule packet    becaus when i open it up i see   percent in there   where did that come from   well  that was   taylor s target   so we sit around the tabl and we look at simul from the rule packet base on   taylor s thought on what is the appropri inflat target   i think it might be reason for us to tell the staff what our inflat target is and have the packet done that way  would it realli matter   in other word  are we fight over someth that is not that import   well  i agre that there is a good deal of consensus among us  but there is a rang of view   i have a view  i call it price stabil plus a cushion  that may be a littl higher than some other would have  but i think it is use for us to have coher intern discuss     and appropri transpar regard what we re tri to do   i believ we should tri to agre among ourselv and communic to the public where we are tri to go becaus the public could say they are not realli sure where we are go   is   percent for the cpi just about right  do we understand what that mean and if we achiev that rate for the cpi is everyth fine  or are we realli head for zero   well  that is a big differ   do we know  so  i think at least some further discuss of this issu is worthwhil   and while i don t see us move ani  e soon  i think have an opportun to voic such issu around the tabl when we have these two day meet and to make some increment progress toward a consensus is realli valuabl   i have enjoy this discuss this morn   thank you
i have enjoy the discuss  too   let me cut it a slight differ way   on the inflat target issu i think there are three level on which we can confront this   one is intern in our own head   at that level i actual find inflat target quit use   i have often thought in term of that and in my statement have describ what we ought to do in those term  and i will probabl continu to do that   there is a second level that i would call intern within the committe   i agre with other that twice a year it would be a veri good idea for don to put on the agenda a topic that involv our talk about long run strategi for monetari polici   mayb the design of that agenda item could be someth a bit less pejor  for exampl     anchor of monetari polici    or someth on that order   but i do think it is a good idea for us to have these issu on the agenda for discuss twice a year at a specifi  e   mayb as we do that we will converg on what our target strategi could be and what kind of specif target we might have   perhap we won t converg  but i think the exercis would be good for us and we will learn as we talk whether we can converg      there is a third or extern level  which is the congress   that includ whether congress ought to be give us inflat target and that sort of thing   frank  i have alway thought that these issu are aw subtl and not easili adapt to congression decis  make   if congress give us an inflat target  it is go to be pretti rigid  there are go to be  e when that target is valuabl and there will be other  e when we find it veri rigid and veri confin   so i would get off the train at that point   but on the first two level  intern in our own head and intern within the committe  i would welcom our think about monetari polici in these term  i think that is a good idea   but extern i don t think it s a good idea
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to express agreement with what i take to be the main messag of governor     s remark and also the vice chair   s statement   also  i agre with your propos to move away from vote on rang for the monetari aggreg sinc we haven t realli been follow them veri close   but obvious  as you suggest  i don t believ we would be credibl central banker if we didn t all in our own individu way look at the aggreg at everi meet   and  in fact  i certain did look at them come into this meet   so  i think continu to keep track of them is part of what we are expect to do  with respect to inflat target  i think we should not undercut ourselv  member have express veri clear their support of a qualit inflat target  which is that we want inflat to be so low and stabl that it is actual no more a point of discuss in decisionmak among busi and union  et cetera   and through a combin of good polici and some other factor i believ we have manag to achiev that object and we are     fight now to hold onto it   but i want to make sure we are clear that we do actual have a qualit target  we are not complet without anchor  i agre that it would be use to have a strategi discuss  as governor   indic  twice a year   that seem to make sens   i will say on the quantit target  have spent some  e travel around and talk to other central banker  that as you suggest there  sn t seem to be much evid yet that it lead to better polici   i recent read a speech by lar heikensten  the first deputi governor of the bank of sweden which has a formal inflat target  that suggest that the bank is deal with a coupl of problem   one concern is the risk of lose credibl when they miss that target  either explain whi it was that they chose to miss the target or altern could not bring the economi to hit the target   the second concern they seem to have is that the public believ there is a bit of bias  that the central bank will be more will to let inflat creep up rather than creep down   so they are struggl with a sens of an asymmetr inflat target  i am entir in agreement with you that as we think about this issu we have to be mind that perhap inflat target have built up credibl where there wasn t ani   at this stage we have pretti good credibl   and the other industri economi that have adopt inflat target have discov that while on balanc they may like it  it also creat some problem that weren t expect   so i think we should be veri  veri care about go down that path at this stage   and those problem are in addit to what governor   had to say about a nuanc here  which is that if we go too far down this path  we may discov ourselv handcuf in a way that undercut our credibl and reduc our effect rather than the opposit   so with that  let me stop
ani further comment   well  assum that legisl proceed in the form we expect  whi don   t we endeavor to have such a discuss at the next appropri meet   presum  we will continu alter the focus and get closer to the committe s general view of the type of discuss we want to have   let   s move on then and go to current monetari polici   don  you have the floor
thank you  mr  chairman  as background for your discuss today  you receiv a paper by flint brayton and dave reifschneid that use the frb us model to examin the econom perform of the u s  economi in recent year   not surpris  their work suggest that a continu pickup in product provid the major impetus to the extraordinari run of noninflationari growth   but it was not the onli influenc   the model result also emphas the role of grow feder surplus and an appreci dollar in hold down interest rate and inflat  even as the labor market tighten   the studi was undertaken in larg part becaus we want to see whether the model could shed some light on imbal in the u s  economi that have becom such a promin element in discuss of the outlook and polici  particular intern  in fact  the perform of recent year has left the economi with some potenti troublesom imbal  most notabl  from the perspect of the staff model  the imbal between the level of aggreg demand and sustain suppli   but it has also produc other  subsidiari  imbal between element of spend and incom  includ a larg current account deficit with it result buildup in net foreign indebted  and a low rate of privat save that has been associ with a sizabl accumul of debt by household and busi   the latter two imbal have been stoke by a rise in the dollar on foreign exchang market and a rise in equiti price to level well in excess of those like to be sustain over  e   in the brayton reifschneid studi these asset price and balanc sheet imbal are the natur consequ of the forc that have shape the economi   under reason assumpt on how those forc will evolv  the imbal tend to work themselv out  or at least to stop get wors  without major disloc when you  the fomc  concentr on the    overal macroeconom task of set aggreg demand equal to potenti aggreg suppli   but in real life  the adjust is not like to be so smooth   the risk is that the balanc sheet overhang and elev asset valu leav the economi more suscept to sharp correct that could produc consider econom instabl   concern about this possibl has led some observ to advoc that u s  monetari polici not look sole at overal macroeconom balanc but also pay special attent to asset price or to save invest flow perceiv to be in serious and potenti destabil disequilibrium   in concept  shape polici in part to address these issu direct  while incur a bit of extra econom cost in the form of differ unemploy and inflat rate than would otherwis prevail over the short run  might avert larger cost and more difficult situat later   with respect to asset price  central bank have usual argu that they should not take account of such price beyond factor them into their assess of the overal balanc of aggreg suppli and demand   central bank are not confid they can identifi danger asset price disequilibrium  or that they could calibr polici action to forestal further problem without ad unduli to econom instabl   mani of the same sort of argument about the difficulti of identif and gaug the appropri respons could be appli to polici to address save imbal and debt buildup  moreov  in the case of some of these imbal  it   s not obvious what role monetari polici could play  even if it want to   in particular  rais interest rate is like to have littl effect on the current account deficit   although tighter polici would reduc import by damp domest demand  it also would tend to appreci the dollar  rais the cost of u s  good and servic and shift demand away from u s  produc   so  while the sanguin outcom of brayton reifschneid might seem implaus  there may be littl the committe can do in advanc about potenti problem   instead  your best postur might be to concentr on fo  overal macroeconom balanc  and to stand readi to react to sharp movement in asset price or other spillov from balanc sheet correct when they occur   nonetheless  the committe   s polici choic cannot be divorc entir from consider of the possibl effect of asset price and balanc sheet disequilibrium   assumpt about how they will evolv are an inescap aspect of project the economi and can be an import influenc on the outlook  with     respect to both equiti price and the dollar  the staff has adopt a middl ground in the  book and it extens in the bluebook   we have built in declin in wealth to incom ratio and the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  but we have not made the full adjust to what might look like more sustain level   the fall in wealth relat to incom help to rais privat save  but the declin dollar is a signific sourc of demand and inflat pressur over the forecast horizon   the baselin simul trace out the implic of the  book forecast   sever key judgment about the suppli side of the economi are import in that forecast   one is that the unemploy rate is now substanti below it sustain level   second  that product growth is pick up further this year  but that thereaft growth will level out at this higher rate  the labor market imbal  which persist under the impetus from strong aggreg demand  togeth with the depreci of the dollar and the catch up of real wage to previous increas in product  produc an upward trend in inflat in the baselin unless the committe tighten polici substanti   moreov  sever of the altern simul built off the baselin suggest that even more op ist view of the level and growth rate of potenti suppli may not remov the risk that inflat will head higher under the  book polici assumpt   a lower nairu than the staff   s es  of       or       percent and addit pickup in structur product growth do help to contain inflat over the next few year at current low unemploy rate  but pressur still build   the staff forecast   not embodi the tighten of fiscal polici and appreci dollar that brayton and reifschneid identifi as so import to hold down demand and price pressur from      on   the low nairu   not cancel the need for real wage to rise enough to captur the full effect of the previous increas in product   the cost rais implic of this catch up will be postpon if product growth is head still higher quick enough  but ul  will show through as product growth level out   moreov  higher product growth impli even higher equilibrium real interest rate and the need for polici to tighten by more than in the baselin to keep the result increas in demand from outrun the pace of potenti suppli and ad to inflat pressur   even with a more favor path for potenti suppli  then  the committe might be concern that it will need to tighten further to stop inflat from rise  and befor veri long     if it is intent on keep inflat near current level rather than have it drift higher   skeptic about either the lower nairu or addit upward speed in trend product would tend to add to percept of inflat risk  strengthen the case for action at this meet  as in altern c   in circumst in which labor resourc util was alreadi unusu high and inflat by some measur had alreadi pick up  the committe might not want to take the risk that aggreg demand could rebound  you might desir greater assur that financi condit had firm enough to keep the economi on a slower growth track  especi in light of the eas of financi condit in mani market sector sinc your last meet  market would be surpris by a tighten at this meet   such a strong signal that you did not share their op  on inflat would not onli rais interest rate immedi  but would set the stage for more sober reaction to incom inform than were in evid over the recent intermeet period   if the committe were suffici worri about inflat to rais rate at this meet  it like would view the result path of asset price as more consist with a sustain expans of aggreg demand   howev  as note  the staff forecast rest on a view of continu strength in aggreg demand  suppli side constraint  and dollar depreci   you may see the incom data as at least creat ad uncertainti about these assess   if you are not veri confid of oncom inflat risk  there are reason to paus in your tighten  at least at this meet   in mani of your intern discuss and public speech you have signal that you would like to follow someth akin to a two stage strategi to determin how much tighten you may need to undertak   stage one is damp aggreg demand growth enough to bring it into line with the growth of potenti suppli so as to ensur that pressur on labor resourc do not intensifi   when the clear and present inflationari danger of worsen resourc pressur seem less worrisom  in stage two the committe would then assess whether the result level of resourc util was too high to be sustain   given uncertainti about nairu  you may not be will to enforc a specif view of the appropri level of resourc util without support evid in hand   the evid of slow in the economi  along with the likelihood that a portion of the financi restraint put in place sinc year end has yet to be fulli felt  rais the possibl that     you may be close to accomplish stage one   at a minimum  the incom data have increas uncertainti about the path of the economi and it respons to polici action   an appropri reaction to such an increas in uncertainti is to move polici more gradual  in these circumst  get a

question for don
don  in read the bluebook and listen to you now  it seem that a critic part of the analysi involv a wage lag hypothesi   at a micro level the idea  this is not your languag but the way i interpret it  is that the valu of the margin product of labor as individu has risen but there may be some lag in the percept of this   and as realiti dawn on the worker that he is more valuabl  he   d want to be compens in the paycheck for this  so  what we would expect to observ if that is go on is that for a while return to capit rise relat to return to labor   that is an imbal  it need to be adjust   over  e  return to capit will fall relat while return to labor rise and balanc will be restor somehow   if the owner of the capit and the labor are one and the same  though  that is not an issu   so there is some notion that these are differ particip in this economi and that those who are the owner of capit gain for a while relat to those who are the worker   mayb  at the same  e  in some of our analysi of what is go on in the economi we have someth call wealth effect   there the idea is that peopl in this long sustain prosper have reduc their concern about layoff  have seen various aspect of their current futur consumpt tradeoff alter  and perceiv that their perman incom has risen  in a lifecycl sens they say     we are richer  our     k s are do better  our compani s pension are better  and our probabl of be laid off is lower      somehow they perceiv that they are richer and can afford to consum more in the present as well as in the futur   and thus be richer  even if they perceiv that their wage current have lag behind the increas in the valu on the margin of their labor  if they have a wealth effect in a sens there is no wage lag   there is no catch up and rebalanc of return to capit and return to labor impli  there is no adjust to be made
i agre with the first part of what you said in term of describ what is go on here   basic the initi return from the innov in product accru to the owner of capit  to the busi who wake up one morn and realiz that there are effici generat capit invest and chang in product process they can make  the first thing that happen is that they enhanc their profit by make those innov  by buy that capit invest and tri to expand their oper   and as they compet with each other  price initi are held down   over  e  their effort to expand their oper increas the demand for labor  but that occur with a bit of a lag   so we can depend on the labor demand catch up slowli with the increas profit of busi  as busi compet against each other first in the good market and later in the labor market   price in the good market are less sticki than price in the labor market   so initi the ad demand  sn t drive up the price of labor as much as it otherwis would   but ul  that demand feed through   worker realiz that they   re more product  and both the suppli and demand of labor will adjust to the higher product   you are right in conclud that that type of lag process  a stage process  is what is built into the model   and it   s what we think help to explain whi the product surg first seem to have damp inflat and whi we then expect rise real wage to catch up over  e  as for the second part of your comment  i   m not sure that the effect would be what you suggest   it is true that it is worker who ul  own capit in one form or anoth  but the distribut of human capit and the ownership of physic capit are veri  veri differ  so veri differ peopl are benefit from the increas profit   that   s one thing  second  i think econom effici  in term of the appropri use of labor and capit  would suggest that over  e their price better adjust to the product of capit and the      product of labor if we are go to have the op um combin of util of labor and capit   so despit the distribut of human capit and of physic capit  even if own by exact the same peopl  i think their price would still have to chang in order to give the appropri signal to busi and to labor on the proper mix   they need to know how much labor to suppli to the market and how to mix capit and labor in the product process in order to end up on the product possibl frontier   so i think those price still have to adjust to enhanc econom effici
can i follow up  mr  chairman   i have two point on that   the more we believ that the distribut is quit differ between the owner of capit and worker  and that certain is true to some extent  the more troubl we have with wealth effect argument as the catalyst s ul consumpt   if the workforc and this other group that own the capit are total differ  drive consumpt spend off the so call wealth effect come from technolog innov and rise product is a difficult case to make  the other point  though  is that innov per se involv creativ destruct  reduc the valu of someth old   and it  sn t matter whether it is technolog innov  manageri innov  or whatev   that reduct in the valu of someth old  this is partial analysi  especi if it involv labor substitut kind of innov    not increas the valu of the margin product of at least some worker   and the idea of worker insecur as an hypothesi drive in the other direct in term of whether or not these peopl perceiv that there is a wage lag that need to be rebalanc
i think we perceiv that worker insecur  at least initi in this product pickup  was anoth reason whi wage tend to lag  asid from the sticki of wage relat to price   but one would think that that insecur has been overcom  in light of      an extraordinarili low unemploy rate and veri tight labor market  and has dissip most if not entir   and that should begin to show through  we should begin to see the process of the catch up of real wage to product
don  i think the long run simul were interest and use and help us to consid some of the strateg issu we face   the longer run simul assum that the valu of the dollar fall rather sharpli after       by approxim   percent per year  i think   that boost the path of the fed fund rate that is necessari to contain inflat   we know that project about the valu of the dollar are rather uncertain  and i was just curious about how crucial the size and  e of the dollar   s declin is to the outcom of these simul   it look as if it is a veri signific factor
it is a signific factor and i tri to indic that in my brief   i don t have a simul that has everyth els the same and hold the dollar constant   but as i mention to the committe ye day  i had ask our model to run what they call the    rosi scenario    simul  which had both a lower nairu and fa  product growth with a constant dollar   interest  the lower nairu fa  product growth simul   not obviat the rise in nomin and real feder fund rate in order to hold inflat to  say  around   to       percent   it   lessen the amount of the increas   and if we add the constant dollar to that  have all three of those thing meant that the nomin fund rate could stay around the current level over the next two year and we would still get inflat come in at about   percent   so it   make a big differ   in our judgment  a differ of about a percentag point on the nomin fund rate after a coupl of year would be need to accomplish the same inflat object   i think    son would like to speak to this
i would  in the sens that the   percent number get one s attent shall we say   it is not that we have a view that a   percent declin is necessarili go to happen or that we have even a clue as to when the declin would start or how fast it would proceed   the problem is that in order to do a simul with relationship that defin export and import we have to have in the model their effect relat price and the accumul net invest posit of the unit state  and so forth   those relationship are built on histor experi at this point   we have no altern that we trust that would lead us to go in and adjust those arbitrarili becaus of someth we think is go to happen for which there is no preced in histori   those relationship tell us that ani depreci of the dollar that is less rapid than   percent caus the net invest posit to explod at some point in the futur   and that is just not someth an econometr model can handl   it can t provid us with a use long run simul with someth like the net invest posit extrapol ever fa  to larger and larger posit   so  in order to make the model have other featur that are not disturb by this explod net invest posit  we have to put in a valu of the dollar that keep that invest posit behav   consequ  one reason back and back and back and one end up with that   percent     that mean the dollar will start fall by   percent in      or      or        not necessarili   but there is a germ of truth in this analysi unless we start see in the data someth that say the histor relationship and elast no longer appli   were the dollar to remain strong and were that to give us a more favor outcom on the feder fund rate  it would be creat anoth problem  one that is grow insidi  which is this net invest posit
i actual want to get in on the previous discuss between jerri jordan and don kohn   as i interpret jerri   s argument  it is that we could get a product shock and  perhap becaus of the wealth effect  wage will not catch up   frank  i would like to believ that   i think we would all like to believ that   but in addit to the answer that don gave  a problem i would have with that analysi is this   if the worker is not in possess of physic capit  the way the wealth effect would work is through some sort of expect regard futur earn   and those futur earn are the wage rate themselv   so i don t see where the wealth effect on human capit come from if wage don t catch up   while i would like to share jerri   s op  about this matter  i guess i am with don in believ that eventu wage do have to catch up even to make the wealth effect work
further question for don
may i respond on that
that is not clear to me if part of the manifest of the wealth effect on the part of the work forc is in their right to futur consumpt that is contain in their pension plan  their     k  profit  or whatev
if they have save
their claim on futur stream of consumpt rise and that   not necessarili have to pass through a paycheck
anyth els   if not  let me begin  i think the evid that the expans is slow to a certain extent is pretti much unambigu   usual  a use clue to watch is the relationship between short term forecast of statist that get publish against the actual outcom to see whether the outcom are      higher or lower   we have had a fair signific run of outcom that have fallen below the forecast  and that usual is an indic that someth signific is occur   in the home build area  i think with the exclus of the home mortgag applic number releas by the mortgag banker associ  which beli everyth els we are observ in the hous sector  there is a fair uniform character of the hous market as clear negat and continu to erod except in california   the rise in mortgag interest rate is begin to exert an effect in larg part becaus of the flat yield curv   in the past  arm captur a lot of homebuy who were readi to accept lower short term interest rate and take the risk involv in that   but the option of lower rate is no longer avail becaus the current rate on arm do not differ signific from those on fix rate mortgag  demand for motor vehicl clear is eas  especi after adjust for incent   part of the explan doubtless stem from the gasolin price increas  but i think there is more to it than that   there has been a general view that motor vehicl are prolifer to the point where the number of vehicl per household is exceed the number of peopl in the household   i m sure that is fals  but it sound right   anoth way of put it is that we are inadvert convert a good part of our highway system into park lot  and onc complet gridlock occur no one is go to be abl to find a way to unwind it   that lead me to the household inventori issu   it has been rais in the  book on success occas  and it may veri well be start to exert an effect in the sens that the buildup of inventori of durabl asset held by household is begin to have a feedback effect on consumpt   this would be consist  obvious  with a flatten out of the wealth effect   the data for a slowdown in consumpt outlay are fair conclus in that not onli are sale of motor vehicl go down  but the week chain store figur have been flat sinc the second or third      week of may   if anyth  the chain store number display a slight downward tilt  and they impli that the consum inventori problem may be affect the market for consum applianc as well as that for motor vehicl  what we tend to get as a consequ of the household inventori adjust process is that as final demand for consum durabl soften  we expect to see the effect filter down to the under industri of the old economi   and to be sure  steel product is down   the incipi evid of appreci in steel price has turn around   notion held by a number of old economi produc that they were gain price power seem have stall   we are get the type of economi which  were it not for the under high tech momentum  would correspond to the earli stage of what we would usual begin to worri about as a recess  as an asid  i ought to point out that in the old day we use to worri about more recess than actual occur  the nation bureau of econom research identifi numer peak dure cyclic expans that never turn into recess so they are not offici peak   in other word  if we look at the nber chart and are not given  say     to    month of hindsight  we will identifi about three  e as mani    cyclic peak    as recess that actual emerg   we clear are experienc one of those phenomena now  in ani event  i think the evid of an actual recess at this point is beli by the fact that there is no evid of which i am awar that suggest ani signific deterior in product growth   inde  even the evid that there is a declin in the second deriv  we will get to the third deriv veri prompt  laughter   is not conclus by ani mean  long term earn expect of the secur analyst  which we presum reflect the view of corpor manag  have not diminish   inde  they continu to move up for both the high tech and the old economi firm  actual  there has been a slight downward tick in long      term earn expect for high tech firm  but it is veri small consid the fact that the stock price for that sector have come down so mark   presum  that market declin did damp some view of futur earn  but there s veri littl evid of that in the data  the order come into the capit good compani  high tech  intermedi tech  whatev  have remain veri strong  and backlog continu to build   incident  in a certain sens there is no low tech equip anymor   one would be hard press to find ani old type of equip that is not infiltr with various kind of microprocessor and other high tech compon   even the old weav loom in use today  which goe back to the begin of the industri revolut  would be unimagin to textil worker of    year ago   it is a wholli differ piec of equip   in fact  there are no sizabl number of textil worker anymor  their work is all autom   what we have are softwar writer and comput oper  and the whole product process just basic run   but as i said  what we find is that the backlog are still build up in the capit good industri   what that essenti say is that the prospect rate of return on new facil must still be high ex ant  if not rise  or els peopl are just make invest with no reason judgment as to their basi  these high earn expect are held not onli by domest produc but by foreign investor as well   the reason is that if the rate of return were not hold up in the unit state  the dollar would sure be under veri signific downward pressur  given the sign of the grow current account deficit   so in a sens  the strength of the dollar is an indirect piec of evid that prospect rate of return are hold up and are in fact fair substanti and solid  this lead to a veri interest set of possibl outcom   what we have in the  book in this context is not onli slow econom growth but also slow multifactor      product and as a consequ slow labor product   the latter effect keep the unemploy rate down in the context of a slow rate of gdp growth   this scenario is consist with the begin of a rise in both unit labor cost and the nairu  which we discuss ye day  and that is what is creat an upward set of pressur on price   the altern scenario is that we are inde see some slow in the expans of demand larg becaus of the wealth and the consum stock adjust effect   but it is also perfect conceiv that after the fact we are go to find that multifactor product did not go down  that labor product growth did not slow down  and that inde the unemploy rate went up  not a great deal  but some   but that behavior would be consist  depend on how one view the nairu effect  with a differ price forecast  at this particular point i would say that i know of no evid that conclus would suggest which of those two scenario is true   success  book have been continu forecast a declin in multifactor product growth   and accord  sinc the capit invest has been pretti clear cut and therefor capit deepen has been veri easi to forecast  we end up with a forecast of slow product growth  a slow rate of econom expans  and acceler inflat   that slowdown hasn t happen   multifactor product has been run at a fair strong pace and  if anyth  has been rise   as a consequ  we have two potenti scenario here   and while the structur of the model that we employ for the  book necessit onli one outcom  i submit that it is quit possibl to reconfigur the structur of the model  depend on one   s view of how the real world actual work  and come up with the second altern   in fact  i know we can do that  but i don t think we can realist make a judgment about which of the two scenario is accur   i suspect we may not be abl to until after the fact       given that uncertainti  and echo some of don kohn   s remark  i think we have a fair substanti amount of monetari tighten still in the pipelin  at least if we believ what we say about the lag and if a good part of the soften that has occur in the economi to date is onli modest relat to our monetari polici tighten  there is no question that the increas in fix rate mortgag has been a crucial element in hous   it is not clear that it has been a big deal in motor vehicl  although there is some anecdot evid  which suggest that buyer are back away in part becaus of financ cost   but i am suspici of that as be the crucial issu in the market for motor vehicl   gasolin price obvious are someth we haven t focus on  but the implicit reduct in effect dispos incom associ with the rise in gasolin price is just too larg to be disregard   so a number of forc can be identifi that are slow this expans prior to advert to monetari polici consider   and if monetari polici still has a backlog of tighten effect that could be quit signific  it strike me that  owe to the uncertainti surround the potenti outcom we have in front of us  the wise move at this stage is basic to do noth today  no matter what we do  i believ it is utter essenti that we retain a statement in our press releas express our view that the risk remain unbalanc toward condit that may generat heighten inflat   given how we all weigh the prospect for various outcom  the probabl that we are through tighten in this cyclic expans has to be less than        to be sure  that probabl is higher than it has been   it certain is higher than it was at the  e of the last meet or the meet befor  but we are nowher  as far as i can judg  up to even money on this   and until we get there i think we should be veri care about suggest in ani way that we might be at the edg or even contempl that our move at the last meet was our last in this cycl   vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   the futur market has built in anoth     point at our august meet   i believ that is a reason bet at this  e  but i think the data over the come week will decid that issu and the market will move rate in the appropri direct
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i think we have done a great deal of work thus far and it is not unreason to take a paus  given the degre of uncertainti and the other factor to which you have allud
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   but i would like to add that i hope the statement we releas to the public will be quit strong word   i think this recommend action is exact what the market consensus expect and i would hate to see an over euphor reaction to it  which i believ is quit possibl   we may inde need to tighten more  perhap quit soon and perhap by a consider amount   and i hope we put the market veri clear on notic to that effect
we can do that in one of two way  either in a statement  which presum would be mere a reiter of our previous remark  or in the humphrey hawkin tes oni  where we can sure fine tune it
howev  i would like to see a statement today that is a littl stronger than the word we have use in the past
i   m not sure i would agre with that for lot of reason  but let s hold that and see what the rest of the committe member say
fine   i just want to put it on the tabl
okay   presid parri
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
presid  n
i don t see ani reason to deviat from the pattern    laughter   i support the recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  too   i should note that this was the posit i felt comfort with as i went home for the weekend   and when the bluebook came and i open it  i found that it was sort of argu with me and question whether i should feel comfort with that decis  given my view   it note  for exampl  that this posit would be appropri if i wasn t sure that inflat would intensifi go forward   i guess that depend on what we mean by    sure      that is a word that forecast are loath to use under ani circumst   but i do think that inflat is more like to rise   the next thing the bluebook said was that this posit would be appropri if i was less convinc than the staff that output is beyond potenti   well  i am at least as convinc as the staff that output is beyond potenti   so i am certain struggl with this       then  as if that wasn   t enough  the bluebook went on to say that if you want to take the view that interest rate should go up you should hold the follow view   first  that indic of slower expans are still tentat   okay  i believ that   second  that resourc util is still quit high   well  i believ that  too   third  that some of the earlier financi restraint has been unwound by the recent ralli in bond and equiti market   that is factual true   and fourth  i should be in favor of tighten especi if i believ that growth may have to slow to below trend to unwind the prevail excess in the labor market   well  i believ all those thing  so i did have to struggl more than most with this decis  i don t put extraordinari weight on what goe on at one meet   i think get the direct and the overal respons right is what is realli import   so  i can feel comfort with hold pat today becaus we have move so decis sinc last june and also becaus i believ that the data are like to show the wisdom of move further perhap as earli as by the next meet   and given what we have done in the past  i am confid that we will do what need to be done at that  e and get it done in a  e fashion to insur a favor outcom  so  i support your recommend with the confid that we have taken step to mitig the risk of higher inflat  but also with the belief that our work is not yet done
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman  particular the part that keep the committe on record both in the press statement and in the humphrey hawkin tes oni that the risk are still on the up side   i agre with governor   s point on this  although i would be a littl concern about chang the word of our statement much becaus the market seem to overreact and overanalyz everi word we put in there   so  i      think it is probabl better to stay with a stabl set of word and allow you to fine tune the messag in the humphrey hawkin tes oni  i happen to believ that the recent data with regard to the slow of the economi are perhap a littl less definit than some around the tabl may believ   i also have some level of concern about the employ data   and i agre with you total that it is imposs to discern which of your two model accur reflect what is go on now becaus i don t think we know conclus whether the unemploy rate is go up or down   everyth we see in the market base on real life experi would suggest that the labor market are just as tight as they have been and that the unemploy rate  if anyth  is go down  not up  in ani event  i was concern come into this meet that if we thought inflat was like to rise in the futur  we would be better off act sooner rather than later becaus appropri earli action tend to amelior the longer run effect   but i don t see ani differ between move now or move at our august meet  and by august we will have a lot more data   so  i agre with your propos
mr  chairman  if i could take a bit of  e here  i would like to look more close at the bluebook s baselin forecast   i found it veri help in tri to think through the longer run implic of what we do today   i think it s import that we do that  the baselin is not the onli scenario  but it is a plausibl scenario and it has implic that i think are import and not terribl comfort   the baselin take as a start point that the economi is current oper abov it potenti and it assum a nairu over   percent  obvious  that is question   you question it ye day  and that is perfect reason  but there is certain a good chanc that there is a nairu that we should be think about      analyt in make our decis and that it is  in fact  abov   percent   so i believ we need to consid care what the econom outcom of that assumpt might be   and we also need to consid the cost of that outcom  even if the likelihood of it is now lower than it may have been befor   so if we just accept that provision and follow the baselin  the idea is that we have been abl to oper below the nairu up to now becaus rise product growth has made it possibl for firm to increas wage without push up unit labor cost  now  product growth could  of cours  keep rise and that would tend to bail us out  if i could put it that way   but in a matur economi like this  i think it would clear be unwis to make that assumpt   the baselin scenario   not make that assumpt   it assum that trend product growth continu at it current rate for the rest of the decad  which would mean at some point fair soon an increas in wage and presum in unit labor cost would emerg   in the baselin case then  this impli that the unemploy rate has to move up toward the assum       percent nairu just to keep the core pce from rise abov   percent   and for that to happen  in turn the real fund rate has to go up a percentag point  to summar   that baselin  which again i think is a plausibl scenario  has us rais the nomin fund rate almost   percentag point at a  e when the unemploy rate is rise sharpli   and even that  sn t realli hold the line on inflat becaus inflat move up close to   percent and obvious could go higher   so this baselin scenario  a care work out analysi  with a certain plausibl and possibl outcom  is not veri comfort  and it will be difficult to pull it off  i think  becaus it requir us to rais the fund rate signific at a  e when unemploy is rise   the bad news in my view is that if we are deal with the situat assum in that scenario  then we realli do run the risk of find ourselv behind the curv both with respect to actual inflat and with respect to inflat      expect   that could at some point forc us to take strong action  which could put an end to this expans   so there is a lot at stake  quick  what are the option   one is we could wait mayb not onli at this meet but even longer and hope to get rescu  and that is certain possibl   product growth could continu to rise   also  we have higher credibl now and the nairu may well be below   percent   all of those thing are possibl and also plausibl   but my own view is that if we accept that hypothesi and follow that option  perhap we ought to supplement it with a word of prayer from  e to  e    laughter  our other option  as i see it  is to be more preemptiv and rais the fund rate more aggress befor unemploy begin to rise   market now appear to expect a fund rate approach   percent at the end of the year   earli next year we could move it up closer to  say        percent  and to some degre begin that process now   in that way we might shore up our credibl  keep inflat expect from rise  and limit the amount by which we would actual have to increas the nomin fund rate over the cours of the whole cycl   obvious  this is not without risk   this approach could caus the economi to be weaker than it realli has to be if the assumpt in that scenario are not accur   but with the labor market as tight as they are  that seem to me to be a risk worth take   that   s becaus  and this is realli the key point for me  if we do fall behind the curv and inflat break out  then we are veri like at some point to be in a situat where we have to creat a recess in order to restor price stabil and our credibl   that mean that we will go back to the stop go monetari polici of year past  and i think that is the worst possibl outcom  so  i guess that   s a long way of say that i think a solid case could be made for a further move today   i can certain accept your propos and i understand the reason for it       but i would say that the primari support for that propos has to do with the evid of a slowdown   we do have a lot of data suggest a slowdown  but i think the evid is still quit preliminari so we have to be care about how much weight we give it   i certain think we need an asymmetr direct   i would make this point too   there   s a long period of  e befor our next schedul meet  and in the month of juli we will be get a lot of addit inform on the behavior of the economi in june  which will either confirm the earlier data or not   if some question aris  i think it would be particular appropri in this intermeet period to have a call  mayb at the end of juli or earli august to take anoth look at the situat   i would hate to wait until late in august  a coupl of month befor an elect  and find ourselv in a real bind   so i make that suggest   thank you
mr  chairman  i support your propos   i don t know if we have move as far as we need to  but i suspect that right now there are still a lot of monetari polici effect in the pipelin from the action we have taken here recent that are not yet fulli in play  we ought to let them work and observ where that is take us   and as other have said  a lot of data will be come in over the next sever week that i think will provid us use inform from which to make a further judgment on the effect of our earlier tighten move   one of the side benefit is that our press statement last  e indic that the balanc of risk was on the up side and today we are not act on it  and i believ that is a healthi thing to do as well   so  i think your recommend is a veri good one
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just note veri briefli  i should have ad this ye day  perhap  that in our discuss of differ model and various way      of look at how the economi is work at this  e  i would have join those ye day who express some uneasi about the nairu construct   like our colleagu in minneapoli  and i believ some from other reserv bank  we have been use a var model to tri to gaug differ inflat path given differ fed fund assumpt   our model work suggest that the restraint we have alreadi put in place is go to deliv an inflat path that is close to     basi point lower than we would have had without that tighten   we also ran an experi last week after get the  book and we use the same amount of substanti addit tighten as assum in the  book   our var model suggest that such an aggress degre of further tighten would involv consider risk to the real economi  so there are risk on that side as well  it seem to me  i would join those who have underscor the import of maintain the bias in our balanc of risk statement this  e   as we have heard each other say  we are see not onli the direct effect of the higher rate but mayb even more import a sens of caution and prudenc among the peopl we talk to  as a result of the tighten we have put in place  and i think it is absolut essenti that we keep that in place and not lose it at this point  thank you  mr  chairman
first vice presid stone
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   particular in light of the action taken at the last meet and also becaus the forecast of long run expect inflat has remain stabl  i think we have  e to take a look at whether the economi is truli slow at this point   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for this meet i support the recommend for no action   and in line with the vice chairman s remark ye day  if a recommend to rais the feder fund rate  whether at this meet or a subsequ meet  had an under object of rais the unemploy rate or open up a gap between potenti output and actual output  i would oppos that   i think it is too easi for these kind of exercis and scenario deriv from model to becom object  if not of the committe at least in the mind of some observ   i cannot imagin chart   of the bluebook appear in the monetari polici report to congress   i simpli cannot pictur the reaction if that chart were to be includ in such a document   like governor    in read the bluebook i tri to find out what it was tell me regard what posit i should take   with regard to inflat object  the bluebook tell me that at this meet i should support a    basi point increas in the fund rate with an announc  in line with presid pool   s remark at previous meet that it is not nice to surpris the market  that we will increas the fund rate by anoth    basi point at each of the subsequ four meet this year becaus we plan to rais the fund rate to   percent by decemb   now  the reaction to that would be chao in the financi market   we would not produc the result indic if we did that  of cours   no model would tell us what result we would get becaus we can   t forecast what would happen if we were to announc to the market     basi point of addit tighten between now and decemb   so  i don t know what use the exercis is in guid me as to what posit i ought to be take to support a price stabil object
i agre with your recommend
would the secretari read the appropri languag
the languag come from page    in the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around       percent      and the sentenc go into the press releas would read      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat heighten inflat pressur in the forese futur
