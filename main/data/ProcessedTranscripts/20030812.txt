without object   thank you veri much   dino kos  you   re on
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were just circul   fix incom market in the intermeet period were character by a high degre of volatil  as market particip readjust their

the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     action   that move toward higher expect interest rate acceler on juli    with the releas of the second quarter gdp data  which came in higher than expect  and the continu strength in some of the manufactur and servic sector survey   treasuri yield had declin sharpli in may and into earli june  base on the same set of expect   market particip express their view by put on carri trade along the treasuri yield curv as well as in other sector such as swap  agenc  and mortgag   as these expect were revis  the liquid of posit   aid by some veri strong technic factor that i   ll get to in a second   acceler  and yield rose along the curv   the two year note trade to an intraday high of      percent on august    creat an unusu

subsequ eas back a littl to    percent   similar  the yield on the ten year note move to an intraday high of more than     percent from about     percent or so   the bottom chart graph the    breakeven    rate on ten year tip sinc januari       calcul by subtract the tip yield from the nomin yield   the breakeven rate has travers a well worn rang of between     and     basi point   i would make two point   first  despit the market   s appar fixat on deflat dure the last few week and month  the breakeven rate drift down onli slight and did not get far below     basi point befor revers recent  second  the recent rise in nomin rate has been most an increas in real rate  which could be seen as consist with expect for an improv macroeconom environ   still  the question remain  what were the factor that led to the sharp selloff in fix incom market   while incorrect expect for polici play a role  at least as larg a role was probabl play by the dynam of the mortgag back secur market   unlik earlier cycl  the mortgag market is now larger than the treasuri market   anecdot report indic that a larg percentag of mbs hold are activ hedg by fund manag  all of whom are use fair similar model   the top left panel on page   graph the distribut of mbs coupon as of decemb            the largest concentr of coupon was at     percent   the shade area to the right repres a veri

the backup in yield  mortgag rate rose even fa  than other rate   by late juli  the thirti year fix rate was report by freddi mac in it survey to be at      percent   the most recent distribut of the

the number are still veri larg   on the other hand  this graph   not includ whole loan held by bank  thrift  and the gses  some of which we know are manag activ   nor   it includ the activ of the

mortgag investor   the top panel of page   graph the ten year swap spread  which jump more than    basi point in late juli   scatter report of spotti liquid circul dure this period   but for dealer

middl panel show the standard deviat of the twenti day chang of the swap spread go back to        typic this measur of volatil was veri small  less than   basi point  until      when it sudden spike to about   basi point in the aftermath of the russian default   in recent year  swap spread have becom somewhat less volatil as the spread narrow   in juli the volatil shot up again to a level compar to or higher than that seen in      and mid        occasion rumor circul again about some bad posit and some loss in the dealer communiti  and liquid was report to have decreas as demand for fix payer swap rose   nevertheless  the market general work well   and as shown in the top panel  the spread itself has drop more than    basi point from it peak  mortgag and agenc spread also widen sudden in late june and juli   that is not surpris given the shift in the mortgag market and  in the case of gses  the entiti specif news that buffet them   on the other hand  the corpor market and  for that matter  the equiti market were not notic affect   the bottom panel graph the invest grade corpor spread year to date   although it has tick up in recent day  it move slight lower over the intermeet period and is substanti down from januari     the high yield and embi spread in the bottom right panel show broad similar   and benign   pattern   u s  equiti market on balanc are slight higher and trade in a narrow rang over the period   turn to page    the revers in our bond market is not isol   this page graph the ten year yield sinc april    for the unit state  germani  canada  sweden  australia  japan  and mexico   all of these sovereign yield reach their low in mid june and then rose togeth   while part of the explan may be that the economi are more interrel  the more convinc explan may be that bond market are more interrel and are especi sensit to u s  yield   i have just two minor point to add   first  the ten year yield is now higher than that of the german bund for the first  e sinc may        second  the more than doubl of the ten year jgb yield   from about    basi point to about     basi point at the peak   creat much discuss about the loss on the book of japanes bank   but it was littl more than discuss  in part becaus the ralli in the nikkei  it was argu  offset some or all of those loss   more recent  ten year yield in japan have retreat to about    basi point   the top panel on the next page graph the euro denomin three month cash deposit rate and the rate three  six  and nine month forward sinc mid april   with weak sen ent and downbeat data  the market expect that the ecb would eas polici  which it did on june    cut rate by    basi point   that is not mark on this graph  i should point out   the forward rate suggest that the market expect further eas  though less  through much of juli   howev  as the global bond market selloff acceler  euro area forward rate trend higher and spike on juli    after the u s  gdp report   the nine month forward rate has eas off a bit sinc  the dollar has risen modest against most currenc sinc june  consist with the higher yield and the more upbeat view of the econom outlook   the dollar   yen exchang rate  shown in the middl right panel  continu to trade in the     to     rang that it has been trap in all year   the ministri of financ  mof  continu to interven  buy     billion in the period and

look rather like a straight line sinc januari   but perhap most becaus of the frequent intervent by the mof   the day japan interven in dollar are mark with small box on the red line   turn to page    let me say a word on reserv   the desk has face an unexpect declin in the growth of currenc  as shown in the top panel on the page  that slowdown is due most to reflow from oversea for reason that are not fulli clear   regardless of the reason  the slowdown and the result overal pattern in autonom factor have led us to shrink the system open market account  soma  slight by reduc our hold of long term rps and essenti ceas outright purchas for the  e be   this is the second instanc in the past year when we have had to contend with an unexpect need to temporarili contract soma   we have use the flexibl inher in the long term rp book to do that   but we have found that a book of rps with a matur of twenti eight day at  e   not give us enough flexibl to adjust the balanc sheet on veri short notic   so in order to give us more flexibl  i plan to shift the long term rp book from a typic matur of twenti eight day to fourteen day at our regular thursday oper   the chang is pure a technic measur and   not requir a chang in the author  but i did want to advis the committe befor we implement the chang   we plan to announc this modif to the primari dealer later this month and manag the shift in late septemb   again  the main benefit of this chang would be to provid the desk with greater flexibl in address the demand for bank system reserv over the two week length of the mainten period   we will  howev  continu to arrang oper with an origin matur of up to a maximum of sixti five busi day when reserv need are expect to persist for relat longer period of  e   that is often the case around the year end  for exampl  when the total volum of temporari oper typic peak in respons to season growth in currenc   mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper   i will need approv of the domest oper   if possibl  after i take ani question on my regular report  i would like to make a few comment about ginni mae
on the contract in currenc growth  was that concentr in particular countri
it   s basic everywher   it occur in all region  i believ  except africa   and iraq  as presid parri remind me   there are reflow of currenc from latin america  ea n europ  and all of the other major region
is it possibl a disinfl problem   the rate of inflat is fall everywher   the declin in the growth of currenc seem rather dramat  and it call out for an explan   you   re not about to give it to me    laughter
i wish i could   i don   t know if mr  reinhart has ani insight  but it   s a bit of a my i
i would point out  mr  chairman  that growth in currenc held domest also has been about flat  but that had been grow relat slowli for the last four month  where we get the slowdown is in our es  of the currenc held abroad   that   s a fact  not an explan
well  i   d say that the improv that   s appar in argentina   whether it will be long last is a differ question   no doubt has had an impact in get peopl to use the domest currenc there
that   s the reason i ask if there were ani region or countri concentr  but dino say no
it   s everywher
do we have ani data on shipment of euro   could there be a substitut process under way
i have not seen ani data on that   i don   t believ that the ecb make those data avail if they have them   obvious  the euro is becom use more activ   some countri in ea n europ have currenc board  but i don   t know that that would explain the shift in the reflow of u s  currenc   i don   t believ the size of those countri  which is fair modest  would be larg enough to explain what we   ve seen
we do know that the european central bank has been studi our eci  extend custodi inventori  system becaus they want to make the euro more avail global   so that   s a strategi that they have announc  but we haven   t seen the number yet  as dino said
one thing we could do is to check with the cash product offic   they and new york work close togeth on such issu
it   s veri like that this currenc develop is utter benign and of no signific whatev   but then again  it may not be   the onli reason i rais the issu is that the data may be tri to tell us someth   my view is that  whenev we see a signific statist that is at varianc with our then current model of the way the world work  we shouldn   t readili dismiss it without some understand of it
well  in this case the first thing we need to do is to respond appropri in term of our balanc sheet manag   then  i agre with you  the next order is that we need to understand it a littl better
on the mbs coupon distribut  the date on your chart are not adjust to the actual period when the refinanc or other mortgag loan occur   in other word  there   s a two  or three month lag  so the current mortgag rate is realli not the relev one   or more exact  with these mbs coupon distribut  the relev rate is the current rate but adjust to the point of initi  not the acquisit by the holder of the mbs secur
i agre   i present the pictur in this way for simplic becaus of the difficulti of make that kind of calcul   lock in the close date and the like   which is what one would realli need to do to calcul this with precis   i was not tri to be absolut precis but to give a sens of scale in term of how these mortgag can move in veri larg size into and out of the pool of candid for refinanc  if you will
further question for dino
could you talk a littl about the fail that have been happen   how have dealer been abl to react when there has been a fail so that it hasn   t disrupt the liquid in the marketplac or ad to the volatil
the volum of aggreg fail has been veri larg   it actual has been larger in the aggreg than what we saw in the aftermath of septemb      the biggest compon of the fail has been in the current on the run ten year note   the precis caus is difficult to pin down   certain there seem to be a larg short base in that issu in particular   and in some other as well   which is creat a demand for that specif secur  and the size of that issu is modest  that   s one point i would make   the second thing i would say is that there are no concentr posit  so we can   t point to one or two dealer that seem to be box this   the third point is that the fail have not affect the cash market   that is  even though the back offic hasn   t been settl these trade the way they would be settl normal  that has not affect yield or how the trader are look at the marketplac   what i   m tri to say is that so far it has been a back offic event  it has not migrat from the back offic to the front offic  let me mention two other thing   first  the ficc  the former gscc  did attempt to do a net among it member to tri to clear this up   but becaus that group  sn   t includ nonmemb  the problem basic reappear immedi   so that did not work   the hope is that with the new ten year note that was auction last week  which also will be reopen in a month  there will be enough suppli to clear this up   we   ll see   that may be more inform than you ask for   sorri
no  fail alway worri me when they reach that magnitud   i worri what that   to the day to day function of the dealer
they   ve been function fine   i think the situat has creat concern among some of the dealer that as these fail age  higher capit requir will kick in under the sec   s rule   so there   s been an effort to get some regulatori relief  if you will  on that side
this may be a question that   s imposs to answer  but i   m go to ask it anyway   you mention that the downward trend in ten year yield had a lot to do with our move of onli    basi point and the discuss of deflat in our statement   but ten year yield and mortgag rate had been come down for some  e   the big mortgag lender had to have been wrong in their hedg activ     anybodi have ani sens  independ of our comment about deflat and so forth  what the bounceback in yield might have been sole as a result of the improv in the econom data   i recogn that it   s veri hard to say
i would agre with your open statement that it   s imposs to answer that with ani precis   it   s veri hard to assign percentag to the caus   in my own mind  the dynam in the mortgag market clear were a veri import factor   anecdot  dealer do suggest that some of them in fact believ that so call unconvent monetari polici action might well be implement around the middl of this year   exact who believ what and the respons that those belief trigger is hard
that had to be the frost on the cake or the fuel for the fire becaus i think there was someth alreadi there
well  there was someth alreadi there   but it   s interest to look at the chart on the breakeven rate on page    which i like a lot  in part becaus it suggest that  at least in this segment of the market  peopl were not realli buy the deflat stori   so  yes  there were some disconnect here  and it   s hard to put all the piec togeth in a tidi stori
but that   s the ten year compens note on the first page
i would point out  presid    that there   s some empir work that suggest that hedg flow on the order that we saw over the intermeet period would be associ with a    percent rise in impli volatil on longer term rate   so just to get a sens of perspect  hedg activ  sn   t ul  chang the level of the ten year rate  but it   increas the amplitud   in the magnitud that dino has been talk about  that   s the rule of thumb we   ve been use
further question   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the transact sinc the last meet
i   ll move to ratifi the transact
without object   dino  you want to talk about ginni mae
yes  let me say a quick word on that   the committe will rememb that last novemb you direct the staff to come up with a propos about how we might incorpor ginni mae mortgag back secur into the system open market account   this was part of the altern asset work that we began some  e ago   we   ve essenti complet that work  and we   ve learn a lot from the process   initi i had intend to bring this issu to the committe either at the june meet or at this meet  but other topic took preced  current  with the market   s rather intens focus on unconvent monetari polici measur and also the recent volatil in the mbs market  there is the strong possibl that ani decis the committe might make in this area would be misinterpret   in addit  given the fiscal situat and the slowdown in currenc growth  there realli is no immedi pressur to add to soma   s list of avail asset to purchas   so after some consult with   and in turn with the chairman  the suggest was made to defer consider of this topic until earli next year when the environ might be more conduc   so that   s the suggest that i come to you with today
ani comment   that   s fine   we now move to the econom situat  and i call on     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know from the august  book  we receiv quit a few encourag indic dure the intermeet period   let me mention just a few   sale of light vehicl in juli ran at a      million unit annual clip  up   million unit from the averag sell pace in the second quarter   chain store sale have been on a notic uptrend the last sever week   the data on order and shipment of capit good improv in may and june   moreov  the nation ism index as well as a number of the region purchas manag    report either move up in juli or held steadi at a high level  and earn report for the second quarter general came in to the high side of analyst    expect   by comparison  the list on the other side of the ledger is short   the two employ report we receiv dure the intermeet period both were disappoint   at the  e of the june meet  we had expect that the chang in payrol employ would have been in posit territori in june and juli  instead  it drop        in june and anoth        in juli   the declin in initi claim dure the past sever week has been reassur but  for what it   s worth  our prefer near term filter model see the avail recent labor market indic  includ claim  as point to onli littl chang   up or down   in payrol employ over the next month or two   in line with this view  we assum in the current  book that labor demand will just stabil in august and septemb befor begin to move up at a pretti hefti clip by the end of the year   in econom forecast  the major  sn   t necessarili rule  and in this case we saw the encourag news on the spend side as fight the discourag news with respect to the labor market pretti much to a draw   leav us still expect a mark pickup in the growth of real gdp  from well below the growth of potenti       percent   dure the first half of the year to somewhat abov potenti in the second half   the list of factor support this acceler is familiar from our repeat incant of it   fiscal polici still should add signific to the growth of aggreg demand over the third and fourth quarter even as the sever distress at the state and local level offset a part of the feder s ulus   monetari polici remain support of a pickup in growth  and structur product appear to be on a relat steep upward trajectori   the key question we had to confront in adjust the longer term outlook was how to react to the run up in interest rate that has taken place  as dino discuss  sinc the last meet   there were two dimens to this question   first  for purpos of put togeth the forecast  should we downweight some of the increas in rate as mere reflect an increas in inflat expect  and to that extent not an increas in real rate   if one were to judg from the relat behavior of nomin and index treasuri secur  a good portion of the run up in nomin rate   mayb as much as half   could have reflect an increas in inflat expect  at least in the eye of bond investor   on the other hand  we had to wonder whi  just as inflat compens in the treasuri market seem to be take off  near term inflat expect as report in the michigan survey of consum were drop like a rock and longer term expect were hold steadi   we certain weren   t hear ani stori from the busi sector about the rebirth of price power   in the end  we treat the whole of the increas in nomin rate as reflect an increas in real rate   while inflat expect might have gone up on wall street  the same   not seem to have been true on main street  where the spend and invest decis are made   moreov  it is worth note that at least in some precinct of main street  particular those have to do with hous  even the pure inflat relat compon of nomin interest rate seem to be relev for the determin of demand   a second import question relat to the chang in the interest rate environ was whether we should downweight the negat implic of the run up in rate on a second theori   name  that it might have reflect an improv in busi sen ent  and thus should be interpret as a symptom of fa  growth rather than a caus of slower growth   while busi sen ent might well have improv  we nonetheless conclud that we need to appli our standard multipli to the whole of the increas in rate  for two main reason   first  in a line of thought much like the one we appli to the issu of the real versus nomin split  while sen ent might have improv on wall street  it was less appar that it had done so on main street  hire through earli juli seem to be in the doldrum  and as i mention earlier  the subsequ drop in claim has encourag us to think onli that the declin in payrol has come to a halt   while invest demand has been improv  we have no evid of a dramat breakout   moreov  the indic avail to us were that outsid forecast were not mark up their project  and this impress was corrobor in ye day   s blue chip releas  which report essenti no chang in the consensus growth project for this year and next   second  and perhap more import  we felt that we had to maintain some fidel to our previous forecast methodolog   for better or for wors  we had taken on board the full implic of rate as they stood at the  e of the june  book  not appli ani discount for the possibl that bond investor might have been have their own bout of irrat exuber   given that earlier decis  it would have been logic inconsist in the current forecast round for us onli to have taken on board a portion of the rebound in rate   altogeth  the chang in financi market assumpt over the intermeet period   the increas in interest rate  the stronger dollar  and the lower level of stock price   were a small negat for our project of gdp growth over the second half of this year and slice a littl more than    percentag point from our project of growth next year   in this regard  two other quick point are worth note  first  for all our angst in the current forecast round over the proper interpret of the run up in rate  our latest forecast of real gdp growth   both for the second half of this year and for next year   is virtual unchang from our forecast two round ago  befor the bond market dip and rebound had gotten under way   second  i should caution that  from the perspect of our forecast  the bond market adjust is not over   as you know  market particip current seem to expect that the fund rate will be on a substanti steeper trajectori over the next few year than we have assum in the  book  and long rate have been set accord   if event unfold as we have project  financi market will have some learn to do   in particular  we have assum that over the cours of next year  as inflat continu to edg down even in the context of a vigor econom expans  the market   s fund rate expect will converg substanti toward our   as a result  bond rate will tail off and finish next year about    basi point lower than would otherwis have been the case   i mention this not to claim ani great clariti in our foresight but rather to underscor that bond market mispercept continu to play a role even in the current project   befor leav the real side of the project  i should mention one piec of news that came in after the close of the  book but would not have great affect our think had we known about it   name the histor revis to the bls data on product and cost   as you know from the  book supplement  product growth over the last three year was mark up consider  base on new data show a sharper drop in hour work than previous es    we are inclin to see those revis data for previous year as have littl or no implic for a number of the variabl of greatest concern to you   in particular  they have no implic for the growth of potenti output becaus ani adjust we might make to the trend growth of output per hour would be offset by an equal size adjust to the trend growth of hour   second  they have no implic for inflationari pressur becaus ani revis to the trend in output per hour would be offset by an equal size revis to the trend in compens per hour  leav unit labor cost unaffect   all that said  the growth of product in the second quarter was noth short of stun  and we certain will have to contempl onc again whether our assumpt for the growth of potenti gdp   alreadi appar far abov the market consensus   need to be mark up further   inflat continu to look veri subdu   we were a littl surpris by the extent of the increas in core pce price in the second quarter  but this turn out to reflect an unexpect bulg in so call non market base price   this make us a littl uneasi becaus we believ that measur issu in this compon of the index are especi acut   the market base compon of the core pce price index came in right on our project as of the last  book   in the second half of this year  we expect core pce price inflat to run a littl higher than in the first half  reflect the remov of some factor that we think held inflat down temporarili earlier this year   owner    equival rent was held down relat to tenant    rent by an adjust for util cost  and we expect util cost to be a neutral factor dure the second half of the year   motor vehicl incent rose sharpli dure the first half of the year  and we are assum that they will taper off as we move to the new model year   state and local are in the process of implement some hefti increas in tuition  other fee  and excis tax as part of their drive to restor their fiscal health  and we   ve factor these chang into our think for the second half as well   that said  we see the under trend in inflat as still point downward   with a notic margin of slack in resourc util persist through the whole of next year  we continu to project that core pce price inflat will finish next year below   percent      son will continu our present
the staff outlook for real gdp abroad in the current  book is littl chang from the one we present last  e   again this round we are look for real growth in the rest of the world to strengthen on averag from less than   percent in the first half to about     percent in the second half of this year and to near     percent dure next year   with the calendar now tell us that we are well into august and thus about halfway through the third quarter  you might reason expect that evid of such an acceler should be emerg in the data for real activ abroad   for juli  we are most limit to survey data for evid on product and demand   but it is encourag and consist with our forecast that euro area and u k  pmi report and euro area consum confid figur for juli show improv as do read on u k  busi confid and japanes busi condit for small and medium size enterpris   we have a wider rang of data on real economi abroad for the second quarter  and i scrutin these data for develop dure the quarter that support our project of acceler econom activ   after show weak in may  german manufactur order move up strong in june   french industri product fell signific in april and may but then rebound in june   u k  industri product also strengthen in june   at least in part  both of these index reflect a jump in energi generat that may have been tie to the veri hot summer weather   the preliminari figur for u k  second quarter real gdp show a rebound in growth from the flat first quarter outcom   canadian employ move up strong in june but slip back a bit in juli   in japan  machineri order rose in may and june  and hous start end the quarter with a sizabl increas   among the asian emerg market economi  export order expand in singapor in juli  and industri product in june rebound or strengthen further in sever  includ china  taiwan  korea  and singapor   but to be honest  some indic signal deceler over the quarter  with drop in june in industri product in germani  itali  and japan   japanes gdp  releas this morn  report grew more than   percent at an annual rate in the second quarter  surpris us and most other forecast  particular with respect to export   all in all  my list of confirm data seem far from conclus  and indic from germani and japan appear to be mix   nevertheless  although we detect no basi in these data for an upward revis to our forecast  we saw no need for a downward revis   so we have maintain the same posit trajectori for total foreign gdp that we had present in the previous  book   our read of financi market develop over the intermeet period is that  on balanc  market particip have becom somewhat more op ist about near term activ abroad  confirm our basic view and leav financi condit general support of recoveri   sinc the june fomc meet  euro and  l three month eurocurr futur rate have shift up  remov from market rate expect of further eas on the part of the ecb and bank of england  we see posit market reaction to the most recent indic  along with statement by japanes offici and the ecb about more favor prospect in their respect economi  as consist with our expect that econom activ abroad is alreadi recov from the sluggish pace earlier this year   further gain in equiti price in the major foreign industri countri over the intermeet period reinforc the view that market particip see stronger activ and improv corpor earn as like in the near term   moreov  greater total stock market wealth should have some posit effect on household spend and should provid some s ulus for busi capit expenditur   the japanes topix index rose sharpli in earli juli as foreign investor report augment their hold of japanes equiti   although some of those gain subsequ were retrac  the index is up about   percent sinc the june fomc meet   stock index are also up on balanc over the period in the euro area  switzerland  the unit kingdom  and canada   all of these index remain well abov their recent low in march   ten year govern interest rate have risen as well  with rate in the major foreign countri reach a low in mid june and climb rapid sinc then   market commentari link movement in foreign rate to those for dollar rate  as discuss by dino and    and most foreign rate display volatil similar to that for u s  rate in recent week   this co movement at least in part reflect shift in demand by global investor as expect for futur monetari polici here and abroad evolv and as return on dollar secur rose   howev  long term rate abroad  particular those in europ  move up signific less than did u s  rate   with the except of japan  long term rate are now back about to where they were in late april and earli may   japanes ten year rate  after fall to less than    basi point  have jump back to about    basi point   their level in late decemb   we see these higher rate as lessen a bit the favor charact of financi condit abroad  but the magnitud of the increas are not larg  and the effect are wide seen  even in japan  as more than offset for mani in the privat sector by the rise in stock price   for mani of our foreign trade partner  the expect recoveri in real output growth in the unit state and the associ rebound in the global high tech sector will be critic factor in ani acceler of output   accord  we wrestl with the issu of whether the downward revis for next year in the staff   s forecast for u s  real gdp growth should be reflect in a similar revis for foreign growth  although adjust were made for some countri  on balanc these were offset  leav our figur for averag growth dure next year unchang   two of the element tend to bol  growth abroad are the intermeet rise in the exchang valu of the dollar and somewhat more expansionari fiscal polici now expect for germani and franc    we have rais the project path for the dollar over the forecast period in respons to it recent step up   although we still project a slight downward trend in real term for the weight averag dollar  the stronger valu of the dollar   and thus weaker valu for foreign currenc   now project for each quarter relat to the june forecast impli some boost to activ abroad   in germani  where real gdp growth was like negat for a third consecut quarter in q   the govern has announc it intent to inject some fiscal s ulus  and we have revis up our forecast for      as a result   franc is expect to use the german s ulus as cover for it own somewhat smaller fiscal expans   all in all  the data that have becom avail sinc the june fomc meet  the financi market develop over that period  revis to the u s  forecast  and macroeconom polici shift  both actual and prospect  result in our make mani margin adjust to our forecast for individu foreign economi  howev  those minor adjust left the averag for real output growth and inflat abroad veri similar to that in the june forecast   such an outcom  along with our slight higher path for the dollar  yield an arithmet contribut to u s  real gdp growth from net export of about zero for the second half of this year and about minus   percent for next year   for the remaind of this year  a rebound in export to a moder posit growth rate is crucial for the extern sector to have a net neutral effect on u s  expans   for next year  we see import respond strong  as histor experi suggest  to the project strengthen of u s  econom activ   thus  although we anticip that export growth will remain solid  the extern sector on net should again subtract slight from u s  real gdp growth  that conclud our remark  and we   d be happi to take question
question for our colleagu   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i had a question for   on the ten year  rate look ahead   the assumpt you   re make  which you explain veri thorough  is that we will get a    basi point declin in ten year rate next year   well  suppos it is now next spring and we   ve seen real gdp growth of over   percent for sever quarter in a row   some peopl think that long term rate actual will be turn in the other direct and go up at that point   i don   t think that   s a complet implaus scenario   so i was wonder how you would interpret such a develop next year if it did occur   and what would the effect be on the forecast if ten year rate did trend up and hit  say    percent by the end of next year
we would interpret that as a further tighten of financi market condit   it would certain come as a surpris to us if that were to occur   let me step back a bit and put as clear as i can the contour of rate we see for next year   we have rate eas back  as you note  despit the fact that ordinarili   absent ani bond market level adjust    we   d have a gradual trend up in the ten year rate   the reason that would occur is that the ten year rate is an averag of expect futur short rate and the bond market would be fold in higher rate at the end of the ten year period   so  hold everyth els constant  the ten year rate would be trend up   despit that  our project is that  as financi market particip gradual adopt our view of the outlook for real activ and the inflat process  that rate will come down a littl   if the bond market were to go in the other direct  as i said  that would constitut a tighten in financi market condit   if the increas were on the order of magnitud that you suggest  with the ten year rate move up to   percent  i don   t think that would in and of itself constitut a dramat restraint on aggreg demand   it might mean a coupl of tenth or someth like that over the subsequ four quarter   but that would not be a help develop in term of produc our expect outcom for aggreg demand
the accompani product rate would have someth to do with that particular scenario
inde   i was interpret presid     s question as involv a sort of disembodi upward drift in interest rate   if it were to eman from a differ view about product growth  then the implic might be differ   but even in that case  it might still signal a wider gap than we had been project between actual and potenti gdp
presid  n
yes  speak of product  the number in the  book forecast for next year that jump out at me were the veri larg employ gain and the veri slow product improv   i   d like to know the intuit underpin those project becaus i   m not sure those are the number i   d write down if i were tri to forecast them
the intuit is that  as best as we can figur out  a larg amount of restraint on the part of employ is an import factor at the moment   we think that show up in the sluggish payrol employ gain of recent quarter  and it is mirror by the fact that we have actual product now well abov structur product   in our project for next year  employ are gain confid in the durabl of the expans   our view is that  as their confid rise  they will bring their employ level back into a more normal align with their output  which would generat the kind of employ increas that you have note  that  in turn  would bring product veri gradual back toward trend  though we don   t have the gap between actual and structur product close complet  that gap persist throughout      in our project
dave  for some  e now  market forecast of inflat have been quit a bit higher than the forecast of the board staff or for that matter of the committe member   as an exampl  the inflat forecast for next year of the    lowest blue chip forecast is about    percentag point higher than our  and of cours  the midpoint of the blue chip forecast is even higher   can you explain whi that differ persist for so long   second  are you at all concern that  if other forecast began to line up with our  that develop in itself could put some downward pressur on inflat   it would be an indic that the market   s expect for inflat were chang and we alreadi have a veri low inflat rate
as to whi there   s a gap between our project and outsid forecast  i think part of the explan is that we have a substanti more op ist view about the rate of growth of the economi   s product capac   if one compar our forecast with the blue chip forecast  implicit we have potenti grow more rapid than they do   but that   s not the whole stori   we have the unemploy rate come down as well   we generat less inflat pressur out of that in part precis becaus we are more op ist about product growth   and that greater op  about product growth help allevi ani buildup of inflat pressur in our view   i would note  too  that the data over the last few month have come in to the low side of our project
so we   ve seen noth of late to caus us to call into question either our assumpt about the rate of growth of structur product or potenti gdp or the inflat outlook   as i mention in my brief  the onli surpris we   ve had late was in the somewhat irrit so call non market base compon of the core pce price index   but the market base compon has been quit consist with our expect
well  what about the second point i made   that  if other were to chang their forecast and becom more convinc about the possibl of inflat rate be lower  that could put some downward pressur on inflat rate as well go forward
that   s not an element of our project   it would be a factor put downward pressur on nomin bond rate   that   s in part the mechan by which we see the market and the outsid world learn about or come into line with  if you will  our view of the world   on our forecast  they should see a combin of strong growth in aggreg demand coupl with much lower rate of inflat than they expect   as that happen  the market should bring interest rate down  as i was discuss with presid
to what extent do you think that the recent and presum prospect fuel price increas might offset the tax cut effect in the next six month or so
we certain have assign a big role to the veri sizabl increas in cash flow that are occur   we have dispos incom grow over the second half of this year at near a   percent rate of increas   import  that reflect the     billion in addit cash flow   not at an annual rate   that   s accru to household in the third quarter from the combin of lower withhold  the advanc refund of the child credit  and reduc es  tax payment   so the fuel price increas are a restraint  but they are overwhelm by the s ulus that we think the feder govern is deliv
thank you  mr  chairman   i have anoth question about the shape of your forecast versus the shape of other   the strength of produc    durabl equip spend in both halv of       but particular in the second half  and the overal q  over q  increas is quit remark   now  i grant you that the invest tax credit work it way into the calcul here   but most busi peopl tell me that  regardless of the invest tax credit  they realli want to spend money on equip onli when they actual need the equip  dure the     s there was a pretti sizabl run up in the level of spend on equip and softwar as a share of overal spend   it blip up in associ with y k and came back down again   but it   s at a fair high level still   i wonder about the acceler in e s expenditur that   s built into this forecast  a    percent increas in the second half of next year seem like a lot
it is an import driver of the contour of our forecast   but i   d come back exact to your statement that firm will ramp up invest onli when they feel they need it   it   s that kind of logic that has led us to be rather restrain in our assess of the prospect for the second half of this year   a lot of the anecdot inform that we have suggest that firm at the moment are deliv those nice surpris to earn import through cost cut measur and not through capac expans
by next year  with a veri strong acceler in busi output  we think firm are go to be feel the need to engag in a substanti expans in their e s spend   the import of that factor is illustr in one of the altern simul in the  book   that simul indic that if a surg in invest   not come through   we did the experi with respect not onli to e s spend but expenditur on structur and inventori as well   the pickup in overal activ next year will be substanti attenu
yes  and then the number  at the top level anyway  would start to look more like the mainstream of the blue chip forecast
if there are no further question  who would like to start the roundtabl   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the seventh district economi is still sluggish   mani of our contact  as well as the avail data  indic that the midwest has been underperform the rest of the nation   nevertheless  we are see a few sign of improv  we   re hear that more firm are releas fund for capit expenditur  main for mainten  repair  and replac of exist equip   inde  some produc of agricultur and construct equip are now see order pick up and price firm  howev  mani busi seem to be focus on meet near term goal   their plan horizon are short  and their expans plan remain cautious  we survey some of our contact regard the impact of rise interest rate  and the result were mix   mani homebuild and realtor indic that potenti homebuy move quick to close deal befor rate went higher   in contrast  refinanc activ has plung accord to mani of our bank contact    automak have yet to see much effect from higher rate   as you know  light vehicl sale rose sharpli in juli  with a surg at the end of the month  when the incent were increas   one manufactur told us that the industri has now fallen into a pattern of increment boost or layer incent as the month progress   while the automak continu to lament their relianc on discount  they are encourag that consum are onc again respond to these incent  the automak and other contact remain concern about the sustain of consum demand  given the stubborn weak job growth   while labor market in the seventh district did not deterior  there are few if ani sign that hire is pick up   both of the larg temporari help firm that we contact indic that order remain flat through juli  and these firm continu to believ that the bls data signific overst the gain in temporari help job   the bls has chang it sampl procedur in a way that give less weight to the larg temporari help firm  and at least one of the compani headquart in our region plan to meet with the bureau to discuss the discrep   we recent receiv the result from manpow   s fourth quarter survey of hire plan   the survey show a modest improv in hire expect from the third quarter but they are still below those of a year ago   these data are confidenti and will not be releas until septemb     which coincident is the day of our next fomc meet  turn to the nation outlook  sinc our last meet we   ve seen that household spend is hold up  capit expenditur are show more life  and inventori are so low that we should soon get a boost to product as firm restock   furthermor  tax cut are show up in peopl   s pocket  and there is plenti of liquid out there to support higher spend   to be sure  the juli employ report was weak   howev  the fall in initi claim over the past few week is somewhat encourag   the increas in long term rate is a concern  but our feel is that the current level of interest rate will still support a pickup in real econom activ   so  while we   ve yet to see the strong growth need to close resourc gap  recent develop on balanc are broad consist with the solid second half that we forecast in june   therefor  i view this as a  e for us to wait and watch

excess inventori of summer good   discount has been fair widespread as retail attempt to clear the way for fall merchandis   retail continu to describ consum as worri about job secur and cautious in their spend   and retail firm do not expect the recent enact tax cut to provid much of a boost to sale   auto sale remain steadi in juli  but cautious dealer have brought inventori more in line with desir level than they have been in the last coupl of month   the residenti real estat sector is still strong but not as strong as a year ago   some bank in our region have seen a slowdown in mortgag applic   commerci real estat market remain soft  with littl chang in recent month   in sum  i would character the tone as cautious op ist   the outlook of the region   s busi communiti remain posit  with most of our contact expect steadi or slowli improv condit  turn to the nation economi  we have seen an improv in econom condit sinc our last meet  but the second quarter   s     percent increas in gdp overst that improv   the surg in defens purchas last quarter is unsustain   even with that  growth was still a percentag point lower than potenti and not strong enough to generat job growth   labor market continu to disappoint   while initi claim have dip below         per week  they remain high enough to suggest that net job destruct is continu  there are some posit  howev   busi fix invest rebound in the second quarter  and the data on new order for nondefens capit equip suggest that busi invest in equip  particular comput  is like to continu to strengthen   growth in consum spend pick up in the second quarter  although much of that was driven by incent on auto   auto inventori are now suffici lean that manufactur probabl will increas product in the third quarter even if sale declin somewhat in august and septemb  manufactur is stabl to up slight  although the recent rise in oil price  if sustain  may damp activ   the tax cut is now show up as reduc withhold and higher take home pay  which should help s ul the economi   monetari polici is veri accommod  and the real fed fund rate has fallen sinc our last meet  although we   re not there yet  the economi is pois for stronger growth in the second half of the year   financi market indic also point to such a resurg   inde  bond market particip have built in a fair sharp rebound in econom activ  as was point out this morn   i think they   re over op ist   in fact  i have some concern that the recent rise in long rate will retard the incipi strengthen we are see   but i suspect that long bond yield will eas off a bit as trader begin to realiz that we will need to maintain a low fed fund rate for longer than they now expect   we may want to emphas our resolv in today   s statement   thus  i would want to see more sign of a rebound  particular job growth instead of continu job declin   given the posit sign we do see  today i think we are about where we need to be on monetari polici  befor close i will note that concern about deflat and the risk of hit the zero bound have diminish somewhat sinc our last meet   howev  i   m not sure that our public statement have help illumin the situat veri much   we are tri to walk a veri thin line here   on one hand  we want to convinc market that we are pois to do whatev it take to keep the economi from slip into deflat  on the other hand  we don   t want to suggest that such a scenario is a probabl one   i   m gratifi that we will be discuss our communic strategi sooner rather than later  as i think it can onli becom more import as the recoveri

thank you  mr  chairman   report from the fourth district are consist with the stori of the u s  economi   slow  steadi growth and slowli improv condit  coupl with mix econom signal and still a great deal of linger anxieti   the one bright spot in the fourth district   s econom scene is lebron jame   he   s the high school basketbal phenomenon who was the number one draft pick in the nba   the cleveland cavali draft him and have sold a lot of season ticket as a result   and this young man hasn   t play a game for them yet   the reason i   m bring this up is that lebron and i attend the same high school    laughter   clear  the more recent akron st    graduat is have a greater impact on the cleveland economi than the one who graduat mani year ago  the drive forc behind the linger anxieti in the fourth district is china   i haven   t been abl to have a singl convers with a member of the busi communiti recent without that convers slip into a discuss about china and it rapid growth as a u s  trade partner   i have to say  though  that the busi peopl i talk to don   t speak about china as a busi partner but rather as a sourc of intens competit   last year the unit state import as much from china as from japan  although we export far less to china than to japan   mani of the manufactur are complain that it is difficult to export to china becaus of trade impedi and becaus china unfair peg it currenc to the u s  dollar  i interpret the preoccup with china that i   m encount in the busi communiti as a proxi for the expans of the global trade order  of which china is but a part   that expans in global trade and the intern linkag are clear affect the decis that busi peopl in our district are make   some of them are reconfigur their suppli chain to sourc good from compani abroad   other are locat their product facil in foreign countri   for mani manufactur compani in our area  all that   s left in the district are assembl and test   the price of item produc in china and elsewher are clear affect our firm    price strategi   the econom emerg of china and other develop countri appear to be forc adjust in the capit and labor market in mani nation  not just our  and this process is go to take mani  mani year to play out  i suspect that today u s  capit spend  product  and employ are weaker than otherwis would be the case and that relat price of manufactur good are also lower as a result of this phenomenon   busi person i speak to have indic that make capit expenditur decis in this environ has been veri complex   for some manufactur compani  the product capac locat in the unit state may no longer have the same econom valu as it onc did   and we   re see an increas in corpor merger  acquisit  and restructur that are all part of this process  intens foreign competit is probabl also an element in understand whi the higher dispos incom that we see and the monetari accommod that exist have not yet total been translat into greater domest product and employ   my busi contact are tell me that there is busi out there  they   re just not get it   these stori appear to have been confirm  as was mention earlier  by the excess of final sale over gross domest product now evid in the second quarter number   if this anxieti that i   m hear about from our district manufactur is pervas throughout the countri  it may be that the pickup in busi fix invest will not materi as quick as forecast in the  book   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   not a lot has chang in the new england economi  but the tone of comment and attitud  especi about prospect for the second half  has brighten a bit   to be sure  the labor market remain in the doldrum  with unemploy stabl in june and employ level still on the declin   other measur of the labor market are weak as well  with initi claim rise and help want advertis suggest that hire activ is declin   residenti real estat market remain strong even in the face of rise interest rate  like becaus peopl are tri to get their mortgag loan befor interest rate go up further   and commerci vacanc rate have stabil  albeit at high level  state and local govern continu to deal with deficit problem by signific reduct in servic and increas in revenu   there may be no new tax  but as an exampl  about      billion in new fee and charg help to narrow the deficit of someth like    billion in massachusett for        so a signific amount of fund are come in the form of new sourc of money from the state   s populac  as with the nation  gloom about current condit appear to be offset somewhat by a modest op  regard the futur   consum and busi confid suggest expect of better condit by year end   in addit  the index of lead indic for the massachusett economi has been in posit territori for four month  predict growth in the economi over the second half   this pattern of less stellar current growth with some op  about the futur was particular evid in convers with region manufactur   for most of the more than one dozen compani contact  current result were either flat or margin lower in the first half of       but loss were abat   obvious  the result vari by industri  with pharmaceut and medic product experienc solid rate of revenu growth  aerospac busi mix  and revenu at manufactur of technolog relat good  chemic  and busi servic product unchang or lower  despit current condit  op  about growth in the next two quarter and beyond prevail among these manufactur   competit remain keen  and compani believ that their cost cut and restructur has been signific enough to enabl better profit growth through the rest of this year and into        in that regard  mani believ that sale have reach a trough in their industri and that slow but steadi growth could be on the horizon   technolog again is the except   mani softwar and equip manufactur spoke about two issu that have been mention by other today   the first  as presid parri said about california  is that the high tech job that are leav the new england region are not like to come back   the second  as mention by presid pianalto  is the concern in the technolog industri about china and india   that   s where the job are go  and most peopl don   t expect those job to come back   so there are concern about the long term abil of the economi to expand in the technolog area  in equip and softwar in particular   uncertainti is a factor for everyon  to be sure   as one contact put it     thing aren   t get wors  and they may be get margin better  but it   s too soon to tell     there may also be tentat sign of a pickup in local econom activ that we see through the bank system   larg new england bank are begin to see some increas in loan demand  and the shift of loan into problem status continu to decreas   this contrast a bit with the discuss about bank credit in the bluebook and other staff materi   in part there may be some bifurc between lender to share nation credit borrow and other c i lend   for the share nation credit loan  there continu to be a great reduc willing to lend  especi by foreign bank  which play a relat larger role in these credit in the      s and experienc a greater share of the loss as well   for smaller c i loan  bank seem to be readi and will to lend  as wit both by the anecdot we hear and by comment from respond to the senior loan offic opinion survey   whether this willing to lend portend a much brighter pictur go forward  howev  remain unclear  for the nation economi there are uncertainti as well   growth in the second quarter was surpris strong  but most of the surpris was in automobil purchas and govern spend  though it is true that equip and softwar purchas show some sign of life as well   but we   ve seen growth surpris befor in this bumpi recoveri   one is remind of the third quarter of last year  when gdp jump to a   percent pace on the back of consum spend on durabl   again  auto   and then slid to a     percent pace in the fourth quarter   i don   t think that   s necessarili go to happen again  but it   bear keep in mind  certain  feder govern spend has been strong  and fiscal polici remain in a high s ul posit  though state and local spend cut subtract from this   monetari polici is s ul as well  though market volatil and a steeper yield curv have subtract from that as well   combin with polici s ulus  consum spend indic  new order data  improv in some confid measur  low inventori level  rise profit  and product all suggest that increas strength in the second half of this year is all but bake in the cake   labor market remain weak  to be sure  and growth dure the second half is not like to eat much into excess capac   thus  the unemploy rate seem like to stay at it relat elev state  and inflat could trend down  the big question is  after a third quarter and mayb fourth quarter burst  where is this economi go   will it proceed on the path describ in the  book  with a sharp acceler in       or on a path that settl down to about potenti along the line of most privat forecast and our in boston as well   i don   t have a clear answer to this question  but i   m not sure one is necessari right now   for now  a polici driven acceler seem assur   it will not be suffici to absorb much excess capac or to reduc unemploy  but it could acceler the process of eas the restraint and caution that is so palpabl in corpor america  market took a bit of a wild ride in may and june in part becaus they becam convinc  for whatev reason  that yield would move onli in one direct   but they appear to have stabil a bit and the current level of rate   reflect  at least to some extent  a sens of market op  about futur growth  the best thing we could do right now  in my view  is to leav well enough alon  that take me to the issu of communic   clear  what we say has assum an import that is in mani way unfortun   in part that   s becaus the outlook has been so uncertain  an inflect point is near by most peopl   s es   and the market are look for a sens of guidanc about it   thus the entir bodi of our communic   the post meet statement  speech  tes oni  and news articl   is be perus more close than ever befor  at least dure my  e on the committe   we   re go to have a chanc to talk about this issu in septemb  and i  like a lot of you  am look forward to it   howev  whatev our decis today  this scrutini of our communic place a higher premium than usual on what we say in our public statement   i would strong suggest that we keep our statement as short  simpl  and familiar as possibl
thank you  mr  chairman   on balanc  econom activ has pick up a littl in our district over the past sever week   consum spend appear to have acceler at least a bit   tourist relat activ  in particular  has shown some renew strength in our region despit the wet weather   somewhat in contrast to what you said about the southeast  jack    mayb all the tourist are visit the fifth district for some reason  residenti construct and sale are still strong  and there are at least a few sign of a pickup in busi capit spend  although a lot of this involv replac of comput and relat high tech equip rather than someth more fundament  perhap most signific though  a develop that is strike in our region is what i would call a fair pronounc shift toward greater op  about the near term outlook among our busi contact despit the recent run up in long term interest rate   for exampl  one of our bal or director  who regular survey    to    peopl in the heavi construct and industri sector of the economi  told us at the last bal or board meet that his contact were more op ist than at ani  e in the three or four year he has been on the board   and the manag of a restaur that my wife and i frequent made a point of come over the other night to tell me how great busi was   on sever occas recent  spontan comment like that have been made to me   i suppos that reflect at least to some extent the initi impact of the tax cut   it   s a littl eeri  though  becaus when peopl make those type of comment to me they seem to be look for confirm from me that happi  e are either alreadi here or just around the corner   i did buy a more expens glass of wine that night   laughter  but that   s as far as i would go

the one sector in my area where op  is still scarc    actual nonexist   is the old line  tradit manufactur industri such as textil and furnitur in the  ina   most recent  the pillowtex compani base in north  ina fold  wipe out about       job in that state alon  which i think was the largest job loss from a singl event in the state   s histori    the total number of layoff amount to about         that compani sold towel and a lot of other soft good under the cannon and fieldcrest label   i inadvert refer to the compani as    pillow talk    dure a staff meet the other day  which was an indic of both my age and my bad tast in movi    laughter   but it   s no laugh matter in the communiti where that compani had plant   most in central north  ina  on the nation economi  the  book forecast is certain plausibl  includ the consider step up in gdp growth go forward that the staff continu to project despit the downward revis in the project   like other peopl  i   m impress by the more posit tone of some of the recent data and the anecdot commentari that i just mention   my main concern  and other have express this concern as well  is that the addit    basi point of further disinfl project for      in the  book could turn out to be too op ist   i would cite three reason to be concern  and some of them have been mention alreadi   first  the latest employ report   suggest that the output gap is still grow  that is in the natur of a baselin fact as i see it   second  given the substanti total job loss in the economi sinc earli      relat to the trend growth in the labor forc  i think the     percent unemploy rate may not be fulli convey the downsid impuls that   s come from labor market into the economi   final  the continu surpris strength   almost amaz strength   in product growth suggest that trend product growth may well turn out to be higher than expect  along the line of the first altern scenario in the  book  which i thought was especi interest  on that last point  in the late     s rise product growth had a power effect on demand becaus it was extrapol   produc excess op ist expect of futur labor and capit incom growth in that period that caus spend to grow even fa  than potenti output   it would be nice if we could get someth like that now   but thing could well turn out differ in today   s environ  where the public   s view of econom prospect is much more subdu  obvious  than it was in the late      s  given the continu job loss and excess capac in a number of industri   rise product growth today  in contrast to the late      s  could well caus the output gap to widen further if spend   not keep pace with potenti output  as the  book altern scenario indic  that outcom would obvious put addit downward pressur on inflat   we would have to move the fund rate below   percent just to keep the real fund rate from rise   inde  in such a situat  we might well want to reduc the real fund rate below zero   in those circumst  i think the zero bound would becom a serious practic problem  not just a theoret issu  becaus it could undermin the public   s confid in our abil to provid the requir s ulus with monetari polici   obvious  if that kind of situat develop  it would involv a disinfl risk   we would have to make a convinc case that we could in fact provid the s ulus ul  by expand our balanc sheet to whatev extent necessari in those circumst  if they aris  let me say again that i  too  think econom prospect are look at least a littl better now   and in my view the probabl of deflat and the risk of hit the zero bound are still relat low   but the high product growth scenario  which in some sens is the most favor scenario from the standpoint of longer term growth    involv a signific disinfl risk in the near term   so i agre with what i   m hear from sever other around the tabl that it   s too soon to sound the    all clear    signal   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   as far as the ninth district is concern  overal econom activ is stabl to improv   let me just cite a few exampl of that   on a year over year basi  employ is stabl in virtual all district state  but i   d say that the underton of the labor market has improv   there clear are stir of net hire  in particular for some higher skill posit   i can probabl make the same set of statement for manufactur   most measur indic that activ in that sector has been stabl in recent month   but again there seem to be some hint of a greater level of op  among at least some produc   residenti construct  which of cours has been a bright spot  is still up signific on a year over year basi   the same is true for sale and price of hous   so that sector continu to do well   of cours  that was the situat befor the recent increas in mortgag rate  but i   ll be surpris if that increas has a materi effect on activ in the hous sector  in the short run at least  surpris  there are some new project under way in nonresidenti construct activ  most expans of hospit and other health care facil and some offic build construct in a few of the medium size citi in the district   final  after a slow start  tourism activ seem to have pick up in mani part of the district  and that appar has brought with it some improv in retail sale as well  most in the tourist center   so overal i would say that the situat in the district is improv  although probabl not at a rapid rate  as far as the nation economi is concern  mani peopl have observ alreadi   and i agre   that the latest actual data are clear on the more posit side   but i would sound a somewhat cautionari note here   we know that those data are unreli  they can be subject to signific revis  and one or two month don   t make a trend   nevertheless  given the improv in the data and given that the s ulus we   re all anticip and have talk about is now upon us  i do think some acceler   probabl signific   in econom activ go forward is like   that said  the precis  e remain open to question  at least in my mind  clear there is no real inflat or inflationari pressur in front of us  as best i can judg  and that prospect could be reinforc if product is better than the  book forecast suggest for next year   part and parcel of that scenario is the likelihood that employ will be slower to pick up as we go forward or that employ gain will be more modest than is typic the case   but with real growth continu  an acceler in growth in prospect  and inflat low  it seem to me that overal the economi is in pretti good shape

thank you  mr  chairman   from a wide varieti of contact in the eighth district  includ fair larg firm like the may compani and enterpris rent a car as well as a lot of small compani  the overal assess of the busi situat is along the line of    not yet      it   s not that the economi is sink but just that there   s no real surg of activ as yet  on a somewhat more hope basi  my contact at j b  hunt  which is one of the largest truck compani in the nation  said that intermod transport busi   that   s the piggyback busi with truck and train   is up    percent this juli over last juli   the higher traffic is in the form of manufactur good go westbound and import from the west coast come back eastbound   on the regular truck side  no dramat chang has occur  but busi is a bit better   the pickup start in the last third of june and seem to be continu into the earli day of august   again  i would emphas that he describ it as an uptick  certain not a surg  my up contact said that he had just gotten back from asia and that a notic pickup was take place in japan  that   s how he led off our convers   he character busi in the unit state as essenti unchang   my fedex contact start off by say that there was no chang in activ for them  no sign of inventori restock   he   not expect to see ani particular chang befor the fall or beyond   again  the tone was more hope  but noth realli solid is in the work  my contact at wal mart said that to him the data do not look as good as everyon seem to think   wal mart   s sale in juli got a fair amount of press  but he note that it   s relat easi to see improv base on comparison from last year becaus of the weak number a year ago   he comment that wal mart is not see veri much from the childcar tax credit check that have gone out   wal mart will cash those check for custom   for check cash at their store  about    percent of the fund are be spent compar with about    percent of the rebat check that went out two year ago   as for the paycheck cycl that i   ve talk about befor  my contact report that it was as pronounc in mid juli as in the one in may  which was as pronounc as ani for five year  that is  peopl are come in to shop when they get their paycheck  which suggest that spend is liquid constrain   he also said that the compani   s growth in sale is about two third from increas traffic and about one third from increas in the amount be spent per each sale ticket   he prefer to see the proport revers becaus that would indic stronger under demand rather than that custom are be taken from competitor   in my contact   s view  wal mart   s inventori are in pretti good shape  at onli about   percent abov the desir level   he think that other retail are probabl somewhat more excess overstock than wal mart and that inventori in the retail sector in general are probabl a bit abov desir level   so he did not forese ani inventori surg in the near term  on the nation level  i believ the  book forecast make a lot of sens   i view that forecast as the median best guess  but i alway like to think about the distribut around that forecast   for the first  e in sever year  my own sens of the distribut is that it   s skew more to the right of that median   i think there   s more of a possibl of upsid surpris   i   m not say that   s my best guess  but i think there   s more room for upsid surpris than i   ve felt for a coupl of year   i   d point  for exampl  to the possibl of inventori accumul  mayb not right away but as we move into next year  i   d also like to emphas the import of corpor profit number go forward   if we see some good corpor profit  i think that   s go to loosen the purs string on capit expenditur  and it   s go to make the stock market perform better   a virtuous cycl of all sort of thing could flow from an improv corpor profit pictur   so i think we   re on a good track   i believ the takeoff is go to be slow  but to me the prospect ahead of us seem much improv   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district economi has strengthen sinc the last meet   although econom growth is certain not robust  it is at least show some posit sign   the labor market are still soft  but they do appear to be improv slight   employ has slowli edg up sinc the end of the iraqi war  move almost to year ago level   layoff announc did rise somewhat in juli  but that was due main to some anticip job cut at certain militari base  manufactur activ show further sign of recoveri in juli   new order were up  our manufactur index was    in juli  up from   in june and minus   in may   that   s consist with other improv  such as increas in capit spend and expect of futur product that remain general favor   the negat were that current product did slip back to below year ago level and plan for futur hire and capit spend remain unclear   there   s a certain sens of want to go forward but a hesit that still remain  consum spend has continu to rebound from the dip dure the war   retail contact in mid juli said that their sale were up a littl from previous month and at or abov year ago level in most locat in our region   commerci real estat  though still weak  has shown some sign of stabil   offic vacanc rate were unchang in the second quarter  and construct activ level off after trend down for the last year and a half   hous activ remain strong   the recent increas in mortgag rate has caus a fair sharp reduct in refinanc  but so far we   ve not heard ani report that it is curb hous demand itself   energi activ remain an import sourc of strength   drill for natur gas continu to expand  support by high price and the lift of some environment restrict recent in wyom  state and local budget remain a drag on the district economi   colorado  nebraska  and oklahoma are plan to implement some further spend cut   also  legisl in nebraska and kansa are talk about   and in fact are veri close to   enact some tax increas  price trend are littl chang sinc the last meet   retail price have been stabl   in manufactur  our contact tell us that price of materi have continu to rise while price of finish good have continu to encount downward pressur   the farm economi is recov   those area that have a crop have a veri good crop   some area in we n kansa and nebraska still are experienc a drought  and farmer there are reli on govern payment as they have in the past  let me turn to the nation economi   it appear  as other have note  that the econom forc are in place for sustain recoveri  make a rebound to trend growth this year possibl and to abov trend growth next year most like   we have accommod monetari polici and fiscal polici  strong product  and a healthi financi system that can support the credit need of busi as those need materi   of cours  as we   ve talk about today  the signific increas in long term interest rate is a topic receiv a lot of attent   while the rise in long term rate can be a negat  obvious  part of the increas reflect simpli a rebound from the dramat declin in may and june   but i think those rate also have risen becaus investor are more confid about the strength of the recoveri   in addit to anticip the strong monetari and fiscal forc propel the economi forward  we   re now begin to see the strength reflect in econom and financi data   inflat index treasuri yield suggest that real interest rate are higher   in addit  the inflat premium has in fact increas  put this all togeth  my outlook for the economi continu to be for real gdp growth of about     percent in the second half of this year  which is below the  book   s   percent   i think growth next year will be closer to   percent than the  book forecast of     percent   of cours  if busi becom confid about the outlook and busi fix invest increas to the    percent suggest in the  book  then we could see growth in the rang of     percent or better   so  while i see upsid risk to growth  it is base on my forecast of growth most like be near   percent  not the     percent project by the staff  relat to that     percent  i think there   s probabl some downsid risk  let me turn briefli to the inflat outlook   i expect core inflat to remain relat stabl   while the output gap may put some downward pressur on inflat  i would be reluct to place too much weight on the output gap as a predictor of inflat go forward   more signific  financi market and market economist seem to me to be expect somewhat higher inflat   in my view  the inflat risk for      is about balanc   more general  given the outlook  i think the risk of unwelcom deflat or disinfl caus by a collaps in aggreg demand is neglig  although i do recogn that continu strong product  along with modest econom growth  could lead to some further disinfl   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for quit a while we   ve been say that a strengthen in the economi was come but we didn   t know it  e or extent   like other  over the intermeet period i saw a number of encourag sign on the  e question that suggest growth in fact has alreadi been strengthen   data for the second quarter support that judgment  show a bit of a pickup under way   notabl  those data preced the latest round of tax cut and probabl had littl to do with the extra financi s ulus that we got in the second half of may and earli june   it   s especi encourag that capit spend seem to be on the upsw  includ increas in shipment and order of non high tech equip in both may and june   among other thing  this trajectori in the second quarter impli that we don   t need quit as abrupt a strengthen in demand and activ as we previous had imagin in order to get growth at or abov the growth rate of potenti toward the end of the year  moreov  the fragmentari inform for earli in the third quarter that     talk about   sale  initi claim  and purchas manag    survey   tend to support the hypothesi that growth is inde in the process of break abov the sluggish pace at which it has been run sinc last summer   the pickup in activ is not confin to the unit state   there are indic of a turnaround oversea  support the staff forecast of much stronger growth in our trade partner   this is import a spillov from the unit state  but it also reflect expect of stronger domest demand abroad  while the  e of the pickup appear to be more settl  the extent of the acceler continu to be in doubt   my best guess continu to be that macroeconom polici s ulus  along with a number of other favor develop we   ve talk about at recent meet  will support growth that is suffici vigor to begin to erod econom slack later this year   but we haven   t seen such growth yet  and a coupl of develop over the intermeet period that other have mention argu in favor of a cautious assess  on the demand side  a key issu is whether  after the recent tighten  financi condit remain support of a substanti narrow of the output gap over the next six quarter and beyond   there are reason for concern   one way of look at this question is to judg whether the path of short term rate impli by the term structur look compat with such an outcom   in that regard  the impli upturn in eurodollar rate next spring is at odd with the flat path in the staff forecast and i suspect from the tenor our last meet with mani of our own forecast as well   the market seem to be anticip some combin of a more vigor bounceback in demand and greater inflat pressur than is built into these forecast  presum then  were higher rate to persist for long in the absenc of posit surpris to demand  we   d have to mark our project down   and perhap consider  but there are some amelior factor that suggest that the risk from the higher rate may not be that larg   for one  rate are still quit low   in nomin term  most bond rate are onli a bit abov the level of earli may befor the good news on growth and the passag of substanti fiscal s ulus   moreov  i see a consider part of the rise in rate as an endogen respons to ongo posit develop   some small part of the increas like was an upward adjust in inflat expect or at least a reduct in fear of deflat   not such a bad thing under the circumst   result level of real corpor bond rate are especi low  as risk spread have come in so far this year   in my view  a portion of the pickup in rate result from greater confid and op  on the part of privat investor respond to better data and to feder reserv statement   this is evidenc in the resili of equiti price and the persist of narrow corpor risk spread despit huge increas in bond yield  i find it hard to believ that this isn   t be echo to some extent in the attitud of busi as they make spend decis   such a shift in psycholog has been a necessari condit for stronger econom activ  and it reduc one downsid risk to the forecast  final  if market are wrong  they will correct themselv  and rate will fall back   in the staff forecast  market particip come to the realiz soon enough that inflat and short term rate will remain damp longer than they anticip so that the result declin in long term interest rate happen in  e to preserv abov trend growth for the forecast period  an addit cautionari piec of inform came on the suppli side of the economi  where we had yet anoth remind of the astound pace of product growth   as mani of you have remark  not onli   such growth rais the bar for requir expans of demand  this increas in product has been achiev with veri littl capit deepen   busi are abl to enhanc effici by rearrang product process with about the current level of capit and onli relat gradual updat of the stock   that has damp the feedthrough of product growth to demand  in mark contrast to experi in the     s  and has made it harder to close the output gap   at the same  e  rapid product growth has been hold down unit cost and contribut to continu disinfl  on balanc  i see incom data as consist with my view that growth is in the process of strengthen but also as not materi reliev my concern about overal downsid risk to our dual object   with inflat alreadi low and slack consider  it   s import to have a prolong period of growth abov potenti not onli to minim lost output and wealth but to limit the extent of disinfl   we don   t want to end up with an inflat rate that may provid inadequ scope for monetari polici to meet unexpect downward shock   this imper has implic for maintain a high accommod stanc of polici for some  e into the futur and for the balanc of risk that we will discuss in the second part of the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll divid my review of the intermeet period into two section   one i would describ as what we know  which is to say what happen   the second is what we think  or how we interpret the data   first  what do we know  as other have said  the data on the real economi dure the intermeet period have been quit mix   the labor market continu to disappoint  with a fall in the latest read on privat payrol employ and a shorten of the workweek   howev  mani other type of econom data admit have been more posit   on the output side  manufactur activ seem to climb a bit toward the end of the second quarter and is at least hold in the earli part of this quarter   on the spend side  the limit inform from juli  name for light vehicl sale and chain store sale  i think indic that consum are hold up their end in this nascent recoveri   with regard to busi fix invest  anecdot evid from the survey that we undertak here and from survey of capit spend by other have been a bit more upbeat as well   so what we know about the real economi has been relat posit but there are still some negat as well  what about the financi market   i   d say that there   s perhap a bit of bifurc there  equiti have turn in a veri respect perform sinc the last meet   the s p is basic unchang  but the nasdaq is up about   percent  and that may well reflect some posit earn surpris and an improv outlook   as we   ve discuss  howev  the fix incom market have had a much less even run sinc the last meet  with intermeet increas in two year and ten year yield that are quit dramat by histor standard  import  real yield as measur by tip rose signific less than nomin yield on treasuri secur  which suggest some increas in anticip compens for inflat  similar  as governor kohn has alreadi indic  market expect for monetari polici dure the intermeet period also show a clear upward shift in the outlook for interest rate  now  outlin these fact is relat easi   the hard part  obvious  is for us to tri to interpret them   in that regard  i think there are three import question   the first is  are these fact consist with the staff forecast and outsid forecast of gradual improv growth  particular with growth start now in the third quarter   my interpret is that the fact do seem to be consist with the judgment that the economi will experi the much expect turnaround in the second half of this year   admit  of cours  that growth is still a forecast  but it seem to me that  sinc the last meet  the odd of that growth occur have certain pick up substanti   even the much discuss run up in fix incom yield  put in a broader context go back to may    the day befor our may fomc meet    not seem so outsiz  the second question is  are these data intern consist   the answer  as is alway the case  is    no  they are not      inconsist and question i think still abound   first and foremost  whi is job growth so sluggish   is it a sign of uncertainti on the part of busi  or on the other hand is it just the negat side of a veri good product stori   that   s hard to answer  i think it   s probabl a littl of both   in my view  the product number should reign suprem here    anoth question with respect to job growth  as it turn around veri slowli  is whether it   s like to slow down the spend behavior of consum   my judgment is    no  it is not      i believ that the s ul monetari polici and fiscal polici plus a gradual improv labor pictur are like to be suffici to support consum behavior  which will be an import part of this turnaround  again in the categori of whether these data are intern consist  one struggl a bit with what the messag is from the financi market   governor kohn has alreadi done  as one would imagin given his background  a superb analysi of the financi market   so i will be modest and not attempt to replic exact what he has said   but i do find the communic challeng we face with respect to the market quit difficult to understand   nobodi can understand fulli whi market expect for monetari polici have shift so dramat toward a futur tighten by the fomc   it may be due to the more posit tone in the recent econom inform  as governor kohn has suggest  but it may also be that communic challeng will creat a bit of a problem for us go forward   so i   d say we still have to be on the lookout in that regard  the final issu with respect to interpret of these data is what they mean in term of the various risk to our dual mandat   on that i   d have to say that i recogn  as presid pool suggest  that there might be some upsid risk   a quick turnaround in inventori accumul  for exampl  could hit us in the third or the fourth quarter  though that would not be a negat develop   but by and larg my concern about the risk tend to be much more to the downsid  particular with respect to the price stabil issu   if one look at ani of the forecast   and certain our staff forecast of econom growth is high among them   for the next six quarter they all impli a still larg pool of underutil resourc at the end of the forecast period   in all of the altern scenario in the  book  particular the most op ist one with fa  structur product growth or the lower nairu  we end up have far less of a cushion in term of the inflat rate   in the two most op ist scenario  the core pce inflat rate drop far below   percent  well outsid the bound of what i would think of as price stabil   so i have some concern about the risk go forward  which i see as be primarili on the downsid   and i think this is realli quit problemat  if i go outsid the context of the  book and look at other forecast  my concern  if anyth  are heighten   as a number of member alreadi have point out  our staff is probabl at the high end of the consensus outlook for gdp growth as compar with the blue chip forecast   this suggest to me that there may be some risk to the downsid with respect to the staff forecast   i think the risk are somewhat asymmetr  with the greater probabl of an outcom that is perhap somewhat weaker than the staff envis   that weaker outcom may emerg from three differ type of surpris that are possibl  though not certain   the first is that the export pictur may be a littl weaker  other economi may not turn around as quick as the staff forecast and   have suggest   the second   and one that certain show up in the more pessimist outsid forecast   is that the recent chang in financi condit may have a stronger impact on refinanc than anticip   again  that   s not a certainti  but it is a risk that is not pick up fulli in the  book   the third  as impli by presid pianalto   s comment  is that the usual multipli   acceler effect may not work as envis  and as we get into       there   s a real risk that some of the strength we see in      may not be translat into busi decis to invest  so where   that leav us   frank  given the relat posit tone of the incom data and given market expect  i think it   s probabl prudent today to sit tight with respect to monetari polici itself   on the other hand  the absenc of a polici respons today make it even more import that we maintain a vigil postur in our written statement  particular with respect to the price stabil part of our mandat   i will stop there and leav the rest of my comment until the second part of the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
i would also refer to a comment that governor kohn made regard the need for the shift in psycholog that appar is begin to occur   last week i talk with four contact at major bank   ceo or other in senior leadership posit   and the most notabl chang in their descript of recent develop at their bank is the across the board improv in busi psycholog that they are observ   it has not yet been reflect in c i loan in a broad way  though an except is one of the major midwest bank  which has seen more activ in c i lend in the rural market than they   ve observ for the past five year   howev  in the major money market  they do tend to see increas activ in some of the area of capit lend activ   ventur capit activ has gone from aw to sign of improv  i   m told   the corpor bond market is still strong  and the attract of that market has help diminish the growth in c i lend   market are describ as improv  particular in the high risk area  and the leverag transact tend to be up   anoth factor that   s import is that loan qualiti is no longer mention as an issu of concern   we have seen continu improv in asset qualiti in both the consum and the busi sector for some  e   so while there is op  and a signific improv in psycholog  that has not yet translat into busi activ  at least as repres by the busi channel
thank you  mr  chairman   the critic of the fed over the intermeet period has been as intens as at ani  e sinc i   ve been here   have we lost our touch  or are we deal with a complic set of new issu    while obvious i   m bias  my vote is for the complic set of issu  i see four major one   number     there has been a huge posit product shock  accord to the nber  the recent posit shock seem to be slight greater than the one that occur in the late     s   to find one as larg one has to go all the way back to        number     there has been a jobless recoveri   note that final sale actual grew     percent in the second quarter  at a  e when everybodi was complain about the soft economi and drop employ   we did have anoth jobless recoveri in the earli      s  but that jobless recoveri was of a veri differ natur   number     inflat is threaten to go below our target rang  inflat did get as low as it is current a few  e in the      s and      s  but in the modern era that has happen onli onc for a brief period in        number     we are tri to explain everyth to the public   as far as i can tell  this has never happen in such a complic environ   so we have four quit rare event interact with each other  and the combin make for a t i interplay of polici and communic   as an illustr of the confus  i quot from one of the news clip that i receiv just ye day     treasuri note fell on specul that the fed will say econom growth is acceler  boost expect the fed will rais interest rate in come quarter      were there to be a jobless recoveri in the presenc of a posit product shock and declin inflat  it is quit possibl that an op  central bank should respond by lower interest rate  not rais them   other such anomali can be easili imagin  apart from lament our fate of have to explain all of this  what should we actual be do about monetari polici   i think the matter boil down to three question we must ask ourselv   my question are a littl differ from roger   s question and are differ organ   the first question is sustain     the fledgl recoveri need more juic to sustain itself   the second question is vigor   will the recoveri need more juic to get aggreg demand all the way back to full employ reason soon   the third question is inflat  will inflat fall below our target rang in the mean    unlik a tradit situat in which the issu confront a central bank might be that of determin when to rais rate as a recoveri proceed  in this case if the answer to ani of these question becom    yes     we ought to be lower rate instead   that said  tentat at this point i would not answer    yes    to ani of the question  as for sustain and vigor  consumpt and hous have remain strong  invest is begin to pick up steam  and inventori are thin   govern spend will be high and rise for a while yet   at this point the recoveri look as if it should be sustain and vigor  even if it has been so long delay   whether more juic will be need at some point is a question that we can   t realli answer right now  as for inflat  core pce inflat is flirt danger with what i think most of us would consid the bottom of an accept rang for inflat  about   percent a year   there would seem to be a clear risk that prolong output gap will lower inflat further   but that eventu  sn   t seem to be in anybodi   s forecast  either in the baselin  book forecast or the other fifti four blue chip forecast  none of which has inflat fall below our presum target rang   i might note  though  that two of the altern scenario  book forecast do have this result   accord to the staff  at these level inflat general respond quit sluggish to output gap   and the standard forecast is that the expect narrow of output gap will ward off the proverbi unwelcom substanti drop in inflat  the summari of all this is that  while the unusu combin of event make it inappropri in my view for us to behav like a central bank that would tradit be rais rate in a recoveri  there  sn   t seem to be enough present evid of the need to lower them either   i guess that mean we should sit tight for now   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   like most everybodi els  i   m encourag by the recent data   the surpris good second quarter gdp number look even better when one take into account the big negat contribut of the foreign sector and inventori invest  both of which should tend to revers at least partial over  e  particular when the normal cyclic inventori rebuild kick in we should see a period of strong growth  and secretari snow   s analog of the economi as a coil spring may final seem apt   despit the good news  i think it   s prematur to conclud that we should not consid further rate cut  if not at this meet then at some  e in the near futur depend on how the data play out   my concern is focus on the behavior of inflat both in the short term and in the long term  regard the short term  though i can see that output gap are extrem hard to measur  the most reason guess is that the current gap remain substanti   moreov  becaus of rapid product growth  the gap may close veri slowli in come quarter even if output growth is quit strong   that   s bad news for worker  and it pose some risk to consum spend   more to the point  a persist output gap impli that addit disinfl over the next year remain a distinct possibl   even if we consid actual deflat to be too remot to worri about  further disinfl pose import risk   disinfl offset monetari polici eas alreadi in the system  and veri low inflat may limit the abil of monetari polici to respond by convent mean to futur advers shock   in short  we should continu to consid disinfl unwelcom and to be vigil about it possibl  the longer term issu can be summar by the follow question   where do we want the inflat rate to be when the economi return to full employ and sustain growth   a good bit of research at the board and elsewher has suggest that a posit steadi state inflat rate improv econom perform by reduc the frequenc at which the zero bound is bind on the polici rate   i survey a number of the relev paper in prepar for this meet   virtual all conclud that zero bound consider should lead one to choos a steadi state inflat rate between   and   percent   recent  sever author have becom more dare and have given point es  of the op  inflat rate  with the choic almost alway be   percent   the memo by elmendorf  reifschneid  and   entitl    deflat and the conduct of monetari polici     circul to this committe befor the june meet  was explicit in put the magic number as   percent pce inflat   i don   t want to take a stand today on what the long run inflat rate should be  and that   s obvious someth we should decid as a committe   but i note that the fomc central tendenc forecast for pce inflat for      was     to     percent  somewhat more op ist than the  book forecast of under   percent   is inflat of     to     percent what we want to be head for in the long run   if so  fine   otherwis it seem to me that our polici should reflect our long term object  final  i have some concern about our communic   govern bond yield have risen a good bit late  and while that rise is unlik to derail the recoveri  it   not help  some would argu that an increas in bond yield at this stage of the recoveri is normal   that may be histor accur  but it miss the point   histor  inflat has typic been higher than the fed would like  so the fomc has respond to strong growth by rais interest rate to forestal ani inflationari impact   this  e around is differ  or should be   inflat is not a threat   therefor  the fomc   not need to take away the punch bowl so earli in the parti  so by right interest rate should remain subdu despit the pickup in growth   judg by feder fund futur and other indic  howev  the market have larg miss this point and have bid up interest rate well beyond where they ought to be in some sens  to the detriment of the recoveri   to the extent that we can sharpen our messag that econom growth no longer impli an immedi and automat polici tighten  we should make everi effort to do so   i understand  along the line mention by governor    that communic this subtl point is a difficult challeng   but the economi would benefit if we could meet that challeng  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m go to focus on a coupl of issu that governor bernank just discuss and that mani of you have mention  too   name  communic our polici and our view about the issu face us today   i want to talk about this from the point of view of the two dictat in our mission statement  potenti growth in the economi and inflat   one of the thing i find strike in my convers with peopl who particip in the bond market is the differ in our percept regard where we are in this particular recoveri   as sever peopl mention earlier  the market tend to believ that  when the recoveri begin  the fed is go to take away the punch bowl and start tighten interest rate right away   most of us have realli been engag in this profess   old as we are   onli when the feder reserv has been tri to fight inflat   that has been the system   s focus sinc the      s   what is unusu here is that the economi has emerg from a long term secular problem of exceed high inflat  and now the rate of inflat is within or near the rang we might want to set for a long term inflat target   as a result we   re not tri to achiev a secular declin in inflat  we   re focus more on the cyclic aspect of it   i don   t believ the street is realli differenti these two issu  a second issu   and one of the reason that inflat is so low   is that product growth is signific abov what ani of us has seen   in fact  the product number that just came out are high even for the earli stage of a busi recoveri   if we believ that product will stay somewher abov it long term trend  the pickup in inflat that we normal would see is not like to occur   while we hope that inflat will go up from where it is current  in the  book forecast inflat remain signific below what mani of us find comfort   i certain am uncomfort when i see inflat forecast of less than   percent  the other issu i see  as i look at the risk to the forecast  is address in the altern scenario in the  book that is call    prolong subpar invest      that is the root caus of this recess to begin with   the slowdown in busi fix invest creat the recess  it was not consum driven   if busi invest  sn   t pick up as we   re expect  the output gap will get wider  and inflat will continu to drift lower   while capit expenditur have increas at some compani  we   re still not hear veri robust plan for capit expenditur as compani have releas their earn report   i think most peopl around the tabl today have been hear mix report about capit spend intent  so i share the doubt express about how busi are go to surviv in a world with continu low inflat  which limit price power   i   m not sure how they can achiev the earn growth for the next five year that we still see in the s p number and other earn forecast   what   s go to give   well  they are go to have to resum capit expenditur in order to achiev that growth and continu to get an extraordinarili high pace of growth in product   altern  without the capit deepen  we will continu to see what has been go on over the last coupl of year   more reorgan  the shut down of plant  and the restructur of product line  so in summari  i   m concern about the strength of capit expenditur relat to the staff forecast  and i see that as one of the biggest risk go forward   in term of our communic  i would love to find some way   mayb we can talk about this in septemb   to make peopl understand that we are now in a differ mode for the long term with regard to both inflat and product   as a result  the output gap will be larg for a while even if econom growth is high in the short run   thank you
thank you veri much   let   s turn now to
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi label    brief on monetari polici altern     which was distribut dure the break   the sharp rise in market interest rate was  without a doubt  the major     the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     develop in financi market over the intermeet period   as shown in the top left hand panel of your first exhibit  yield on ten year treasuri and other high grade bond general climb about     basi point on balanc   the increas took place amid consider volatil  the right hand panel   as dino note  the steep advanc in yield trigger a cascad of portfolio adjust  includ in particular a larg volum of hedg transact by mortgag investor  and the volum of those transact and the high degre of volatil briefli took a toll on liquid in a number of fix incom market   the stress were particular visibl in a spike in swap spread  the middl left hand panel  but market function has improv consider in the past few day   one potenti signific develop is the substanti increas in compens that bond investor requir for inflat  the solid and dot line in the middl right hand panel   howev  the most recent result from the michigan survey  shown in the inset  suggest no pickup in household    longer term inflat expect and  in fact  indic some further declin in their anticip short term inflat rate   as shown in the bottom panel  the sharp increas in yield over the intermeet period to an import degre repres a revers of a consider declin over the previous period  as a number of you mention earlier   the recent run up in rate  while spark by feder reserv word and action  also reflect incom corpor earn report that were better than anticip  some of the econom data releas  and perhap the news that the feder deficit was widen substanti   thus rate are now higher than they were in earli may   the revers in market sen ent show through clear in expect for monetari polici   as indic by the dot line in the top left hand panel in your next exhibit  just befor your last meet mani investor appar anticip that the fund rate would be eas to    basi point befor long and that the rate would remain low for an extend period of  e   by contrast  the solid line suggest that market now think you probabl will begin to firm polici next spring   although the direct of the revis is not surpris  it extent may be   and the fact that market see tighten as commenc in less than a year appar indic that they see the expect rebound in growth as potenti lead direct to inflationari pressur without much of a role for a persist output gap in determin price chang   the top right hand panel provid addit inform about market particip    expect for your polici stanc in the near term   accord to a survey conduct by the desk  all twenti two primari dealer anticip that you will leav the target for the feder fund rate unchang at today   s meet   sixteen expect that the risk assess will also be unchang   that you will again see balanc risk to sustain growth  downsid risk to inflat  and downsid risk overal   four seem to think that you will shift your view of the risk to growth to the downsid  while two believ that you will move to a judgment that the two compon  as well as the overal assess  are balanc   the market   s view of the like cours of monetari polici contrast with the  book assumpt that you will keep the fund rate at   percent through       as     discuss earlier  the staff forecast that such a polici stanc  in combin with the monetari and fiscal s ulus that is either in place or come on line  should result in a consider acceler of aggreg demand   howev  becaus the staff also project continu strong expans of product and henc aggreg suppli  an output gap linger throughout the project period   that leav the civilian unemploy rate at     percent at the end of        a touch higher than in the june project   and bring core pce inflat to a tad below   percent next year   some discomfort with that higher track of unemploy resourc is the first of three basic argument outlin in the middl left hand panel that might support an inclin to eas polici at this meet   even if you find the  book forecast to be credibl  you might prefer to pursu more rapid gain against econom slack   and  perhap  to increas slight the inflat buffer in view of concern about the zero bound to nomin interest rate   a frb us simul not report in the  book indic that a    basi point lower path for the feder fund rate would boost gdp growth   percentag point over        also  even if you view the  book outcom as accept  you might want a littl more insur that it will eventu   second  you might be concern that aggreg demand could turn out to be weaker than in the staff forecast  perhap becaus of a larger impact of the recent advanc in long rate than in the  book  or becaus the expect  and seem emerg  brighten of busi sen ent fail to materi   third  you might see a good chanc that aggreg suppli could be even stronger and inflat even lower than project by the staff  reflect robust product gain and  perhap  declin inflat expect on main street  if not on wall street  feed through to wage and price   on the other hand  you might see the  book project of acceler output and decreas slack as support an unchang stanc of polici  as indic in the first bullet in the right hand panel   some of the data that have becom avail sinc the last meet may be earli evid that econom activ is now in the process of acceler  as the staff has been project   also  the addit fiscal impetus now be implement should help sustain the project improv  and you might want to see some evid of the effect of that s ulus befor undertak further action   moreov  the recent increas in long rate could be seen as a possibl signal of a pickup in busi confid and a strengthen of spend that may outrun those forecast by the staff   a calcul report in the bluebook suggest that if bond investor use someth like a taylor rule in forecast futur monetari polici  then the recent run up in interest rate impli that their expect level of output a year and a half ahead has revis up as much as   percent   if the committe place appreci weight on this possibl signal  it might be inclin to leav the stanc of polici unchang at this meet   final  the recent increas in inflat compens impli by index secur  while not confirm by other gaug of inflat expect  may inclin the committe toward move ginger in provid ani further s ulus   in these circumst  the committe may wish to defer action at this meet and assess the data over come week to determin whether adjust to the stanc of polici are necessari   as i mention  such a polici decis is uniform anticip in financi market  and most investor expect that you will coupl it with unchang assess of the risk to attain of your object for growth and inflat   as note in the bottom panel  such an evalu of risk would seem consist with develop over the intermeet period   the encourag incom data on spend and the backup in market rate may be view as have rough offset effect with respect to the risk to the attain of sustain growth  leav them balanc   and the continu veri low rate of inflat  accumul evid that product growth remain strong  persist weak labor market perform  and a small downward revis to the staff econom forecast may be seen as argu that the risk to inflat remain tilt to the downsid   while certain develop over the intermeet period   particular the sharp backup in interest rate and the rise in inflat compens   could be taken instead to argu for adjust to the risk assess  in the current environ ani chang might well prompt a sizabl market reaction and possibl reignit recent volatil   the prospect of a strong respons presum would not deter the committe from revis it assess if the case was clear   howev  should the case for chang be seen as margin  the possibl of an outsiz reaction   togeth with the committe   s intent to revisit it communic polici at it next meet   might set a relat high hurdl for the fomc to reach a judgment at today   s meet that the risk had chang   thank you  mr  chairman   that conclud my prepar remark
i vagu recal see anoth survey of primari dealer  which show    percent of them   or someth like that   indic that they thought we would move toward balanc risk   it was circul today   i may have misread it
it was the stone mccarthi one
that   s the one   did i misread it   how did that percentag get to be so signific
it was the stone mccarthi survey  but part of the challeng is interpret the word that were use   it say no chang in the balanc of risk
the previous one was a risk toward weak
they got this differ result so i assum
if i could  i think one of the issu here was the word of the question use to ask the dealer about their assess of the like balanc of risk statement   we found that we had to go back to some of the dealer  in some case more than onc  to get clariti becaus they did not
in other word  no chang in the balanc of risk mean that they expect the same statement about the balanc of risk that we made previous
that   s the way that some dealer interpret it  yes
i see   so stone mccarthi think it is
again  the question may have been pose slight differ  and there may have been differ follow up
i did find that survey result rather startl when i saw it this morn   question for     if not  let me proceed   perhap the most interest develop we are observ  and a number of you have comment on it  relat to the emerg of a clear diverg between the view of this committe and a signific portion of the invest and financi communiti with regard to the evolv econom situat  inde  as i read the view express by the member around this tabl  there also is a diverg between the central tendenc of the member    outlook for econom activ and the staff forecast   in fact  there   s probabl a problem in the way the economi look to most peopl  as best we can judg  gdp for the month of juli is alreadi more than     percent abov the second quarter averag at an annual rate  this mean that gdp will be     percent higher for the third quarter even if we have zero chang for august and septemb   and from what we can alreadi observ in the most recent data  zero chang is veri unlik for the month of august  what we   re see is an acceler gdp  not as a forecast but as it has begun to be reflect in incom indic   one would scarc infer that from the anecdot comment around this tabl  part of the reason for the appar differ between percept and the gdp data relat to the fact that gdp measur final sale and  as such  it consolid out a signific amount of intermedi activ that is reflect in the comment of our contact in the busi communiti   consumpt expenditur are clear at a veri signific level  we know that recent motor vehicl sale are in fact higher becaus our data for such sale are base on full coverag   but we also know that motor vehicl firm are have veri signific price problem and that domest manufactur current tend to be unprofit in mani of their oper   i think this provid us with a clue as to where the general problem lie   as i see it  the fundament problem for busi firm realli get down to the issu that a few of us have comment on today  name the lack of price power   there is no evid of ani improv in busi price power  and that fundament color the way the busi communiti see it activ   profit are rise  but busi execut seem to be surpris by the improv in their profit   to a substanti extent  those profit are come out of cost cut activ  and that inevit mean  as i   ve said in the past  that busi firm are still take advantag of potenti product gain that were not exploit dure the boom period of      to        so  unless and until busi see some prospect of pass through more of their cost to price  it is my experi that the busi communiti will have a veri forlorn view of the outlook and some reluct to move forward on capit invest except for those that are essenti to maintain current oper  as we look at this process  we tend to formal it essenti in term of a model structur in which the rate of inflat is relat to the level of the gap in gdp   while the result of fit the data to such a model are reason robust  there is evid a consider amount of nois in the data   as a consequ  it would be perfect credibl to get rise inflat with a constant output gap for sever quarter and not violat the under robust of the relationship  in ani event  we are look at differ view of the way in which the economi function   in the past  as a number of you have mention  the tendenc of the feder reserv has alway been to tighten when the economi show sign of a macro pickup   in this period we have a veri obvious reluct to move in that direct larg becaus we   re look at a world in which global competit is much greater than it was earlier   to use the exampl of natur gas  the real problem in natur gas distribut is the fact that there are a lot of remot deposit of natur gas that cannot readili be move to where the demand for the gas is locat  similar  in the past there were area of capac for various type of output that could not be move to market in part becaus some of them were behind the iron curtain but also becaus of the inabl to move good and servic the way they can be move now  clear we are look at a differ econom world from the one we have experienc histor  and we are move ahead of the market in our assess of that new world   but in do so  we have to be veri care   i say that even though it may veri well be   and inde i think the evid support the probabl   that in the end the fed will turn out to be right and the market wrong   still  there is a fair larg minor probabl that the outcom will be the other way around   the reason i say that stem from my observ over the year of economist who have construct veri convinc model of how the economi function  onli to see those model break down when appli to real world situat  the most famous exampl undoubt was the veri clever stock watson model develop a number of year ago on short term forecast   it had work for everi busi cycl prior to it public  and it fail the first  e it was actual appli   that sort of experi lead me to suggest that a littl humil probabl is requir here   we need to be wari of talk ourselv into view certain relationship as absolut and persuad ourselv that it cannot be otherwis  this lead me to propos that we maintain the polici stanc we adopt at our june meet   that would coincid incident with what the primari dealer suggest we ought to be do   i think we have to be awar  howev  of a veri signific upsid risk to this economi  it relat larg to the fact that inventori chang can be veri rapid   busi firm almost sure are still liquid some inventori  at least insofar as the avail juli data seem to indic   inde  c i loan and commerci paper adjust for merger and acquisit were declin into juli and have onli veri recent stabil   and i understand that staff in queri market contact as to whi commerci paper issuanc has stabil found no evid of ani inventori accumul  to be sure  it   s not accumul per se that   s critic   a slow in the rate of reduct can move the economi  that effect would be amplifi  of cours  if the economi were to experi a normal swing in inventori invest   that would involv a swing from a     odd billion annual rate of liquid  which i gather is rough what we are experienc in the current quarter  to accumul at an annual rate of someth on the order of     billion to     billion at an annual rate   in the context of the staff forecast for final sale  such a swing would occur if busi return to inventori accumul at a pace that was in line with what have been normal inventori    sale ratio   we do have what appear to be an ongo downward trend in such ratio and the staff is not project ani near term impetus from inventori rebuild  but an upturn in inventori accumul   occur in        there   s no reason in my view whi it can   t occur in the fourth quarter of this year or even within the next sever week  when an inventori swing occur  it is alway a big surpris   what we find is that  even though survey may show that busi firm think their inventori are at normal level  they may nonetheless in a veri short period of  e perceiv them to be inadequ and initi a pronounc turnaround in inventori invest   so that is a signific risk to the forecast  and it should temper the degre of assur with which we comment public about the econom outlook  which i presum a number of us will be do in the month ahead   it is veri easi to becom certain about econom behavior that may have been veri consist over a number of year  and yet histori contain what can be veri disturb surpris in this regard   i mere suggest that one rememb that histori  i can   t add terribl much to the evid that profit and cash flow are rise   lead  e are still veri tight   we certain would be better off with a resumpt in the growth of employ  but i think we have to recogn that the aggreg amount of compens is a function of the gdp and it distribut is a function of whether it   s relat to employ or product   obvious  if at ani given level of compens and gdp we have an acceler in product  the economi will end up with higher unemploy  and those who are employ will earn higher real wage   what invari happen in that case is that the distribut of incom becom less equal but the level remain the same   unless we can argu that the propens to spend is signific higher in the lower incom group than in the higher incom group  which seem to be the convent wisdom though it   not seem to be valid all that much by the data  then whether we are get product gain or get more employ onli modest affect the averag propens to consum   even so  there   s veri littl doubt in my judgment that rise employ   affect overal confid and exert an effect on consumpt from that direct   so it is import that we get the rate of gdp growth up adequ abov that of product to get an upturn in employ   i must admit that i   m a littl skeptic about the size of the      rise in employ project in the  book   that   s basic becaus i find it hard to believ that product growth is go to fall as far as the staff has it declin   but that   s a minor issu  in ani event  the critic polici issu today probabl is reason clear for us   what is not clear is how we will proceed beyond today   i think the incom data are go to matter to a veri consider extent in test the differ hypothes of whether in fact we are live in a world that differ substanti from the one we have experienc in the post   world war ii period   that   s becaus the model we   re work with is not the model of the post   world war ii american economi   my bottom line is that we should stay where we are with the fund rate at   percent and retain essenti the same risk evalu that we adopt in june   governor
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   i will say to your broader philosoph question that i   m still struggl with whether or not be in a new world of greater uncertainti suggest more caution or more aggress behavior  given where the price measur are and the outlook for inflat   but for today i think your recommend seem to be the sounder one
i   m veri comfort with your recommend on both count  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  recent data give me more confid that an acceler in econom activ has final begun   at the same  e  howev  there is an uncomfort high risk that inflat may move lower than would be desir   on balanc  i do favor leav the fund rate unchang at the present  e and wait awhil to see if the incipi rebound continu to develop   i favor retain our current risk assess  with the risk be balanc for growth and weight toward the downsid for inflat   in express our risk assess  i would prefer to use the word in the bluebook that we actual vote on rather than an interpret like the one in the last press statement   i   d feel more comfort vote for a particular risk assess if i knew in advanc exact how it would be express to the public  this is an issu that i hope will be on the agenda for our discuss of communic in septemb
it will be   presid pool
mr  chairman  i support the recommend to keep the feder fund rate where it is   let me talk briefli about the communic process   ahead of communic strategi logic come the polici substanc   we have to know what it is that we realli want to communic  and i think some  that   s part of our problem   first of all  it   s easier to communic a polici decis   what the feder fund rate is go to be   becaus we pick the number   and it   s relat easi to explain the reason for that decis in term of the background of the recent data   it is much more difficult to communic condit under which we might chang the rate in the futur   the respons rule or the polici rule  if you will   it   s the regular or predict of the respons that the market realli want to know becaus to a great extent that determin what peopl will do and affect the decis they make   i don   t think we   re necessarili of one mind around the tabl about what our respons rule will look like  i will tell you what my view of it is in a veri general form in the current situat   i think we are like to want to keep the fund rate at the current level unless we see a veri good reason to chang it   that is  i believ we would tend to hang back from chang the rate until there is some compel reason to do so   if the economi is weaker than expect  there   s a lot of room for longer term rate to fall  which would provid more monetari accommod without our do anyth   i think we   re unlik to want to rais rate quick to fight inflationari pressur becaus we   re not like to confront such pressur in the immedi futur   but i feel quit strong that we should not commit ourselv to ani given length of  e that the rate would remain where it is   in sum  i believ it is veri difficult to explain the polici respons function that we might follow look ahead  so my instinct on this is that we should minim   absolut minim   the foreshadow of like futur chang in polici and concentr on what we are do right now   therefor  i would prefer to see the balanc of risk statement provid no hint about futur polici in term of a final sentenc about the two risk taken togeth   it seem to me that the market is go to read that as a forecast of the probabl futur direct to polici  wherea i person think we ought to be tell the market that we   re go to be on hold at a   percent fund rate for the forese futur
mr  chairman  i support your recommend on the fed fund rate and on the balanc of risk statement
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman   i had a reaction to your discuss about the potenti for an inventori swing to be a sourc of upsid risk   i   ve heard discuss in the technolog arena about long suppli line  veri low inventori  and the possibl that when demand begin to acceler   peopl in the industri say    if      there will be the potenti for a strong reaction to that demand so that it can be suppli   an offset to that  and one that i worri about a littl  is the increas proport of foreign good that are use in our overal capit invest process   i   m not sure how much that would offset the pickup from an inventori swing   with regard to the communic process  i don   t think we should chang anyth about the last statement as you have recommend   but i do agre with bill pool that develop a mechan wherebi we tri to assur the market that we are go to do one thing or anoth for a long period of  e is a recip for the kind of market volatil we   ve had   and i think we ought to be veri care about that
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i must say i   m attract to bob parri   s suggest   i   d like to think about it a littl more  but on the face of it his suggest make a lot of sens to me  and i   m look forward to our communic discuss next month
first vice presid stewart
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i also promis not to get too pessimist  but i feel that busi decisionmak is differ than it use to be   i think that   s part becaus of the global competit that presid pianalto talk about but also becaus of pressur from investor for a low risk  high return strategi   this is someth that   s familiar in the market  as i know it
i support your recommend for no chang in the fed fund rate and no chang in the three part statement   i think it   s the right thing to do and anyth els could confus the market   i have some sympathi with the notion that we don   t want to be too explicit about where we   re go if we don   t know exact   so i agre that we ought to be cautious  along the line of bill pool   s argument about not promis too much  becaus we know we may not be abl to deliv
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i   d like to associ myself close with bob parri   s suggest that we think about the merit of have some discuss of how we are go to explain our action befor we vote   i   d also associ myself with bill pool   s comment about be extrem care in term of what we say about futur polici action   we may be as surpris on the other side in futur month as we have been with the disinfl in recent month   thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman   i would comment that what struck me about your remark was the discuss about who has the right model   whether the feder reserv   or the market     of cours  there are lot of other possibl   in that regard i have to admit that i   m less concern about further disinfl or even deflat than perhap mani other around the tabl   it   s true that we   ve had a posit product shock in the unit state  china  india  and probabl part of central and ea n europ  and i   m no doubt leav out some import place   but it   s not clear to me that we ought to be as concern as i think we are about further reduct in the rate of inflat
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   in particular  i would not want to chang the format of the statement that we   ve been use for the last two meet  today would not be the appropri  e to do it   i look forward to the discuss at our next meet of how we   re go to communic in the futur
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  and i  too  look forward to our septemb discuss on communic
i support both part of your recommend
i support both part of your recommend  mr  chairman   let me just say a word on the communic issu becaus we do need to be veri care   we   ve seen in the last two meet that our word have been far more power than our polici decis in term of chang market   so  inde  our communic are a veri  veri power tool  now  the reaction of the committe has been that it   s so power that perhap we want to stay away from it complet    laughter   but if we give no inform about our futur intent  then somehow or anoth the market has to make an assumpt or come to some conclus about what our polici is go to be   the presumpt  therefor  is that we are so bad at give inform that we better leav it to the market to draw inform from noth   i don   t want to be that pessimist   i would hope that in the futur we could think of way that we could fine tune our communic to use it product   particular near the zero bound  it could becom an import part of our tool kit   obvious  bad communic is much wors than no communic  but i wouldn   t want to rule out communic complet as a way of tri to enhanc our arsenal   thank you
i support both part of the recommend  and i also look forward to our meet in septemb regard communic
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support both part of your recommend   i agre with those who   ve said that it   s veri difficult to talk about the futur  and i play second fiddl to no one in my humil regard my abil to forecast  as you can attest to over the year  that humil is well earn   i also agre with presid pool that it would be veri riski and counterproduct to promis to keep rate at a particular level for a certain period of  e   but like governor bernank  i think we need to work on how we talk about our assess and judgment regard the economi and our object go forward  without perhap be veri specif   to the extent that the market make their judgment about futur rate with a more accur es  or knowledg of what we   re think about  we   re go to get better feedback from the market   the market are go to act in a more stabil way even when they don   t agre with us  which is fine   but they need to know what we   re think about in order to do a good job of assess how the     pound gorilla in the money market view the outlook   so  while i agre that we need to give more thought to it  i haven   t given up entir on tri to do someth in term of how we communic about the futur  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend   i think if we did anyth other than keep the negat bias today  the fund market would go even crazier  and long rate would back up even more   i just don   t see how we can do that  i   m probabl the onli one here who is not particular look forward to the septemb discuss  laughter  becaus i   m not sure i see my way through it   i guess i should confess that it   s part becaus my wife has been tell me for forti year now that i don   t communic particular well    laughter   so i have that advers mental associ with the whole concept  i just find this a veri hard issu to address   first  on the statement itself i have express my reserv befor about ad up or balanc the output risk and the inflat risk   i   ve alway had that problem   second  i think the phrase    the probabl  though minor  of an unwelcom substanti fall in inflat    may have serv us well a coupl of month ago  but as the probabl of this substanti fall get more and more minor  that sentenc is go to have to be chang   and i   m not sure how to do that   the third problem is that ani  e we chang anyth in this paragraph  even a comma  there is a huge market reaction   the way the market react even to minor inflect of what we say scare me   so i think that   s a real problem in tri to communic and be honest about what we think  along with mani of you  i share the reluct to pre commit to a futur polici cours  howev  i   m on the side of governor bernank and kohn in feel that we probabl do have to get into this issu a littl in term of explain our assess of the outlook   at some point  the way we do it now is not go to work   and mayb that point has come alreadi   but i just don   t know how best to chang our approach   this whole process take place in a fishbowl   so i find the topic veri difficult and depress  and i don   t look forward to discuss it   sorri
i just want to note that we have not been issu a press releas after the end of each meet for veri long   we can alway return to our previous procedur  if that will make you sleep better
no  i think we have to do this  but i just don   t see how to do it
well  we can leav it to   to explain it and solv the problem   would you read the appropri direct languag
the word is on page    of the bluebook   for the direct      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent     then for the risk assess sentenc that are not part of the direct      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the risk to the committe   s outlook for sustain econom growth over the next sever quarter are balanc  the risk to it outlook for inflat over the next sever quarter are weight toward the downsid  and  taken togeth  the balanc of risk to it object are weight toward the downsid in the forese futur
call the roll
chairman  span  governor bernank governor bie   presid broaddus  governor   governor     presid guynn governor kohn          yes  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  presid    governor olson presid parri  first vice presid stewart     yes yes yes yes
where is michell smith   will you distribut the propos statement  michell     paus
may i speak
i think the statement look good   it   s quit consist with the last statement  which i gather from our survey is what the market expect   so in that sens i think this is a good statement   i wouldn   t chang anyth about it
this  as you notic  is repeat word we   ve state previous   i might say that a number of us have been struggl with this whole communic issu      do you want to discuss what our plan are on this
well  like governor    i am not look forward to the next meet
i   m sorri  i may have cut short the previous discuss   i was assum becaus i heard no negat comment that the statement is okay with everyon  but i don   t want to assum that   are there ani further comment   yes  presid moscow
i think the word of the last paragraph is a real improv   the onli question i have is in the second paragraph where the term    mix    is use to describ the labor market indic   i tend to view them as less posit
the    mix    is becaus of the initi claim data
but those involv season issu and
well  the initi claim are down   and the payrol employ statist clear had a bias in them  the season that occur in the payrol employ seri becaus juli   was on a friday is potenti a problem   the unemploy rate came down   the number are truli mix   to say more than that we   d have to add anoth sentenc  and i   m not sure we should be do that
i just hope it  sn   t give too op ist a view of the labor market at this point  which i view as a real question
i   d like to say that in my previous statement i attack the summari paragraph  but i agre that it   s much better this  e   it elabor our assess of the situat in a more realist way
could i reflect an opposit concern   our statement the last  e said someth along the line of this word   the probabl  though minor  of an unwelcom fall in inflat exceed that of a rise in inflat   therefor  we believ that  on balanc  the risk of inflat becom undesir low is like to be the predomin concern for the forese futur   now we   ve ad a third sentenc that not onli talk about disinfl again but also mention ward off unwelcom disinfl for a consider period   i   m just wonder whether that   s veer a littl too much toward the commit side than we need to or ought to do at this point   i would be happi if we stay more or less with the way we word it the last  e   that is  end after the second sentenc of the last paragraph   as the statement is draft here  we now have three sentenc emphas the disinfl concern  and i think that   s hit it too hard
the sentenc is veri consist with the chairman   s tes oni
that last sentenc come direct from the chairman   s tes oni  i think
yes   may i suggest someth   i have some sympathi for what you   re say   but this is not the meet to make that chang
i thought we   d come up with a statement from the committe for this meet that was as ident to the last one as we could get   that   s what i had in mind when i support the recommend
but rememb it   s a combin of word that   s almost ident to the last statement plus word from my tes oni on monetari polici  which is essenti what we have been use
also  the definit of what constitut    a consider period    is veri flexibl
i realiz that   but the big surpris of your recent tes oni was not this statement about disinfl   it was the relat op  about the prospect that the economi was go to get better   i thought it was a veri balanc statement on your part   the op   combin with the rang of our expect for growth  which under most peopl   s assess of potenti and so forth were surpris upbeat  was convey in the context of all the hand wring we had been do over sever week about further disinfl or deflat  so to me that sens of op  was the surpris in your tes oni   therefor  to go back in this statement to three sentenc of emphasi on disinfl seem to me to be chang a bit the sens of our outlook in an environ in which i don   t think we should chang it
mr  chairman  may i speak to this   i see other want to comment as well
my sens of the last sentenc  cathi  is that it   s actual rather import  given what we   ve seen in term of chang in fed fund futur   it   s not that i think we ought to attempt to micromanag market becaus i know we can   t   but in term of the communic challeng  i do believ that it   s quit import for us to say as best we can that we expect to maintain an accommod polici  whatev that might be  recogn that growth will probabl pick up and has to pick up eventu   i think it would have some veri benefici effect to say that we can remain accommod for a period of  e  though again i   m not sure what that period of  e is   but my read of the last sentenc in the last paragraph is that in some sens it is the key respons to the veri volatil and uncertain market we   ve seen   i think it would be help after this meet for us to be quit clear about it   it   s not news in the sens that the chairman has alreadi said it onc in his tes oni on the semiannu report on monetari polici object   moreov  i think it is consist with what the market are expect and more help than not in term of be far less like to creat uncertainti   on the other hand  i don   t think it commit us to anyth that we don   t want to commit to becaus   by definit  if you will   if the data come in stronger  we   ll respond to that
i realli worri about our tri to target anyth in ani market with this statement
i   m not suggest that we tri to target anyth   i just want to tri to be clear about what we know and what we in this room are sens   i think the outsid world probabl hasn   t pick that up
yes   there is a critic addit to this statement  an issu that wasn   t mention in the last statement  and that is busi price power
we tend to talk about inflat in the context of the cpi or the ppi  the usual measur   but realli what this whole deflat issu is about is price power  there is none out there of which i   m awar   my judgment would be that  as soon as i see the emerg of busi price power  i would start to think about vote to remov the imbal with regard to inflat   in other word  so long as price power is nonexist  i would say that the risk of an emerg of inflat are minim   it   s littl more than definit  so i do think we   re in a period when we actual can make a statement that we can hold tight for   use a flexibl term      a consider period    without too much risk   if price power start to pick up and everyon notic that it   s pick up  which mean profit will be move and the whole system will be chang  i think we could readili chang our statement in such circumst with no signific disrupt
i don   t debat that at all   i think that   s total accur   my concern is that this statement introduc yet anoth slight varianc in a market environ that has alreadi been volatil   so i think we   d be better off make the statement plain and simpl and let the market sort thing out   then we can figur out in a littl more organ way in septemb how we want to communic some of these point
mayb all has been said that can be said  but i want to echo that last comment   i   m uncomfort with the last sentenc  and not becaus it   s not help in the current circumst  i think ben and don made the point veri well that it is   my concern is that it will be the first  e that  as part of the statement  we have made some veri explicit comment about futur polici  and i   m afraid it   s go to set a preced   i think we   ll be expect in futur statement after our meet to make parallel kind of comment at  e when that would not be help   i   m tri to weigh the help in the current circumst against move ten feet more down the slipperi slope of how much we say in these statement befor we have a chanc to talk about this next month   i just wonder if that   s a good trade today
i   d like to hear from the rest of you   i agre with governor   that there are slight variat in the way to say this   we could say  for exampl     in these circumst the committe believ    rather than    the committe judg     that altern is perhap a bit softer     judg    may be a stronger word   but this is an import issu  and i   d like to hear from those of you who have view one way or the other on this  governor
i   ll suggest a compromis   a lot of peopl do word count on these statement   count how often a particular word is use   i think we can convey roger   s sens of the messag in that last sentenc but cut down the use of the word    disinfl    by one  by drop    aim at rais    all the way through to    disinfl      in other word  roger want to convey that polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period  and we can do that without all these word and without rais the word count on disinfl   so my first point is to offer that as a compromis   second  i actual like this sentenc  but procedur i would not be upset if we wait until next  e  after we realli think through all the implic  to includ it   so my first prefer would be just to drop the phrase i mention  and my second choic would be to hold it over until next  e
on balanc  i think it would be prefer to drop the last sentenc becaus it   chang the statement  which get attent  and then expect chang   if we just repeat what we said befor  we   re signal to everyon that polici is on hold   in term of polici announc or implic  i think that is the safer cours  and we can have a full discuss of these communic issu at the septemb meet   i recogn that this last sentenc come out of the semiannu monetari polici report  but if it becom part of the committe   s statement  it will receiv more emphasi
i don   t wish to impli that the monetari polici report and tes oni have the same status as these statement
no  i   m not suggest that you are   i   m just say that have that word here   tend to bring out the point more forc
cathi  if i understand what you   re say  you   re recommend that we simpli drop that last sentenc
that would go a long way
i would associ myself with that posit   whether or not it   s your
drop the last sentenc would be a good idea in my view   i read that next to the last sentenc as a pretti clear signal that we   re go to be on hold for the forese futur becaus of the concern about a possibl further declin in inflat   make the statement veri  veri ters  which drop that last sentenc    seem to me to send a signal that we   re go to stand where we are   that we   re satisfi with the current stanc of polici and that   s where we   re go to be   i think make the statement veri ters in and of itself send that messag
that   s what we did last  e
look at where it got us
actual  i rather like this last sentenc or some variat of it  though i recogn that it involv a bit of a risk   but i also recogn  as i think most peopl around the tabl would acknowledg  that what is built into the market now is not what we think is go to happen   that   s not to say that we can tell them exact what   s go to happen  but i   m a littl concern that there is a disconnect between what they think our reaction function is and what it actual is   there is a differ in the inflat pressur they see come and the inflat pressur we see come   so i think it   s worth take the risk to chang the statement to make that point   i thought take the sentenc from the chairman   s tes oni  though i agre it get much more attent and emphasi in the statement here  was a good way to do that   to me have the same statement that was in the tes oni and retain the same balanc of risk as last  e   even after the better econom data we   ve had   emphas our judgment  which is a littl differ than the market judgment   if the market want to stay where it is after see this statement from us  that   s fine  but it   s not clear to me that market particip understand what our think is  and i think this would help
whi  sn   t    forese futur    do that for you in the context of take out the third sentenc
i   ve been listen to this convers  and i will tell you that there is someth to the point that the last sentenc is essenti repeat the sentenc immedi preced it
it emphas it  i think
if there is ani signific doubt among us  we should not decid this issu on a major vote   if there is a substanti concern among even a larg minor of this group  whether they   re current vote member or nonvot  i think we   d probabl be wise to leav it until we can discuss matter more fulli in septemb   governor bernank
i would appeal to the committe to retain the sentenc becaus in my view it make a veri big differ   i think the addit of the sentenc will go some way to bring polici expect in the market toward what i heard around the tabl dure the entir meet today   it will have a benefici effect on the unit state economi  which is the ul  goal of this committe   i understand that due process and fair consider would milit toward go the bureaucrat way and have this issu on the agenda for septemb  but given our ul  object of help the economi  i think the right thing to do is to leav the suppress  or shorten  version in this statement  and i would appeal to the committe to leav it in
just to weigh in on this  i tend to have the opposit point of view from governor bernank   i support cathi   s posit for a lot of the reason that have alreadi been state   i just don   t think this is go to buy us that much   i don   t think we need it  given the languag in the preced sentenc   also  i   m a littl concern that we have been critic  mayb unfair  for tri to manipul market  and i think put this sentenc in is go to reviv some of that sen ent   we don   t realli need that   we are go to talk about this topic next  e   so for me the tradeoff are such that i favor pretti strong not put it in this  e
mr  chairman  i   m sort of split on the last sentenc   i think the final sentenc in the second paragraph on price power is a realli good addit  and i like that a lot   a part of the last sentenc that troubl me is the phrase    without ul  stoke inflationari pressur     which we haven   t talk about   that phrase make me uncomfort   in light of your admonit to be humbl  to say that we can maintain an accommod stanc    for a consider period without ul           sound like an extrem posit   i would suggest that we might want to end the sentenc by put the period after the word    period
it use to be there    let me tell you what the altern seem to be come down to   i would say that we have two choic   either drop the sentenc complet  or just say     in these circumst  the committe believ that polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period      i hate to ask for a vote  but it   s the onli way i   m go to get a real sens of this group   one altern is to leav in the truncat version  the other is to drop it entir   i will stipul that  unless we get a signific vote in favor of put it in  i would recommend that we drop it and bring it up for discuss   not this particular sentenc but the basic process   next  e   may i see a show of hand
could you read it again  pleas
yes   in fact  let me read the whole last paragraph   i think that   s a better way of do it      the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal   in contrast  the probabl  though minor  of an unwelcom fall in inflat exceed that of a rise in inflat from it alreadi low level   the committe believ that  on balanc  the risk of inflat becom undesir low is like to be the predomin concern for the forese futur   in these circumst  the committe judg that polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period
judg    or    believ      you said    believ    the first  e
i know  and the reason i chang it was becaus i had    the committe believ    in the preced sentenc   i   ll put it back to    believ    and use    judg    in the previous sentenc   can i see a show of hand on drop that last sentenc complet
those who prefer to drop it
yes  to stop at the phrase    the risk of inflat becom undesir low is like to be the predomin concern for the forese futur      that   s the end of the statement  period   let   s get a count
everyon  both vote and nonvot member of the group
yes  in this case it should be vote and nonvot member on the ground that this is a procedur question and i think everyon   s voic should be heard   so  can i just see by a show of hand those who prefer to drop the sentenc complet  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven   it   s seven of nineteen
bob   had to depart to catch a plane
well  on the basi of that vote it   s right on the margin  but i would say that we have to put in the truncat version of the final sentenc
i think that   s right
and we will revisit this issu becaus this whole question is go to be a veri import one   final    you can get your few word in   mayb there   s noth left to say
main  i should issu a warn that the next meet will be a long day for you   we   ll reconven the meet after lunch to talk about both the process and the content of the press statement   that will be the first item of discuss on communic   and then  depend on the outcom of that discuss  we   ll ask what you   d like to talk about at the januari meet   whether you want to consid more aspect of communic in januari
so that mean the discuss on communic next  e would not affect our statement after the septemb meet   is that right
i don   t know practic how to do it ani other way becaus
the meet could start at   o   clock in the morn
we could start at      p m   for someon from california that would be easier    laughter
well  we can start at      a m  and serv breakfast
if that   s what you would like  we can do that
i should just let you know that the media peopl know exact when each fomc meet begin   we   d have to explain to them that the meet start at      a m  and give them some reason for that   otherwis we could see some excit out front
i see   do we have to announc that in advanc
we announc when the meet begin  typic the media peopl wait on the phone until      a m   and someon from our offic scurri back to the phone and say the meet began at      a m
what happen if we   re two minut late
we would tell them it start at      a m
it   s also the case that they often   but not alway   ask when the meet end   so we may veri well have to explain whi the meet has been extend if we reconven after lunch
can we have a dinner meet the previous night without creat a big problem
as sort of an intermeet meet
governor   has an insight
i don   t have an insight   i have a question   i   ve been worri about this increas as our meet have gotten longer   what happen if we   re not done at      p m   the  e we usual releas the press statement
we haven   t had to face that    laughter  speaker      good answer
we don   t commit to have the statement out at      p m   it has just been our practic to releas it then
we don   t commit to a  e
so it   s easier to go beyond the typic  e period on that end than it is on the other
i gave you a bit of a legalist interpret   these peopl will get a littl crazi if they don   t hear someth from us around the usual  e
governor   has an interest recommend
well  it   s a procedur recommend   i think we could easili have a dinner meet the previous night  and we could treat it as we do ani other intermeet discuss
if an intermeet discuss is held  it wouldn   t be announc until later  call
yes  we announc it the way we did it after
oh  i thought you were talk about have a confer
well  we could have a confer call   either we could have a confer call to discuss communic  or we could do it in person   but in either case  we   d announc the fact that we met for an intermeet discuss in the same way that we announc confer call
a confer call for this type of discuss is veri difficult to do
yes  i think we   d want to discuss this issu in person   but i would say   and frank i don   t know if you   d want to handl a breakfast meet this way   that theoret we could argu that we would treat a breakfast meet as though it were ani other intermeet discuss   and we would announc that in the usual way  when we releas the minut of the previous meet
have a breakfast from      to      a m
the breakfast would be from      to      a m   and then the regular meet would begin at      a m
then the meet begin   that   s a littl sneaki
well  it   s legal in term of our definit of a meet   laughter  but i think it   s easier to handl the dinner meet in that way
that   s whi we need lawyer
no  that   s whi you don   t need lawyer    laughter   i would suggest that we have the dinner meet  it   s easier to bifurc that from the regular meet and treat it the way we do ani other intermeet discuss
it also give us more flexibl and  e
yes  it also give us more flexibl and  e
okay   we will arrang a dinner on monday befor the next meet to discuss communic
is it anybodi   s birthday  incident    laughter
you need to announc the date of the next meet befor we close today
the next meet is septemb      we will get togeth on monday night  septemb     for a dinner and discuss  end of meet
