good morn  everyon   befor we get start  i just want to thank you for what was an extraordinari even for me and also a big surpris   i appreci not onli that all of you show up but  as best i can judg  that  virtual everyon els who was physic abl to do so also show up   so  it was great  on to offici busi   mr  kos  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   the now lengthi period of tight spread  and low volatil continu in the intermeet period   that was despit some  unexpect credit event  anoth hurrican  and increas talk about upsid inflat risk    the top panel on page   graph the   month deposit rate in black and the same rate three and nine month forward in red   the    and   month forward rate rose    and    basi point  respect  as market particip absorb incom data and  even more  comment by committe member express heighten level of concern about upsid inflat risk   mani market particip now assum that the committe will tighten dure each of the next four meet  includ the first meet to be presid over by the new chairman   the tone of market expect   at least among trader as oppos to street economist   has chang a bit   earlier this summer the bet was about where the co call    neutral    rate resid   the assumpt was that the committe would stop in that neighborhood   now  with increas concern about inflat  the question of where neutral resid is slowli be supersed by a new question  how far beyond    neutral    will polici need to go to dampen inflationari pressur   the yield curv rose across matur  as shown in the middl panel   the   year treasuri yield rose    basi point while the    year yield rose     appar affect in part by mbs relat hedg flow   the   year yield is at it highest level sinc may        the shape of the curv narrow by    basi point and sit at a relat narrow    basi point   while the convers in market was about inflat  interest  break even inflat rate from tip  treasuri inflat protect secur  were littl     the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix            chang  as seen in the bottom panel   the   year break even inflat  bei  rate had risen over the summer as energi price ralli  but it plateau and came off a bit as the price of oil head back down   the    year bei was littl chang  this suggest that the rise in nomin yield was an increas in real rate and suggest of tighten financi condit   the sluggish in equiti market until this past friday was consist with this view   the behavior of break even rate also call into question some of the instant analysi surround ben bernank   s nomin last monday   while some analyst were quick to attribut the rise in nomin yield last week to the nomin   on the basi of some perceiv squishi on inflat   the rise in real yield  which had alreadi been in train  and the flat of bei do not bear this out    if there is some suggest that financi condit are tighten  the evid elsewher was mix   certain  yield in other major economi have been move higher sinc the end of the summer  as shown in the top panel of page     long term sovereign yield in the u k   canada  and germani   the latter as a proxi for the euro area   have been rise recent   the rise of near    basi point in german yield has been particular noteworthi and may reflect upgrad forecast for european growth in general and improv sen ent toward germani  notwithstand a messi elect outcom that leav prospect for reform uncertain    even japanes yield have been rise recent   investor are increas  contempl that mayb  just mayb  after so mani fals start  this  e the recoveri is for real   the better econom tempo and heighten probabl that some  in the next    month the cpi will no longer be preced by a negat sign are lead more investor to take a defens postur toward japanes bond   expect about near term polici in those same countri are broad consist with the movement in longer date yield   the middl panel graph march      futur price for short date interest rate for the u s   u k   canada and the euro area   short  l futur are flat   in itself noteworthi  given that the bank of england most recent eas polici   the other are all move upward to vari degre   the middl right panel graph the decemb      euro yen deposit futur contract  which has also risen as the market tri to anticip the end of the bank of japan   s  boj  quantit eas polici  now expect by the market   and the boj  as report in the month report ye day   to be some  in the fiscal year begin on april     if the develop world provid evid that financi condit are tighten  the same cannot be said for the emerg market   the embi  emerg market bond index  spread was littl chang and is at histor tight level   despit higher dollar rate  the central bank of brazil and mexico     have both been abl to eas monetari polici   albeit from high level   in recent day and week  as reflect in the bottom panel   brazil and colombia have manag to issu local currenc denomin debt in the intern market at  attract rate  as have some privat borrow in asia   this decoupl from polici rate in the major economi stand in sharp contrast to previous cycl  and to emerg market bull  it reflect a better polici mix  higher reserv  and a strong global economi   as with emerg market  the byword in domest credit market seem to be    what  me worri      despit some high profil bankruptci in airlin  auto part  and the surpris collaps of refco  credit market were not flu  and took the news in stride   as shown in the top panel on page    both invest grade and high yield spread move onli slight and remain at histor tight level    the bankruptci of delta and northwest were dismiss  have been long expect   the delphi bankruptci was also broad expect   and yet when it happen  protect for general motor in the cds  credit default swap  market temporarili shot higher  as shown in the middl panel   the prospect that gm might have to absorb billion of dollar of addit pension cost got trader    attent   ford motor cds rate were also affect   but the broader dow jone cdx high yield index   compris of     singl name   was littl chang   one collaps that was not expect was that of refco  whose fraud was made public the morn of octob    and which file for bankruptci on octob     refco is a small corpor bond issuer but it   have linkag to firm across wall street   all in all  the stress eman from refco was limit   the rather  busi graph at the bottom of page   depict credit default swap rate for eight major financi firm sinc januari   note the temporari increas in the price of protect for these firm in the spring  when gm and ford were downgrad and the so call    correl trade    began to go bad   in contrast  the refco news did not even regist a blip in cds rate   overal  market are pose someth of a puzzl   the rise in real yield and the fall in equiti price for most of septemb and octob suggest a tighten of financi condit   there were both expect and unexpect bankruptci file   yet both emerg market and domest credit market were unfaz  and money continu to seek higher yield asset   mayb it realli is differ this  e   then again  mayb the reaction will come with a lag that is longer than usual   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
thank you   i notic that we still don   t endeavor to calcul the implicit    or   year break even inflat rate   subtract out the implicit cpi forecast from what the futur market are tell us about energi price to get inferenti what the cpi ex food  and energi would be if one presum that the energi futur market are arbitrag against the tip
i may be wrong  but didn   t we do
we have a cottag industri  mr  chairman
i don   t recal see ani calcul recent
i think this question came up about a year ago  and   was summar the  work that had been done
what we do is take the energi futur curv  take the weight in the cpi
yes  but i never saw the result
actual  governor   saw someth veri similar just this week
that still  sn   t answer my question    laughter
i guess the answer is that you do have a need to know  and you will   laughter
well  can you just give me a hint as to what i   m go to learn
in previous episod  increas in spot oil price had brought the spot rate well abov the longer ahead futur rate  which impli that market particip were expect inflat compens to be go down becaus of the anticip declin in energi price  relat to those episod  this  e around the curv is relat flat  so you don   t have that   and it   s a more perman effect   it affect the veri near term part of the curv  but it   s a relat  small weight in the total
okay   thank you   on page   in the upper left hand chart  i  notic that the relationship among these sovereign debt yield  which we   ve been look at for a   long  e  have gradual morph from fair low correl to extrem high correl   do we have ani roll correl coeffici that suggest when that happen and the  presumpt hypothes as to whi   are we look at the same issu that i inadvert call a   conundrum earli this year   or is this go back well befor then
you know  i haven   t look at the roll correl coeffici recent  certain  there have been episod  go back at least a decad  when these rate move veri  veri close       was a period
for a while
right   then the correl sort of break down and then it start up again   i don   t know if   know more about a date  but over the past coupl of year they have been move pretti tight
i would say that has been the case sinc move out of the recess   sinc earli      or someth like that   we benchmark this correl from  e to  e   i don   t know that we   ve done it quit as a roll correl but we easili could  and we will
you know  the roll coeffici is a measur of the degre of global
it is   it   s also  though  indic of the natur of the shock that are  perceiv by market particip   so  to the extent those are idiosyncrat to individu countri  it  tend to caus the correl to fall apart   to the extent they are perceiv to be global  those rate move togeth      on top of that is the issu of whether or not portfolio holder are hold a suffici divers portfolio that ani adjust they might make in respons to a shock is go to be spread across   market  becaus they   re go to rebal and they   re go to achiev the new risk return mix that they   re look for   and there   s some of that go on   that   s  i think  what you mean by the term global   that portfolio holder  by the way they adjust their portfolio  do some of this  but it   s certain true that this come and goe a bit  and we can look to see how the correl  coeffici has develop
i   ve had the vagu impress that it   s been except tight  over the most recent period  more so than i recal   this chart  sn   t suggest spike of ani type  but  it suggest just plain old fashion arbitrag   on the brazilian and colombian issuanc you refer to  i presum these were issu in  their local currenc
denomin in local currenc
the brazilian issu was denomin in real  but actual the payment will be in dollar   it   s index back to real  so the exchang rate risk is wholli with the investor
whi are they do that   whi not just pay off in real
well  they are abl to get a much more attract rate   the spread that they   re  abl to get
do you mean the princip is guarante in dollar
the princip is repaid in dollar
you mean it   s guarante in
no   the payment is in dollar
but it   s index to the exchang rate
wait a second
in other word  the flow of payment you receiv is in dollar   when you get your   money back  you will be paid dollar
for the old bradi bond the princip was guarante in dollar   that is not what this is
that   s right
well  it   s not clear to me whi they are do that   if you have a freeli float exchang rate   if i understand what you   re tell me   the holder can just as easili get the payment in real and convert it to dollar
for reason that i can   t fulli explain  the spread that brazil was abl to get by  do it this way has been much tighter
well  i think these secur were target to intern investor more   i find it a littl puzzl whi it work this way  but it was not the case that these were sold into the domest market and happen to be bought by intern folk and  therefor  isn   t that a good   sign   these were realli target for foreign investor  denomin in the domest currenc  so as to give them the brazilian interest rate and the colombian interest rate   it is thought that peopl who are search for yield would want to add these sort of secur to their portfolio  and they did
but isn   t the onli differ that should exist the transact cost of the convers of the currenc
mr  chairman  there is also convers risk   that is  a sovereign govern at a later date could limit what it currenc could be use for   wit all the capit control in the      s and      s
so  in principl  if you   re guarante the payment in dollar  you know you   ll get dollar rather than real that perhap couldn   t be use for as mani thing later on
you realli begin to get a multipl exchang rate type of thing   so that would explain part of it   if that   s the case  howev    the investor know which particular  exchang rate he will be hit with   it  sn   t strike me that that   s a great defens
no   you are basic take on countri risk and exchang rate risk when you buy these issu
is the colombian issu the same
i   m not as familiar with the colombian one   i don   t rememb the detail of that
i   m not sure either   in colombia   s case  given that there is to a certain extent a dollar compon of their economi
this is not the status of the mexican peso issu of sever year ago  which was just a pure local currenc for the first  e ever
actual  i believ colombia   s was pure local currenc  domest  at a    year matur for the first  e in a long  e
on the bottom of page    are these brokerag sector cds   is  this the mix of their individu portfolio or their es  of the total market
no  no   this is if you want to buy protect on  say  lehman brother or bear  stearn   this is the price of protect on these firm
oh  this is the actual credit default swap on lehman brother  or on
yes  all eight of them
this tell you a good deal about the individu firm   that   s   interest
there   s a moral hazard in there  too  if you look at it    laughter
i   m go back in the privat sector   i   ve got to know who   s  riski    laughter   that was off the record    laughter
this come from a privat sector firm  so there   s no insid inform here
dino  did i hear you correct   what is the probabl of  a move in march
the probabl  base on fed fund futur  i think is pretti low right now   my point was more about the way that peopl in the market are slowli come to view the situat   in this cycl  they   ve been look two to three meet ahead   but the next few meet are a bit  differ  obvious   i believ trader are think that the polici move over the next coupl of  meet are more or less bake in the cake   the new chairman won   t want to be in the posit where he has to    stop    and confirm the dovish suspicion of some of the folk out there   so that  get you to the next four meet  basic   but that fourth one i don   t think is in the fed fund  futur
mr  vice chairman  the expect fund rate in april  which is a fair clean read on the march meet   is about   or   basi point abov     percent   so that put a    percent probabl of action there
yes   i apolog for even ask this   i may have becom color blind this morn  but i can   t tell which firm are which at the bottom of page     there are two tier  right  don   t tell me all of them  but which one are at the bottom
it   s citigroup and bank of america
obvious  we   ve creat a full array of insight  which ha   evok no question    laughter   we   re go to run out of  e
i do need a vote
you do need a vote   vice chair
without object  the transact of the desk are approv  we   ll turn now to mr    and ms   son
thank you  mr  chairman   most peopl that i know realli seem to dislik how earli holiday decor go up at the shop mall these day   not me   i=m a forward look kind of guy who like to plan ahead   you folk are alreadi on my mind  and i know what would make the perfect holiday gift for you this year  the answer to two question   how much more will monetari polici need to be tighten to secur stabl price and maximum employ   and  how will you know when you have reach that point  unfortun  nieman marcus is not carri that gift this year  so you will have to settl for the usual from me   anoth  book forecast   yes  i know that= about as excit as a new pair of sock on christma morn   but on the assumpt that it= the thought that count  i=ll offer my thought on those question this morn       obvious  there is an explicit answer in the  book to the question of how much farther tighten will need to proceed  and our answer is not much farther  we have assum that the fund rate top out at    percent by the end of the year   a figur onli slight below current market expect that place the peak at a bit abov     percent   in set that path  we need to consid both the current momentum of the economi and the princip forc like to be shape the contour of aggreg demand over the next two year   at the  e of the septemb  book  we had expect hurrican katrina to exert notic restraint on econom activ over the remaind of the second half   the anticip drag reflect disrupt to product in the region  as well as the broader respons of consum spend to the steep run up in retail energi price that follow in the wake of the storm   but we saw this shock as hit an economi that had retain consider momentum over the summer month and did not think that it would be of suffici dimens to derail the expans   sinc then we have grappl with the effect of hurrican rita  which further slam the energi produc sector in the gulf coast and put ad upward pressur most notabl on the price of natur gas  and hurrican wilma  which caus disrupt and properti damag in florida   much as we had anticip six week ago  we are now in a thick data fog that make it difficult to separ the under trend in the economi from the influenc of the storm   but we are feel increas comfort argu that the data support our earlier view that the economi would retain it momentum this fall   to begin  payrol employ fell in septemb  but that declin was not as larg as we had expect  and the bls  bureau of labor statist  note that employ gain outsid the area affect by katrina were on pace with those earlier in the year   industri product took a veri larg hit in septemb from  the combin effect of the hurrican and the boe strike  but absent those factor  factori output appar would have pick up notic in that month  and report from purchas manag indic that these gain are like to continu in the period immedi ahead   as you know  we receiv the bea=  bureau of econom analysi  advanc es  of third quarter gdp last week after the  book was complet  real gdp is es  to have increas     percent at an annual rate last quarter  about    percentag point abov our forecast   at this point  we have found no major reason to quarrel with the bea and would probabl revis up our forecast of the third quarter toward their es    we also didn=t see much in that releas that would caus us to revis our project increas in real gdp of     percent in the fourth quarter   in ani event  take all of this inform togeth  we see the economi as have been at least as strong  if not a bit stronger  than we had anticip in the septemb  book       we project activ to advanc at a    percent pace in the first half of        similar to that in the second half of this year   we are expect that rebuild effort and govern transfer payment will be provid a notic lift to activ dure that period   but asid from those influenc  broader macroeconom forc are project to slow the pace of activ as we move through      and        tighter monetari polici  wane wealth effect    includ a slowdown in hous price appreci   and diminish fiscal s ulus all work to brake the current momentum in activ   those effect are  onli part offset by some support to dispos incom and spend from a project fall in energi price   all told  the growth of real gdp is expect to be close to the pace of potenti dure the next two year   a bit abov it in      and a bit below it in        view from a slight differ perspect  the gradual but steadi tighten of monetari polici over the past year and a half has move the real feder fund rate into the rang of es  of the equilibrium real rate   that assess is not idiosyncrat to the  book   the model base es  that we provid to you in the bluebook are in the same ballpark   these es  of the equilibrium real rate remain a bit to the low side of  histor norm  but that seem reason to us for two reason   first  the invest share of output has recov over the past sever year  but it remain below trend   second  and perhap more import  the extern sector continu to siphon off a notic portion of domest demand   these influenc persist in our project  suggest to us that real rate will need to be a littl lower than usual over the next two year   of cours  it is worth rememb that a    percent confid interv around the es  of the equilibrium real rate is   percentag point wide   so there is plenti of scope for reason women and men to come to differ view on this issu   that is especi so becaus the es  of r  do not indic the level of rate necessari to produc ani specif desir rate of inflat   those wide confid interv suggest that the answer to the second question  how will you know when an appropri stop point has been reach  will be far from obvious   after all  under our baselin project  real gdp will be grow at a    percent rate in the first half of next year   fa  than potenti   to be sure  as i note earlier  we will attribut that to rebuild effect  but it will be hard to have much convict about our abil to es  the size of those effect   moreov  on our forecast  core pce  person consumpt expenditur  inflat will be edg up earli next year to a pace just shi of     percent   the difficulti is that the case for stop soon is predic on develop that remain forecast rather than fact   for exampl  ani diminish of the impetus to household spend from rise wealth will depend import on the cours of hous price   we are project hous price to deceler from this     year=    percent increas to   percent in      and     percent in        we seem  to be hear with greater frequenc anecdot of some cool in hous market  but that certain is not yet evid in the data   fiscal polici also is an import element in the project slow of econom activ over the next two year   after hurrican relat spend tail off over the first half of next year  we are expect real feder purchas to be about flat over the remaind of the project period   we have been encourag by the heighten concern be express by mani on capitol hill about the deterior fiscal pictur and the need for greater spend disciplin   inde  our assum     billion hurrican relief packag that appear so modest compar with the figur be bandi about at the  e of the last meet is look pretti good right now   but whether that translat into more durabl disciplin is obvious open to question   so the bottom line is that  as we move into next year  you are like to have data in hand that continu to suggest solid expans  but a forecast of some notic slow by the second half of next year and into        confront with this situat  one could approach the staff project in a manner similar to that with which presid reagan approach the soviet union   trust  but verifi   in other word  continu to tighten until the data show more convinc the effect of polici restraint   along those line  we includ in the  book a simul that laid out the consequ of steadili rais the fund rate to   percent by the meet in may        this addit tighten drop the growth of real gdp to just a bit abov    percent late next year and into       and with growth below that of potenti  the unemploy rate rise to about     percent by the end of the project period   core pce inflat edg down to    percent that year  and further disinfl would be in train beyond the forecast horizon   depend on your polici prefer  this outcom might not even be character as an    overshoot    but rather simpli establish more firm a core inflat rate comfort below   percent   of cours  there are consider risk surround the baselin project  and some of those risk would be amplifi by a more aggress tighten of polici   one obvious concern is that at some point the tighten of polici could trigger a more pronounc retrench in spend and activ   in that regard  there are a few straw in the wind worthi of your attent  most of which are center in the household sector   motor vehicl sale have drop off sharpli sinc juli  and consum spend exclud motor vehicl slow notic over the same period and is es  to have actual declin in septemb   so we are head into the fourth quarter on a weak note   the soften of spend has also coincid with a steep drop in consum sen ent  and all of this has occur in advanc of household receiv some veri hefti heat bill this winter       should these develop portend a more sustain weaken in consum spend  there could be consequ for busi sen ent as well  busi attitud never seem to shift convinc from caution to exuber in this expans  and the continu solid gain in capit spend that underpin our forecast might not materi if the strength and durabl of the econom expans were call into question   i should stress that this is not how we are read the recent data   the slump in motor vehicl sale look to us like a payback for the extraordinari spike that occur this summer  the drop in other consum spend in septemb most like reflect the disrupt associ with hurrican  and declin in consum sen ent  like the stock market  have predict mani more recess than have actual occur over the year   we don=t yet see the sign of cyclic contract   but then again  if truth be told  we rare do much in advanc   of cours  we see some promin risk on the other side of our baselin project  and some of those risk would be moder by a more aggress tighten of polici   one risk is that we are underes  the under strength of the expans  and that left unattend this momentum will carri the economi beyond it potenti   certain  last week= stronger than expect es  of third quarter real gdp provid some support to this concern   with margin of slack in both product and labor market alreadi slim and with pressur on busi cost intens  an overshoot could result in a further deterior in the inflat pictur   our view that the aggreg suppli curv is relat flat impli the deterior in inflat would probabl be small  but it also impli that wring out the ad inflat would be cost   furthermor  ani tendenc for inflat expect to come unmoor would simpli compound the cost of move inflat back into a more comfort zone   while i acknowledg these concern  i don=t  in fact  believ that the risk to our inflat project are skew to the upsid   as you know from read the  book  we are expect that the further run up in energi price in recent month will pass through into core inflat earli next year and that the higher headlin inflat that we have experienc this year and last will result in some modest increas in inflat expect that feed back into the growth of labor  cost   howev  to date  indic of a notic deterior in inflat expect are larg limit to the veri recent step up in the michigan survey measur  which occur in the wake of the spike in gasolin price in septemb   and last week= news on labor cost was a touch to the low side of our expect and certain provid few hint of ani sizabl acceler   if inflat expect remain firm anchor  then there may be littl to no increas in core price inflat next year   so  in sum  i am confid that we will be wrong  but i don=t know in which direct       you know  the onli drawback to shop earli is that you have longer to second guess your choic   after work on these remark over the past few day  i have begun to wonder whether    pair of sock would not have been the more consider gift    laughter      will continu our remark
the staff forecast for real gdp growth and inflat abroad is littl chang this  e from the forecast in the septemb  book   this is the case despit addit hurrican  volatil energi price  and a notabl rise in long term interest rate in sever foreign industri countri dure the intermeet period   the futur path for wti  west texa intermedi  crude oil price retrac somewhat in octob   accord  we have

year and edg down in      and given that the effect of previous increas in crude price on inflat will wane and then end   such an outcom depend upon an absenc of signific second round effect of oil price on domest price and wage abroad   to date  core inflat in the major foreign countri confirm this is the case    the combin of continu growth and contain inflat pressur sound op ist   rest assur  we have found numer risk about which to worri   the elev energi price could sap consum demand more than we expect  undermin the pace of real growth   in the face of higher cost  busi spend on new capit could falter  particular in emerg asia where few countri have petroleum product sector   wage demand could react to the increas in headlin inflat and threaten to ignit a set of second  and third round effect   we do not see evid of these develop at this  e  but it is too soon to conclud that the danger of such action has pass   a second featur of the intern forecast that merit a few minut is the approxim neutral contribut of real net export to u s  real gdp growth in the third quarter  follow a posit contribut in the second quarter   the third quarter nipa  nation incom and product account  data releas last friday impli a slight smaller  less posit  contribut than we had incorpor in the  book baselin forecast or in the septemb forecast  howev  in the current quarter  compar with the septemb forecast  we are assum a greater rebound in export and have reduc our assess of the extent to which the extern sector will provid a drag on gdp growth  accord  we expect that on a four quarter chang basi  the extern sector will record a slight posit contribut to u s  real gdp growth for the year    the first annual posit contribut sinc        howev  we are not readi to declar that extern adjust has arriv  and we expect a return to a small drag on u s  growth from the extern sector in the current quarter and on balanc over the forecast period   on a quarter basi  both import and export are high variabl   season adjust real oil import impart notabl quarter to quarter varianc to real     import   but recent we have experienc weak in other compon of real import   dure this intermeet period  import again surpris us on the downsid  with august data for nomin import much weaker than expect  this negat surpris includ both good and servic  and within good  it was particular the case for import of consum good and industri suppli   for the near term forecast we have includ some effect as a result of the hurrican and the disrupt to general trade they caus   as a result  there is some implicit payback in the forecast for real import in the fourth quarter   nevertheless  compar with the septemb  book  we have lower the growth of real import in      and      in respons to the somewhat softer outlook for u s  activ and to a higher path for import price   growth of third quarter real export was also revis down  although not by enough to offset weaker import   hurrican effect also figur in our es  for third quarter export  more signific has been the recent strike at boe   we judg that the strike had a more pronounc impact on september= export than we previous thought  lead us to weaken real export for last quarter   but the rapid conclus of that strike also led us to strengthen real export for the current quarter   for      and       we expect export growth will averag a bit abov   percent per year  consist with our outlook for steadi real output growth abroad   in sum  actual trade data through august  our es  of how the turbul weather of recent month has affect export and import  and our project of global primari commod price  particular crude oil  combin to impli unusu quarter to quarter fluctuat in growth of real export and real import  some of these develop have surpris us sinc the septemb  book  go forward  howev  we expect that the transitori weather effect will fade by earli        we look for real export and import to expand at similar rate on balanc in      and        with import substanti greater than export  this  outcom impli a negat contribut from the extern sector of about  …   percentag point each year      and i will be happi to take your question
are ani comment look at the movement of the real trade deficit and rais the issu of j curv possibl
well  that   s alway present for a  e
i   ve seen almost none of it   that   s all
but for exampl  our j curv effect last for two or three quarter after the  exchang rate chang   peopl look for this in particular when the dollar is come down  and the     dollar declin end last decemb  rough   so i would say there is present veri littl j curv in the pipelin   there may be a littl bit from the dollar   s rise  but the dollar hasn   t risen so veri much
but this downturn is somewhat unusu
in nomin import  but it   s sort of go the wrong way   you might say it   s the effect of six month of slight dollar depreci  it could be   but odd  import price have  been higher than anybodi was expect   so piec just don   t fit for the j curv   and i think the effect of the dollar depreci that occur through the end of      has larg gone away
it is the import price data which realli undercut it
dave  i would like to ask a littl more about the  book baselin   first  tell me more by way of character the path of inflat expect   and second  character the forc and the relat weight that bring core inflat down in the second half for next year
certain   basic  embed in this forecast is some implicit deterior in inflat expect or under inflat momentum on the order of about    percentag point from the end of      into        we think we need some of that to explain the   pickup in actual core inflat that we   ve had  which has been a deterior of about a percentag point   some of that follow from the fact that higher headlin inflat probabl has fed back a bit   into inflat expect  so we think there has been some slight deterior there on net   with  energi price flatten out and then turn down  we have some veri low headlin inflat number come soon  that will start to appear around the turn of the year   so we think some of the pickup that has occur is like to unwind  first  as the indirect effect of the higher energi price   which we think will still be a small plus earli next year   start to wash out by later next     year   as headlin inflat come down  that will reduc somewhat under inflat momentum  and we have inflat expect move back down into        it   s a pretti small move   the deceler we   re project in      from    percent to   percent reflect most the  indirect effect of energi price and some slowdown in import price   but we would think that that inflat expect process  which we have built into this forecast and which is relat minor   would begin to unwind later in the forecast period
how much of the acceler that you describ in inflat expect occur from here out   you talk about a certain amount from       to now
a coupl of tenth   one of the reason for rais this issu is that it remain a matter of consider uncertainti on our part   and i think a good case could be made  that we haven   t realli seen much sign yet of ani under inflat be built into the labor cost side especi   that   s still just a part of our forecast   the pickup we   re project in compens cost is  in part  a feed through of higher headlin inflat   it   s also  in part  a feed through of better product find it way eventu into real wage   but we haven   t realli seen it yet   so  i think a case could be made that even the small amount that we have built in could be overdo it  and that   s one of the reason we want an altern simul in the  book in which we show you what would happen if we   re wrong about that  obvious  on the other side  it   s hard to know whether or not your action and your  statement perhap have been the key factor keep overal inflat expect relat well  contain   your action and communic about polici intent may have  in essenc   condit both the wage  and price set environ in which worker and firm current find themselv      on the other side of our forecast  if you were to stop tighten soon and communic that basic the inflat situat wasn   t a problem  there is some risk that observ would interpret that to mean you would be more like to acquiesc to higher inflat go forward   and that  could feed through to expect   so we also show a simul in which thing deterior more notic on our fund rate assumpt than we built into the baselin  as i said  i feel that we   ve balanc the risk   as i look ahead and ask myself if no chang in inflat expect go forward would be a balanc forecast   mean     is it just as like that they   ll be go down as go up over the next year       i didn   t think that scenario  in fact  had balanc risk   so we felt comfort build in a littl more upsid on the thought that that would probabl better balanc the risk given the inflat pressur that are current  confront firm and worker
i had a question for you about the forecast that activ is go to  slow in the second half of       and         you talk about the reason for the slowdown  which were tighter monetari polici  a slow in hous price appreci  and diminish fiscal s ulus   in  the monday morn brief  you threw in the stock market as well   wane impetus from household wealth in term of both the stock market and the hous compon   i thought the  book had an assumpt of   percent growth in the stock market per year   i wonder if you could talk about that
it    inde   in essenc  what is go on with the stock market is that we   ve had a net s ulus in the economi this year come from the run up in the stock market that occur last year  so there are lag effect of that earlier increas on spend   go forward it     goe from a net s ulus to more of a neutral effect becaus we   ve made basic a neutral assumpt about the stock market go forward  that contrast with the hous market  where we think we   re get a lot of net s ulus right now   but in our forecast of a slowdown to   percent  that move toward neutral  and then the   percent rise in hous price that we   re forecast for      actual would impos a littl bit of restraint on overal spend at that point
so when you look at those two factor  which is more import
this is probabl put far too fine a point on it  but they   re both about equal in the forecast in term of their overal effect   in term of the under thrust or the under restraint that is be put on growth go forward
i   d like to renew a plea that i   ve made a coupl of  e over the year   i think  everybodi in this room believ that a vigor competit intern sector is good for  growth and  therefor  i bristl when you talk about that in term of a drag on growth and a negat  contribut to gdp   you   re talk about an arithmet way of ad up the gdp account   but  what   s happen is that vigor growth in demand is be partial met from abroad  and that   s not necessarili bad for growth   so i bristl when i hear it put this way becaus some of this end up filter into our public discours   and even though we may understand that we   re talk about the arithmet statement of the gdp account  it seem mislead   so i want to mention that
i take your point
second  and this goe in part to the question presid   ask  we  have somewhat of a mix situat in term of the forecast   when i first came in       there was a staff forecast of the stock market   in fact  i rememb that at the  e the stock market was forecast     to go down  and mani aspect of the  book forecast were predic on a declin in the stock market   of cours  eventu the stock market did go down  but it didn   t go down in      or        now we have  i think  an appropri standard type of assumpt here   the stock market is forecast on a sort of equilibrium basi  and we   re not independ tri to have a stock market forecast   we do the same thing on oil price   but we don   t do that on some other import part of the forecast  such as exchang rate and the feder fund rate  to me  the most use baselin forecast would be to put togeth the  book on a consist set of assumpt on those kind of thing   then i   d valu the staff input as to where  they believ the feder fund rate  the exchang rate  and everyth els will like come out  differ from the expect in the market   but to me we have a somewhat muddl situat in term of the intern consist here   dave   and i have talk about this sever  e  over the year  but mayb there could be a survey of the committe on what we would find most use as the assumpt for thing like exchang rate  the stock market  oil price   all of those thing where there are market forecast avail   what would be the most use to the committe in term of the baselin assumpt for the  book
i   m sure   would be prepar to organ a survey and would respect the committe   s wish
i don   t know whether i   m the onli one who would find that use   but at ani rate  i offer that propos
let me make one point  if i may   we have wrestl with the notion of what constitut a neutral assumpt about the exchang rate  and it is not obvious becaus we know that the forward rate impli by interest rate differenti are veri  veri poor forecast   everybodi know that   so  take that as an assumpt and give it weight   and have it run through the      forecast     not seem attract to us   but the altern is an approach that is kind of    consist with the other piec of the forecast and neutral      it   s a tough call   we have clung to someth that is close to  but not exact  the random walk version of thing for a while now   we  certain don   t see our exchang rate forecast as have a determin effect such that we   re drive the forecast by make this assumpt   we tri not to do that
but i think you could set up whatev standard you believ would be most use and stick to it consist over  e and then explain how your view may differ from the  standard assumpt that you use   that   s more or less what you do with a number of thing   and i   emphas the stock market as a veri import exampl becaus of the influenc of wealth on consumpt
on the hous price front  obvious  there aren   t market signal   but  we   ve confront the veri same problem of tri to forecast an asset price that we don   t have  enorm confid in   so the approach that we have taken is that we present a few model at  the special brief last juli   some model that reli more on the momentum in under hous  price and other model that take serious some sort of error correct to a rent price ratio to bring that ratio back into equilibrium   and our forecast is a mix of those various approach  i guess i   d plead guilti in the sens that our hous price forecast  along with our rent forecast    impli by the end of the project horizon a littl of what we view as the current over valuat diminish   but most that forecast is fair neutral in that our assess of over valuat pretti much involv price hold at that higher level go forward   it get a littl wors in the near term and then get a littl better a bit further out   but it is an element of the forecast that obvious is import and about which there is consider uncertainti
i didn   t bristl  but my ear p  up when you mention mexico  this is not a major point  but well befor the hurrican we notic a disconnect between the  standard presum correl of  say     percent   mexican gdp to u s  industri product  someth has weaken in mexico   we   re analyz it   it could be the onset of the sexenni event  the presidenti elect   but  for exampl  our el paso folk report that with the delphi  announc some        mexican maquiladora worker have been affect   and your comment on mexican econom growth or your assumpt seem to be somewhat differ than  what we   re hear anecdot and what we   re find in our research in dalla   i just want to  point that out and offer our input   if we can be of assist there  we   d be glad to do so
okay   we appreci that   i recogn that the outcom in mexico dure the first half of this year certain rais question  becaus mexico has not enjoy the level of  product that would have been consist with previous relationship to u s  gdp   so whether or  not mexico will  in fact  strengthen is certain a risk in the forecast
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to talk a littl bit to the point bill made  especi if we   re go to do a survey of committe member   i like the way we   re get the forecast now   the staff has a view of forc of aggreg demand  potenti suppli  and inflat pressur  and they take that view and fold in some cours of feder reserv polici that will   produc an outcom that we see in the  book   and in some case  for some type of price  they think they can   t do ani better than the market so they just put in the market forecast   other  price  like bond yield  etc   are endogen  stock price are endogen to the process  if we ask the staff to put togeth a forecast that had their view of demand and suppli and  inflat pressur  togeth with market price   which may be built on a differ view of suppli     and demand and market price   i   m not sure what we   d get in the end   we   d get an outcom that could look veri strang from  e to  e when their view and the market   s view differ   and then   we would want to know what we would have to do in order to produc someth that look more   sensibl  right now  we have your fed fund forecast in there   if we went the other way  i would ask for anoth forecast that incorpor how the staff thought market price would evolv   there   s no perfect way of do this   but i   m a littl more comfort with the way it is done now than i would be in the other case
if i could respond veri quick  someth is go to look veri strang one  way or the other when the view are veri differ   and what can look strang now is a cours of long term interest rate that is not what   s in the market   so someth is go to look strang one  way or the other   the question is  what is the best way to convey the staff   s view about where the world is go   what is the clearest way and what is most use for the committe
yes   on this point  what presid pool is suggest is well pose   it   s a  forecast condit on replic sort of an arbitrag free set of observ financi asset price go forward   i don   t want it  though  becaus i want a mixtur of the inform that is convey by the market and the staff   s judgment   i want a combin of that   the approach you suggest is  a use exercis to ponder   but as long as the staff is clear about how their assumpt differ from those embodi in market price  i   d rather see a combin  person
have you learn anyth more in the last    hour on  the issu of the miss on produc    durabl equip
we haven   t learn ani more   we are not inclin to discount that figur   we saw noth in the detail to suggest that that would be appropri   it look to us like a translat miss between the bea   s more detail construct of the figur out of the order and  shipment figur and some deflat issu   i think at this point we probabl would be closer to     than to           s peopl think they would be inclin to be just a littl lower than the bea   s current es   and we would as well   we learn a bit about deflat on the residenti side that would suggest we   d probabl be a littl lower than the bea   but all of that is small potato   the basic stori is that it still look to us to have been stronger than we were expect and probabl suggest a littl more under strength than was implicit in our forecast for the second half of the year
all right   are there ani further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to start   presid

in our contact call for this round  energi price were a pervas concern  so far they   ve had a limit effect on consum spend  but our contact worri that high heat bill will take a bigger bite out of sale in the come month   in contrast  we   re see the impact  on cost right now   near everi contact report pressur from higher energi price   there are mani exampl  but here   s one that seem a bit more surpris than other   a larg specialti retail note that the wholesal cost of furnitur had increas due to higher price for polyfoam      which is a petroleum deriv   he said that in    year in the furnitur busi  this is the first  e that the stuf cost more than the fabric or the frame    laughter   labor market are also start to generat cost pressur   for exampl  both manpow and kelli report sign of tighter labor market   these contact say that mani firm  after have been veri cautious about hire  now feel they have push product growth as far as it can go and  accord  final feel they need to hire more perman employe  particular in offic job  our contact see this as a further sign that firm are more confid about demand   one of the  staf servic firm said that they are pay higher wage and also spend more on recruit  and retent bonus   and sever of our director report that they   re budget larger salari increas for       in the rang of one half to a full percentag point higher than this year  the consensus among our contact was that onli a portion of these higher cost has been pass through to price  at least so far   sever report that labor cost are most eat into  margin  which is what we   ve been expect   but more price increas may be come   a home  good retail note that they had set their current list price last spring   when they decid how to price their product for next year  they   ll take into account the fuel cost outlook at that  e  there has been no let up in the auto industri   s woe   our contact say that higher oil price  seem to have frozen consum  and showroom traffic is down   there have been some interest  develop with regard to labor cost in the auto industri   gm   s recent renegoti of it health  care liabil  if ratifi  would be the uaw   s  unit auto worker  first major mid contract give back in histori   ford and daimlerchrysl will be demand similar concess   inde  it might be that the delphi bankruptci has help the industri at least get the ball roll on some meaning restructur of labor contract   howev  these are veri contenti issu  and there   s     a clear possibl of a strike at delphi that could serious disrupt the auto industri  particular general motor  for the nation outlook  the last six week of data have confirm that the disloc from katrina and rita have had a limit impact on aggreg econom activ   outsid the area affect by the hurrican  labor market are improv at a pace similar to earlier in the year   and  i   m get favor impress of busi sen ent from my contact  which is a good sign for hire and capit spend   howev  there is a risk that the recent sluggish in consum expenditur and low level of confid may be foreshadow a period of somewhat softer  growth in consumpt   household have further run down save to maintain spend in the   face of higher energi price  and it   s veri difficult to gaug how this might influenc consumpt go forward  with regard to inflat  the read on core price in the last quarter were good   given all that i   ve heard in recent week  though  it seem like that past increas in energi and materi cost will soon begin to show through more clear in price downstream  as is forecast in the  book   furthermor  labor market have tighten   as i note  mani of my busi contact  are plan for larger increas in wage and benefit next year   they can onli absorb these higher  cost in margin for so long   final  there   s a chanc that increas in cost and price will result in a meaning rise in longer run inflat expect  which would be a risk to the longer run  book forecast  all of these risk add up to increas the fund rate by    basi point again today   look ahead  i think we should continu tighten   at least we are comfort in the middl of a neutral  rang  and there   s a possibl we   re go to have to go further   there   s a good deal of uncertainti about how to quantifi the equilibrium fund rate and the degre of polici accommod   the     bluebook suggest that a   percent nomin fund rate might be the midpoint of the rang  but i   m person skeptic that the rate is that low   this is go to be an import issu for us to consid go forward   i   m glad that we at least start the discuss earlier today  and i hope we   ll continu it later in the meet
mr  chairman  growth in the eleventh district  if anyth  has been acceler in recent month   pick up steam   we appear to be the beneficiari of the natur disast that have taken place on the gulf coast  and that continu  incident  through wilma    a small exampl is that the grapefruit grower have definit benefit from the destruct of grapefruit crop in florida  which was near total   if i were to paraphras yogi berra  who said the   futur isn   t what it use to be  i think i would be on the mark becaus we   re now much more confid  one of the most articul  smartest  and at the same  e conserv  banker in our district  dick   of cullen frost  say that build contact are report the busiest busi activ in     or    year in our state   at the veri front end  which is site work for land develop  one of  his client  an engin  report that in his entir busi career he   s never been busier   so we are proceed on all piston  and we   re begin to see it reflect particular in real estat price  the market has gone from a buyer   s market to a seller   s market almost overnight   in the gulf area  of padr island  for exampl  record price are now sudden appear overnight   so in summari  the banker and the busi communiti in the eleventh district  as i report at the last session  are still friski  mr  chairman   inde  their tail are wag at an acceler pace and i hope   to paraphras anoth    berra ism     which is that histori isn   t what it use to be        that histori  sn   t repeat itself here   but we certain have a much more enthusiast busi communiti  i want to turn now to a broader perspect  base on our call to headquart of compani  that oper throughout the nation as well as in our district   at the last fomc meet  mr   chairman  you mention gasolin price have a veri visibl impact as one of the few  commod that consum look at for price comparison   in talk to our retail  that is clear the case   in share with presid pool our contact with wal mart  i talk to the new ceo of u s  wal mart ye day  and he note that while octob same store sale were up     percent  the consumpt pattern had shift   becaus of gasolin price  peopl are make fewer trip to the store but they   re buy larger amount  and we have a lead indic ourselv in harvey rosenblum  who is the wine connoisseur  amongst our research leader in dalla   i   ve notic that he  sinc he live in a dri district of dalla    we still have prohibit in part of texa   is make less frequent trip to the wine store but is buy in greater volum   perhap that   s becaus of the question we   re ask him    laughter  wal mart    eleven  and dollar general all report that heavier item transport by truck    dog food and bottl water are just two exampl   are under tremend price pressur due to rise fuel cost   and these higher price are be pass on  although some  offset by consum substitut privat label item for brand name product   american airlin is pass   on their fuel cost   they manag to rais their averag fare   percent in the third quarter   onc again we hear them talk about     attach to confirm fee for standbi passeng    hovnanian and centex  two of the largest builder  report rise cost of local sourc materi deliv by truck  ad to price pressur of labor and materi for roof  side  and window   we   re see fuel price affect also the transport cost that are charg and pass      on by the express compani   up report   and i don   t think this is public inform   that they   re target rate increas  pre fuel charg  of   percent to be set in earli novemb  know that the u s  postal servic will be price in an increas of   percent plus at the begin of the new year  there are some potenti mitig factor here     eleven  exxon  wal mart   s sam   s club store  and other gas retail report that the margin they are retain on their gas sale   and    percent of   eleven   s revenu come from gasolin sale now   is still run    cent versus    to    cent normal   they expect to hold these margin as long as they can  or at least until volatil is dampen  but as gas price eas  this could possibl be a cushion that will provid some relief  for retail   and the correl is quit direct   at   eleven  for exampl  they can walk you through  week by week  the effect on sale of each downward movement in the price of gasolin   three week ago they had an increas in sale volum of   percent  two week ago    percent  and this last week    percent   so we may have a littl bit of relief come from the reduct of margin that might occur as the margin go from    to    to    cent  it   s still clear from our discuss with busi oper that price pressur are build  a rise percentag of compani are experienc price increas for what they sell as well as for  what they buy  along the line that presid   mention   we see it particular in  chemic  as he mention   caustic soda  former price at      a dri ton  is now      a dri ton  polyethylen  former price at    cent a pound  is now price at    cent a pound    i hope this is expung later  but exxon   s ceo told me that they will take everi measur they can to pass  through  and i quot     sizabl increas    on that front in everi place that they can   perhap the best indic of what   s happen in the chemic industri is pioneer core alkalin compani  which was file for bankruptci and is now    print money     accord to their ceo   wal mart expect       to pass along price increas for all resin base product  such as garden chair and outdoor tabl  in the spring   the rail appear to be plan  accord to bnsf   s ceo  a price increas of   to   percent befor fuel surcharg next year  and of interest in all of our discuss is that we   re hear what presid   is  hear  which is that there are pressur on the wage front   to be sure  they are mitig by delphi  northwest airlin  and also gm   but the number we   re hear from the rail  from the belo corpor  a larg broadcast  and other on labor price are negoti target of about   percent  with a heavi focus on health care run in the   to    percent rang   i think probabl the best summari  mr  chairman  came from the ceo of wal mart u s   he  said that    previous we were deflat and we can still offset a littl bit through china  although to a lesser degre than befor      he said    we will earli discount like all retail  move our discount   season  larg in term of announc  up to novemb     but at best we hope to   ˜hold the line    on price      that   s a direct quot   so i feel that the heighten inflationari pressur that we talk about last  e are lurk  against that background  i favor further tighten to contain inflationari impuls and expect   i have some comment on the statement  but we can speak about that later   the bottom line is that one can sens  even though we don   t see it in the data  inflat pressur  creep up like littl cat   s feet   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet i was op ist that we would avoid a brush with stagflat despit the higher energi price and the setback in product from katrina   develop dure the intermedi period have general reinforc my     op ist view   although consider uncertainti still cloud the outlook  i regard report on both real econom activ and inflat to be general encourag  on the real side  it now appear more like that the disrupt caus by the hurrican will  be transitori   oil and wholesal gasolin price  for exampl  have fallen below their august level  befor katrina   furthermor  rebuild has been gather steam quick  and spend outsid of the gulf region remain robust   in the  book  the effect of this encourag news about the under vigor of the economi has been held in check by the assumpt of tighter financi   condit  so the path for gdp is littl revis  with respect to the prospect for inflat  i remain more op ist than the baselin  book project     suggest in his remark that it was possibl to make a case for  inflat do better than the  book project  and i will pursu that case now   certain  the latest data have been favor   over the six month end in septemb  the core cpi increas onli     percent at an annual rate  while the core pce price index was up     percent   these data rais the question  where is the energi price pass through   pce energi price have been rise at doubl digit rate for more than a year  but they have left remark littl imprint on core inflat   at our last meet  i describ some econometr evid show that sinc the earli      s  chang in real oil price have not had an appreci effect on core inflat   today i thought i would cite some report from our busi contact that appear to be general in line with this result   they do note that there has been some success in pass energi cost increas down the suppli chain but  given competit pressur and the lack of price power  they tell us that the buck usual stop befor the consum   i thought i would give you an exampl inspir by the season   a larg pumpkin grower  processor  laughter  near portland has seen a    percent jump in the price of plastic packag     materi   she report that she can pass these cost on to the small retail she serv  but they are not abl to charg consum more for retail pumpkin product   so this thanksgiv you need not worri about pay more for your pumpkin pie   obvious  forecast beyond that is hazard   but look out toward christma  i thought i would note that one of the countri   s largest grower of poinsettia is on our advisori council  and he is high confid that there will be littl pass through of energi cost into retail poinsettia price    laughter   also in contrast to the  book  i see no signific pressur for higher inflat come from increas inflat expect   in particular  despit the surg in energi cost this year  current es  of inflat compens  both over the next five year and the subsequ five year period  remain at the same averag level that prevail dure the first half of this year   a  further sign that inflat expect remain well contain can be found in the continu subdu growth of wage and salari   last friday   s read on the eci  employ cost index  i thought  reveal no evid of ani pass through of higher headlin inflat or higher inflat expect to labor compens   so i see no indic of the      s style wage price spiral in the of  overal  i judg our credibl to be veri much intact   of cours  our credibl go forward   depend on continu vigil   the economi now appear to be close to full  employ  with a good deal of momentum   and annual core inflat  at least as judg by the  core pce measur  remain near the upper end of my comfort zone and  arguabl  inflat risk are tilt somewhat to the upsid   so with respect to polici  i support at a minimum the remov of ani  remain polici accommod   the bluebook show that the fund rate has final enter a  broad zone of plausibl neutral rate  but under the circumst  i person would be more     comfort with a polici posit toward the center of this zone   so a few more increas  includ one today  seem to me like to be requir  in implement monetari polici  it seem to me that action matter  but so do word  and i want to briefli open up the question of the statement   i think for today the word of altern b should suffic  but   has repeat suggest  and a number of you have emphas  that we need to consid how to modifi the statement languag   sever element of this statement have  expir date that are quick approach   so i think it   s an import issu for us to discuss  as we go forward  i see three problem with use the kind of languag that is in altern b   first  it refer to polici accommod  which will arguabl soon be exhaust   second  it refer to a    measur pace     when at some point presum we will reach a stop point in this tighten cycl   and  third  it now contain a near tautolog balanc of risk statement that i  think serv no obvious polici purpos   of cours  these three problem could be fix at differ meet   for exampl  if the inflat pictur sour  the    measur pace    languag could continu to be use well past the elimin of the polici accommod phrase   as governor   fear  the balanc of risk statement could outliv us all    laughter   still  tri to fix all of these three problem at onc has some appeal  and i thought that altern c did just that   it elimin the balanc of risk statement and the polici accommod languag  and it substitut a new forward look polici statement for the    measur pace    phrase   my main critic of altern c is that it jettison ani mention of the condit of our action on futur data  and i believ such condit is alway worth highlight and particular deserv of emphasi now  toward the end of our tighten cycl  i believ that a good model for futur statement would have three section  a polici decis  a descript rational  and a bit of forward look polici guidanc   the polici guidanc should     be nuanc   tailor to prevail circumst and explicit condit   and it should not includ a formula balanc of risk statement   let me give a concret exampl base on altern c   if the committe believ  for exampl  that further tighten remain necessari onc polici is   no longer accommod  it could state  follow the rational section  that    under these condit the committe perceiv that further polici firm is like to be necessari     or    will be necessari     or    might be necessari         nonetheless  the committe will respond to ani chang in econom prospect to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil and fo  sustain growth     onc the committe feel that further tighten is not necessari  it could state that    under these condit the committe perceiv that the current stanc of monetari polici will like remain appropri go forward   nonetheless  the committe will respond to ani chang in econom prospect  and so forth  to fulfil it oblig      in ani case  i hope that this propos might be use in jump start our discuss of these issu
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data confirm that econom activ was grow at a solid pace pre katrina  and we appear to have remain on track sinc then  at least on an ex hurrican basi   the direct effect of the storm appear to be limit to the disrupt of  product capac along the gulf coast   outsid of the affect region  real activ continu to   expand  as suggest by the septemb industri product report and the third quarter gdp figur  in our district  there are few sign that this year   s hurrican have direct affect real  econom activ   in fact  we   ve seen a broad pickup in activ sinc august   our octob manufactur survey indic that shipment  order  and employ grew at or abov the  previous month   s pace   servic firm also report strengthen revenu growth in both      septemb and octob  and retail sale increas moder in both month  as broad sale  increas outweigh a drop in auto and light truck sale  concern about the macroeconom effect of these hurrican obvious center on the signific bulg in energi price   the continu growth in nomin consum spend ex auto sinc katrina is evid that the effect of energi price increas have not yet dampen household demand  and there seem to be littl indic of a hurrican induc downshift in invest demand either   so the evid is consist with my hypothesi that the hurrican are essenti a suppli disrupt with littl independ effect on demand  and thus  the real interest rate path should be  if anyth  higher than it otherwis would be  a second concern regard the macroeconom effect of the hurrican is the potenti for energi price to pass through to core inflat   here the recent news on core price has been  encourag   core pce inflat came in at     percent for the third quarter and has averag     percent sinc march  right where i think we would like it to be   one would expect most of the pass through to take a coupl of month to materi  howev  and in that regard there are sever  unsettl sign worth note   within the fifth district  for exampl  our survey show a surg in price paid for both manufactur and servic over the last two month   moreov  the averag report rate of increas in price receiv in both survey has acceler signific in  septemb and octob   consist with these quantit signal  a larger number of our contact now say they   re  abl to pass through part or all of their increas cost to their custom   in addit  the averag rate of price increas our respond see for six month ahead has also surg  and our index for expect wage increas in manufactur has skyrocket to over    for octob   this diffus index has a midpoint of zero  and it had been averag below    recent   so a read of    is     consist with the anticip of a fair broad base upsw in inflat  although obvious it could just be a fals alarm   anoth unsettl sign is the recent behavior of tip inflat compens measur  these have drift up a coupl of tenth sinc june and are now bounc around in the  neighborhood of       so i think we were right to downgrad inflat expect from    well contain    to mere    contain    in our last statement  and i think we should view a further eros of inflat expect as unwelcom  the extent to which energi price increas pass through to core inflat is fundament determin by the public   s expect regard futur monetari polici   my sens is that we have  just a brief window to head off such pass through should it threaten   the  book   forese signific pass through  with the core pce inflat rise to     percent in the first half of next  year and then gradual fall back down to under   percent   inflat expect appear to trace out a similar hump shape path   in the face of this outcom  the  book has us rais the fund  rate to    percent in decemb and then stop there for a year  at least   point short of where   market expect us to go  i would question the plausibl of this joint outcom   first  i do not think we would or should stand by while inflat prospect erod as notic as they do in the  book   nor do i  think we could count on inflat expect to gentl drift back down after surg as the  book expect   at least not without forc action on our part  for today  i   m comfort with the altern b statement   but should more definit sign of pass through emerg in come month  we should be prepar to communic forc and convinc our intent not to accommod a deterior in core inflat of the magnitud  portray in the  book
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in new england have bounc around a littl bit over the last year or so   right now they show a few sign of flatten out   survey of both consum and busi confid show some current strength  but opinion about activ six month from now either remain at a low level in the case of consum or  for  busi  turn negat for the first  e in the last five year  worri about fuel and benefit cost  interest rate increas  and the war in iraq are most   often mention by contact as shape a less than rosi outlook   and when you talk to them about  big profit margin  they look at you with a puzzl express  wonder what busi you are  talk about becaus that   s certain not the case for their busi   i think there   s some differ  of opinion when look at your own number versus the number in the aggreg   anyway  for the present  most firm do report profit  with those serv the defens industri make notabl headway   consum are spend  if not on car then on hous  though at least  accord to one survey they perceiv rise pressur on their person financ   and core inflat in the boston area is surpris low relat to the nation   it   s usual higher   thus  there   s a sens in which the region may be experienc a period of calm befor a possibl storm of negat trend  employ in the region drop in septemb  and the unemploy rate rose   the employ declin was widespread by state and involv  in part  the usual suspect of trade and manufactur  but about half reflect govern worker in main   septemb govern  employ can move around a lot  depend on the hire of teacher for kindergarten through   th grade   so it   s probabl wise to take this drop in job with a grain of salt   mani of our contact      report that skill labor is hard to find and expens   there are continu refer to caution in hire and a desir not to add a singl new employe until it   s necessari to do so  both busi and consum are concern about the impact of high heat oil  natur gas  and gasolin price   local heat oil compani that have provid lock in rate for the winter in the past will not do so now  like feed into concern   despit mani fervent prayer for the opposit  the winter is expect to be a bad one   and that forecast was underlin by the earli snowfal in northern new england a coupl week ago and by the flurri in massachusett over the weekend   certain this is good in term of prospect for ski revenu  but not so good for  general op   given concern about energi  final  let me say a word about residenti real estat market   the boston area is often mention as have bubbl like characterist   this is an obvious concern  given the problem the  region experienc with fall price and relat bank failur in the earli      s   howev  there   s good reason to assum that recent rise price in new england reflect a lack of suppli and an older  wealthier popul capabl of support both a primari and a secondari resid  rather than a fundament unstabl situat   and some of the froth is fade   home price continu to escal but are current increas at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole  rather than lead it   four out of the eight other region of the countri are now experienc more  rapid escal  contact in the real estat industri report two trend   first  there was a rather abrupt soften in the high end suburban market this summer  with escal suppli and the advent of a buyer   s market   someth not seen in sever year   the other trend is an increas in the suppli of multifamili unit  particular condominium  and a mark upturn in condo inventori   thus  most  contact think real estat market appear to be return to a more reason place gradual  with      much of the chang at the high end   this could feed into some concern about spend in the futur and could certain make peopl feel less wealthi   but given where it seem to be center  it  sn   t appear like to do a lot of near term damag  turn to the nation scene  incom data appear to confirm the under strength of the  u s  economi   separ out the impact of sever hurrican is not easi   read on unemploy and busi spend net of hurrican effect seem consist with the continu of solid growth through the remaind of        the strength of consum outlay remain a question  given the now   month downturn in confid and the fact that the outsiz motor  vehicl purchas that had support such outlay in the third quarter are fall off their high  howev  labor market data seem consist with continu strength in hire   one would suppos  that  at least in the near term  work consum will be spend consum  especi if confid improv in the face of wane energi price   or at least price for gasolin   final  i take the continu strength in hous as a sign that  under it all  consum still have the confid to make rather long term invest  our forecast in boston for the next year and into       differ littl from the  book   s  assum energi price subsid  or at a minimum that we don   t have ani new shock  growth  should pick up in the spring  as the impact of the energi tax on consum eas and as rebuild in  hurrican ravag area acceler   over the same   month or so period through the winter into  spring  low inventori level are like to be replenish  feed factori activ   growth outsid  the unit state is  on balanc  expect to be posit as well   employ growth should return to it pre katrina month pace  and the remain slack in the u s  economi should wane   the post katrina    throw money at it    attitud in washington seem to have moder  but a fiscal  s ulus of some size appear like   our best guess on inflat mirror the  book   s as well      the worrisom headlin number on both the cpi and the pce moder  the feed through to core inflat tick up but then moder through the year  and this process pull in on the upward  trajectori of near term inflat expect  there are obvious risk here   energi base headlin inflat could feed more strong into the core  and inflat expect could remain elev   we could see the moder trend in wage and salari growth  as measur by the eci  begin to take off   howev  i   m hope  along the same line that presid   is  that inflat expect will moder  as gasolin price have  and that we won   t see even as big a feed through to the eci data as the  book project  howev  if a big rise in wage were to occur  it would set red light flash on everybodi   s  econom dashboard  if we are lucki  our rather benign forecast for the next year will work out   if we   re not  we could be look at both rise inflat and fall growth  as one of the altern scenario highlight   in that regard  we need to pay care attent to incom data on expect   compens  and core inflat   if they   re blink yellow or    we may be on track   if red predomin  the risk have clear escal  it certain seem clear that manag such risk in the near term involv place a premium  on remain credibl regard inflat   do so should moder price growth by tighten financi condit and should result in better price of risk   it should also convinc consum that inflat will not continu to exacerb the grow strain on their pocketbook   it should moder inflat expect and limit the feed through into wage and salari growth  but we also need to take care not to overdo   there are downsid risk   with a small amount of addit tighten in the mix  the  book see growth at below potenti in late        a widen output gap in        and a tick up in unemploy   one key caus of this is a general     slow in real estat market and a declin in relat household wealth   the relat expect rise in person save may be just what the doctor order to start the process of rein in the excess  in the u s  economi  but i think we do need to take care about dispens excess amount of  inflat medicin  in my view  we   re not at a tip point as yet   our process of measur step toward   remov the remain accommod should continu for a  e  take us closer to the middl of the rang of equilibrium rate   but we should also begin to consid when we might have move enough and how we might prepar market for that   in that regard  i was interest in the propos  that presid   had for an evolut in our statement   i think it   s go to take some  e to absorb what she has recommend   mayb this meet is not the meet to make a chang   i   m probabl comfort with altern b   a coupl of meet ago  the chairman suggest that i  take on the task   becaus i was open my mouth at the  e   of put some propos on the tabl  and i   ve been drag my heel   i   m more than happi to work with presid   on the direct she   s tri to take the statement   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   let me first share some thought on recent econom develop in our southeast region   as you would expect  we   ve continu to assess the region and nation implic of hurrican katrina  and now hurrican rita and wilma  which have ad to our woe  the recent employ statist serv as a real  e baromet of the hit our region has  taken   across the state involv  through septemb our district has lost approxim         job from the storm   iron  busi in the affect area tri to restart their oper  are  in mani case  desper to hire worker   on a trip from the new orlean airport into     downtown new orlean  one see help want sign on everi corner   the inabl to get evacue from the area back into local hous has clear slow the process of busi recoveri   in fact  if  one thing relat to the storm now stand out  it   s the linger uncertainti on sever front and what now look to us to be a longer rebuild and recoveri period  indic are that it could well be sever more month befor oil and gas product and process return to near normal   the latest report from our contact indic that almost   percent of u s  daili oil product and     percent of u s  natur gas product remain shut in   the  assess of damag and the repair to pipelin and product facil in the gulf continu to be hamper by equip and labor shortag   louisiana refineri are slowli come back on line   but by current es  up to   percent of total u s  refin capac will remain off line until at least earli next year   and u s  refineri are report now oper at onli about    percent of capac   the situat with respect to natur gas is even less clear than for refin product  and there remain widespread concern that potenti shortag over the winter could keep natur gas price elev for a while  at the  e of our last meet  i express concern about the impact of the storm on ship and port facil   it now appear that activ is slowli return to the port of new orlean  constrain by labor avail and access to land transport   by and larg  ship that were inbound to new orlean were divert to other port  so there wasn   t as much disrupt to the  nation   s import as there was to those export that depend upon the mississippi river and louisiana port  at the last meet i also indic that while we expect a signific region hit to output  that would quick be replac by spend on cleanup and rebuild   this is general happen  but the larg scale reconstruct is now not expect to get under way until the first quarter of next      year when insur assess have been complet and comprehens plan are put in place  commerci contractor note that there was a strong backlog of work prior to the hurrican  and this  coupl with labor shortag  will constrain the pace of rebuild at least for a while   at the nation level  i agre with the  book   s assess that despit our heartach along the gulf coast  the nation economi seem to have remain relat strong   and this was reinforc by last friday   s initi read of third quarter real gdp  i view the economi as continu on a path of about trend   howev  i continu to wonder  how the consum will respond to higher energi price   so far  the impact hasn   t been great  but there may be some import substitut effect when the consum is face with substanti higher heat cost dure the winter on top of still elev gasolin price   spend may not declin  but more household fund may be alloc to energi and less to other good and servic   and this could caus second round effect in term of cutback in product and invest   in  addit  we do know that auto sale drop earli in the fourth quarter  due in part to energi concern but also due to a retreat from employe price  i   ve gotten some recent and interest anecdot inform that is consist with my  concern about consumpt and consum substitut effect   last week i chat with a major  wholesal supplier of groceri who has seen a signific recent pickup in busi   he note that core wholesal groceri sale are notori steadi and bore  and he attribut the measur  pickup in recent week to the fact that more peopl were like eat in and  henc  were buy more groceri   similar  an atlanta director who is presid of a major build materi and consum product firm note that his away from home product sale   stapl like paper towel and toilet tissu sold to restaur   were slow and that retail home product sale were up   he interpret that as consist with the stay at home sen ent express by the groceri wholesal      this same director  howev  also comment on how serious the price pressur were due to energi and freight cost   his compani experienc a substanti earn declin in the third quarter  as he wasn   t abl to pass on all of his cost increas to his custom   taken togeth  recent data and these kind of anecdot suggest to me that downsid risk to consum spend still remain elev  this bring me to the inflat risk  which is my major concern   as alreadi note by a  number of peopl  we experienc a signific increas in both headlin cpi and ppi inflat last  month  which was expect   this was larg due to energi and  in my view  is like to be   temporari   at the same  e  the core measur remain relat stabl  but the anecdot about  grow price pressur and actual or intend price increas seem to be at odd with this   continu  go forward   i note  too  like other  that the  book has built in more of a pass through of energi and other price increas into core inflat next year  there are some possibl explan that we   ve all given at one  e or anoth for this  seem disconnect  includ the fact that the economi is relat more energi effici and that  we are evolv into a more servic orient economi so that energi is a much less direct compon of consumpt   and perhap most import  there   s the fact that intens competit is limit the abil to pass input price increas through to custom   for instanc  the difficulti i note earlier that the consum product firm was have in pass on energi cost   a larg  athlet apparel manufactur in our district  the russel corpor  attribut a larg share of their third quarter earn declin to higher cost for poli cotton blend that could not be pass  on  veri specif becaus of intens foreign competit  but these question about price power are not  in my view  reason to be complac about  the inflat outlook   the real fund rate is still low  there is substanti monetari accommod     in the system  and signific fiscal spend associ with hurrican relat rebuild has yet to come on stream  my concern is that deviat from our path of gradual remov polici accommod at  this  e could signal that we are less concern about inflat and  therefor  caus some  deterior in inflat expect   it is this threat that i think we need to guard against    i view  the cost of ratchet down inflat expect  should they get out of hand  as be great   so i   d argu that we need to continu on our current path  at least for a while longer  includ rais our fed fund target rate by    basi point today  as sever of us have said today and in previous recent meet  decid what to say follow today   s meet may be more difficult than decid what to do   realiz that our discuss of the statement often get truncat  i also want to put down a brief marker   given my    concern about keep inflat expect in check  i would prefer a statement that is somewher between bluebook altern b and c   i   m concern that    c    is too strong  but i am particular   uncomfort with the balanc of risk character in option b   presid   has just offer some attract statement languag for us to consid  and i think it   s terribl import that  we make  e at this meet or at some other meet in the near futur to begin to talk about that  serious   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the third district   s economi continu to expand  with growth moder toward it potenti pace   after acceler in the second quarter  employ growth in the region deceler in the third quarter back toward it first quarter pace   but unemploy rate remain steadi for the three state region and remain lower than the nation averag       consum spend for general merchandis has held steadi   there is some anecdot evid that consum are limit discretionari spend due to higher energi cost   and there is some concern among retail that fourth quarter sale may come in below plan becaus of subdu consum sen ent and higher winter heat bill  construct continu to be a strong sector for our region economi   hous construct  and sale remain strong in the district  and nonresidenti construct has been on an improv trend sinc the begin of the year   with the usual month to month volatil  region manufactur activ acceler in octob   the index of general activ in our  manufactur survey rebound sharpli from     in septemb to      in octob   the other  forward look indic in the survey  includ those for new order and shipment  also show a nice bounc  as did the index of futur activ   perhap the improv in expect should have been expect  sinc our septemb survey was taken in the earli day after the katrina event  inde  in respons to special question  half of our firm report that they had experienc some  chang in demand or problem relat to the gulf coast hurrican   the chang in demand  some  posit and some negat  were general slight   problem relat to obtain energi and other  materi  as well as transport problem  were character as be somewhat more signific   despit these problem  our firm did experi an increas in activ last month  again  the most troubl aspect of our latest survey is the signific increas in price indic  the price paid index rose sharpli in octob for the second consecut month and is at it highest level sinc        the price receiv index also jump last month  suggest that some of the  higher price input are be pass on to consum   the core pce and core cpi share a  correl with our price receiv index of about       while most of this correl is driven by      the high inflat period of the late     s and earli     s  i think these earli indic of possibl pass through bear watch  in my view  the nation economi seem to be evolv along the line we had expect at our last meet   the economi appear to have weather the hurrican in reason good shape  and  abstract from those hurrican effect  the economi has retain a good bit of posit momentum   of cours  uncertainti remain about the magnitud of the hurrican effect  so there   s a wider band of uncertainti around the econom outlook than there was pre hurrican   on the negat side  higher winter heat bill could result in signific slower consum demand   but  on the posit side  next year   s rebuild activ could result in a bigger boost to activ than expect   the growth risk seem to be balanc  and these hurrican effect are most like to be temporari  the bigger risk  in my view  is on the inflat side   core inflat remain contain at this point  and empir studi suggest energi price pass through to the core has typic been small   where we   ve gotten into troubl dure the earlier energi price shock is when we   ve let inflat expect get away from us   inde  the onli departur between headlin inflat and core cpi inflat as larg as the current one occur dure past energi price shock   in those case   accommod monetari polici result in rapid increas in core inflat  we cannot allow inflat expect to becom unanchor  and i don   t believ we will  as the energi infrastructur is rebuilt and energi market stabil  much of the run up in headlin inflat should revers itself  as mani peopl have suggest   this will help keep inflat and inflat expect contain   we   ve alreadi seen a declin in crude oil and gasolin price   the  latter is particular welcom  as it could buoy consum sen ent as we head toward the buy season      nonetheless  in my view  inflat pressur remain elev   so the prudent cours of action today is to continu to gradual move rate up nearer to the rang of the equilibrium real rate   as we near that rang  our languag is go to have to evolv  as a number of us have indic   i don   t think today is the day for a major chang in languag  but i would welcom the discuss that  mani have suggest we need to have   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  thank you   my view on the nation outlook remain pretti much unchang from the last meet   i think growth will be somewhat slower in the second half of this year and then stronger next year due to the reconstruct activ   the rise in energi price  will have a dampen effect on growth to some degre   nonetheless  the resili that the u s  economi has so far experienc follow the hurrican suggest that real gdp will grow at abov trend  at least over the near term forecast period   sever other factor are consist with that  financi condit remain support  fiscal polici is s ul  and as i   ve note and mani have alreadi mention here today  there is a momentum in the economi  evid from the tenth district is consist with this outlook   district manufactur activ continu to expand at a solid pace  and capit spend plan at district factori have  rebound  after dip slight follow the hurrican   as a further sign of solid busi confid  hire announc for district busi have exceed layoff announc by a wide margin sinc the last meet  on the negat side  though  higher energi price have erod consum confid in our  region as well as nation  lead to somewhat slower consum spend   for exampl  retail  contact in the first half of octob report sale were general unchang from a year ago  a mark chang from the summer when mani store were report solid year over year growth in     sale   home in some part of our district have been take a littl longer to sell  caus some builder to lower their price or at least increas the incent around the sale effort  turn to inflat  let me talk a littl bit about evid from our district  becaus we are see further inflationari pressur   wage pressur  while still modest  are begin to show through   manufactur are report sharpli higher cost for natur gas and petroleum base raw materi   some of our manufactur are also report increas cost of build materi  such  as steel and lumber  as a result of the reconstruct effort elsewher   but ad to this  district  manufactur are find it somewhat easier  as other have note  to pass their higher cost on to  custom   for exampl  in the special question we ask this month     percent of the firm said that their price power had increas over the last three month  but onli    percent said their  price power had decreas   retail have also been show somewhat greater determin to   rais price to cover their higher cost  although the retail price increas have been most modest so far  with this said  i want to tell dave that i think today   s report on the  book and the  discuss have been veri  veri help   it   s begin to redirect the discuss from one of a clear posit of remov accommod to a discuss of the correct rang for the fed fund rate and where it should fall if we are to maintain stabl price and sustain growth  obvious  i share with other here the view that inflat is current the main concern   energi is an obvious pressur  there is strong momentum in much of the economi  and there are  some sign of chang inflationari expect   i think this is someth we have to be alert to  but sinc our polici action today have their final effect month in the futur  i think it   s also import that we begin to address inflat and whether the rise is transitori becaus of the energi effect  or whether we are  in fact  see some inflationari pressur that will becom embed      go forward   if it is transitori  then the question is  i think legi   where should we stop  what is the right rang   is it near where we are now or should it go higher  for now  my own view are that we should be move the fund rate somewhat higher  as  other have suggest  and that this perhap would be a reason place to stop   what exact is  the appropri area  i think  should be a continu focus of this committe   s discuss in the  meet ahead   i would also share the sen ent that we need to care rethink the fomc statement come out of these meet   i think it is becom bad out of date and  as a result  may lose credibl   so now is the  e to start a serious discuss about chang it   i welcom     s comment and other here today   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the worst posit for a central banker to be in is depict in the  book   s stagflat scenario   i don   t think we   re head there  but just know that it has a nontrivi probabl is somewhat disturb   and inde  i   ve start to get question from busi peopl in the fourth district on whether i   m concern about stagflat  with that possibl in mind  i   d like to speak first about the real economi and then make a few comment about inflat   dure this intermeet period  i   ve had a number of convers  with director  obvious  but we   ve also held sever econom forum and busi advisori council meet   from these convers  i   ve conclud that the busi condit in the fourth district are mix   first  i   ll comment on the posit news   steel produc report that sale in most product  line are do veri well   commerci construct activ in the district pick up recent  albeit from a relat low level   truck and ship firm continu to report that busi is brisk  and that they   re have a difficult  e find qualifi driver   mani firm report that they are     plan to step up their capit spend next year  and invest   in foreign oper especi   continu unab  now for the not so posit news   the problem in the automobil industri appear to be  deepen  as signifi by the delphi bankruptci file   ford  gm  and a host of their supplier are concentr in my district  and their restructur activ are almost certain go to be a drag on region growth for a while   in fact  there appear to be a lot of merger  acquisit  and restructur take place in the manufactur sector  as was point out by presid    certain  the compani that reli heavili on natur gas and petrochem feedstock are face sever margin pressur   one of my director from a larg multin chemic compani report that the u s  coat industri is becom global uncompetit due to the price and avail of natur gas in the unit state  moreov  as other have mention  mani busi leader are quit anxious about the  impact of home heat bill in the come month on consum spend   some retail are be especi cautious about their inventori  and compani further down the suppli chain tell me  that they can quick pull back capit spend project if the need aris   although the comment that i   ve been hear about the real economi vari a lot by industri  i  hear a much more consist commentari when it come to the price environ   everyon i   ve spoken with is worri about the effect of higher energi price and price psycholog more general   it   s a fact that energi and other input cost have been rise   some of these cost are  now be pass through success  and i   m concern that the climat has becom more  recept to pass through than at ani  e in recent memori  one of my director report that she has been tri unsuccess to rais price to a particular custom for the past sever year   two week ago that custom call her to say that      he knew she was go to have to rais price in this environ and he was just hope to get a head up on how much those price increas would be and when they would come   what that  custom had previous regard as unaccept was now acknowledg as inevit   an execut of a softwar compani that special in solut to steel compani told me that he is  increas his price becaus his custom are final make plenti of money  so they   re now  will to accept his price increas   to paraphras him and other     now that the train is leav the station  you   d better get on with as much luggag as you can carri       laughter  shortag of some raw materi are also like to add price pressur in come month  sever peopl report that their supplier are invok forc majeur claus in contract   their supplier are face shortag of some raw materi  prevent them from meet their contract oblig   these peopl tell me that they   ve not encount such circumst in    year of do busi  and they are concern about where price are head  i   ve not been as alarm about inflationari pressur as my busi contact becaus core measur have been veri favor   and i expect the headlin number to improv next year   but i   can   t refrain from note someth about the polici environ that   s impli by the  book baselin project   an awkward featur of that project is the trajectori of the headlin and core  inflat measur in        after tell the public that they should ignor headlin number and pay attent instead to core inflat statist  this committe would be hold the fed fund rate steadi dure a year in which labor cost and core price measur are expect to acceler from their current pace   this might inde be the correct polici  but it might appear to the public that we are toler a rise in core inflat   such a situat could pose some addit communic challeng for us next year   so  like other  i know it   s  e for us to start focus on how we     communic these issu   but for today  i believ the appropri action for us is to continu to remov our polici accommod   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   chang in district econom condit have been small recent and seem larg offset each other   so the economi overal continu on a posit path  hous activ  especi the pace of sale  has been slow recent  although to some extent that is season   but i think it   s fair to say that overal some of the vigor in hous is in the process of diminish   in contrast  commerci real estat develop has been pick up modest and in a number of locat throughout the district  and develop seem more op ist  than they have for some  e   manufactur activ is continu to advanc   the mine and  energi industri are oper at high level of capac  as you would expect   and employ is   increas  except at northwest airlin  i don   t think the under fundament of inflat have chang recent  but there are a  few more report in the district of the abil to pass through cost increas   more report than i had been hear former   also  at a meet of our advisori council on small busi and labor  there were more report of product on alloc than i had expect to hear   while there are readi substitut for some of these product  for other  like concret  that   s not quit the case  and that will be  without question  constrain activ relat to what otherwis would have occur  as far as the nation economi is concern  i don   t have ani materi disagr with the  book assess of the outlook although  if left to my own devic  i might write down a littl more real growth in the next sever quarter   my sens is that the economi has a good deal of      posit momentum to it  as other have observ  and spend associ with recoveri from hurrican katrina will add to that   i am also encourag on balanc by the modest report on core measur of inflat for the last coupl of quarter   so  overal  both the current state of the  economi and it prospect look favor to me   core inflat may tick up a bit  as depict in the   book  but i would expect that to be temporari   and as far as the risk of stagflat are concern  while i certain wouldn   t dismiss that as a possibl   and i would acknowledg that the episod in the mid  and late     s initi  as i recal  snuck up on policymak   it   s hard for me to develop a stagflat scenario without serious monetari polici error   and that   s in our power to avoid  against that background  i would favor anoth   percentag point increas in the fund rate at this meet   i would also endors the comment of presid   about the need to review  and make some signific chang to the statement accompani our decis   and i think there  may be some urgenc to that   one way of view that  at least as i   ve been think about it  is  that if we continu on the path we   re on  we   ll be look at a nomin feder fund rate of     percent befor long and a real rate north of   percent   at that point  are we still go to be will to talk about remov polici accommod   will we be will to do it at      today we   ll be at   percent  so i don   t think the  e is far off when we   re go to have to confront these issu
thank you  mr  chairman   let me say at the outset   to tri to put some organ structur into my anecdot report   that the report on activ are almost uniform on the strong side   and i think the report on inflat are almost uniform on the upsid rather than the downsid   there is somewhat of an asymmetri to the report i hear       let me talk about wal mart first   befor the hurrican  let   s say in earli august  wal mart was anticip growth in same store sale of about   percent year over year   so they would have expect octob to come in about   percent abov octob of last year   onc they saw the hurrican and had other inform  includ the big spike in energi price   of cours  they believ that energi price have a major impact on the incom avail to the peopl who shop at   wal mart   they were expect octob to come in at about   percent   in fact  octob same store sale rose by about   percent  exclud gasolin   so sale were much stronger than they would  have anticip  given the inform that they had   moreov  they saw a pickup in demand for higher price point item   in various discretionari categori  such as televis  for exampl  more  of the higher price good were be sold  i have a contact with a larg west coast softwar compani  and that compani is disappoint  in the larg enterpris segment of it busi but is see surpris strength in the consum  sector  includ a shift in the consum sector toward more expens equip   the exampl  cite was that in the back to school market for the high school and colleg segment  there were more purchas of laptop  which are more expens than desktop comput  my contact in the packag deliveri industri are anticip a veri strong holiday season  inde  they are expect demand in the peak week prior to christma to outrun capac   the expect that they will not have enough capac in place is due in part to the rapid growth in  internet sale and the home deliveri associ with that   also  they point to a particular larg unexplain increas in busi in the chicago area recent  both inbound and outbound   they  have no idea whi   i said i would consult with my colleagu on the fomc to see if he has ani insight   so mayb dure the coffe break he can tell me what   s go on in chicago   i don   t think the world seri was enough to creat this outcom    laughter
don   t underes  it    laughter
anoth exampl that i thought was quit interest was that up is actual shift it over the road shipment away from the piggyback rail system to long distanc truck in  order to gain shorter transit  e   my contact said that the railroad are simpli unwil to put the invest into their track and equip and oper system to match the deliveri  e  obvious  it   s much less fuel effici to ship by truck  but the pressur on deliveri  e was lead up to switch it oper in that direct  on the price front  my wal mart contact said that general merchandis price are still fall a littl bit   food price have been up about     percent over the last year   howev  wal mart note that it supplier   i think this would be primarili domest supplier   have indic that they expect to take some price increas after januari    although not enough to complet cover their  cost increas   wal mart is not see price increas on good that are sourc abroad  particular   from china of cours   wal mart has continu to absorb increas in transport cost and util cost   that   s the stori for retail general   it   s obvious that they   re not go to absorb those cost forev  but they have been do so temporarili   my wal mart contact also note that their construct cost for new store and other facil are rise in a rang of    to    percent  and in a recent luncheon in st  loui with local real estat peopl  hous builder  and other  in the busi  mani said that they also see substanti upward pressur on construct cost   it   s  not just the cost of land   or ground  as the homebuild put it   but materi and labor cost are under substanti upward pressur  one other thing that i thought was interest came from my contact at up  where they   ve just complet   i think the negoti are complet   negoti with their pilot   appar  the pilot had no increas at all in      and       but up is go to pay retroact increas in a       lump sum   and i suspect that these lump sum payment will escap inclus in the eci measur  given the way the eci is put togeth   i see dave   shake his head   the other thing that was realli quit surpris is that they are pay sign bonus for new airplan captain of         to           you would think  with all the pilot be releas from the passeng airlin  that they wouldn   t have ani troubl hire pilot   but appar the strength of the union is such that it has been abl to work that deal as part of the settlement   up is anticip that their pilot  now make      per hour  will be up to      per hour in        they will be the   highest paid pilot in the industri  the one other thing i would say is that i share the  book forecast  but i do believ that the inflat risk are asymmetr   it   s much easier for me to imagin a    point forecast error with inflat come in on the high side  rather than the low side  of the point forecast   i think that   s  where i   ll stop now   thank you
all right   shall we break for coffe   let   s come back in a  reason period of  e
vice chair    coffe break
we view the balanc of develop sinc the last meet as strengthen the case for further firm of monetari polici   the under pace of demand growth seem reason strong   a bit stronger than we thought at our last meet   the  inflat outlook to us look larg the same as it did in septemb  with the expect path of core  inflat higher than we would like and some risk of further acceler   on the assumpt that we increas the fed fund rate on the higher trajectori now price into market expect  our forecast is for growth to continu at a pace just abov our es  of     potenti in         somewher between   and     percent   and for the rate of increas in the core pce to stay in the vicin of   percent   of cours  this has to be consid an implaus benign view of the world  laughter  and the expans still face a familiar array of risk   but we don   t see evid yet of a substanti slowdown in demand nor of a troubl acceler in under inflat  the balanc of risk in this forecast has chang a bit   i   m a littl less concern that the cumul rise in energi price will itself bring about a more substanti and extend slowdown in growth  although that obvious has to remain a concern and possibl the princip risk to the growth outlook   we believ that the modest expect tighten of financi condit will have less of a dampen effect on demand growth than the  book assum   we don   t see strong evid yet of a signific deceler in hous price appreci or expect of that  outcom in household spend behavior  although both would be desir   the evid of strong stabil in the growth of household consumpt is  in a sens  borrow against a futur cushion  and that perhap rais the probabl of a more advers path to futur consumpt   but it   s not here yet  as in septemb  the relat probabl of altern inflat outcom still seem slight skew to the upsid  thus probabl justifi more cumul firm in monetari condit  core pce has remain moder  compens growth modest  product growth strong  and long term inflat expect reassur low   but the size of the rise in headlin inflat and the deterior in near term expect creat the possibl of some further drift up in under inflat if  as we expect  the labor market firm further and unit labor cost eventu  start to rise more rapid   we   re see some drift upward in core inflat outsid of the unit state       on balanc  to us this suggest we need to make sure that the market remain confid we   ll do enough to bring inflat and inflat expect down over the next two year   to put it differ  we should make sure that we take out enough insur to avoid a more advers inflat outcom  and in this sens we should be pleas that the market has rais it es  of  the termin fed fund rate to around     percent   our statement today  i believ  should be  design to be neutral to those expect  rather than to rais or lower the expect path  i do think it would be help if the minut reflect some discuss today about the  approach need   the approach need  not the need today   for some chang in the structur of the statement   we   ve been veri fortun to date in how well we have manag this transit in   monetari polici  with the market expect a sustain period of tighten but it expect of the termin fed fund rate vari with chang in the outlook    our decis to put a soft  qualifi  condit ceil on the fed fund rate path at    basi point a meet has not cost us  to date ani eros in long term credibl  though it probabl has encourag the market   s investor to take more durat risk   the remark stabil in quarter gdp growth and in core inflat we   ve seen has tend to reinforc expect about the outlook for monetari polici   ad an unusu degre of certainti about the like path of the fed fund rate   this has to chang   as we becom less certain about the path ahead  that increas in uncertainti need to get built into market expect   the question is when and how we alter our statement to reflect this   so far  the domin strategi befor us has been to keep move    basi point  to signal that we will continu to do so  and to defer ani major chang to the structur of the statement until we are confid we have made our last move   now  this may turn out to be the   op  choic  but the languag feel increas stale   and it may be better  in fact  to chang the languag befor we are forc to  when we still believ we have some firm ahead of us   this     might make the transit ahead more gentl   it would give us more than one shot at recalibr the signal  and it might help bring the market   s uncertainti about what   s ahead more in line with our  own  there are two area where chang in the statement seem indic   the first is in how we character the rational for our action   there we have some room to becom more explicit about our view of the outlook relat to our object without go all the way to a fulli articul   quantit forecast   the second  of cours  is in the end of the statement   if the world in decemb look about how it look now  with a high probabl of one or more move still ahead of us  we could  for exampl  replac the last three sentenc of the statement with two which state our view more simpli   they would state first that the outlook for growth and inflat suggest  that further monetari polici firm is like to be necessari  and  second  that the committe will  respond to chang in econom prospect as need to maintain price stabil so as to achiev sustain growth  this would get us out of some of the risk of repeat    measur    go forward   it would  help address some of the problem in use the word    accommod    to signal tighten   and it  would elimin the awkward in the superflu balanc of risk sentenc we now have   this  would allow an easi evolut to a more neutral signal when that becom appropri   with a  simpl statement that polici is now rough appropri but that we will act as necessari to achiev our object go forward  of cours  the world may look differ in decemb  and we have to assess then what make  the most sens   i don   t know that we can say with confid today that evolut in decemb is  ideal or necessari  but i think we need to prepar ourselv and the market for some evolut  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   unlik presid    i view the incom inform over the intermeet period as have mix implic for what might be requir  from us to keep inflat in check   on the one hand  demand and output  as he note  appear to be continu to grow at a pace that over  e is like to gradual put ad pressur on resourc   appar  the tighten of monetari polici  the rise in energi price  and the appreci of the  dollar in the first half of the year were not enough to slow growth to trend in the third quarter   and the septemb employ report and octob data on initi claim suggest that the under pace of job creation has been maintain go into the fourth quarter   moreov  demand over the  next few quarter  as mani of you point out  should be boost by the ramp up of rebuild effort  still  condit do seem to be in place for a moder in growth over the intermedi term  financi condit have tighten   interest rate have move higher  in respons the exchang  rate has firm and stock price have drop a littl   all of the increas sinc the last meet was in real interest rate  and most of the rise didn   t seem to be in respons to data  but rather to our own speech  make it unambigu restrain   in addit  volatil have back up a littl and risk spread have widen just a littl sinc the middl of the summer  suggest that investor are a bit less confid about the futur  even if they   re still too confid  data and anecdot on hous market hint at some moder  and that began even befor the recent rise in rate  perhap as a consequ of the earlier increas in interest rate as well as   the elev level of hous price relat to incom   home equiti loan at bank actual fell last  month  suggest that equiti extract is no longer so attract   but as best we can tell  without a new repeat sale index  the rate of increas in the price of exist singl famili home has not      slow  while price increas for condo have moder veri littl and remain quit high   all in all  we seem to have reach an inflect point in the hous market  fortun   and hous price   increas  work through the wealth channel and as an induc to construct  should be less  of a s ulus to demand in the futur  though how much and how fast is a veri open question   higher energi price could take someth off of consumpt  even after gasolin price declin in come month   natur gas price will be elev through the winter heat season  and the negat result of consum sen ent survey   which persist into octob  even as gas price declin   could be suggest a more mark respons than we   ve seen over the past few year of increas  in the staff forecast these forc slow the economi to a rate of growth slight below it potenti  even with a slight eas of financi condit as polici firm less than the market has  built in    it   s as good a guess as ani and better than ani forecast i might make   given the rang of uncertainti  howev  the import point for us at this meet is that growth is like to slow to closer to the rate of growth of potenti  but it   s probabl go to take at least a coupl more polici firm  the news on price and cost has been more favor for the inflat outlook   core inflat has been damp  despit substanti increas in energi price befor the hurrican   becaus the increas in the price of petroleum and petroleum product have been larg and sustain  they are more like to show through to core price than at ani  e sinc        but i   m encourag by the   lack of much respons so far this year   and energi price themselv have eas off much more  than expect when we last met   pass through effect of past increas in energi price in the staff forecast are magnifi and  persist for a  e becaus of the associ increas in inflat expect   in this regard  the     result of the michigan survey are cautionari  but long run forward measur of inflat compens in the market have risen onli modest  and they do remain well below their level of last year and the earli part of this year   i suspect that household inflat expect will eas back if gasolin price retreat  as they are expect to  busi labor cost are probabl not put much upward pressur on price   the trend in eci compens continu to be favor  includ wage and salari increas at a     percent rate for sever quarter now   the lack of upward pressur is especi noteworthi in the face of huge increas in consum energi cost  and it seem inconsist with tight in labor  market that might begin to escal cost at prevail level of resourc util   and product growth in the third quarter was strong  hold down the rise in unit labor cost   in the  book  compens and core price acceler notic over come quarter   in my view  incom price and compens data rais the odd that the pickup could be a bit smaller  with  inflat settl at a slight lower level if output follow the  book path  on attitud  we   ve had compet anecdot at this meet   most of you   i think the major of you   seem to suggest that busi are sens some increas price power   that  would  if it   s true  support the staff forecast  but it hasn   t shown through in actual price paid by consum as of yet   becaus the economi seem to have a good deal of forward momentum at a  e when resourc util is high  and becaus higher energi price do threaten to feed through to core price and inflat expect  we need to continu firm until we have some better indic that condit are in place to keep inflat restrain  under trend in output and employ will be obscur by the effect of the hurrican   includ the onset of rebuild effort  and this circumst probabl amplifi the alreadi present danger of overshoot with our polici   i   m not sure myself how use es  of r   the     neutral feder fund rate  will be in reduc the risk of overshoot   they do provid a rough guid that we   re in the neighborhood  but i don   t think they   re a veri precis measur   in that  regard  i myself am not uncomfort retain the    accommod    languag until we decid we  don   t need to tighten anymor   i   ve defin accommod for my own purpos as too low  laughter    too low to accomplish my object  i think we can mitig the risk of overshoot in polici by keep our eye on the  under driver of resourc util and demand   such as hous price and household reaction to energi price  as well as cost pressur and inflat expect   and i do think the    measur pace    of tighten has been help in this regard as well  in contrast to      and      when tighten pick up at the end and i think the risk of overshoot increas   i   m  comfort with tighten again at this meet and signal that we do not think we are finish  remov accommod   but just what we should signal about our expect for the futur will requir a fresh look at each meet  and i support the general sen ent that we need to look at our languag veri  veri care go forward   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for today   s meet  i survey the ceo of three larg region bank in the southeast  the head of the banker    bank in texa  and a banker in biloxi  mississippi  hope primarili to get an idea of the rate of recoveri  although to a certain extent to get a read on the amount of devast from the storm   the way to look at it  i  think  is to do it in band go out from the point of the storm where the greatest damag occur   the banker in biloxi remind me   mayb inform me   that although most of the public  was about new orlean  the damag to the mississippi gulf coast may have been at least as bad   i  see presid guynn nod in the affirm to that   from the beach to     yard in  everyth     is gone from the alabama coast to the louisiana border   they are experienc at the moment    percent unemploy and labor shortag  simultan  due to the fact that peopl can   t stay in the area when they have lost their hous in addit to their job   in his judgment     percent of his custom have left the area   so some restaur there are on reduc hour becaus they do not have the labor to keep them open   it is this banker   s expect that it will be five year befor the citi of biloxi recov and that it will recov onli becaus of a chang the legislatur has grant   allow the game industri to move their oper from offshor barg to on land   there   s  go to be a signific transit in the mix as a result of that   it is the game industri  and more  broad the servic industri  on which the recoveri will be base  if you go from that immedi band out one more  to the area not quit as heavili impact by the storm  you get a complet differ pictur   in the es  of one bank with a signific  alabama presenc and a signific southeast presenc  it was about three week between the  e the storm hit until the bank activ   consum and commerci loan   was pretti much back to normal   the remark fact  which they hadn   t expect becaus it was complet differ from  other hurrican experi  is that the number of check account   two differ bank gave this  inform   has doubl   this activ has doubl  compar that to the biloxi area where  over the year  hurrican have general been good for bank  becaus what the bank do dure the recoveri process is recycl or  if you will  intermedi  insur check   that is now happen more broad throughout the region  but it  also suggest that a veri signific realign or redistribut of popul is take place   throughout that area  similar to the experi that presid   note  hous unit as far away as atlanta are fill up  as they are certain in houston and in other area   baton roug  louisiana  has doubl     in size  and it appear  base on the apart rental and home purchas  that that is at least semi  perman   more broad  skill worker throughout the southeast are flock into the storm impact area  the attract be the differ in wage rate they can receiv   a side implic of that is that construct project in other part of the southeast have been delay or  in some case postpon  both becaus of the unavail of labor and also the increas in price of build suppli   pull it all togeth  the inform i   ve receiv fair well corrobor the  book in  term of the impact of the storm   name  that outsid of the most heavili impact area  econom  activ proceed larg unab   and it suggest that we are clear see evid of price  pressur  both in wage and in build materi   that be the case  it   seem that a    basi  point increas in the fund rate at today   s meet would be appropri  describ the rational for  do it in the languag of altern b   but i strong support presid     s suggest that we look at how we communic what we do   six or eight month ago  when i thought about approach the point where we were close to a posit we would defin as equilibrium  i was comfort that we   d have a clear sens at that  e as to where we were go and what i could be  look for   but i don   t   and i don   t know if that   s consist with just where we are in the cycl   so the decis are tougher  or if it   s becaus we are get some mix signal at this point when   we are close to a transit  i have heard this morn a veri strong indic of the need to guard against inflat and to identifi inflationari pressur   i   ve also heard a veri good explan for the fact that long term inflationari expect in particular  as governor kohn suggest  are well contain   but i think we are at the confluenc of a number of event  one of which is that we are clear reach the point where our polici will ceas to be accommod   second  we are clear reach the point     where the word of the statement has outliv it use   and third  we are approach a transit in leadership   and i think all of us are awar that while there perhap have been weak in our communic  and mayb even in our analysi  there has been enorm  confid in our leadership   in my experi  the onli  e that this bodi has signific confus the market is when we have tri to make a chang both in our posit and our communic simultan   if we  add in a transit in leadership  i would hope that if there is ani miscommun it would attach to the communic  not to the transit   so in my view  decemb will not be too earli to think about the confluenc of all of those event   but for today  i certain support the    basi point increas and the definit of it in altern b   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   what i   d like to do today is to talk a littl bit more about some recent trend in consum borrow inform  which a few peopl have alreadi mention  and then just make some general comment on the economi and on inflat  as a coupl of you have alreadi note  the data on consum borrow have shown a lot of  nois  as i would call it  in the last coupl month   overal  we   re see a slow in the rapid rate  of growth   it   s still grow in general  but the pace of growth is slow   so it rais the question  of what is realli happen here   are consum say that they are near the point at which they realli can   t absorb ani more debt   or are chang in underwrit under way that are slow  the pace of growth  as you know  the senior loan offic survey  cover in the supplement to the  book  report onli modest chang in demand for credit  it was modest lower   and to the extent that this could reflect consum demand  we know that motor vehicl sale have slow in the last     coupl of month  as the big incent came off   also  we   re begin to see a moder in the pace of increas in median hous price   so that could be consist with a slow in demand  on the other hand  if we look at the chart in the  book on bankruptci file  there was a huge spike in the week prior to octob     just befor the new bankruptci law went into effect  and that could have front load anywher from three to four quarter of bankruptci file  as everybodi tri to get in befor the law chang   we saw a tremend increas at that point   it   sn   t reflect what the bank are show in the qualiti of their credit or in the securit transact that are out there in the market where delinqu rate have basic been fair stabl   so this was a blip up ahead of what our normal lead indic are show  on home equiti line  i find the number realli remark   home equiti line grew    percent in          percent in       slow to    percent growth in the first half of this year  and   now  as governor kohn just mention  have shown declin in septemb and octob   so the  question is  what is happen with these home equiti line   as you know  the bank agenc collect put out common guidanc in may regard home equiti line   there was realli noth new in this guidanc   it just pull togeth what was out there to remind everybodi what safe and sound lend practic are   we know that the vast major of bank follow these sound procedur in almost all of their lend   so i felt comfort that in the senior loan offic survey onli a few bank said they had chang their underwrit standard becaus of the new guidanc  that to me say that we did realli focus on the outlier  which was our intent   so i don   t believ that this rein in of home equiti line is due to underwrit chang   we know that home equiti  line have been use not onli to extract equiti for spend but also increas for downpay on purchas of home   more so than in the past   so again  this could reflect someth more that is go on      as you know  the bank agenc later this quarter are go to issu some guidanc on mortgag and on loan for commerci real estat   again  our intent is not to signal alarm that overal credit qualiti and underwrit are poor  but to call attent to some lend practic at the  limit that are rais some concern   so at the margin it could have some impact on the pace of    lend  but we think overal thing are in pretti good shape  the other point i want to make is about credit card lend   more than a year ago now  both the occ  offic of the comptrol of the currenc  and the fed start to rais question about underwrit and credit advanc for borrow who go over their line of credit and about   minimum payment expect on credit card balanc   a grow number of custom were not  be requir to cover late payment fee or fee for go over their credit line and actual were  into negat amort when their outstand balanc exceed their line of credit  we   ve given the bank quit a bit of  e to figur out how to get into complianc with these guidelin   some start do so toward the end of last year and some will be do it later this year  so they are move at their own pace   the chang in practic will slow credit growth for some client   the one who chronic are over their line and who have paid onli the minimum month fee   again  we don   t expect this to be widespread  but it could be a factor in some of these  bankruptci file   peopl who have been at the fring of be overextend are realiz that they   re go to have to get their borrow down   now let me shift my focus to the overal economi   i find that the pace of the expans has  been quit resili  given everyth that we   ve been through in the past year   recent  despit signific difficulti  whether it was hurrican or the spike in oil price  growth continu at a  sound pace in the mid   percent rang   and the staff forecast show more of that next year       inflat has slow in the last coupl of month  but i   ve focus a bit on the natur of the  develop there   as you know  some of the slowdown has been in price of servic   and with some of the trend we   re see in core element of inflat  get a number over   percent  as the forecast has  begin to give me some concern   so i look at that and at the forecast for a continu rise in labor compens cost   a potenti slowdown in product also suggest that we need  to be much more attent to what   s go on in term of cost pressur on the labor front that could affect worker    expect of compens increas   so i think it   s even more import for us to watch inflat in the next few month  i support rais the fund rate today   i also support the dialogu  as presid   outlin  on the element of our communic so that we have an order transit   we ought to  look care at everi word in our statement   while it will be pars when we make chang  at least all of us will have had some  e to think about the chang   and i would hope that we have   that dialogu at our next meet
thank you  mr  chairman   like other  i am somewhat  though not fulli  reassur by the incom data   the economi clear appear to be on an expansionari track  not   have been serious damag by the serious damag hurrican   addit  read of  core inflat have been surpris benign  given everyth we know from our model and the anecdot data we   ve heard from other on the cumul effect of the rise in energi price   more import  dure the intermeet period  inflat expect for both the next five year and for the    to    year horizon are littl chang   at least they have not chang much sinc the last meet and could reason be describ  as they were at the  e  as be contain       as the earlier dialogu between   and the chairman indic  i did ask the staff to give me some inform on how inflat expect and energi price interact   let me summar just three point from that data   first  of all the categori of energi price   spot crude  gasolin   far futur  natur gas  and heat oil   it seem that spot crude is the one that drive inflat expect most firm   second  as   indic  across the   year    year  and    year  horizon for inflat expect  the   year horizon is realli the one that is most heavili  influenc by spot crude oil price   and third  as i think   said  even there the impact on inflat expect of spot crude in the   year horizon is relat mute  a   percent increas in spot crude oil price  at least in these model  tend to go to a     basi point increas in inflat expect   so while we   re awar of the import of energi price  it turn out that in term of  drive inflat expect  there are mani other thing that are equal import  have said all of that  let me now turn to the broader issu of import at this meet  which are what to do and also what to say   someon quot yogi berra   i   m go to quot that equal famous poet  archilochus  whom some of you may recal from the  th centuri b c    laughter
i knew him well    laughter
he famous said     the fox know mani littl thing  but the hedgehog know one big thing      the reason that   s import here is that while the various read we   ve had on the incom data are extrem import  in some way they are in the categori of    mani littl thing      and the one big thing   the big thing that dave note in his open remark   is that the staff now has a forecast for the next    to    month of an economi that  with just one or two more  tighten move  is like to enter a phase of growth below trend  with inflat pressur gradual  subsid   i think this is realli the first  e in this period that the outlook show  after the long and     variabl lag  the impact of the cumul tighten that we   ve undertaken   and the forecast   inde show that the economi is like to slowli respond to our tighten regim   i find this actual quit credibl becaus i believ  as   the staff  that the fund rate is probabl within the rang of it equilibrium real level and will certain be within that rang with one or two or more tighten   i think it   s fair import to put that on the tabl   while i fulli  respect don   s view that one can   t put too much weight on these point es   i think it is import for a committe of our sort to have some sens of whether or not we   re in the rang of equilibrium  have said that  i do think a number of forc are pull and push against the economi and lead us to this level   here i would pick up on a point that presid   made   and i  certain agre with him   that the impact of these hurrican is more like to have been on the suppli side than on the demand side   howev  i would say that that   s a partial equilibrium analysi   and ceteri is clear not paribus in this case  becaus there are a number of forc that are also drive the demand side independ of the hurrican   let me just highlight two or three of them   one i continu to be worri about is the my i of what it is that   s drive busi   dave rais in his open remark the point i   ve made a few  e   that the invest gdp ratio still seem relat low  certain compar to it level in the last decad   there is some survey evid that ceo and cfos still have some uncertainti   anecdot discuss that i and some other have had suggest that some of this uncertainti has to do with whether or not to invest in the unit state or oversea   and the second part of the uncertainti is still  i think  a linger concern that these elev energi price will eventu play through to lower demand  while other may disagre  i think the larg negat net equiti issuanc and the willing of busi to repurchas share or to engag in cash financ merger  against the backdrop of     ampl liquid  is primarili a sign that busi are somewhat skeptic about their abil to reward sharehold with a reason futur return on intern invest   and  therefor  they  may be hold back on invest   i   d also say that the slight negat guidanc from busi dure this earn season reinforc this view that there   s some downward pressur that show up in a slight lower equilibrium rate than we would have had otherwis  second  i would pick up on a point that both don kohn and sue bie made have to do with  develop in the hous sector  and whi for household in particular there is a sudden fall off in the demand for heloc  home equiti line of credit    again  i think that creat a littl bit of  downward pressur on the neutral rate  we may also see dure the next coupl of year an increas in the save rate  both for the reason that the staff talk about and also due to continu uncertainti about pension  which has sure been veri much in the newspap   i think that  plus the ongo discuss about social  secur reform  will perhap drive household to save more  and final  to pick up on     s point   a point that we haven   t talk about much today   i think net export dure the forecast horizon are like  if anyth  to continu to be a drag  if i can  use that word  though i understand your mathemat point
pleas don   t    laughter
they will be an arithmet subtract from measur gdp in the u s    economi   i think all of the condit that have driven that in the past  includ foreign exchang rate  relat interest rate  and most import the product stori and an absenc of domest absorpt oversea  are like to result in the extern sector be an arithmet subtract from  gdp more so than an addit      in my view  all of those thing lead to a credibl stori that say we are  or soon will be  in the rang of the neutral rate   but what   all that mean   i think it mean that we should clear be vigil about inflat becaus there are some upsid pressur  but i agre with cathi and other  that we don   t have to be vigilant about inflat   to put it anoth way  i think the scenario in the  book that has us go to an interest rate of   percent  drive the economi to a growth rate that   s far below potenti  open up an output gap  and have unemploy of     percent  is   not someth that we need to embrac   in fact  it   s someth that we need to be cautious about   so that   s my view on what to do   the implic  obvious  is that i   m quit comfort with a    basi point move today  and i won   t preclud futur discuss by suggest what we  ought to do go forward   but i don   t find the  book implicit assumpt terribl unattract   the second question then  obvious  is what to say   i applaud   for open that topic   in my view it   s import for it to be on the tabl   i come out at a differ place from where     come out and also from where i think don come out   i   m not comfort keep this languag  until we think we   re done  becaus i   m not sure we   ll ever realli know that with enough certainti   i think the languag   need to evolv   i agre with     s view that it seem a littl stale at this stage   i would veri much be in the camp of favor some forward look languag of one sort of  anoth   the sort that i prefer is the kind of languag that deal with the outlook in term of our  dual mandat  with respect to both growth and inflat   i know that in the period i   ve been here there were  e when growth and inflat were not point in the same direct or when the  risk to our growth and inflat object differ substanti   so i think we need to separ them  i recogn that the market onli want to know what   s go to happen with regard to interest  rate   from year of discuss around this tabl  i think most of us  myself includ  are perhap a      littl uncomfort go that far with our forward look languag  becaus we know that there are mani factor that can chang the outlook between one meet and anoth   so i   d be veri cautious about that  i do encourag us to have this discuss in an order fashion between now and decemb  and mayb again between decemb and januari   but have said all of that  mr  chairman  i think what to do and what to say today are fair clear   thank you
thank you   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that    low is distribut   over the intermeet period  market particip mark up their expect of your come action  as seen in the drift upward of eurodollar futur rate in the top panel of the first exhibit   the rate for contract end this year  the black line  and next year  the red line  rose    and    basi point  respect   three factor  appar came into play   first  the econom effect of the spate of hurrican this fall seem less moment now  at least to market particip  than they did on septemb     the date of your last meet   essenti  a portion of the worri about the economi that lower rate in advanc of the septemb meet was roll back   second  data releas  on net  were read as evid that the economi had consider momentum in advanc of the landfal of hurrican katrina   and third     mani of you express concern in public about inflat risk  and those statement were taken as a warn of more tighten than previous anticip   the net result was to shift up the path expect for the feder fund rate  plot  as the solid black line in the middl left panel  by  …  to    percentag point relat to that prevail befor the septemb meet  but by onli  …› to   percentag point  relat to the august meet   the fund rate is now anticip to peak at about     percent in futur market  which is a touch below long run expect of the fund  rate suggest by the blue chip survey   as shown in the middl right panel  the survey economist see the termin fund rate at around    percent   that same  survey  howev  suggest that economist pitch a pretti big tent  in that about    percent of their respons span a rang from    to    percent    this ratchet higher of polici expect was associ with a tighten of financi condit more general  seen in the bottom panel as the rise in longer     the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix           term treasuri yield  declin in stock price  and appreci of the foreign exchang  valu of the dollar   if you are worri that this financi market reaction was overdon  therebi   impart too much financi restraint  you might favor hold the intend fund rate  at    percent today   the subject of the left hand panel of exhibit     as note in the first bullet at the top and in the middl panel  the staff forecast of the growth of real gdp for      has been mark down over the cours of the year   you may see reason whi this might happen again   say  becaus the econom disloc from the hurrican could be larger than expect or becaus household spend could sag as  real estat valu stop escal  or even declin  and as consum confid  plot in the bottom left panel  sink further   if so  the shock in financi market in reaction to altern a would certain realign market expect lower   inde  even if  you view inact today as like to be mere a paus in the process of firm  it  might be difficult to convey that to the public  make it like that the rotat  downward in rate expect could be consider   more probabl  you   ll find the argument for tighten   point   in the right hand side of the exhibit   to be more compel   in particular  as the top bullet point and the middl panel relat  you might view the upward drift in the staff   s inflat   forecast for      over the cours of the year as signal that the risk to the price outlook are on the upsid   a number of you have note at previous meet that inflat was run on the high side of your comfort zone  suggest that the prospect of ani further rise would be especi unwelcom   in that regard  you might  consid the pickup in the michigan survey respons of near  and longer term inflat expect  plot at the lower right  as evid of such an unfold dynam   a   point firm might be seen as suffici at this  e to keep inflat contain  as long as it was expect to be follow by at least a few more move go forward   the differ between altern b and c in the bluebook hing on how mani more tighten move you see in your futur   which could be convey by the languag of the statement   with the aid of exhibit    i   d like to cover  some of the same ground as presid    but more color  if i say so myself    laughter   this exhibit take as a start point the statement issu in septemb   among the pertin question are      is product growth still robust  the red text      if the nomin fund rate move up to   percent  will polici still be accommod  the   text      if polici remain accommod  are you like to remov that accommod at a measur pace  the blue text       is there an appropri path of monetari polici that will balanc the risk to  your dual object in the face of a suppli shock    by now  i   ve use up much of my color palett   but i think it   s the purpl text         i would remind you that  even if you do not want to address some of these question this afternoon  the passag of  e could ul  forc you to do so   an earlier  rather than later  dialogu about these issu would provid the opportun to use the minut to forewarn the world of chang in languag that has been unchang for so long that the public might be forgiven for think it was carv in stone    exhibit   provid some perspect on these question  start with the tabl at the upper left list the four quarter growth of output per hour over the past few year   the   percent growth rate of product in the third quarter pull the four  quarter chang to   percent   while the fomc statement refer to under  not actual  product growth  this perform may well make you comfort retain the    robust    character   in that regard  as can be seen in the chart at the upper right  the privat sector economist in the blue chip panel continu to see output grow at better than a   percent pace in the long run  an assess that has  been essenti unchang over the period the committe has assert that under product growth has been robust   as for assess the degre of polici accommod  the middl panel show that bring the nomin fund rate to   percent would place the real fund rate at the midpoint of the rang of the staff   s es  of it equilibrium level   there are three  reason  list in the bottom left panel  whi you might think that describ polici as   accommod is nonetheless appropri  beyond governor kohn   s gut the word of ani mean    laughter   first  you might believ that the staff is underes  the vigor of aggreg demand  perhap becaus we   ve pencil in too big a drag on consumpt from higher energi price and an as yet unobserv slow in home price appreci   if so  your person es  of the equilibrium real rate of interest would be to the north of that plot in the chart   second  you might believ that the real rate should be  calcul base on a forward look proxi for inflat expect  not the backward look four quarter actual core inflat rate use in the chart   if you also  believ that an inflat scare has pull expect inflat abov it recent pace  then the real rate lie to the south of that plot here   third  the gap between es  of the equilibrium real rate and it actual level may not be an appropri measur of  polici accommod at all   mechan  the staff calcul the equilibrium real rate by determin  within a given model  the level of the real rate that would close the output gap in about three year   you might view the path of the output gap in the  transit to it ul  closur as unlik to unwind current pressur on inflat or mayb even as consist with pressur build for a while   that is  if you wait three year     e to close the output gap  you might not like the inflat rate like to prevail then    the chart in the lower right panel show the recent jump in energi price is a remind that you might label the current set of forc imping on the economi as a  suppli shock   as the textbook tell us  a suppli shock confront monetari     policymak with unpleas altern  as it tend to weaken aggreg demand and put upward pressur on inflat   in such circumst  there might not be an appropri path of polici that balanc the risk to your dual object   that is  you might have to accept   and relat to the public in your statement   unbalanc risk    exhibit   present four altern for the languag in the relev part of the committe   s statement   as in the top panel  you can limp along at this meet with the current word  reassur by the fact that this would like preserv someth close to the current path of expect futur tighten  becaus few market particip anticip ani chang   as in the second panel  you can get out of the busi of character the degre of polici accommod by describ the chang  not the level  of the fund rate  thus  you could say that          polici firm can continu at a pace that is like to be  measur     which implicit admit the possibl that you may have to impos polici restraint  on net  to check inflat   this could establish the preced of provid guidanc by write a fresh character of the odd of your like futur action at each meet  appropri condit on the econom outlook   i know that i discourag easili  but i   d like to point out that this was exact what you were do with the addit of the    measur pace    languag in may        but if the polici outlook   not chang materi from meet to meet  fresh languag can get  harden pretti quick   as in the third panel  you can replac the current risk assess with a formula base on an unchang stanc of polici  thus provid a coars signal of your like futur action   my argument for tilt at this windmil one more  e is that such a formula both provid some transpar about your intent and should simplifi  the process of the committe come to closur on the languag of the statement at each meet   in my view  prior effort to find a satisfactori formula to provid guidanc about your futur polici intent ran aground becaus most propos were too ambiti by incorpor assess of level and chang of the committe   s  dual object   a simpler formula   perhap even couch in term of interest rate rather than the committe   s goal   is more like to last   if it is not specif enough  on some occas  you   ve got the rational part of the statement and the minut to provid a more nuanc view    the fourth panel would be appropri if you want to scrap the risk assess entir   howev  reflect on the discuss of the committe and it success of subcommitte on this subject over the year  i think those of you who prefer the simplic of this altern may be tilt at your own windmil   by my count   enough member seem to believ that there is some role for word in narrow market uncertainti about your futur action to make such guidanc a durabl featur  of the statement for some  e to come   it has been a featur of my brief for what seem to be a long  e to remind the committe that a discuss of your communic polici is warrant   i now     know the wisdom of the maxim from the    monkey   s paw        be care what you ask  for  you might get it      becaus you have spent some  e discuss the issu  the  minut will have to address the topic   it is also pretti clear that this convers will continu in decemb   to inform that discuss i propos circul a survey fair short to probe your view on key principl govern the statement of the sort governor   discuss   my goal  is to get back to the committe befor the decemb meet with a summari of the result to make it easier to find the middl ground among the various view that have been express   for your conveni  the last exhibit updat tabl   from the bluebook  relat to what you saw there  we   ve taken comment from some member that   think simplifi the discuss of the outlook in row   and
i have a question that concern altern c in tabl    current  the onli part of the fomc statement that the committe vote on is the balanc of risk section  and that now includ the forward look    measur pace    languag   my sens is that  to the extent we continu to have forward look languag in the statement  it   s someth the committe should vote on   but in look at altern c  what you did there was to move the   forward look languag into the descript rational part of the statement  which in my understand is not subject to a vote   to me there   s a govern issu there that i find troubl  and i wonder if you would comment on it   was your expect in altern c that the forward look languag would not be vote on   or do you envis the committe vote on the  entir statement   so  my question has to do with govern
i think it   s a govern issu for the committe to decid   i was  presum that you would continu to vote on at least a portion of the statement  the part that contain the forward look languag   but it is an open issu whi you vote onli on a part of the statement and not the entir document
is there a reason whi the vote now   not cover the rational sentenc
what the committe vote on has chang over  e   initi  start februari          the statement issu was explicit the chairman   s statement describ what the committe did   somewher about a year and a half later that character was drop  and it becam less clear whether it was the committe   s statement or the chairman   s statement   by      or       market particip general view it as the committe   s statement   most of the peopl  sit around this tabl  i think  view it as the committe   s statement  when we last rethought what the committe vote on  it seem import to bring into the statement the forward look guidanc  the risk assess portion  and that   s whi we did that  so  it has evolv   i assum that it will evolv again if you chang the basic structur of the statement
i had a question on a differ part of this   you rais the issu of  whether you should use the inflat project in your calcul of the equilibrium feder fund rate instead of the backward look inflat number that you use   i was wonder if you could elabor on that a bit   i certain would think that the forecast would be a better measur to put in here than the backward look figur   what is the argument or the logic for put the backward look inflat number in there
the main one  which has been reflect somewhat in the convers alreadi  is that it   s hard to know what inflat expect are   we don   t have a consist proxi over the entir period   and it   s not obvious that if you took the entir sampl and es  your model use measur of inflat expect that you necessarili would have a differ gap right  now becaus you would not onli chang the actual expect real fund rate  but you   d also chang  your es  of the equilibrium real fund rate
mayb i misstat my question   i   m not talk about an inflat expect forecast but the inflat forecast you have   whi not put that in the model
among other thing  the staff inflat forecast is judgment and need not be accept by the committe   i think comput you   re talk about someth  if you  want to go to the frb us model  that would be difficult to do and
if you put in an inflat forecast  you   ve just target inflat to a point  not a rang   that   s what will happen   we   ll be lock in to explain whi we didn   t move on either side of the forecast   i think it   s veri t i
let me also say  presid    that the passag of  e is help in term of provid other measur of the equilibrium real fund rate   we now have index debt quot   we use them to back out an es  of the equilibrium real fund rate   we don   t have a long enough  e seri to know it properti as  say  a predictor of aggreg demand or inflat  over  e  i would think that would becom a more standard featur of our analysi  although this  analysi is done in dave     s area  and i wouldn   t want to commit his resourc    laughter
you probabl did   thank you
i think we   re miss an opportun as fiscal agent for the  feder govern to have an audienc for this meet and collect revenu  which could probabl balanc the budget    laughter   presid
set asid the govern issu that   rais  it seem to me that the  key oper phrase and the chang in altern c is take out    accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur    and replac it with    like make further polici firm necessari      i   m of the school that we like have a littl bit further to go  partial driven by our own analysi of the inflat trend   mean pce inflat data   that we do in dalla   but i   m      curious as to what the staff ventur might be the market reaction to this particular word chang  would chang this languag to    make further polici firm necessari    sound as if we have a more sever situat on our hand that we are worri about   what   s your judgment
in talk about market reaction to potenti statement word  you   re get as far from econom scienc as what we do here  and that   s pretti far   it is hard to say  and mayb i   ll ask dino to help here  too   but our presumpt was that use the    firm    word would send a signal that you envis not stop at what you think is the neutral rate but go abov that  and so market particip would rais their sight for how much you would tighten  but that   s onli a guess  and that   s the guess we put in the bluebook
i think that   s right   i believ it would be view as veri hawkish becaus you   ve taken out the accommod languag and you   re talk about firm   so i think   is right  that it would be taken as a veri hawkish statement
i guess i would like to make a coupl point about that   when you think about the languag  the character of    accommod    and the    measur pace    are link  so if you were  for instanc  to take out    accommod    while leav in someth about    measur pace     that would signal that you   re go past the firm now anticip   on the other hand  if you left in    accommod    but took out    measur pace     market particip would probabl view that as an indic that you want to pick up the pace of tighten   that is  start do    basi point  the other thing i would like to mention is that this propos realli is  in a sens     back to the futur      the committe at one point did signal it intent about the possibl futur direct of  it next action in the form of the direct   and the experi back in       when the direct  becam part of the committe   s statement  was that market particip didn   t deal with the     condit natur of that direct veri well   if you were lean in one direct  they tend to just slam into that corner   so the purpos of the old balanc of risk languag was to step back from there by talk about the committe   s goal   so  those are all among the thing that the committe would have to consid in frame new statement languag
mr  chairman  sinc   has rais the question of process  and i get the sens that we   re probabl not prepar today to deal substant with chang the statement  i   m wonder out loud if we shouldn   t tri to go even further than   has suggest between now and the next meet   perhap we should tri to get ourselv in a posit at least a coupl of week befor the next meet where we have some viabl option languag work out that we could make oper at the next meet if we choos to  it has been pretti clear that we   re not go to have a veri product discuss today on the statement   or next  e either  unless we do some work on it in advanc   given the amount of  think that has been done on this and the suggest   has made and   has made  i think we ought to be abl in a coupl or three week to get someth on the tabl that we could all look at  if we truli want to have an option that we could exercis  if we choos  at the decemb meet   so i just want to push on the process side a littl bit and ask if we could do that
i think that   s precis the direct in which   is go at this point
i realli didn   t want to promis too much in my prepar remark
i would push a littl bit
the sequenc i envis is first survey you on general principl   are you comfort with put in forward look languag   if there   s forward look languag      would you prefer it to be about interest rate or the risk to your object   there are differ of opinion on a number of those basic question   then onc those survey result are collat   to  see if there realli is a middl ground or if there are a coupl of distinct altern that lend themselv to these question   i   d send a document around
but we need to have that more than a coupl of day befor the meet if we   re realli go to have someth that   s workabl   i guess it sound like what you have in mind is what i   m hope we can do   thank you  mr  chairman
further question   to quot somebodi from last night  whi don   t i proceed    laughter  someth veri unusu is occur both in the economi and  as a consequ  in monetari polici deliber   essenti  this surpris long   and i must say in retrospect rather success   interv of increment measur chang over a protract period of  e  has turn out a lot better than i think we could conceiv have imagin   but it   s clear come to an end  and i think the reason it   s come to an end is that our grasp on what   s go on in the world is a littl more tenuous than it was when we start   you may recal that we had a general view of the way we thought the world was go to work in the spring of      when we start to indic that we were go to tighten   the market all began to respond   the durat measur  the convex measur  and all the various forward look measur were adjust the whole structur of interest rate in the context of how we and the rest of the world thought the world was work   then sudden the whole thing crumbl   it crumbl becaus there was essenti an x factor out there which we had not anticip   a disinflationari forc   and we worri about that  it resurfac this year  and i think we final conclud that it reflect essenti the signific  increas in the activ workforc in the market economi   that increas was a result of over         million peopl from the former soviet union come from a central plan  isol economi and be ad into the world market economi   even larger  but a littl later was the addit of  a workforc of     million in china  as that countri began move in the direct of market forc  and more late  india   although india is a bit laggard in this respect  the consequ  of cours  was to doubl the number of worker in the labor forc who are  particip in world market   they are not necessarili wholli involv in tradabl good  but there has been a definit shift in the structur in the world labor forc   these are educ  but not   high product worker  and obvious  they are produc a much smaller fraction of world output in these emerg nation than is come from the develop world   but what we are   observ is this phenomenon where unit labor cost are undergo for the world as a whole a  signific but one  e chang  if we had the data  which we would have onli veri crude  we could make a judgment as to what bring all of these peopl into the workforc   to world unit labor cost   inde  we have all sort of exampl of what   s happen at the margin  not the least of which is in the unit state   in germani the impact of worker from the czech republ  slovakia  and poland is veri  pronounc   it   s veri pronounc in the unit state and in a lot of countri as a result of china   s workforc  what we are clear see are disinflationari forc that are reflect in inflat premium in the longer tranch of the interest rate market   so  the tenth year tranch of the    year note has been realli quit suppress and onli veri recent has move up  we know without actual data that the shift  which polit occur in a veri short period of  e  cannot occur that rapid econom   there has been a gradual absorpt of all of these  peopl into the labor forc   and we know that it is  inde  a one  e event   when you   re      experienc gradual from a one  e event  the rate of chang at which the transit is occur has a veri signific impact   i would argu   look at world inflationari pattern and the high correl between core inflat worldwid and the remark declin in inflat in the  emerg world   that this is a global process   even in earlier period when we had low inflat in the develop world  we had huge problem in the develop world   we do not even have that anymor  we have  as we were discuss veri earli in the meet  this converg of interest rate  so that what we are look at is quit evid a global phenomenon   and when we tri to reconcil  as we are tri to do  the anecdot evid of these inflat pressur that we   re see with what   s come out of our model  there is a disson   in other word  the model are   not consist with an anecdot exampl of the kind presid   was talk about in term of  the surg in price in texa   a lot of you have note similar exampl   it goe beyond the issu of a mere pass through of energi cost   energi cost are be pass through  we know  and becaus profit margin general are not be squeez by it  we   re essenti see a full pass through  but becaus the product in the use of energi is clear improv  the pass through is in fact partial  there   s more to this stori  though  than we   re observ becaus energi is a much less signific factor than it use to be   inde  we   ve just had a declin in the last two month of    cent a gallon at the pump for regular gasolin   now  that is clear go to have effect  though we   re not quit sure what they will be   but it strike me that our real polici problem involv how to make a judgment as to what phase we   re in of this disinflationari set of pressur   when   it eventu come to an end   or more exact  when do we get enough of the adjust so that the  adjust thereaft slow down    what that mean is that the disinflationari effect on just the     normal rise in structur unit labor cost worldwid is eas   in other word  if there   s a lot of pressur  that pressur will keep the inflat rate down   but the deflationari pressur eas as we complet the process  and we begin to get   and would expect to get   a gradual rise in core inflat   and that is what we   re get   that   s not to say that we   re get a rise in core inflat   what we have to do  i think  is come to grip with a veri larg element of uncertainti regard how this process is emerg and how it   s go to come out   i do think that the indic of the rise in core inflat  as modest as it is  may be   and i underlin the word    may       a sign that the first differ of that adjust process is chang   yet we   re not get it in the inflat compens   to be sure  as i said  the    year tranch has move up    to    basi point   it   s  not a big deal  inde  a good part of that could be real and probabl is  so we   re realli delv into area where our past experi is not all that help   if in the spring of      the big surg in expect in term of where the    year note was go to end up and where the mortgag rate was go to end up had actual materi  we   d be in a differ  world today   and that world would be base a lot on the way our old model work and the way certain relationship have work in histori   but there is someth new here with which we have to come to grip   and strang enough  the most benefici way to address this particular subject in   our communic  in my judgment  is through the statement   in the statement  we are  inde  recogn the element of uncertainti with which we are confront   the sureti we had and went  forward on start in the spring of        in term of how we were view develop and the appropri polici to follow   has proceed liter almost unchang   that   s realli quit a remark stretch   but it   s over   or i should say it   s about on the edg of be over becaus we can no longer be as sure as we were about the intermedi term outlook      i feel a littl queasi about use the word    accommod    for a   percent feder fund rate larg becaus  as you may recal  we didn   t get to    accommod    until we went from   percent  to    percent in the earlier period   so i find that don has the obvious solut to all of this     accommod    is the state we want to leav for whatev reason and  therefor  rais the  rate    laughter  in ani event  yes  i do think that we need to move today   i wouldn   t worri about the statement be stale   it has been stale for a veri long  e    laughter   and it   s not go to  chang that much   i think at the decemb meet we   ve got to make some fundament choic   and it would certain be help if we could come togeth and essenti complet the structur of what we are go to do   if not in actual at least the conceptu underpin of it   so that we  will be on a new path with new word   and depend on how   decid he want to read  your respons to his questionnair  perhap we will have a new statement    laughter   so that   s the direct i would suggest we take  now  the actual word of the propos statement  i think  is slight differ from what we have here  isn   t it
no   the one in my brief materi is
but i thought there was a semicolon somewher
this has the semicolon    laughter   the latest version is the one in the last exhibit of the handout that was distribut just prior to my brief
my apolog   so everyon has actual seen this   if it is accept  this is the statement we will be go with   i would  therefor  put it as a suggest that we move    basi point and use the altern b statement as is   governor kohn
i agre with your recommend   move    basi point  stick with this languag  and give full consider to new languag between now and the next meet   i   m actual not as worri as some other about the statement be stale   it has been accomplish our object  i think  in an amaz success way   market have correct interpret what  we   re talk about and what we   re do   we haven   t had the slip up that we had when we were  chang languag a lot
when we tri to be origin
i withdraw the word    stale       laughter
no  it has been unchang for quit a while  i agre with that   but we can defer this discuss
i agre with what you are propos
i support your recommend
i support your recommend as well   and i   d like to think that this discuss will get in the minut so that if the word chang in decemb   let me put some odd on the fact that they will chang somehow   it won   t come as a big surpris to peopl
we want to be reason clear in which direct we may chang it rather than leav the question open   just to say we   re go to chang but we   re not go to tell you how  i think will creat substanti unnecessari uncertainti
well  should we take some of your thought in term of how the minut  are written   my understand of what you said   and what i think i heard around the tabl      although not explicit   was that the statement would have a sens of greater uncertainti about it  it would be move in the direct of not promis as much go forward   now  mayb i   m read too much into what you said
that   s what i did say   that   s what i believ
i can   t speak for the rest of the committe in that respect  but  we   ll all be vet the minut so we can tri to do our best in convey our thought   my onli concern is not to introduc a new uncertainti in the process sinc we   ve done except well for so long   be innov has less valu than i think we   ve realiz
may i just add to that comment   i think we need to be  care not to telegraph in the minut ani chang until we have a littl more confid about how we want the statement to evolv   so i think the minut can reflect the fact that we   re discuss  as  the world hope we   re discuss  what evolut might be sensibl   we   re not
the term is    ongo discuss      that will clarifi it   that   s   basic say  don   t take this as some dramat chang
then it   s not a surpris  if someth differ come out  it would be the result of an ongo discuss
yes   presid santomero
i support your recommend   just to continu on this topic  i think  we all have to be care  number one  to read what   s in the minut and  number two  to think about what we   re go to say when we   re ask about the minut and what it is the minut are communic   we know there   s go to be a rash of question about what it mean   and i think     we just have to be prepar for what we as individu are go to say to the press when they ask about what is that ongo convers
but  mr  chairman  may i say someth
i don   t think we normal take it upon ourselv to tri to interpret the minut for the world   we let the minut speak for themselv  and we convey whatev person view we have about what we think go forward  but
all i   m point out is that the press is go to say     you talk about   chang   what do you mean by that      i think we all just have to be prepar to recogn that that   s an inevit part of mention in the minut ongo discuss about chang   perhap  it   s obvious to all  but it will be a new area of inquiri by the press  and we have to recogn that
we might want to get involv in that as we proceed with the  minut and see where  in fact  everybodi is   perhap we can give  implicit at least  some guidanc as to what we all ought to be do when the minut come out   presid
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i support the statement   i just want to regist a thought or two about languag   as we approach decemb  i recogn that   the chang in languag that everyon is anticip is a chang that would be associ with  stop or at some point moder the pace at which we increas the fund rate   i  like don kohn  have alway interpret    accommod    to mean the rate is less than what we think it   s go to be after the next meet   i can   t think of anoth coher way to interpret that   i think  that is alway what it has meant  in that regard  there are lot of word that peopl use that involv implicit counterfactu  the word    neutral    is one  for exampl  the word    equilibrium    is anoth one   i understand veri       well the mechan of what the bluebook    but that to me  sn   t correspond to a path our   economi could conceiv get to from where we are now   so it has alway troubl me for us to make refer to these fair complic and elabor counterfactu simul in describ interest rate   and i   d be reluct to go in the direct of the formula option that   put befor us yet again   with compliment for his persist   that make refer to someth  that   s clear off the equilibrium path  let me mention anoth thought about languag   i recogn that some around this tabl don   t share as heighten a sens of concern about an uptick in core inflat as i do   my fear is that that has some posit probabl   and if at some point we feel about a rise in core  if it should move up  the way we felt about a fall in core in mid       i think we would find it desir to  communic our dissatisfact with that and our intent to prevent it   obvious  our sequenc  of communic in mid      had some fit and start  but it was ul  the communic of  our intent that stabil expect   that establish sort of an effect floor to the level of  inflat that market particip thought we were will to toler   and i worri about chang the statement in a way that everyon associ with a paus when there   s still a likelihood out there that we may have to engag in a communic exercis of anoth sort   i   ll leav it at that
well  i accept your suggest  mr  chairman   i was just think about the  introduct you provid  which is someth i   ve been consum with becaus i   m suppos to   give a lectur at harvard on thursday night on the global of monetari polici   i   m worri about the phenomenon that you describ   it   s one of the reason i feel quit hawkish even relat to presid     and the direct in which it is proceed   let me cite a small data point   the retail will tell you that they got    percent relief last year from china but that they   re onli     get   percent relief now   now  where that number come from  i   m not quit sure   but the point is that the disinflationari mitig factor is be reduc  and yet we have no sens of the measur of capac or of the util of capac outsid our own border  particular in the part of the world you spoke of   and i want to make sure  howev we word thing and whatev we communic in the minut  that we don   t close the door to still be veri vigil  though not vigilant  on the inflat front   but i accept and support your recommend
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend on the rate and i support  your plan to review the languag  as we   ve all talk about here or  as you put it  to continu our  ongo discuss of the languag go forward  just a comment on the point   i forget who said this but i think it was     that the statement speak for itself and the minut speak for themselv   i agre complet with that   and i think it is import  as we give talk and answer question  that we make it clear that our comment   repres our own person view   they are not interpret of the minut   they are to be read   as    in my view  x or y        i think that is a veri import distinct to make go forward  let me add just one final point   i  too  am concern about inflat  as we all are around this tabl   and i must say that i think the cost of inflat come in abov the  book forecast now outweigh the cost of inflat come in below the  book forecast go forward
presid  n
i support all part of the recommend   the chang in the fund rate  the exist languag  and the possibl that we will alter the familiar languag at the next meet
i support the recommend  mr  chairman   with respect to the languag  what i think i   m support is the process by which we will be look at what chang would be appropri   but i certain agre that the next meet is the appropri  e to look at it and that  in order to do that we need some intermedi communic about the option
mr  chairman  there are word and phrase that i   m not as comfort with as i   d like to be  particular the part deal with inflat risk   the word    potenti    has crept into  the sentenc in term of inflat pressur  i see those pressur as clear there and not just  potenti   but i certain can support your recommend and i look forward to a discuss between meet of how to fundament restructur the statement we   re use   thank you
mr  chairman  i support your recommend for the polici move and also the statement today   and i look forward to more detail discuss about revis the statement go forward

mr  chairman  i support your recommend of    basi point   i   support the languag in altern b   on the issu of what we should say about the minut  i  would caution all of us to be veri care becaus the real answer is we don   t know   to say much more than    ongo discuss    perhap is signal more than anyon want to or should  on the question of whether or not we should wait until we   re fulli done tighten befor we  chang the languag  i think that will creat an incred gong reverber that say     boy  they   ve chang the languag   they must think they   re realli done       in my view  the realiti is that if we chang the languag befor we think we   re realli done  then the languag can evolv in a way that may be more help  have broken my sword on this issu over sever year with the help of don and then     i  too  look forward  laughter  to see the wisdom of     and i admir the way he will bite the hand that feed him    laughter
mr  chairman  i support your recommend on the rate and the languag for  today   i   d like to make just a coupl of other point   there has been a lot of discuss in the newspap and among peopl i talk to about the influenc of the remark in our speech regard  our concern about inflat risk   that clear  i think  has made a differ to market sen ent  and with respect to the neutral rate  i hope that we don   t start make statement that we   regard the neutral rate as be a narrow rang or a number   these calcul come from a model    one way of look at this is that if the neutral rate has averag about x over some histor  period  we might anticip that that would be the averag go forward   howev  the rate that is  consist with equilibrium at ani moment of  e has vari a lot   if we look at      or       for   exampl  the rate was low and yet the economi was bare move forward   if we look at           that was a period of vigor recoveri from the         recess  and the real feder fund rate was about   percent   so the rate that at ani moment of  e is consist with equilibrium can vari wide  and i hope we don   t give the impress that the neutral rate is some narrow littl target toward which we are like to go   we talk about it as an averag of histor experi   i think we could realli be mislead the market as to where we   re like to end up if we leav the impress that it   s in the neighborhood of     or    percent or ani other such number that we might mention  second  i   d like to point out that the  book forecast for the core pce inflat rate next  year  fourth quarter to fourth quarter  is     percent   and there is a view abroad in the marketplac that some member of the committe have an explicit target rang in mind for that measur of   to   percent   other will say that by reveal prefer the committe has made clear it prefer for an inflat target of   to   percent   and if we  in fact  consist start get year to year inflat rate that are notic abov    we are go to produc a market reaction that we need to   be awar of   one that may well be ahead of us   and understand where that may take us   thank you
