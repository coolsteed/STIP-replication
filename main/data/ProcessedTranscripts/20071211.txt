good earli morn    laughter   i would like to start by thank the committe for the veri use discuss we had last week  although i must say that videoconfer is not the most in  format   peopl rais a number of import reserv about the taf  includ the fact that capit  perhap more than liquid  is the issu now  issu about the size of it  and concern about stigma   i think that those point are well taken and that we need to be modest in our expect about at least the initi effect of this facil   howev  as i indic last week  i think that it will perhap provid a platform for us to creat a more flexibl tool that will allow us to use our discount window facil in a more effect way as we go forward   in the near term  it has also provid a good vehicl for us to cooper with other central bank  and i would like to updat you on that now  first  the board did approv the taf on friday by notat vote  as we expect  second  we have been in communic with the whole g    about these matter and have widespread support from our colleagu for this action   in particular  i believ that you have a draft press releas that will be veri similar to what will be releas tomorrow morn   what  e is it   it   s at      a m  now
tomorrow morn at        it will be a joint releas of five central bank   the press releas will have a common first paragraph  as you see in front of you  and then each central bank will describ it own action in more detail  follow by web link to the other central bank   in particular  the european central bank will take the     billion in swap that we approv last week and will do two essenti noncompetit auction   that is  they will alloc     billion in two tranch to european bank need dollar at the price that clear the u s  taf  so they may have to ration or otherwis alloc   that is their problem  the swiss nation bank will also do a    billion one  e auction   let   s see  they are go to do an actual auction
are they   i think with a reserv price
with a reserv price is our understand
okay   at our stop out rate
the minimum bid will be one month oi
okay   so they have the same auction plan that we have  essenti   in addit  we are be join by the british  who are do two auction of  £   billion each befor year end   these are  l auction  not dollar auction  but they are in fact of the same actual size as our   an indic of the appreci of the pound   final  the canadian were alreadi plan to do some auction befor the end of the year  and they will simpli join us in announc those at the same  e   in addit  the japanes and the swede  although not plan anyth in the near term  will issu statement support our action and affirm their willing to support liquid as necessari   so i am hope   again  i think our expect should be modest   this is not a one shot deal   we will continu to tri to address these problem  but i am hope that the intern aspect of this will also be at least somewhat reassur to market   there will be  i think  a bit of disappoint today that we don   t cut the discount rate spread  but by tomorrow morn  i hope that will be resolv one way or anoth  a few peopl have ask about inform their board   i have no object to your inform your board if you wish in advanc of the announc   so long  of cours  as it is with the usual confidenti rule   what i might suggest to you to consid is that perhap a compromis between do noth and inform your whole board might be to give a call to your chairman some  today and just give a head up  if you choos   i am just indic that we have no object  to your do that  there is one piec of busi remain associ with this  which is that we have to approv the    billion swap request from the swiss nation bank   what i would propos to do is allow bill to begin his report on desk oper   subsequ to that  we can take question  either on the financi condit that bill describ  on ani of these aspect  and then i would like  along with the ratif of oper  to ask you at that  e also for a vote on the swap  so if there is no question or comment at this point  i will turn to bill
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the exhibit that you should have in front of you   over the past few month  the outlook for residenti hous has continu to darken   rise inventori and tighten credit standard have led to outright declin in home price in mani major hous market   the deterior in the subprim mortgag space continu   as shown in exhibit    delinqu and foreclosur rate for subprim mortgag continu to rise veri quick  and as befor  the degre and the pace of deterior are much wors for more recent vintag  see exhibit      but most import  the problem in residenti mortgag can no longer be thought of as a subprim or even an alt a mortgag problem   as shown in exhibit    delinqu and foreclosur rate on prime mortgag have move up sharpli in recent month   the ongo deterior in the hous market has had a number of import implic   the first import develop is that high rate collater debt oblig  cdo  tranch   includ so call super senior aaa rate tranch   are now vulner   that is becaus these tranch typic are backstop  in part  by lower rate subprim ab tranch and other mortgag relat secur product  for high rate cdo tranch to be protect against loss  it is import that the averag loss rate on the under collater stay relat low and that the correl in loss perform among the differ asset that underpin the cdo stay low   unfortun  for mani of the cdos issu in      and       these condit no longer appli   as hous has deterior  not onli have expect loss rate climb  but the correl among the asset within cdos has also move sharpli higher   this has occur becaus a grow proport of bbb rate and a rate ab tranch now appear like to suffer loss   at a    percent averag    materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     loss rate on subprim arm  mani bbb  and a rate tranch are like to surviv  there is a dispers of loss rate   say between   percent and    percent   that help keep correl low   but at a    percent loss rate  the same degre of dispers protect mani fewer tranch than befor   instead  most of these tranch will becom impair   as this occur  the correl rate will climb sharpli   the net result is that cdo tranch that were thought to be safe becom high vulner to loss   exhibit   and   illustr the sensit of cdo perform to the mortgag loan loss rate   these exhibit summar a studi by ub of a larg number of cdos brought to market in      and        exhibit   show how sensit the perform of the cdo market is to chang in under mortgag loss rate   the base case scenario assum a relat favor loss experi   for exampl  in the base case  loss for subprim mortgag are assum to be about    percent for both      and      vintag   in this case  total loss es  for mezzanin cdos are around    percent and less than   percent for high grade cdos   in the base case  the loss for the super senior tranch are trivial   but when loss es  increas    percent abov the base case  loss es  on the cdo tranch climb much more sharpli  for exampl  the averag loss for the mezzanin cdos tripl  rise six  e fa  than the rise in under loan loss  and expect loss on the super senior mezzanin cdo tranch soar   in this case  they are anticip to lose about one half of their valu   exhibit   focus on how a relat modest chang in the loss rate on the under mortgag lead to a sharp shift in the distribut of loss   in the base case  the super senior tranch of most cdos are expect to suffer no loss   howev  at the higher loss rate on the under mortgag  about half the super senior tranch are expect to lose more than half their valu   the cdo market is now fulli implic in the hous crisi   the rate agenc are now downgrad mani cdos  and the magnitud of the downgrad is often quit larg   as a result  the valu of mani cdos has fallen sharpli   this has led to     larg write down at some major financi institut and     question about the financi health of the financi guarantor that ensur some of the super senior cdo tranch and that have other exposur to the residenti mortgag market  exhibit   illustr the larg movement in two of the major financi guarantor    share price and credit default swap over the last few month   moodi   s recent indic that mbia   general perceiv as one of the stronger player   is    somewhat like    to need to rais more capit to avoid a credit rate downgrad  mbia announc ye day that they are rais    billion in equiti capit from warburg pincus   the total outstand volum of asset back commerci paper has begun to contract more rapid again  see exhibit      this contract appear relat broad base   it is not just an siv stori   the ma  liquid enhanc conduit  mlec  continu to move slowli forward  with the syndic process have just start   but the mlec is not like to be veri larg   siv asset have alreadi shrunk sharpli  and some bank have alreadi taken siv asset back on their own balanc sheet   the difficulti of the siv have affect some money market invest fund   with the state of florida   s local govern invest pool the most notabl casualti in this regard   fortun  most money market fund that have siv exposur are back by strong parent that have been will to lend support  at least up till now   the second key develop   the deterior in the perform of the broader mortgag market   has had it own set of effect on the financi sector   first  it has led to signific loan loss provis charg and mark to market loss for the two major hous gses   fanni mae and freddi mac   the result has been a sharp declin in their share price and a substanti rise in the cost of credit default swap for these institut  see exhibit      second  the mortgag insur have also been implic  with even more substanti share price declin and increas in the cost of credit default protect  see exhibit      in addit  the big thrift institut remain under pressur   ye day  for exampl  washington mutual announc larg loan loss provis and other write down and slash it common stock dividend  for commerci bank  the consequ of cdo write down and of rise mortgag and other loan loss has been even more pressur on capit ratio and on balanc sheet   also  corpor debt spread have increas mark over the past few month  see exhibit       the rise in high yield debt spread is import for bank that still have signific leverag loan exposur that they hope to distribut to the capit market   the widen in spread suggest a risk of further mark to market charg for bank for these exposur   so is there ani good news in ani of this   i would emphas four aspect that might provid some modest reassur   first  market particip know a lot more now than they did befor   thus  fear is diminish  which impli less risk of a crisi develop from this sourc   second  although there remain consider uncertainti on mani front   such as the magnitud of mortgag loss  the degre of further tighten of credit avail  and the fate of some thrift and mortgag and financi guarantor  i believ we may have final defin the broad dimens of the crisi   most of those who are like to be implic may alreadi have been identifi  with the cdo debacl the latest instal that has widen the circl of particip   the issu now seem to be shift toward sever from dimens  third  the market is resolv some aspect of the crisi on it own   for exampl  the level of siv asset has shrunk sharpli sinc august   fourth  sever major financi institut  in addit to mbia and washington mutual  have rais capit from dispar sourc   citigroup and ub are rais fund from sovereign wealth fund  e trade rais fund from a major hedg fund   fanni mae and freddi mac have rais capit through prefer stock issu   the willing of opportunist investor to make such commit may limit the balanc sheet squeez somewhat and put a floor   albeit a low one   under asset price   let me turn next to market expect about the path of short term interest rate at this meet and beyond   exhibit    show expect for the current meet  calcul from option price on feder fund rate futur   as can be seen  the probabl of a    basi point cut has climb to about    percent  and the probabl of no chang in the target feder fund rate has fallen virtual to zero   as shown in exhibit    and     expect for subsequ rate cut have increas consider sinc the octob meet  whether one look at the yield impli from feder fund futur contract or from eurodollar futur contract   look out to the end of       rate expect have fallen more than    basi point sinc the octob fomc meet   the eurodollar futur rate for decemb      impli more than     basi point of addit eas   our survey of primari dealer also show a sharp shift downward in rate expect sinc the octob fomc meet   as shown by compar exhibit    with exhibit     the averag of the dealer modal forecast for the feder fund rate target in the first quarter   the   circl in the exhibit   fell about    basi point  and the averag of the dealer modal forecast   not differ meaning from market expect at that  e period   howev  longer term  the primari dealer    forecast seem to anticip less eas than market particip   but this may reflect more the downward skew to rate expect that pull the mean below the mode rather than a more fundament differ in expect   as has been the case for sever month  there is a veri wide dispers of forecast one year ahead  with the primari dealer    modal forecast now rang from     percent to      percent   despit an expect of more aggress eas  inflat expect appear to be well anchor   exhibit    show two measur that i discuss at the octob fomc meet   the market base barclay measur of five year  five year forward inflat versus the board staff measur   as can be seen  although the gap between these two measur has remain much wider than earlier in the year   presum reflect  in part  a climb in the liquid premium for on the run nomin treasuri   both measur have move down a bit sinc the octob fomc meet   final  a veri brief discuss of the desk   s open market oper is warrant  as seen in exhibit     which show the cumul effect feder fund rate sinc the last meet  we have manag to keep the feder fund rate close to the target on averag   but it hasn   t been easi   as you can see  the rate did trade a bit soft to the target earli in the intermeet period   also  we continu to see upward pressur on the feder fund rate earli in the day   reflect a strong bid by european bank   and much greater intraday and day to day volatil than befor august   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the octob       fomc meet   i also request a vote to ratifi the swap agreement with the swiss nation bank that chairman bernank discuss earlier   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
thank you   are there question for bill on financi condit or for bill or me on the taf propos   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i have an observ  and that is  bill  that most of your present has to do with spread rather than with the absolut level of rate  although it is true that spread remain wide  the absolut level of the high qualiti rate in general has come down  i believ   prime mortgag rate are down  and it seem to me that if we look onli at spread then  of cours  our action to reduc the feder fund rate target may not show up for quit some  e   in fact  i think most peopl have the sens that spread had gotten too narrow and they may end up be elev for a long  e even as a    perman    matter  so i think it is veri import to look at the level of rate as well as the spread  and i insert the comment   and i notic you   re nod your head    yes      that the rate on high qualiti paper have in general come down   the rate on riskier paper are perhap higher than they were  let   s say  in juli
yes  i think that is correct   if you look at chart     which show corpor credit spread  you have a widen of about    basi point in invest grade corpor spread at a  e that long term   you know  ten year   treasuri note yield have come down by i think a littl larger magnitud   in contrast  in the high yield debt market  you have a widen of spread of     basi point just in the last month and a half or two month  which is much more dramat than ani declin that we have seen in treasuri rate
thank you  mr  chairman   i ask the staff to put togeth a tabl   the tabl iii t   that we get in the  book   and compar rate with august     it turn out that all the rate are about the same as they were on august   for the bond yield  and equiti price are essenti unchang  mayb down or up   actual up   just a tick   so i would say that the    basi point of eas we did and the addit     that the market has price in sinc august   have had no effect on the cost of long term credit to corpor
i think it is probabl worth observ that the spread probabl also are correl with nonpric term   so it may not be an exact neutral chang  presid
bill  we talk a bit about this on the phone ye day  but on the four relat op ist point that you mention  the fourth point  which is what i call the substitut of capit  we are see new sourc   one of them is measur  which is the gic in singapor   but do we have ani sens of the dimens that is avail for substitut  and is there a way to get a better sens of measur   i just want to prefac this by say that we went through the petrodollar issu in        some of us were veri involv in that exercis  it is a much more sophist busi right now  and we have much more sophist investor   what we don   t know   or i don   t know and i would be curious whether we know at the new york desk   is how big this money is and how much is avail to be tap
well  i guess i would say two thing   i think you are absolut right that the sovereign wealth fund are of signific size and are grow rapid   but i think that you realli have to distinguish between the equiti side and the debt side of thing   the commit that you are see from the sovereign wealth fund seem to be equiti invest  and they are equiti invest that have occur onli after share price fell veri sharpli   if you look at debt spread in the unit state  debt spread in europ  and debt spread throughout the world  they have widen   so it  sn   t look as though the sovereign wealth fund money is provid much help for that sector   it would be surpris if it were big enough  given the constraint on bank balanc sheet global  that they could come in and fill the gap   so i think  on the equiti side  the sovereign wealth fund are pretti import   they are provid some floor on equiti price  but onli after the equiti price of some of these financi firm have gone down veri signific in valu
nonetheless  they can restor tier   capit  as we saw in the case of ub  i mean  that is how market work
yes   it is a good develop that we are actual final see bank rais capit   i don   t think you were see that until last month   i would say that there was stigma associ with rais capit  and then thing got progress wors  so bank were just forc to rais capit despit the stigma associ with it
well  i want to thank you for at least rais four ray of dim sunlight
we tri for balanc
thank you  mr  chairman   bill  the troubl with the mortgag insur has been a develop sinc our last meet  and i am curious   do they have the capabl for rais capit   will rais capit correct or help them get their rate back to aaa  or is it more complic than that   i have read some concern about the effect  for exampl  on municip market if the guarantor cannot in fact maintain their rate   so do you have some insight into their abil to rais capit and correct the potenti for a downgrad
the risk to the municip market is realli through the financi guarantor  not so much the mortgag insur   the fact that mbia was abl to rais    billion of equiti capit ye day for  i think  about one seventh of their book valu   so it is a fair larg capit commit relat to the size of the compani   is an import develop  you saw that mbia stock ye day rose more than    percent becaus it basic was a confirm  at least in the mind of some peopl in the market  that mbia was a viabl busi and that someon was will to put    billion of new capit in   i think that was reassur to the market   general  the peopl i have talk with suggest that the barrier to entri into those busi are pretti high   the second thing that is happen is  obvious  as you see this distress  their price power on new busi is actual improv   that would suggest that there is a reason chanc that these firm will be recapit  but it depend on how far down the path they are toward serious problem
just a quick comment   i have talk to one of the larg mortgag insur compani in some detail  and their view is that their price power actual is improv   that their own abil to work their way out of this thing is get better all the  e right now   even though they are take some veri larg hit in the near term  their outlook actual has improv in recent month  part becaus of this   this was just to reinforc that point
other question for bill   if not  we need to vote to ratifi domest oper
without object   okay   we also need a vote on the swiss request for a currenc swap
ani commentari   presid pool
i vote against the swap for the same reason that i did befor  which i would like to amplifi  if i may  just for a moment
whi don   t you make your comment  and then we will take a roll call vote
okay   as i said in our confer call  foreign central bank have ampl amount of reserv   the swap is  therefor  in my view not necessari   i would like to make one other observ   in the past  the swap have been most often use in conjunct with oper to interven in the foreign exchang market   i worri that we may get a reaction in the market  given the concern in europ about the valu of the dollar  that would say that this is a precursor to some sort of coordin intervent in the foreign exchang market   i would be veri oppos to the intervent  i think it would upset thing quit substanti  and i would worri that the market concern that there might be intervent come would upset the situat on this announc   so those are my concern and whi i vote against
thank you   we will  of cours  announc a swap in the context of our plan to address money market issu   with respect to the issu of their reserv  i think there are two reason for have the swap   one is that for technic reason it is easier for them to segreg their foreign exchang reserv from the money they would use in this auction  they felt it was bureaucrat easier for them to do it this way   second  this obvious give us   which is veri import for our monetari control   sort of a clear marker in term of what the size of this oper will be  and so on   but your point are well taken   ani other comment   if not     could you pleas read the resolut
the feder open market committe direct the feder reserv bank of new york to establish and maintain a reciproc currenc arrang for the system open market account with the swiss nation bank in an amount not to exceed    billion   the committe author associ draw on the arrang up to the full amount of    billion  the swap arrang shall be for a period of up to     day  unless extend by the committe     chairman bernank vice chairman    presid   presid hoenig  governor kohn  governor   governor    presid pool  presid   governor              yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no yes yes
all right   thank you   let us turn now to the econom situat and dave
thank you  mr  chairman   we had a great deal to contend with over the intermeet period  and the forecast has chang in some import way   nevertheless  the basic stori under our project remain larg unchang   the fallout from the slump in the hous sector  the ongo turbul in financi market  and elev energi price result in subpar growth over the next sever quarter   with some further eas of monetari polici  a level off of oil price  and a gradual improv of financi condit  growth pick back up toward potenti in        the gap in resourc util that open up over the next sever quarter  in combin with the anticip flatten out of energi price  put total and core inflat on a mild downtrend over the longer haul   overal  our forecast could admit be read as still paint a pretti benign pictur   despit all the financi turmoil  the economi avoid recess and  even with steepli higher price for food and energi and a lower exchang valu of the dollar  we achiev some modest edg off of inflat   so i tri not to take it person when i receiv a notic the other day that the board had approv more frequent drug test for certain member of the senior staff  myself includ   laughter   i can assur you  howev  that the staff is not go to fall back on the increas popular celebr excus that we were under the influenc of mind alter chemic and thus should not be held respons for this forecast   no  we came up with this project unimpair and on noth stronger than mani late night of diet pepsi and vend machin twinki   while our basic stori hasn   t chang much  the event of the past six week have result in a consider darken of our outlook for activ over the next year   in particular  the incom data have been weaker than expect  the project path of household net worth has been revis down owe to lower price for both equiti and hous  oil price averag about    per barrel higher than in our previous forecast  and the brief improv in financi condit that we experienc in septemb and octob has been revers in recent week   as a consequ  we now project that real gdp will be about flat in the current quarter after have increas at an annual rate of   percent in the third quarter   although the sharp swing in activ from the third to the fourth quarter is exagger by some wide fluctuat in inventori invest  we are read the incom data as suggest that there has been a greater downshift in the under pace of growth than we had previous anticip   furthermor  we expect activ to remain sluggish next year  grow    percent  near    percentag point less than in our octob project  in       real gdp is project to grow at a     percent pace  a touch below our previous forecast   most of the disappoint news that we have receiv over the past six week has center on the household sector  most especi on residenti construct   singl famili hous start came in a bit below expect  and permit plung  suggest some further intensif of the declin in construct activ in the month immedi ahead   moreov  substanti downward revis to es  of new home sale for earlier month indic that hous demand has been weaker than we previous thought   meanwhil  condit in mortgag market have deterior further and appear like to remain impair longer than we had project in octob   nonprim market remain moribund  spread on jumbo mortgag have widen further  and spread on conform mortgag to treasuri have increas   these develop along with the weaker incom data on sale and start led us to mark down our hous forecast onc again   we now expect that sale and start will post a further drop of near    percent by earli next year  moreov  we have delay our project recoveri in start until        as a consequ  the contract in residenti invest is now expect to subtract over    percentag point from the growth of real gdp next year  about   percentag point more than in our octob project   in addit to these softer read on hous activ  the incom data on consum spend also have surpris us to the downsid   real outlay are now es  to have been near flat between august and octob  rather than increas modest as had earlier appear to be the case   that subdu pace seem consist with the slump in consum sen ent that has follow in the wake of the increas financi turbul   we now project that real pce increas at a    percent pace in the current quarter    percentag point less than in the octob  book   i don   t want to overst the strength of our case that a notic slow in consum spend is under way   light motor vehicl sale ran at a      million unit pace in novemb  an observ that creat a bit of tension with the survey report of bum out consum   moreov  it wouldn   t take much more than a few modest upward revis to earlier month or a pop in spend in decemb to undermin this part of our stori   that said  the pictur  sn   t seem like to us to brighten much soon   the recent jump in oil price  coupl with a restor of current narrow gasolin margin  point to steep increas in retail energi price that will take a bite out of the purchas power of household incom and further restrain overal consum spend in come month   furthermor  with the lower level of the stock market and a downward revis to our hous price forecast  household net worth is expect to exert more of a drag on consum spend over the next two year than in our previous forecast   while we don   t expect a dramat shift  we are anticip that household will face tighter standard and more expens term for consum credit   all told  we are project real pce to increas     percent in       about   percentag point less than in our octob project   in contrast to the almost uniform weaker than expect data on the household sector  the inform that we have receiv on busi spend has been more mix   invest in high tech equip has been well below our expect  especi for communic equip   that observ squar with some report we have heard that order for high tech gear from financi institut have fallen off   other equip spend has come in close to our expect  with the recent data on order and shipment consist with our project for some modest slow in capit spend   the data also have been mix for nonresidenti structur   as i note at the last meet  the gdp data for the third quarter point to stronger drill activ than we had earlier anticip  and we have revis up our project for this categori in respons to both the incom data and the higher project path for energi price   for nonresidenti build  the octob data for construct put in place were a bit below our expect  and we have lower our near term project of activ in this sector   beyond the near term  we have reduc our forecast for both equip spend and nonresidenti invest   most of that revis reflect an expect endogen respons of invest to the slower growth of final sale and busi output in this project   but we also have made some small allow for what we expect to be less favor financ condit and greater uncertainti over the next year   taken as a whole  the spend data have clear fallen short of our expect  it might appear that  like the spend data  last week   s labor market report was also a downsid surpris for us  after all  we note in the  book that we had pencil in an increas of         for privat payrol in novemb   howev  we did that onli grudg after see the adp survey last wednesday morn  and basic we did not allow that chang to alter ani other import aspect of our forecast   in fact  the payrol employ figur are slight stronger than we expect at the  e of the octob  book   inde  i still see the general firm condit in labor market as suggest some upsid risk to our view that the economi is in the process of slow sharpli   let me now turn to the inflat forecast   total pce price are project to increas at an annual rate of     percent in the current quarter  about   percentag point abov our previous forecast   most of that revis reflect higher retail energi price   but we have also rais our project of core pce price for the third and fourth quarter by   percentag point   that adjust result from the upward revis made by the bea to nonmarket price in earlier month   as you know  we had been consist surpris by the mild increas in nonmarket price that had been report sinc the spring   as a concess to those persist error  a coupl of forecast round ago  we push off the reacceler of those price into        well  we should have stuck with our earlier stori becaus the revis data now show that those price pick back up in late summer and earli fall   our slight upward revis to core pce price in       from     to     percent  reflect the indirect effect of the higher oil price in this project   we continu to believ that the pass through of energi price is small  but not zero   the other major influenc on our price project have remain relat tame   although the exchang valu of the dollar has fallen a bit  global price for non oil commod have revis down as well  leav the forecast for core non oil import price rough unchang   increas in labor compens remain subdu   and taken as a whole  read on inflat expect have not chang much   the michigan survey measur of inflat expect are up some  the survey of profession forecast was flat  and inflat compens as infer from tip has edg down slight   with some slack emerg in labor and product market in the second half of next year and with energi and import price project to deceler  we are forecast a slight drop in core price inflat from it project pace of   percent this year and next to     percent in        in contempl our forecast  you might be concern that our relat benign muddl through scenario is increas look like the averag of two consider less benign outcom   one in which the economi prove consider more resili  growth bounc back more quick  and inflat pick up by more than we are project and anoth in which we drop below stall speed and the economi experi outright recess   while i would readili acknowledg those risk  i still see someth like our forecast as the more plausibl outcom at this point   at the septemb meet  i quot from the  book of march       in which we had rais the white flag of surrend on our stori that the financi turbul of the autumn of      would signific restrain the growth of the economi   we could be make that mistak again  but it seem less like to me now   in particular  one import featur of the episod of the late     s was that we were almost immedi fight the incom data  much of which came in well abov our expect over the final month of      and earli        by contrast  as i have note today  the recent data seem to be line up comfort with our project of slower growth ahead   i also note in septemb the possibl that we could be face a situat similar to the fall of       when we were forecast a period of muddl through but were  in fact  on the brink of a mild recess   again  this possibl certain can   t be rule out   but here  as well  there are some noteworthi differ from that earlier episod   in particular  through the fall of       we were receiv increas grim stori  especi from manufactur  about the dismal state of order book and a sharp shift in busi psycholog   at the  e  we didn   t have the convict to embrac those anecdot given the strength of the offici data  i   ll be interest to hear your report today  but my sens is that the anecdot from busi  while mix  are not sharpli at varianc with the data at present   both seem to be point to slower growth but not to a serious retrench in activ  for these reason  we are inclin to stick with our muddl through stori for now  nathan will continu our present
our read of the recent data suggest that econom activ abroad deceler toward the end of the third quarter and has remain on a deceler path thereaft   in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada  this soften of activ appear to reflect   at least in part   increas drag from the ongo financi turmoil   notabl  in the euro area  busi and consum confid have weaken some in recent month  pmis for

these move are relat mild when view from a longer term perspect   all told  foreign growth is project to step down from an averag rate of near     percent dure the first three quarter of this year to

growth  as well as the softer pace of activ in the unit state   thereaft  we see foreign growth rise back to a rate of    percent   this outlook is weaker over the next few quarter than in our octob project  in line with the lower u s  forecast   in addit  given the renew market turbul  we now see the drag from financi develop as like to be larger and more protract than we had previous assum   we continu to believ that these effect will be felt main in the advanc economi  but an import downsid risk to our forecast is the possibl that the emerg market economi may be more affect than we now

thank you veri much   are there question   presid
actual  mr  chairman  i have a statement disguis as a question   laughter   i am glad on the intern side that we rais the issu of food price inflat  not becaus it is on the cover of the economist but becaus we discuss it at our last meet  what is curious to me     is that there is onli one line on page    of the  book   it say     at the same  e  agricultur produc are expect to step up output of farm product  and that should help bring consum food price inflat more in line with core inflat      my statement is that  given our communic exercis  we are draw more attent to headlin pce   my question is  do i understand it correct that the food weight in the pce is twice that of energi and in the cpi is      e that of energi   therefor  whi are we not talk about food price inflat as it affect headlin inflat number  and whi do we spend so much  e on energi relat to food   that is my question   or are we just not worri about food   the second question   by the way  on the intern side  as well as the domest side   is  what is the basi for our op  that food price will come down against the background of the demand that you have describ on the intern side   thank you
food is import   in fact  we devot  i would imagin  a surpris amount of resourc to it   we have an agricultur economist whose job is to follow those develop and report on them   it is his view   and base on both the futur price and some of the model that we have done   that we will see a deceler go forward in retail food price   as you know  futur price basic are project a flatten out   i assum that is part of what is in nathan   s forecast as well   we are not tri to outguess the market in that regard  and the report that we have receiv on agricultur product look relat favor for the come year   now  most of that is a bit of winter wheat at this point and not much more in term of product  although we have seen some signific rebuild of both flock and livestock herd that suggest that we are on the right track in term of an output respons to the higher price that we have seen in the past year   market are tight  and i think there probabl is some asymmetri in the risk surround the food price forecast  in that it is easier to see some possibl of stock out problem if there is ani shortfal in product over the come year  than that there would be some massiv boom in agricultur product that will depress price sharpli   but i do think   and in the  book part   quit often  especi in the autumn  when we are actual do a more care account of the harvest   we devot a fair amount of attent to resourc to it   we can certain do even more go forward
just to underscor what dave has said  our forecast is driven larg from the quot from futur market   so  realli  the question boil down to  whi in the world do the futur market expect the price of these foodstuff to declin   i think a key factor is that there are some import temporari develop that have driven up food price   there have been advers weather condit in a number of asian economi   for exampl  in china  they had flood earlier this year that have signific driven up veget price   in addit  there has been a sustain drought in australia that has driven up wheat price signific   it has been sever year that we have seen these drought condit in australia   it is an open issu as to whether that goe away in      or       but the expect is that at some point that is go to abat somewhat  so we can point to temporari factor   there has also been a signific imprint on the food price of a move to ethanol in the unit state  and that has driven up the price of corn   at the same  e  some acreag that had been in soybean has shift to corn  and that has reduc the suppli of soybean and driven up that price as well   but it is our view and i think the view of the futur market that over  e you are go to see some of these effect balanc out  and the acreag product will be distribut in a way that will help bring these price down   in addit  you could get more acr brought into product of these foodstuff  the final point that i want to emphas here is that there are also some import structur factor that are drive up food price  two that i think are worth mention   one is that you have a lot of peopl in these emerg market economi who are a lot wealthier than they were ten year ago  and they want to eat better  and the world is go to have to find a way to produc more and higher qualiti agricultur good   it is imagin that there will be some upward pressur on price through that transit   the second import factor that i think is structur is we have seen a sustain and now an appar perman increas in the price of oil   it take a lot of petroleum to produc these good  so that is a longer run factor that may contribut to higher agricultur price
thank you for your thorough answer
thank   dave  i have two question  i suppos   the first one is that the  book gdp forecast has come down a good bit sinc octob   at the same  e  the  book consist short run equilibrium real fund rate was revis down   percentag point   how much independ inform is there between these two observ   i mean  the equilibrium real fund rate is the rate which  if maintain for some period of  e  would get us back up to potenti growth   so the fact that you have mark that down suggest that you would have a lower real rate   the second question is this   we were expect the economi to slow dure the current period   expect of slow versus slow that is reveal in the data are veri import for how we think about the outlook   mayb you said this  but i don   t recal it   could you give me an idea of how in the  book your assumpt have evolv sinc octob with regard to prospect loss due to mortgag foreclosur and the write down that the bank are expect to take or have announc on this   do you have some number in mind on how thing have chang in that regard and how that might be influenc your hous outlook   thank you
in respons to your first question about whether there is independ inform in that es  of the equilibrium fund rate for the  book consist measur  the answer is that there is no independ inform   it   s just a transform of the revis in the gdp outlook into interest rate space   now  obvious  we provid a few other measur in that tabl  some base on a larg scale econometr model and some on smaller scale model   those have come down  too   so i don   t think our forecast is do someth differ from  well  what those other model suggest   in respons to your second question  our forecast of hous activ go forward is not driven by the foreclosur   the foreclosur forecast that we have is driven import by the hous price develop  and there we have mark down our hous price forecast   we would expect some increas in foreclosur  and obvious that would have some feedback on overal lend and condit of bank balanc sheet  in general  sinc the octob forecast  we have built in more broad about   percentag point to the level of gdp in addit restraint on spend come from the increas overal financi turmoil   not just in the hous market  but we   ve taken down a littl our forecast of consumpt and our forecast of busi fix invest too   basic  look at the past correl between measur of overal financi stress and the residu of our spend equat  there   s consider correl there   that is  our standard model  as i note in the past  have veri rudimentari financi transmiss mechan in them   most a few interest rate  a few asset price  hous  equiti  and the exchang rate   in the past  period when we   ve seen signific increas in financi stress have also been associ with signific shortfal in spend  and we   ve tri as best we can to build that in   most of that effect overal is in hous   over half of it   but some of it we think will spill over elsewher   those bank balanc sheet are go to be impair   we think there will be some restraint on lend go forward   but  boy  it   s a lot of guess work   on the hous side  i do think we can go through more care calcul of the implic of the shutdown of the nonprim market and the current impair in the jumbo market  but beyond that  i   d say we   re veri loos calibr it
dave  i want to lump togeth all the various form of financi distress here   the mortgag market  auto loan  credit card loan  and mayb even busi failur   if my memori serv correct  and it may well not   if we look at the histori of busi cycl fluctuat  all those differ form of financi distress rise after a busi cycl peak when we have increas in unemploy and actual declin in gdp   assum that we are not after a busi cycl peak right now  it appear that we have a great deal of financi distress ahead of   i   m hope it remain ahead of   a busi cycl peak   so this is a veri atyp situat in the context of u s  busi cycl histori
i don   t actual know in term of the lag between financi stress and activ   they look veri contemporan in mani case  and in some case  obvious  they are past lead indic of econom activ  such as the stock watson index  which ul  didn   t work all that great  but for a while it look as though various qualiti spread and term spread had some lead indic valu   so i   m not total sure about whether or not this look incred unusu in that the stress might have increas
i   m talk particular about the delinqu  foreclosur  and busi failur becaus i think that they usual occur on the way down dure the contract phase of the busi cycl and ordinarili those measur look their best close to a busi cycl peak   that   s what i rememb  but i haven   t gone back and review it  but from just my memori of look at a lot of busi cycl data over the year   that would say that  if my observ is correct  this is quit an unusu situat   unless of cours we are past the peak or right at the peak
this is obvious a situat in which  in some sens  the financi stress is the shock to the system rather than the endogen respons to some other shock  either an aggress tighten of polici or some other type of aggreg demand shock   so in that sens this particular configur  i think  sort of fit with the situat we   re current face   obvious we   re not forecast a busi cycl peak   so in our forecast  we   re not yet say that we   re on the downsid of a busi cycl   we have a growth recess in this forecast and noth more than that   if we were to get a true cyclic downturn  i think you could obvious expect that to have some veri consider effect on foreclosur  busi failur  and so forth  that channel or mechan would amplifi the downturn in this particular episod
presid  n
dave  i   m have difficulti reconcil the employ and hour data for the current quarter with your forecast of no growth whatsoev   it seem to me that  even if domest final demand  sn   t grow or grow littl  we still have inventori and export that could take up whatev output turn out to be  and we don   t know veri much about those two compon for the current quarter  if i understand the situat right   altern  obvious you can get a veri bad product number  and that would squar the circl   but i   m wonder what we know in particular about inventori and export that would lead us to someth as weak as this forecast
in the forecast  in fact  we do squar the labor market with our forecast of weak gdp with basic flat labor product   now  that   s come on the heel of a quarter in which we had a   percent increas in nonfarm busi labor product   that   s a huge gap  and i don   t think in some sens that the level of product that we   re forecast here is at all at odd with the basic trend that we   ve been see   now  when you ask me what we know about inventori and net export  i   ll let nathan speak to the net export side of thing   on inventori we know virtual noth at this point  and this forecast is actual predic on non motor vehicl inventori invest step up   we have some offset in some sens built into this forecast on the non motor vehicl side  that there will be some  we think  unintend accumul of inventori in the fourth quarter   obvious the standard error around our forecast is veri larg  and it includ much higher number on inventori  which if that were to be the case  would obvious not bode well for activ go forward becaus we certain don   t see inventori current as so lean that they need to be rebuilt   as i indic on the final sale side  at this point we do have  i think  enough data in hand to make us pretti comfort with the notion that there   s go to be a consider slow in final demand in the current quarter   nathan  do you want to say anyth
yes  just to echo what dave said  we have veri littl hard data so far  essenti no hard data for net export for q    we will be receiv the octob trade data later this week   so at that point we   ll start get a bit more insight into it   that said  we see the contribut from net export fall off from a substanti     percentag point in q  to just a touch abov     in q   and that   s driven by a moder in export growth and continu   percent import growth   but obvious there   s a lot of uncertainti around those project
thank you  mr  chairman   i have sort of a longer run question that i   d like to pose   i was look at the altern scenario in the  book  and one of the thing that i was look at was the fund rate path that was describ as the market base forecast for the fund rate   it drop almost     basi point  or     plus basi point  between now and the middl or end of next year   one consequ of that  though  seem pretti benign   that there   s not much chang in the inflat forecast at least through       it chang onli about     percentag point   and there are some posit effect on output  particular in         it appear  at least within this period  that     basi point rate cut seem to be pretti much free   so i guess my question to the staff is  is there a price to be paid for that  and if i run the forecast out beyond       will ani of those price or those consequ appear in the forecast for inflat   if so  how long would i have to look befor i saw them in the model
i don   t think you   d need to look much farther than the horizon that we   re show here to see that  in the context of the staff   s view about activ  that path for the fed fund rate would probabl not be sustain becaus in some sens our is curv is consider stronger than the market   s current   if it make you feel a littl better  we are plan on incorpor the extend forecast into the  book next  e  and we want to take these altern scenario and push them out becaus we recogn that one of the weak in the relat short period that we have here is that much of the interest action in these often take place just beyond the  e frame that we   re show   so i think that will help
i appreci that   that would be veri help to put in some perspect what tradeoff in the cost we might see   thank you
we should make some progress there
thank you   my first question is an extens of presid     s question   dave  there are two thing to your monetari polici assumpt in the  book   one is that you lower the path    basi point over the forecast period  but the way you did it was sort of interest   you did    now  and you did the rest just at the point where i think in your forecast the economi is come back up toward trend growth   can you say a littl about the shape of that path
yes   in some sens that reduct in the middl of      goe back to presid     s point   we   re tri to get on track so that when we actual show the extend  book  we have been follow  rough speak  the op  control simul on a    percent inflat target   the    basi point up front is in some sens deal with the current weak in overal activ   the    basi point in      realli reflect the fact that  at that point  inflat is come down a littl and you   ve open up an output gap   you have an unemploy rate at   percent  and you can start a process then  accord to that op  control  of lower the real fund rate to encourag growth to move abov potenti and eventu reduc the unemploy rate back toward the nairu   i recogn it   s go to be a cosmet   i mean  not a cosmet but a small analyt wrinkl   that might be more confus than enlighten   but  as you know  in the  book extens memo that we circul  we do see the fed fund rate come down to   percent or below in the extend  book part   so it realli is more to tri to s ul growth to abov potenti onc you have inflat move down
may i ask one follow up question   in the note for the board that you circul on monday  dave  you said that the magnitud of the credit crunch you   re contempl is rough compar to the unusu weak of privat spend seen dure the headwind episod of the earli     s   so i was curious   it is sort of interest becaus you think that capit at bank go into this period is much stronger than go into the           period  corpor balanc sheet  base just on the crude leverag ratio  are much healthier today than they were then   on the other hand  bank are a smaller share of the financi system  and you could say that the nonbank part look kind of weak   the fhlb is grow veri dramat  take up a fair amount of the room left by the shrink of the nonbank sector   i don   t know   gses have less room to grow   it   s sort of mix   it   s complic   i was curious about how you thought about the comparison   you didn   t seem to like the comparison
so the headwind of the           period   that was a calibr we use for the    credit crunch    scenario in the  book
oh  it   s just the altern scenario   i misunderstood  i   m sorri
in our baselin forecast  we don   t have what i would call a real credit crunch   we have some tighten of term and standard in a period of financi stress that we think will depress spend   but if you   re realli think that we are on the verg of someth that look more like the           period  then i think that credit crunch scenario give you a better sens of the dimens of the demand shock   now  as we discuss at the board meet ye day  and governor   suggest  we might want to think about elong that particular shock   we pile a big shock into a relat short  e  and certain anoth reason altern   if you were in a situat like that   would be that you would face a longer period of weak demand but not necessarili that sort of recessionari type of scenario that we show there
other question   presid
as i was look at the altern simul and the credit crunch scenario and tri to make sens of what financi market are think about in term of the expect fed fund rate path  it seem as though you need that credit crunch scenario to get to that type of path  and that   s not where you are   then there are also other scenario that are slight stronger  which i think are in line with more blue chip type of forecast  too   so there realli is a disconnect in a lot of this
well  i think  as we show in the altern scenario  someth like either the credit crunch or the greater hous correct scenario   in the real world obvious wouldn   t necessarili be shock that would be independ of each other   but either one of those two scenario is construct to produc someth that look similar to what the market might be think   and we don   t think those scenario are unreason
all right   presid hoenig
in listen to this  i have a question   as you are look at and project forward  we   re talk about a fed fund rate path that come down  and yet we   ve talk a great deal about inflat rise temporarili in some view   the question i have is    it give you paus   how do you analyz the risk that you are lower rate in an environ of rise inflat on a global basi   do you have ani concern about the risk   are you reevalu the risk of how stabl inflationari expect might be in that scenario
obvious in our baselin forecast we don   t realli have a pickup of inflat  even headlin inflat  beyond the veri near term   so we do think that  in the next quarter or two  we   re go to be look at some pretti larg headlin number that will be reflect the jump in energi price and some linger increas in food price
right  and you   re say the slowdown in the economi make that temporari
the slowdown in the economi help in the sens that we do think open up an output gap is go to limit and eventu bring down some of those inflat pressur   in term of the risk surround the forecast  i think an import element in the baselin forecast is that take on futur market for both energi and food   and those market are expect almost an immedi flatten out and even oil price come down just a bit   is probabl more import in some sens over the next year or so in term of reliev inflat pressur   certain our experi in the past sever year is that we don   t know ani better way to do it   it   s not as though the futur market have done a great job for us  they   ve alway been forecast that thing were go to be flatten out right around the corner   so if you were skeptic about whether that was go to occur  you might be concern about whether or not you could experi some continu upsid surpris there   now  we   ve been encourag in look at inflat expect  becaus we haven   t yet seen ani realli broad base deterior  and we think thing have to date been reason well contain   in our forecast  that continu   this forecast   not assum that there will be ani deterior of inflat expect go forward  if we saw that  it would be at odd with what we   re see now and would probabl lead us to revis up the forecast
okay   let   s begin our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   at the  e of our last meet  i held out hope that the financi turmoil would gradual ebb and the economi might escap without serious damag   subsequ develop have sever shaken that belief   the bad news sinc our last meet has grown steadier and louder  as strain in financi market have resurfac and intensifi and as the economi has shown clear sign of falter   in addit  the downsid threat to growth that then seem to be tail event now appear to be much closer to the center of the distribut   i found littl to consol me in the  book   like the board staff  i have signific mark down my growth forecast   the possibl of a credit crunch develop and of the economi slip into a recess seem all too real  condit in financi market have worsen   rate on a wide array of loan and secur have increas signific sinc our last meet  includ those on term commerci paper  term libor  prime jumbo mortgag  and high yield corpor bond   cds spread from major financi institut with signific

have all move up  reflect the greater uncertainti about the economi   s direct  the most recent data on spend have been discourag as well   data on hous sale  price  and construct have been downbeat  and foreclosur on subprim loan have move even higher   even with effort such as those facilit by the administr to freez subprim rate  foreclosur look to rise sharpli next year  which may dump a larg number of hous on a market alreadi swamp with suppli   this will exacerb the downward pressur on hous price and new home construct from alreadi elev home inventori   inde  the ten citi case shiller home price index has declin more than   percent over the past year through septemb  and futur contract point to anoth sizabl declin over the next twelv month  i am particular concern that we may now be see the first sign of spillov from the hous and financi sector to the broader economi   although the job market has remain reason healthi so far  real consum spend in septemb and octob was dead in the water  and household are grow more pessimist about futur prospect   the decemb read of consum sen ent show anoth declin  and the cumul falloff in this measur is becom alarm   gain in dispos incom have been weaken   with consum sen ent in the doldrum  hous price on the skid  and energi price on the rise  consum spend look to be quit subdu for some  e   this view is echo by the ceo of a nation high end cloth retail on our board  who recent emphas to us that the posit chain store sale data in novemb were in fact artifici boost by the thanksgiv calendar shift and that the under trend for his busi has worsen notabl  my modal forecast forese the economi bare manag to avoid recess  with growth essenti zero this quarter and about   percent next quarter   i expect growth to remain below potenti throughout next year  caus the unemploy rate to rise to about   percent  much like in the  book   this forecast assum a    basi point declin in the feder fund rate in the near futur  place the real fund rate near the center of the rang of es  of the neutral rate report in the bluebook   i should emphas that i do not place a lot of confid in this forecast  and  in particular  i fear that we are in danger of slide into a credit crunch  such an outcom is illustr by the credit crunch altern simul in the  book  although i don   t forese condit in the bank sector get as bleak as dure the credit crunch of the earli     s  the parallel to those event are strike   back then  we saw a larg number of bank failur in the contract of the save and loan sector   in the current situat  most bank are still in pretti good shape   instead  it is the shadow bank sector   that is  the set of market in which a varieti of securit asset are financ by the issuanc of commerci paper   that is where the failur have occur   this sector is all but shut for new busi  but bank capit is also an issu   until the securit of nonconform mortgag lend reemerg  financ will depend on the willing and abil of bank  thrift  and the gses to step in to fill the breach   to the extent they do  that will put further pressur on their capit  which is alreadi under some pressur from write down on exist loan and hold of asset   bank are show increas concern that their capit ratio will becom bind and are tighten credit term and condit   sever develop suggest to me that this situat could worsen   in addit to the problem plagu the adjust rate subprim mortgag  delinqu have recent start to move up more broad   on credit card and auto loan  adjust rate prime mortgag  and fix rate subprim mortgag   my contact at larg district bank tell me that  becaus the economi continu to be reason healthi and peopl have job  thing are still under control   but if hous price and the stock market fall further and the economi appear to be weaken  then they will further tighten the lend condit and term on consum loan to avoid problem down the road  and these fear could be self fulfil   if bank onli partial replac the collaps shadow bank or  wors  if they cut back their lend in anticip of a worsen economi  then the result credit crunch could push us into recess   this possibl is presum increas reflect in cds and low grade corpor bond spread   thus  the risk of recess no longer seem remot  especi sinc the economi may well alreadi have begun contract in the current quarter  inde  the decemb blue chip consensus put the odd of a recess at about    percent  this es  is within the rang of recess probabl comput by my staff use model base on the yield curv and other variabl  turn to inflat  data on the core measur continu to be favor   wage growth remain moder  and the recent downward revis to hour compens have reliev some worri there   inflat expect remain contain   as i mention  i expect some labor market slack to develop  and this should offset ani  in my view  modest inflationari pressur from past increas in energi and import price and help keep core pce price inflat below   percent   continu increas in energi and import price pose some upsid risk to the inflat outlook  but there are also downsid risk to inflat associ with a weaken economi and rise unemploy  to sum up  i believ that the most like outcom is for the economi to slow signific in the near term  flirt with recess  and i view the risk to that scenario as be weight signific to the downsid   in contrast  i expect inflat to remain well contain  and i view those risk as fair balanc

thank you  mr  chairman   just befor the meet i learn someth about how we select the order   there are a bunch of us sit with    and most peopl seem to want to go toward the end     appar has been in touch with too mani econometrician becaus she said it is    overdetermin      laughter   anyway  here i am  let me start with some of the anecdot report   it is pretti clear that the anecdot report that i am get from larg nation firm on the good side of the economi are come in on the soft side   the holiday season  accord to up  is come in about   percentag point below project  and up and fedex are revis down somewhat their longer term project and their capit spend plan   my fedex contact said that the less than truckload busi is  in his term  piti   my contact with a larg truck compani  j b hunt  said that the compani is cut it capac   it volum is down    percent from a year ago   the compani has reduc capac    percent over the past twelv month and will cut anoth    percent   that is  after all  a full one quarter cut in capac of that compani   hunt is sell it truck   mani of them are go to russia  interest enough   perhap the onli good news from this compani is that driver are plenti avail  which has not been so true in the past  in the quick serv restaur busi  there is a ray of hope   the project is that food price will increas much more modest than they have been do this year  but they said that most peopl in the restaur busi are pessimist   on the other hand  a larg softwar compani report that it is op ist   the sale of pcs are good  game devic and softwar are do well  and cap ex plan are substanti   noth be cut back there   a contact with a larg money center bank said that the bank   s analysi of it consum credit card busi indic that the increas in thirti day delinqu is entir explain by what is go on in florida  california  and nevada  and delinqu in the rest of the countri are about unchang  a general comment on the busi outlook   we have a lot of specif news   and certain   talk about some of that   that is pretti negat   i have an inher op  about the economi  which is hard to put ani real flesh on the bone i guess  but i think that the economi in the longer run is inher strong and resili   a lot of the adjust in the credit market i believ are under way   we see it with a lot of the recapit that are take place and the initi shock back in juli and august   there are a lot of smart peopl with sharp pencil who are dig into their situat  decid what to write off  and then get on with thing  and they are past the initi scrambl   so those thing togeth give me some sens of op    i would also note that  although mani household are certain stress  there   seem to be a lot of discretionari spend take place   consum electron  for exampl  are pretti strong   there was an articl in the newspap note that the hot item this christma season are gps navig devic   to add one of these to your car hard seem to be an essenti expenditur   comput game are anoth exampl

i bought my gps a long  e ago  and i don   t play comput game   but at ani rate  flat panel tvs  a lot of stuff like that  suggest that mani household are not on the edg of be high stress   so i don   t know where to come out on this   i guess that my outlook has more varianc to it than usual  and it seem to me that  when we get to the polici discuss  what we need to do is to find a way to react prompt to the surpris that i think are inevit ahead of us   thank you
is the sale of a use truck to russia an export or a capit inflow    laughter   think about that one
well  it is not current product  so it is not an export
no  i understand   let   s see   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the fifth district appear to be general sound but with some notabl area of weak   our survey read on the servic firm indic continu moder growth in novemb  and our index of manufactur activ gain a few point follow a sharp declin in octob  though it remain in neutral territori   a number of our contact report that the weaker dollar is provid a boost to manufactur export  and i have notic a definit increas in the number of coal train rumbl by my offic on their way from west virginia to port   on the other hand  our merchant contact were much less op ist about their sale prospect go into the holiday season   our retail sale survey indic slid anoth   point  pull down by signific declin in big ticket sale and shopper traffic compon   district hous market continu to weaken overal  with distinct more pessimist tone in some market  particular around the d c  area  although there are a coupl of area that are still report decent activ to the south  in commerci real estat  report from the retail and industri market are general upbeat   one former director  whose firm own a sizabl portfolio of retail properti throughout the east coast  describ the sector as in the best shape he has seen in his life   and he is by no mean a young man   industri leas appear to be in good shape  even tight in some market   in the offic market  howev  contact in maryland and the  ina report slower offic leas activ in octob and earli novemb  the communiti banker i have talk with say that portfolio are still quit clean but that they are scrutin deal much more care in the current environ   they also complain that larg bank are rais deposit rate and compet more intens for deposit   at larg bank  the cost of capit has increas  and they are respond accord by reevalu the profit of various line of busi   this   not appear to have result in ani wholesal cutback in lend but more in a tighten of term in select market segment  i view the inform from our district as fair consist with my econom outlook at the nation level   hous invest continu to contract  and the overhang of unsold home and general tighten of credit term suggest a quit prolong period of relat depress activ   consum spend clear has slow   for the month of septemb and octob  real consumpt show almost no growth   while earli report on the holiday shop season are notori slipperi  it seem clear that shopper are far from ebulli  perhap with the except of these gps toy   this seem consist with the virtual absenc of growth in real dispos incom over the past two month and the flatten out of household net worth in the third quarter   job growth has shift down to a more modest pace over this year  and revis to the payrol seri  when we final get them  seem like to make the slowdown look bigger   so it wouldn   t surpris me if consum spend came in fair tame next year   i am expect a slowdown in consum spend growth  howev  not a sharp pullback   labor market are still fair tight   household net worth is still at fair elev level   so while the increas in the save rate project by the  book for next year is plausibl  i think consum spend could come out on the high side of that forecast  a key factor in the outlook and a key sourc of uncertainti is the continu drama in credit market   larg bank are bring impair asset onto their balanc sheet and are face a higher cost of capit and increas fund cost   it would seem reason to expect them to respond by tighten term of credit for household and busi borrow  impli a further drag on spend   the magnitud of this sort of fallout is still quit uncertain   reduc credit flow appear so far to be less a reduct in credit suppli than in demand   that is  they appear to reflect a genuin deterior in borrow creditworthi in some segment   residenti real estat fit this descript as   some  though not all  commerci real estat   beyond these sector  we have seen some evid of yield spread widen  but the cost of credit to invest grade nonfinanci firm is low and has been fall along with the risk free rate  at least until veri recent   the flow of credit to such firm seem to have been hold up well  as has the nonmortgag consum credit flow   so at this point  it   not look as though an indiscrimin  across the board credit crunch is take place  although margin higher credit cost may exert some addit drag on spend growth   overal  then  i do see a weaker outlook for growth in the near term  and the  e of the return to trend is go to depend somewhat on the bottom out of the hous cycl  which unfortun appear to be get even more remot each  e we meet  if we have a more protract slowdown ahead of us  as seem like now  we need to be care not to lose sight of inflat   core pce inflat has edg up over the past two month  and it now appear like to move abov   percent for a  e   overal inflat  of cours  has been higher on averag over the last year  and we have seen a slight upward trend in five year forward inflat compens sinc earlier in the year   in fact  the behavior of energi and food price over the past sever year call into question the standard presumpt we make that overal inflat is go to return to the core inflat trend in a reason period of  e   that point to the possibl that inflat may give us more troubl ahead
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   come out of our octob meet  i expect a period of subpar growth stretch into the middl of        sinc i was anticip some soft data  it was not obvious to me that the outlook had worsen until later in the intermeet period   a lot of the data that we have cite are financi item that are difficult to assess and are somewhat unusu for the current period   but the incom inform has caus us to mark down our outlook further  although we don   t see growth declin as far below potenti as in the  book baselin forecast   although hous continu to weaken  that by itself did not caus a substanti revis to our outlook   the bigger factor was a notic weaken of consumpt   pce was basic flat in septemb and octob   i guess dead on arriv   the financi headlin are take their toll on consum sen ent  and higher energi price are lower real incom  it is not clear  howev  that we are see a major sustain pullback in consumpt  but  of cours  that is arguabl   the limit inform we have about novemb   motor vehicl sale and the chain store data   suggest at least modest gain in consum expenditur   i realiz that the chain store sale could be a bit artifici   i was talk to one of my busi contact who has a signific presenc in retail  and i am accustom to hear that     well  the christma season is a bit short this year  so that could be a problem      but i actual caught him this  e say     gee  it   s so long this  e that peopl seem to be lose interest       laughter  on balanc  i think the fundament for consumpt are still reason good  import  although they may be somewhat lag  the payrol number are still consist with decent growth in wage incom  and the unemploy rate remain low  elsewher  foreign growth remain good  which along with the lower dollar should support continu growth in export   we have seen some soften in capit spend as well  but the usual indic still point to moder gain in invest   these develop seem reason consist with what i heard from busi contact   most of them think that growth is slow  and they are more cautious  but i would summar their view as guard and not alarmist   furthermor  mani say that their improv inventori control method are prevent an inventori cycl from exacerb the current situat  and they bring this up without my prompt   so to me their comment do not yet suggest a sharp curtail in real econom activ  of cours  the financi market continu to weigh negat on the outlook   in my view  the biggest concern are the larg markdown on structur secur and the volum of asset that may be return to bank    balanc sheet   these effect appear to be larger than the bank had plan for as of octob and could have a signific impact on lend capac  this is an import downsid risk to the real economi  as the  book highlight in mani place   that said  when i talk with my busi contact  there continu to be a disconnect between the credit condit they report face and the turbul we see in money and credit market   outsid of lend for residenti and nonresidenti construct  my ceo contact at nonfinanci firm do not report much chang in credit cost or avail   we have heard this from a number of sourc   for exampl  two of the larger bank in our district said they have not chang term to borrow  and they express relat sanguin view of lend condit overal   for the  e be  some lender report offset a portion of their higher fund cost by take a hit on their interest margin  credit condit for construct relat industri are anoth matter   a major shop center develop who has been one of the largest issuer of commerci mortgag back secur indic that this market has dri up complet   howev  the develop has been abl to obtain financ from other tradit sourc  such as life insur compani  he is pay similar interest rate  he say  but the term includ lower loan to valu ratio   so there is some credit effect  but he still has access for the moment   that is a bit like what presid   was suggest   he said the switch is not a big deal for him current  but if it continu for too long   say  for more than six month or so   it would then weigh more heavili on his busi activ   the evolut of such develop will obvious be an import thing to watch over the next few meet   i would just note that i don   t often look at the duke univers survey of cfos   but as i look at it   and i don   t have a great deal of experi   it did seem to indic that they had higher spend plan on averag from their septemb survey for capit expenditur and technolog spend   it wasn   t a great bit  but given all the negat headlin associ with the credit condit   which are unweight  wherea these spend plan are weight   that was a bit of a surpris  put all of this togeth  we have mark down our current quarter and      real gdp forecast     percentag point  which is pretti signific   we now have growth next year of    percent   we expect growth to improv to our assess of potenti thereaft  name about     percent   this forecast assum two polici eas  similar to but sooner than the  book  and it is shade toward the    stronger domest demand    altern scenario  which has less financi restraint on pce and busi fix invest than in the  book baselin  turn to inflat  our forecast is for pce inflat to settl in at     percent   this continu favor project for inflat is import for my polici view now   we think resourc util like will be about neutral for inflat over this forecast period   our gdp project   not result in appreci resourc slack over the forecast period   even under the weaker  book scenario  the gdp gap remain less than    percentag point   but there are upsid risk   the most recent data on core price have been a bit higher   the lower dollar could put pressur on price  and my busi contact remain concern about the cost of energi and other commod   final  at least by the board staff calcul  five year forward tip inflat compens has move up to the rang that it was in dure the spring of       a period when we were more concern about the inflat outlook   i wouldn   t put too much weight on this particular inflat expect develop at the moment  but it may be loom ahead   so i continu to see upsid risk to inflat  which if realiz would complic our polici reaction to develop on the growth and employ side of the ledger   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   it probabl goe without say that i think the main develop sinc the last fomc mete has been the renew deterior in some of the financi market   in the absenc of that   that is  had financi market condit either stabil or continu to improv as they had from the septemb to octob meet   we would be probabl have a somewhat differ convers this morn   we would be talk more about pars the recent incom macro data and talk about whether the economi was slow as anticip or a littl more or a littl less   we should rememb  we were expect a signific slow in the rate of growth  and that in fact   seem to be occur   but  as i said  i think the financi market develop have been the domin one  as far as the econom outlook is concern  my view of the next few quarter is for growth a bit better than that in the  book for a coupl of reason   one is that i think the incom data  as alway  are noisi  and i am reluct to put a lot of weight on them   second  it seem to me that some of the under fundament  particular the labor market data  present a more favor pictur of the outlook than the spend number at the moment   but it seem to me that the risk are clear on the downsid  and they are on the downsid becaus of financi market condit   perhap the most interest anecdot i came across in the intermeet period was that about two week ago we had a meet with about fifteen leader from firm in the financi servic industri in the twin citi   there was a good deal of concern among  i would say  virtual all the particip in that meet  and it wasn   t so much about year end fund and that kind of thing   it was realli about the econom outlook  and it had to do with the fact that some market are not work or are bare work at the moment  there is no doubt that in their own busi they are all tighten term and other condit  they believ that is appropri  but they wouldn   t argu that it isn   t go to have an effect on spend   they also believ that at least some of their custom are act in anticip of that   that is  they are start to cancel or at least delay spend plan  believ that they aren   t go to be abl to find financ or at least find financ at term they would like   so it seem to me that we are in an environ  as far as financi condit are concern  where that pose a veri real downsid threat to what otherwis might be a pretti accept econom outlook  just a word about inflat   i haven   t chang my outlook for inflat go forward   i don   t have a sens from the incom inform that there is ani compel reason at the moment to do so   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   the convers that i have had with my busi contact indic that busi condit in our region have clear soften sinc the last meet and perhap even more than what is reflect in the beig book report that we prepar just a few week ago   a sens of pessim about the econom outlook seem onc again to be sweep over our busi communiti  and it is not just the financi communiti  this is a decid chang from what i was hear in octob and is clear an ad threat to our alreadi fragil outlook   my bank supervis staff report that the district bank continu to address the risk in their portfolio by shift focus away from residenti and commerci real estat and by requir more collater  stronger coven  and better debt servic coverag in their deal   but our examin are not report that capit posit of our financi institut have been impair such that they cannot accommod sound project   a few of the corpor cfos i talk with say that credit commit are more difficult to come by   the ceo of the fourth district financi institut advis me that what we are face is a liquid squeez and not at present a credit crunch   that said  these bank ceo have express concern that their capit posit could becom impair if the current pressur for more liquid forc them to sell some of their asset at larg discount  the incom data for the economi appear to be unfold reason close to my octob project   i was fair pessimist about our near term growth prospect  and that pessim seem to have been well found   so the econom data by themselv haven   t been enough to push me off the forecast trajectori that i submit at our last meet   but as i note earlier  i do observ a sharp drop in busi confid across a broad collect of industri  not just those tie to residenti real estat   what i am hear sound more substanti than the transitori slow that i was project just six week ago   what i am hear from my busi contact is probabl more align with the prolong slow growth outlook that i now see in the  book baselin  or wors   i am somewhat thank that i didn   t have to submit a project for this meet becaus i am torn between what my most data driven model say and what i am hear from my busi sourc   about the onli thing that i can say with much confid is that the reemerg of liquid pressur  combin with the deterior in busi confid  has increas the downsid risk to growth   i think it is prudent to address that risk with our polici decis today  but i will hold my comment about our polici move for later in the meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think presid  n frame it well in bring focus to the effect on our think that the financi market are have   as mani have said  the central question is not whether the economi is soften but whether it is soften beyond the rang that underpin the polici decis in octob   i   d add to that a rang of question relat to financi market  particular the question of whether the deterior in the financi market chang the prospect for achiev financi stabil  the potenti for spread to a wider array of financi market and institut  the potenti for spillov to the general economi  and the compound of the alreadi heighten degre of uncertainti   all of these weigh heavili on my think   like the  book project  atlanta   s forecast has been revis down as a result of incom data sinc the last meet   i just point out  speak onli for ourselv  that these downward revis of previous forecast and our general outlook have been a pattern over recent month  the current situat is extrem difficult to read   which is anoth way of say that uncertainti around our forecast has increas yet again   contribut to this uncertainti is the continu  if not acceler  gap between the anecdot inform and the view i   ve receiv from wall street versus main street   the expect of financi market particip have deterior and can be character as extrem serious   howev  the messag i get from director and repres of nonfinanci busi outsid the hous sector  though relat pessimist  has not chang substanti sinc our octob meet   in my convers with financi market contact  to vari degre i heard the persist and grow apprehens concern the spread of turmoil to an expand set of affect market and institut and a wonder of what will be the next shoe to drop   one consist messag is the belief that the recent volatil and increas in term spread cannot be entir explain by the year end problem  most of my contact agre that year end balanc sheet concern are ad to market stress  but no one express confid that get past year end will bring much reduct of concern over counterparti weak  asset valu  and secondari market liquid   most expect financi market turmoil to be protract  with increas risk to the general economi   almost all my contact note that deterior hous valu are a root caus  feed problem in the market   this view hold that the adjust in price and inventori requir to stabil the hous sector will take mani month to play out  and until that occur  the valu of structur financi instrument and the solvenc and liquid of structur invest vehicl will be uncertain   there remain a great deal of skeptic that arrang like the super siv and the treasuri   s rate freez plan will have much tangibl effect   the issu of siv restructur and support by sponsor is a grow focus of concern becaus of their linkag to money market fund as well as their contribut to a general contract of credit avail   in sum  my contact in the financi industri uniform express the belief that thing will not get better ani  e soon and may well get wors   while recogn that a rate reduct   not direct address the inform problem in the market  there is widespread sen ent that lower cost of fund will help  turn to the anecdot input from contact in my district  there is some diverg of view between contact direct affect by the hous sector  includ banker  and other   bank loan activ remain particular weak in real estat segment   truck  larg retail  auto dealership  and busi suppli build materi and household durabl were identifi as segment where loan volum are slip   industri warehous market have weaken in some

m left with a view that econom fundament  current and prospect  have not yet fallen off a cliff   that be said  there   s not much of a case to be made for ani risk assess other than one weight to the downsid   in my view  the potenti for protract and grow financi market troubl should weigh heavili in the polici decis  and though recent core inflat read are accept  i continu to be concern about the ongo diverg between headlin and core inflat   until they converg  price pressur cannot be remov from the watch list   but overal i see more uncertainti and  therefor  more downsid risk in the real

thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the econom condit in our district sinc the octob meet   except for hous activ  manufactur and other busi are expand at a modest pace  somewhat below trend   our busi contact are a littl less op ist about growth in the near term than they were earlier in the fall primarili becaus of uncertainti surround the outlook rather than ani immedi chang in their busi activ   i   ll begin by report on what our contact say about credit condit   busi contact as well as our board of director have told me that credit activ has chang veri littl  creditworthi borrow  as far as they were concern  have had no problem access credit  bank have report some tighten of lend standard  but most that has occur for real estat develop and in residenti mortgag   some loan demand has drop becaus of busi    uncertainti about the futur  as i suggest earlier   that is  busi seem to be a bit more cautious   but bank do not appear to be conserv capit   in fact  they   re activ seek good credit   to quot one of my director     the crunch on wall street has not hit main street      a coupl of banker i spoke to  one repres a veri larg region bank and anoth a veri larg communiti bank  express the view that they were activ seek to regain market share from the larger bank becaus they did not engag in the same off balanc sheet financ of riskier debt that the larg bank did and so they were not face either capit or fund constraint   some banker acknowledg that consum credit qualiti seem to have deterior slight  but they remind me that this was from veri good level   so the default and delinqu remain well within histor norm  turn to the economi  payrol employ continu to expand at a somewhat slow pace in our three state  yet the unemploy rate is still     percentag point below that of the nation  retail sale pick up in novemb   moreov  retail general said they met their expect for the thanksgiv weekend   howev  these sale seem to have been boost by fair heavi discount  accord to them  and despit the reason show to date  retail are wari and uncertain for the holiday season   hous construct and sale continu to declin  but the pace of that declin is in line with the expect at the  e of our last meet   nonresidenti real estat market remain firm in our district   offic vacanc rate continu to declin  and commerci rent are rise   new contract for commerci real estat have declin  howev  but with the declin in vacanc rate and with rise rent  the outlook of mani develop is not as negat as the current level of spend would suggest   accord to our busi outlook survey  manufactur activ in the district has been increas at a modest pace for the past few month   the index of general activ move up slight  to     in novemb from     in octob   this is actual about the same averag level that the outlook survey has maintain over the past two year   shipment and new order move up slight   howev  op  regard the outlook over the next six month declin   it   s a common theme of mani of our busi contact that their busi have not chang much  but they seem to be react to the steadi stream of negat news  and it is affect their outlook   inde  the ceo of sever veri larg industri firm in our district report busi to be veri strong both domest and oversea  and the ceo have seen littl effect of the turmoil on wall street on their abil to obtain credit  now  last  e i said that there had been littl chang in the district   s inflat pictur  howev  we have start to see evid of increas price pressur   the busi outlook survey   s price paid index has risen consider sinc the begin of the year and has doubl sinc august   the index for price receiv has also more than doubl sinc august  rise sharpli in both octob and novemb   also retail have note spread price increas for import good  and a wide rang of industri are report increas in energi and transport cost   firm continu to report higher health care cost  and at the same  e  wage continu to be moder  they say  in summari  econom condit have chang littl sinc our last meet   the busi activ in the region is advanc at a moder pace   credit constraint experienc by the larg money center bank have not appreci affect the bank in our district or their lend practic   in general  firm in the district remain cautious op ist about their busi six month from now but not so much as they were last month   price pressur have increas on the input side relat to energi and commod cost  more general  mani firm are now prepar to rais their own price and are look to do so in the near futur  and the financi condit of our bank remain good  turn to the nation  financi market condit  especi those associ with the big money center bank  have clear deterior in recent week   until the end of octob  spread were gradual declin   it seem that the potenti for a serious meltdown was monoton declin   howev  sinc earli novemb  as we all point to  a number of financi institut  subprim mortgag  jumbo mortgag  asset back commerci paper  below invest grade bond  and libor have experienc increas spread   volatil has risen as well   clear  risk premium have risen for certain class of asset  and investor have fresh concern about the way credit market condit are evolv   overal  the recent financi develop suggest that it will take longer befor condit are    back to normal    in all segment of the market   as i   ve said befor  i continu to believ that price discoveri still plagu mani of these market   it now look as though it will take a littl longer befor these market can sort thing out and return to normal  financi institut continu to write off some of the invest and take loss   i view these write down as a necessari and healthi part of the process toward stabil   infus of capit in some financi institut  i think  are encourag and help to the process   this   not mean that the ul  agre upon market price for some of these asset will bear ani resembl to what they did befor august   inde  they probabl won   t   but that   s not necessarili a bad sign  nor is it a caus for concern   in general  it may be a veri healthi develop  the news on econom activ has soften somewhat sinc our last meet   among the negat  of cours  the hous market and residenti invest continu to declin  foreclosur have continu to grow at unpreced rate   firm have becom a littl more cautious in their invest plan   consum spend has soften slight  and real dispos person incom declin in octob   oil price have move higher   on the brighter side so far  there is some evid of spillov from the financi and hous market to the broader economi  but i believ it is limit   net export and busi fix invest have been surpris on the upsid   final  and most import  the labor market still look pretti solid   foreclosur and consum weak appear to be heavili concentr in those state where the hous boom and thus the hous price declin have been most pronounc   especi california  nevada  and florida   and in those state  such as ohio and michigan  that are feel the effect of the declin in automobil manufactur   as presid pool indic  credit card delinqu were up but high concentr in california  nevada  and florida   thus  base on such observ and the news that i hear from my district  i sens that the stress in the economi vari signific by region  and we must be mind that the weak on wall street are in those state that have exagger hous volatil and may not be repres of the rest of the economi   to be sure  we must be wari of continu deterior and spillov  but at this point my assess is that they remain concentr in a few region and are not as widespread as some of the aggreg data might suggest  it   s import to note that  for a good part of the forecast for the fourth quarter gdp  it   s payback for strong inventori and net export number in the third quarter   i note that  absent payback and despit the worsen news  econom growth would be on the order of   percent higher   to put this differ  the news sinc the last meet has not alter the overal gdp forecast for the second half of        it   s about the same   the news has clear alter the  book   s forecast for       especi for the first half of the year but also extend into the second half of        the forecast call for explicit spillov from financi market and the hous sector to the broader economi  to consumpt  to fix invest  and so forth   i should note  howev  that most privat sector forecast are signific less pessimist than the  book   the blue chip survey  our just releas livingston survey  our survey of profession forecast  and sever of the major forecast firm that have issu forecast in the last coupl of week see weak extend into the first and mayb the second quarter of      but a much more rapid bounceback in the second half of      than is suggest in the  book   these privat sector forecast are more in line with my own view  while the news on growth is somewhat on the downsid  the news on inflat is on the upsid   read on core inflat have been stabl over the last few month  but headlin inflat rate have risen sharpli  with increas in energi and commod price   the broader scope of these commod price increas and their breadth suggest that perhap there are more general inflationari pressur out there rather than these isol relat price shock   i will note that the core pce inflat rate for march to june was     percent  and in everi three month window subsequ  the inflat rate has risen monoton  now reach      percent for the latest three month period from august to octob   this come after fair steadi declin in core rate dure the first half of the year   in my comment on the third district  i note the greater prospect for price increas indic by our manufactur firm   i also am go to cite anoth statist from the same survey that presid   refer to   duke univers   s cfo magazin survey  the survey to which he refer was a survey conduct in late novemb and earli decemb of more than     cfos   in the survey  the averag price increas that these cfos were es  for their own product in the come year was     percent  and that was up from just   percent in the previous quarter   thus  it appear that firm are begin to be more interest in increas price and are more abl to do so than they were just a few month ago  even though the same cfos were more pessimist about the economi than they were in the last quarter  anoth piec of news on inflat expect come from the livingston survey  which was just releas ye day   there the forecast of the averag annual chang for the cpi for      to      move up from     percent to   percent   this  of cours  partial reflect the behavior of oil price dure the past sever month   the decemb to decemb forecast  on the other hand  also rose  but onli slight  thus  overal  the economi is weak but onli slight more so than i anticip   volatil in the financi market continu  and the repric of risk has not progress as smooth as i would like to see   nevertheless  the spillov from the financi turmoil seem geograph concentr  and broader spillov appear limit to date   i view inflat expect as fragil and see evid that price pressur are grow and that more and more firm feel that price increas are come and are support   i think we will have to be veri care not to presum that just becaus price expect and price have remain contain that they will continu to be so  independ of our action   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start on the local level   overal our district economi continu to perform general well  with ongo weak in the hous sector be offset by strength in agricultur  energi  and manufactur   we have seen some slow in employ growth over the past few month  but this appear in part to be a suppli consider  our director and busi contact continu to report that the labor market are  in fact  tight across much of the district with shortag of both skill and unskil labor and rise wage pressur  there is some reduct in employ  obvious in the hous sector  but that is be offset by these other consider   i would also note that manufactur activ remain basic solid  with manufactur report strong export order   the district   s manufactur index move upward in novemb and still point to moder growth   in addit  district manufactur    capit spend plan actual rose but remain below most of last year   s read on balanc  turn to spend  general retail report a rebound in sale in the latter part of octob and earli novemb   automobil dealer  on the other hand  did report weaker sale and have also becom more pessimist on futur sale   travel and tourism continu to expand in our region  with district airlin traffic figur solid  particular in the denver area   likewis  hotel occup figur have continu to increas from alreadi strong level in the region   as has been true for some  e  hous activ  as i said  remain soft   for exampl  the valu of residenti contract drop again in octob  and the rate of declin in residenti permit steepen again in the past few month in our region   offset this weak in hous  though  is consider strength in agricultur and energi   district energi produc continu to expand their capit invest as they are relat confid that oil and gas price will remain firm over the longer term   in fact  their capit expenditur have been slow by a continu shortag of labor and access to some equip   our larger region bank are still report fair good condit   the deal flow seem to be come through  although they are look at those care  just given the environ that they find themselv in on a nation level   final  price pressur remain mix  most busi report rise input cost  both labor and materi  but differ in their abil to pass those cost on at this point   in transport  input cost are pass through one for one through custom surcharg   other busi continu to find it a littl more difficult to pass through the higher cost  but they are begin to push harder on that as we talk to them  let me turn to the nation outlook   weak in incom data and continu stress in financi market obvious are noteworthi  and other have note that here today   compar with the  book  howev  i see stronger growth in both the short run and the longer run   i expect fourth quarter growth to be closer to   percent  not the zero percent in the  book  and the economi to strengthen slowli through a good part of       start out slowli obvious and then pick up as we go through the year   compar my view with those in  book  the basic differ appear to be larg in some of the judgment adjust in the  book concern spillov from the hous and financi stress to consum spend   the current  book forecast  as other have note  is similar to the blue chip bottom ten forecast  which suggest to me that it might be better seen as the downsid risk outlook not necessarili the most like outlook at this point   the first half of       as i said  is like to be somewhat slower than i previous project becaus of the high energi price and continu drag from hous   howev  i expect that growth will gradual strengthen as we move toward the end of      and then remain there through the rest of the forecast period   have said this  i realiz that the downsid risk to econom activ   remain elev   the hous slowdown could be deeper and last longer  and continu financi turmoil could further affect consum and busi spend   howev  while financi factor remain a risk to the outlook  in my view the economi  though it will grow below it potenti  can weather these forc and is be support by the polici action that we have taken in the past two meet  against this outlook for econom growth  let me turn now to the inflat outlook   year over year overal and core inflat rate have risen   in addit   book   s      forecast for overal and core pce inflat has increas sinc our last meet   while below trend growth in the near term may exert some downward pressur on inflat  the combin of higher price for oil  commod  and some servic and dollar depreci should place upward pressur on both overal and core inflat go forward   over the past sever year  the pass through of dollar depreci and higher oil price to inflat has been limit in part becaus of longer term inflat expect remain  as we said  anchor   my concern is that  if we continu to lower the fed fund rate into a rise inflat environ and the dollar continu to depreci  these expect may becom unhing perhap more quick than we would like to think   in this environ  i think we should not lose sight of not just the downsid risk to the real economi but also some veri serious upsid risk to inflat   thank you
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  have listen to various view start with presid    on the one end  and presid    on the other  and presid hoenig on inflat  i was think that edward r  murrow said that anybodi who isn   t confus realli  sn   t understand the situat    laughter   i   m confus  and i don   t understand the situat   i would like to report what i see  howev   first  in term of my district   in sharp contrast to the twelfth district  becaus i think they are two extrem  or  say  florida  in presid     s district   employ growth has slow   i mention this becaus last  e i mention a data point  which is that within our district   actual in one state   year to date we may have creat up to one fifth of the job in this countri   we were grow our employ base at     percent in the first quarter  we expect it to slow to     in the third quarter and then to slow down to the high  s as we approach the end of the year   hous price in our district are appreci  and we   re benefit from what we call the california diaspora   that is  particular the techi and other  who are push up price in dalla and austin   final  one point to bear in mind is wage pressur  oil and gas extract repres onli   percent of the employ of texa  despit how everybodi  eotyp our state   yet the wage index in that industri and the labor shortag are put enorm pressur on skill labor in other area  and the overal wage index for our district is rise at the highest rate sinc januari   unemploy is down to     percent for our district  so like presid    we are enjoy a relat strong situat  howev  my view on polici are not govern by the outlier district that i inhabit  and i   d like just to give some anecdot evid  for what it is worth  sinc most of the inform i was go to impart has been given by other thought peopl at this tabl   first of all  on the growth side  my convers with the ceo of ma card were quit detail this month becaus i was follow up on what i was hear from retail at differ price point   he said that retail sale through novemb were up   percent year over year  take out gasolin    percent   he report that most bank are express some concern about receiv growth in california  florida  nevada  and arizona   but elsewher and at the largest issuer  as he put it  he   not see consum run up their line   i think this is in keep with chart    the middl panel  in the bluebook  which show consum credit fair steadi as you go through  e and not signific increas   second  the ceo of wal mart usa   sinc you didn   t mention wal mart   feel a shift in view in that consum  as he said with a terribl pun  have driven through       gas   that is  they accept       gas   the ceo of jcpenney  who report befor our last meet that he felt that    the wheel were come off the economi     has sale    percent year over year to date through last monday   as to black friday  yes  there was discount on black friday   for jcpenney  their total volum was up almost    percent over their previous record year  and there is a sens in the retail industri that there may be a calm down between the two period   the prolong shop period that you mention   nonetheless  most of the retail i speak to at differ price point on the gross side are happier than they expect to be   anoth phenomenon that seem to be occur is an increas in confid with regard to inventori manag   that was best express by the ceo of texa instrument  who report that  when we last met and actual dure the summer  there was almost a freez in term of the willing to build inventori and that their custom were not will to think beyond thirti day   now  have look through the cloud that are present on the financi front  which i   ll address veri briefli in a second  they see more willing for nineti day commit  on almost everi other front  with the except of the homebuild  i haven   t heard from my ceo contact the negativ that  again  is reflect on the wall street side of the equat  with three except   in term of the airlin industri  southwest airlin    overal volum is down     percent in the third quarter   it   s pretti uniform across all district  includ my own   we talk about truck earlier   one of my contact is the largest truck dealer in the countri   he es  accord to what he call  if you   ll forgiv the express  swag   which is    sophist  wild ass guess      i ask for the transcript to put the third letter in the third word as in a snake rather than the po ior    laughter   but the es  of class a truck sale  whether they   re go to russia or not  was         in         the origin forecast for       was          and they now es            so there is a signific slacken on that front  final  with regard to the hous market  you obvious don   t want to talk to anybodi in the homebuild industri current   but those with the strong balanc sheet are take advantag of weak in certain area  and i   ll give you one data point that was startl   in the sacramento  california  area  one of the larg hous builder just bought a fulli develop set of lot that were price at          a lot and the go price was         a lot   signific deflat clear is occur in that sector   but also signific opportun  i   d like to address the inflat situat more thorough  mr  chairman   the ceo of wal mart usa said that  for the first  e in his career at that firm  they have approv a plan in which purchas cost will increas   percent in         he hadn   t seen that befor in his experi and said     i   m total use to deflat   deflat is finish      in term of the supplier to wal mart  this was verifi   i think on food price we have to be extrem care   frito lay is seek a     percent price increas for next year   wal mart has acquiesc   accord to the cfo of that compani  that   s the highest rate in fifteen year   kimber clark and other paper produc  as i report befor  push through price increas   procter   gambl and other have follow  in term of the energi situat   whether it is  as i mention befor  exxon or the larg independ   they don   t see much price relief other than what is the variabl factor present by the so call citi refin  our own data at the dalla feder reserv indic on the intern side that there has been some slacken as indic in the bluebook  but our work with jpmorgan and the index we   re develop indic that capac remain veri tight and that the tight capac has ad to fuel and food price and may well explain whi inflat in the euro zone  the unit kingdom  japan  and other area  includ canada  is higher than the benign trend they   ve been experienc or are target in countri like mexico   so on net  mr  chairman  from our perspect  i can   t say i much agre with the  book becaus i have differ view about busi invest   i   m hear report of signific cap ex expans   and  on the inflat front  i believ that we are underst inflationari pressur  now  veri quick on the comment that was made about condit in financi market have worsen   we hear this repeat   presid   mention price discoveri   i think we have to be veri  veri care to not overreact to what we see develop on wall street and to realiz that there are benefit to price discoveri   it is becaus of that price discoveri that we   re see a substitut effect  which i referenc in my question earlier   it may be equiti for debt  but it is restor balanc sheet  and reason price obtain   i would argu that it is a healthier condit than  as i said earlier  live in the fantasi world where we were price thing at ridicul level rather than realist level  we   ll come to the polici discuss short  but i would like to ask when we have that discuss what we are realli buy with a fed fund rate cut   given the other mechan that we   re go to be put forward and  veri  veri import  rememb as presid hoenig  presid    and other have mention that we still have signific price pressur bake into the cake   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   it   s         it would be a good  e to take a coffe break   whi don   t we return at         coffe break
whi don   t we recomm   vice chairman
thank you   the outlook for real activ has deterior somewhat sinc our last meet   in our modal forecast we now expect sever quarter of growth below potenti with real gdp for       a bit abov   percent   the sourc of the deterior in the outlook for us are pretti much as outlin in the  book   what separ us from the  book still is about    or    basi point of differ view on what potenti growth is   our view of the like path of the output gap is similar   so as in the  book  we expect a deeper contract in hous activ and price   we expect nomin and real incom growth to slow more than we expect and consum spend also to moder more than we had anticip   part of that lower path of real spend is  of cours  due to energi price   we also expect the rate of growth in busi fix invest to slow a bit more than we had previous thought  and these chang are in part  but not sole  due to the expect effect of tighter financi condit   for a given path of the nomin fed fund rate  they are tighter now than they otherwis would have been becaus of the fall in the es  neutral rate   in our view  growth in the rest of the world will slow a bit  but along with the effect of the declin in the dollar  it will still provid enough pull for net export to contribut posit to growth  offset part of  but just part of  the deceler in domest demand growth   our forecast for core inflat is littl chang   we expect the core pce deflat to rise at a rate just under   percent over the forecast period  like mani of you  we see consider downsid risk to the forecast for growth  and they have intensifi sinc our last meet   the  book altern scenario on hous and the credit crunch seem plausibl  perhap more like to happen togeth than to happen independ  and i think realiti is like to fall somewher between the baselin  book scenario and these two darker altern   the risk to the inflat forecast still seem closer to balanc in the forecast period   the higher forward curv of energi price and the lower path of the dollar will rais headlin inflat a bit and  in the near term  the core inflat path   but these pressur should be offset by the fall in anticip pressur on resourc util  not just here but also global where the economi that have been grow abov potenti are like to slow as monetari polici tighten  i think it   s import to recogn that breakeven in inflat at longer horizon have stay relat stabl in the context of the fair substanti move in the dollar  the fair substanti move in actual and expect energi and commod price  and the veri dramat chang in expect of how the fed is like to respond to the chang in the balanc of risk to growth   in light of these chang to the outlook and the risk to the outlook  we   ve lower our expect path for the fed fund rate   we now think it   s like that the committe will reduc the target rate to      percent over the next few quarter  and this put our real and our nomin fed fund rate assumpt for       a bit under the new path in the  book   we   d rais it back in         but our fed fund rate path is signific abov the market   s es    as you   ve all recogn  condit in market have deterior substanti sinc our last meet  but the basic dynam is still the same   actual and anticip loss to financi institut have risen as the price of a larg rang of asset have fallen   uncertainti over the path of hous price in the real economi and complex in valu asset and structur financi instrument that are most expos to those risk make it veri hard for market to know with confid the like dimens of total loss and who is most expos to them  financi institut have seen a sharp increas in their cost of fund  a substanti shorten in matur at which they borrow  and a signific reduct in their abil to liquid or borrow against their asset   most bank have seen a veri larg and unanticip expans of their balanc sheet as they   ve been forc or have chosen to provid fund in various form   as bank and other financi institut have move to posit themselv to deal with a more advers econom and financi environ  they have becom much more select in how they use their liquid and capit   the consequ of those action is evid in the sharp increas in the cost of unsecur borrow and the spread on secur financ  now  it   s import to recogn that  although a sourc of this pressur is concern about macroeconom risk and it consequ for credit loss and asset valu  the consequ of the adjust by institut to this new realiti are veri sever liquid pressur in market   these are particular acut in europ  and they are   at least in the market   s expect   like to persist well beyond year end   these pressur are the symptom of the under problem  as fever is the sign of the immun system   s respons to an infect   but just as high fever can caus organ failur befor the infect kill the bodi  illiquid itself can threaten market function and the economi   the longer we live with these condit   larg spike in demand for liquid risk free asset  a general shorten of fund matur  a limit amount of avail financ even against high qualiti collater  the risk of substanti liquid of financi asset  and the chanc of run on individu institut    fund   the more we are vulner to a self reinforc advers spiral that lead to a greater retrench in credit suppli than fundament might otherwis suggest and with a greater effect on growth  i don   t think the past four to six month have been kind to those who have argu that this was just a mild and transitori bump   as in august  i think we have to be will to treat both the fever and the infect and  if you step back a second  the appropri polici respons to this set of challeng will entail a mix of measur   monetari polici will probabl have to be eas further to contain the risk of a more substanti and prolong contract in demand growth   i think we will probabl need to continu to adjust our various liquid instrument   we may need to encourag some institut to rais more equiti sooner than they otherwis might choos to do   we need to be veri care to avoid make both type of the classic error in supervis in financi crise  these are  on the one hand  action that would amplifi the credit crunch by forc bank to protect their ratio by sell more asset  la new england or  on the other hand  the commiss of what you might call irrespons forbear  la japan in the hope of mask weak and stretch out the pain   we also need to be care to keep think through more advers scenario for the economi and the financi system and the polici respons that may be appropri if they materi  the unit state is  i think  a remark resili economi still   outsid of hous  we don   t have the same imbal in inventori with the same degre of overinvest in other part of the economi that we have had go into past downturn   corpor balanc sheet still seem relat healthi   the world economi is no doubt stronger   current account imbal is come down   our core institut enter this adjust period with a fair amount of capit   it is veri encourag to see so mani of them start to rais capit so earli   the financi infrastructur is more robust   inflat expect impli a fair degre of confid in our abil to keep inflat low over  e   the speed and the extent of the adjust that we   ve seen in hous and by financi institut to this new realiti are realli sign of health  of how well our system work  but we need to be cogniz that the market is torn between two quit plausibl scenario   in one  we just grow below potenti for a given period of  e as credit condit adjust to this new equilibrium  in the other  we have a deep and protract recess driven as much by financi headwind as by other fundament   there are good argument for the former  the more benign scenario  but we need to set polici in a way that reduc the probabl of the latter  the more advers scenario   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   the outlook for econom activ has weaken over the intermeet period   the hous bust look steeper with import greater declin in price  and that will affect futur consumpt   weak in hous and the uncov of greater loss at key financi intermediari have contribut to a notabl deterior in financi market and a tighten of some financi condit   we are also begin to see sign that econom weak has not been confin to the hous relat sector   with regard to activ outsid of hous  like mani other who have spoken today  i see the most notabl develop as the flatten out of consumpt spend in septemb and octob   that could reflect the rise in energi price  but it seem to me that the veri deep dip in consum sen ent suggest that more is at work   that the actual and expect effect of financi market turmoil  for exampl  on the cost and avail of credit to household along with lower hous and stock price might also be contribut to less ebulli consumpt spend in the recent past and go forward  capit spend also seem to be slow   although busi invest spend hasn   t been revis down in the fourth quarter in the  book  logic slower consumpt growth will show through befor long  as it   begin in the first quarter in the  book   in addit  we have some more evid of greater busi caution  which could damp busi invest relat to expect activ   the nfib survey for novemb  for exampl  show that the outlook by small busi deterior decid in novemb   there   s a sharp downturn in almost all the outlook index for small busi in this novemb survey  and as i listen to the report from around the tabl  i think for all except a swath of state from nebraska through texa  mayb the lower midwest  i   m hear a littl more pessim from other place around the countri consist with this   to be sure  employ continu to expand   various purchas manag survey also suggest that activ continu to increas  albeit slowli   but i agre with the staff that  on balanc  the incom data suggest more near term weak than anticip at our last meet  includ some tentat evid of spillov from hous  financi market condit have deterior substanti  and that will place further restraint on growth next year   i think what we learn in the first few week of novemb was that loss are much larger than had been previous anticip   those loss stretch into what had been seen as higher qualiti mortgag relat asset  as bill   show us  and the loss are larg enough to call into question the abil of some veri essenti intermediari to provid support for market or to extend much addit credit   those intermediari includ fanni and freddi and the financi guarantor  as well as some invest and commerci bank  as concern about downgrad and potenti fire sale rose  investor and institut move to protect themselv  with the rise in term fund spread symptomat of the greater level of concern   it is logic and reason that the respons of intermediari to this concern would be to tighten term and condit for their loan to exert greater control over their balanc sheet  expect that intermediari will be tighten credit  along with the incom spend data  led to a more pessimist view of the econom outlook  and although treasuri rate fell substanti  concern about the perform of borrow meant that those declin did not show through veri much into the cost of fund to privat lender and borrow   inde  a number of indic point to a net tighten of credit condit across a rang of borrow sourc over the intermeet period  and that tighten will persist past the new year   that tighten will have advers implic for demand by household and busi in        that is  i do think there   s go to be some spillov from wall street to main street   forward measur of the libor oi spread for after the year end move substanti higher   in effect  the cost to bank of fund will not reflect the full extent of the eas we   ve done in the feder fund market   the spread on corpor bond have widen suffici to actual increas borrow cost for both invest grade and junk bond issuer over the intermeet period   the leverag loan market deterior in late novemb  forc bank to take more loan onto their balanc sheet  use up scarc balanc sheet room   secondari market for nonconform mortgag remain moribund  with no sign of life  and ani loan that will be made in these nonconform sector will be place onto the balanc sheet of thrift and bank  mani of which are alreadi face strain   perhap as a consequ  rate on prime jumbo mortgag have actual risen over the intermeet period  fanni and freddi have increas fee and are tighten standard  and they face slight higher spread   so the damp effect of lower treasuri rate on the cost of conform hous credit will be held down  all that said  i do see some encourag sign that the precondit for futur improv are come into place   as other have note specif  institut are recogn and deal more direct with the implic of these loss   they are recogn the loss more aggress   they   re rais capit  and they   re be more explicit about take conting liabil like siv onto their balanc sheet   even so  i think that what we have learn over the intermeet period is that the process of return financi market to more normal function is go to take longer and the disrupt to the cost and avail of credit will be greater than i had thought just six week ago  prospect for a period of weaker econom growth and reduc resourc util do work to lower inflat risk   in addit  we   ve seen a downward revis to compens and unit labor cost  and commod price outsid food and energi have fallen substanti in recent week   at the same  e  energi price have risen  and past inflat data have been revis higher  and the staff has actual revis up it inflat forecast by a tenth or two over the next few year  so on balanc  i judg the inflat risk still to be to the upsid if the economi follow the modal forecast but by consider less than i thought at the last meet   i look forward to a discuss in the next part of the meet about how we deal with the polici implic of this chang situat
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani of you  i think that the risk of bad econom outcom are higher than they were when we met in octob  both here in the unit state and among our trade partner   the profound deterior in financi market   which in my view has chang signific  more so than the data on the real economi   as been much discuss alreadi   i   ll make two separ observ about that deterior now versus on the darkest day in august or septemb   first  we   re see a veri meaning prefer for treasuri as oppos to agenc   in our discuss and in the data sever month ago  they would have tend to be bundl togeth  but are put more pressur on treasuri in this current environ   second  it strike me that more overnight fund is be done by more larg financi institut  and that has to concern us as we talk in the next round about polici   liquid condit have been hurt by sever relat factor  most of which speak to a lack of confid  certain there are lower expect about the macroeconom environ and a lack of confid in counterparti and in fund through year end  but perhap most  the escal risk avers within the four wall of most  but not all  veri larg financi institut has caus this market turmoil  both in the formal bank system and in what presid   describ as the shadow bank system  so whi have these institut lost faith and so much convict   i   ll give a few reason  first  senior manag instabl   second  a lack of confid   by board  senior manag who are still around  and the rest of their peopl   in the risk manag system   there is a grow chasm of confid between the board   and those who are around them   about their stress test and about their abil to withstand a seri of shock that could lead to further deterior   there is also a veri bad risk reward tradeoff for those who are prepar or have been given some abil to put balanc sheet capit to work   if they make a bet and it turn out to be veri bad in this environ  their job and the job of mani of their peer will be over   if they make a bet and it turn out to be as good as they expect  they won   t be keep much of the fruit of that trade   as a result  i think we are find that key peopl across institut   which presid   and other talk about as keen to provid opportunist capit   have step back  i would say materi   final  it   s not year end pressur with respect to balanc sheet that strike me as have the biggest effect here   it   s that  as these manag are look at their busi for       they   re fundament have to ask themselv the question about what busi they are realli in   whether they all should be origin  distributor  and holder of credit and risk or whether they need to go back to where they were five or six year ago  when they were pick their compar advantag   as they look at the budget for next year  i think they have a lot of understand of what their cost structur are if they don   t chang their personnel  but they have veri littl clariti about what their top line revenu will be   that has led to some serious question about put capit to work when you   re realli not sure what your core busi are   i expect that process not to be complet in week or month but realli in quarter  and it   s for that reason  among other   as governor kohn referenc   that i expect this period of relat strain to last for a while  let me rais a question that i ask at the last fomc meet   are we see mere a chang in the competit landscap or a fundament weaken across class of financi institut   i would say that today most larg financi institut  both money center commerci bank and larg invest bank  are on the sidelin to some meaning extent   unabl or unwil to put their balanc sheet with ani real forc to work on new capit or on new project  they   re like to be stuck there for a while   sure there are a few larg institut with both capit and convict that are opportunist deploy capit with extrem compel equiti risk premium   i think about that more as cherri pick than ani interest or abil of these institut to buy the entir orchard   so they will be survivor  but they are be veri  veri care  is there enough opportunist credit from those institut that distinguish themselv  along with class of other institut that we talk about today   larg foreign bank  u s  branch  super region bank  mid size bank  communiti bank  credit unit  the gses  the home loan bank   to pick up market share and take advantag of that slack that   s been left for a period   i think in a word the answer is    no      that is  they will inevit pick up some market share dure this period   this is good news for the institut that had been crowd out by the money center bank invad some of these region   but as i look at their own convict  at their own balanc sheet  and import  at where their sourc of credit might come from   from these same capit market that are in dysfunct   i get encourag that they can pick up some of the slack  but i wouldn   t expect them to be abl to pick up enough for us to avoid the spillov effect to the real economi   it is true that mani of these institut now find busi and new loan to be on better term   they   re price leader rather than price taker   there is less competit for some of these new c i loan and some of these new consum loan   this is a good thing  but again  i wouldn   t overemphas that they are somehow go to be abl to pick up the slack  what about other form of opportunist capit  like sovereign wealth fund and hedg fund that are play an import role in re liquefi larg bank   again  i see that as part of a solut  but in my view  we   re realli still earli in that process  and most of those institut that are out look for capit are like to get more round of capit in the come week  month  and quarter   the term of the invest by some of these extern fund suggest that this is not the final fund rais but realli one of the first   in some way  this is a much t ier posit than if we saw one class of financi institut that was weaker and thought that other could fill in   again  the provis of credit normal made possibl in this environ by the structur financ market is affect all financi intermediari   the weak  the strong  the regul  the unregul  those on wall street  and those in other citi  so what   the immedi futur hold   let me spend a moment break down a few class of these institut   invest bank first   i expect most of them to be on the sidelin for a while   i expect the      budget  which are still come togeth now  to like suggest that they are exit from some busi and fire employe in larger number than market expect right now   what about larg money center commerci bank  particular those that have been in the headlin   obvious i would expect them  with some leadership clariti  to take a direct  but these busi take a veri long  e to turn   so what will they do   they will continu to prune their balanc sheet  continu to sell noncor asset and busi  continu rais capit  and continu their discuss with rate agenc about meet rate agenc    expect   these rate agenc want to be observ   they no longer want to be market maker or market particip  but i suspect they   re go to find a revers to the role of some year ago hard to pull off in this environ   what about super region and communiti bank  which mani of you spoke about with some view that their current balanc sheet look okay   i think there is a sens of forebod in that group about their commerci real estat exposur   even though they are larg open for busi  we shouldn   t overst their abil to pick up some slack   after all  the secondari market is close for mani of them   their portfolio lend is up   the credit line util are be fulli tap   their own profit project are like to be come down over       and even though they certain want to increas market share  they   re read the same headlin  and my own judgment is they   re like to be still somewhat worri  in sum  these problem appear to me to have been long in the make   long befor they struck the hous market   and will be somewhat longer in the rebound than we might have thought even some week ago   the catalyst for improv  though  are manifold   first  new leader with dispassion view are come to mani of these financi institut and are will to sell asset at price that the leader who brought them into differ busi might have been unwil to do   again  it strike me that the abil to sell an entir book of busi at a fix dollar amount and run a competit auction might help clear mani of these price that have otherwis look pretti stubborn and pretti hard to mark   in term of other valid that might be come into these new invest  as i mention  i think the rais of equiti fund is encourag  but these valid  particular those in the unit state and some in sovereign wealth fund elsewher  are pretti patient  and i don   t see ani of them think that they need to deploy their capit quick or on term with which they are uncomfort becaus they will have an opportun to look at ten and dozen more term sheet in the next sever quarter   as mani of them are make invest now  they have a rang of term sheet in front of them  and that judgment won   t be rush in their view   so the idea that it would be a panacea for the real economi strike me as a bit overst in the current environ  so what about the real economi   no doubt the turmoil in financi market  some of which was self inflict  has the potenti to do more harm to the broader economi in the fourth quarter and in earli next year   but we have to be humbl about our understand of that transmiss mechan   the preced discuss strike me as give less comfort than i had at the last fomc meet on the short term resili and dynam of our financi market to repair themselv quick   i   m still veri op ist over the forecast period and the medium term  but it put more of a burden on the resili and dynam of our labor market and more of a focus on the resili and dynam of our product market and of our busi   they do appear to be hold up okay   in my view  if you look at the various survey that were referenc earlier today and the busi roundtabl survey of ceo  these would be much more dire forecast if we were in recess now than they appear to be at this moment   most of these ceo  who are not great at call inflect point  still think that their busi is okay   the economi has slow  it is riskier  but it strike me that we have a good shot of be abl to follow through on the pattern outlin in the  book  final  just let me make a quick note about inflat risk   i think the inflat risk have garner certain less of my attent in this intermeet period and might have garner even somewhat less of the discuss around this tabl   the inflat risk that we saw six week ago strike me as not have improv veri much   inflat risk are quit real  and so as we are choos our polici option  we have to keep these in mind   but we obvious have to take the shorter term risk and the illiquid in the market into account first and foremost as we think about both monetari polici and liquid polici   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you   at the last meet i expect a somewhat rougher patch  particular in hous  than the last  book scenario   a sort of slow burn scenario  or someth that dave made refer to   but over just the past three week or so  the heat of that fire has becom a lot greater than i had expect in term of the burn that i   m see in the financi market as well as in the real market  particular with respect to consumpt  as mani peopl have mention  and then more broad just the reclos of market that had open up   i describ some of the market and the turmoil  say that thing were in sort of a brittl circumst   unfortun  i think in certain part we   re start to see some crack show  i want to focus on think about bank    balanc sheet and how that address some of the issu that we   ve talk about   for commerci and industri lend  as mani peopl said  there still seem to be reason robust in the invest grade corpor sector   those guy haven   t yet seen a lot of pressur in term of increas cost of fund   not a reduc cost of fund but also not an increas cost of fund   just a slight increas in term  but it   s no problem for them to deal with those kind of term   they have the market open to them both for long term debt issuanc and for intermedi term debt issuanc   they have bank fund that is avail   most of the bank  the larg bank as well as smaller bank  are suggest that  although they may be tighten standard somewhat  there is still a reason amount of credit demand and that most board and execut are say    continu to make those loan      firm    balanc sheet are still quit strong   firm have built up a lot of cash or liquid asset on their balanc sheet over the past few year of profit  so that part hasn   t seen that much of a challeng   some of the increas that we   ve seen and measur on the book of bank in term of their c i portfolio are the take on board of some leverag loan on which they had made commit a number of month ago  those commit are now be drawn down  and so they   re increas their portfolio   so some of the increas in c i lend is realli just commit that have come in earlier   the leverag lend market  which had open up for syndic  has quit affirm close onc again   that   s clear a negat develop  with respect to siv  asset back commerci paper conduit  it seem that mani of the bank are go it alon without wait for the m lec   virtual all major bank have announc program for bring asset back commerci paper or siv onto their balanc sheet   so this is still order  but it   s begin to show some stress on the balanc sheet with the leverag lend and all of the siv come on board  and this underscor the import that a number of peopl mention about capit rais effort and ensur that capit will be avail  not just abov the regulatori minimum but enough to make the market certifi  the rate agenc  and other continu to feel comfort  a number of peopl have also mention that the flatten  and in some case the downturn  in commerci real estat and the tighten of term are of particular concern at the midsiz and smaller bank   as you know  we had issu some guidelin a littl more than a year ago on commerci real estat concentr and concern about that becaus we had look back to what happen dure the save and loan crisi and saw that we were start to get bank into the same level of concentr that we had seen back then that were associ with troubl  although we had a lot of negat pushback at that  e  i think that was not an unreason thing to do  but there are still a lot of challeng at those institut  consum lend is probabl the area in which i   ve seen the greatest chang  and it has rais my concern the most   i   ll hold off on mortgag for a moment   first  i talk with a veri larg provid of credit card and other consum product  heloc  mortgag  et cetera  who said that  sinc the report that i receiv just befor the last fomc meet  when thing were reason stabl  they had seen signific deterior   as some peopl have said  even though it has gone up sharpli  the number are still reason  but it   s the delta that concern me  the veri sharp deterior that they   re see   they   re see this nationwid   the sharpest deterior is  as a number of peopl have said  in the area that have seen the greatest hous price stress   california  nevada  and florida   but it   s not limit to those   i won   t go through all the detail of what they told me on delinqu rate on differ type of product  but nationwid they are see doubl  tripl  or quadrupl in those area  and this is over a period of just six to eight week   so that   s realli quit signific and concern me in combin with some of the lower number that we   re see with respect to consumpt  also  one of the phrase that they use is that they   re now see    contagion in their book     so it   s not just in one particular area but through a seri of consum product  and it   s not just for subprim borrow   they note that one third of the charg off had a credit score of over     at the origin of the mortgag   so it   s far beyond just the subprim area   obvious  as a number of peopl have said  the mortgag market have realli not reopen   there had been some hope around the last meet that the jumbo market would reopen   we   re see no evid of that  the subprim market is not realli open   the abx index and other index are suggest that market are anticip extrem high loss rate  even beyond what bill was suggest with the    percent loss   now  i don   t know whether those are reflect just loss rate or whether other issu with respect to a lack of liquid in the market  or hedg that is go on  but still it   s a concern   as i mention last  e  the case shiller s p index  although extrem thin trade when you go out a year or two  is still suggest potenti a    percent declin on averag in the ten citi that they look at   so noth has improv there  and given the tight in the market  given that we know that there will be more reset come  given the continu pressur  there   s probabl go to be a lot more downsid potenti for hous price  and that  of cours  could again feed into lower consum spend   so that   s the concern on the real side  the concern on the financi side is that  obvious  all these thing put a lot of pressur on bank balanc sheet   gather capit is veri import  but basic what we   re see is a veri  veri slow reviv of the market  and i agre with mani of the other who have said that it   s go to take a while   a lot more inform  model build  and hire of peopl who can analyz these thing will be need   someth that was dishearten to me is that the mortgag banker associ said that they hope by earli next year to be abl to provid suffici inform to the market so that peopl can realli assess on a loan by loan basi what   s in their cdos  and that   s a real concern   the inform is simpli not out there   so it   s not just confid or concern  peopl are now look care and say     i just don   t have the inform to be abl to make an assess      that   s  of cours  on top of the macroeconom risk and uncertainti about hous price in general   so i do think it   s go to take a while for these market to reviv   as the vice chairman   actual both vice chairmen   and other mention  if you look into the forward market for the oi spread and other thing  this is go to persist   this is not just an end of the year problem  peopl are look to the bank for re intermedi and for take a lot of thing on the balanc sheet   that   s go to continu to put a lot of pressur on the capit that they have  and i think there will be continu uncertainti for both u s  institut and intern institut that thing have to keep come on their book and they won   t be abl to get other thing off their book  so that is a real challeng go forward  just a moment on inflat   i certain am hearten  as mani other peopl have said  that as expect about our polici move have chang  we haven   t seen a signific uptick in inflat expect  although by some survey measur we have seen some uptick   but real inflationari pressur are out there  and each increment step we take with respect to polici eas potenti has higher and higher cost with respect to inflat   there are no free lunch here  but we do have to be mind of the downsid risk  particular with respect to the bank and the financi system   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   you are all awar that i have a veri op ist person  and at the last fomc meet  i actual had that kind of op    i felt that the economi was evolv in a quit reason way and  in fact  was respond to our polici chang in a way that i felt was veri appropri in order to minim the cost of the financi destruct that we   re experienc   in particular  with the credit market stabil  we were in a situat in which our polici move had reduc a lot of the macroeconom risk that was out there in term of credit spread   clear we were still left with the opaqu spread or valuat risk that would requir price discoveri to resolv   it look as though that was go to progress veri slowli and over  e we   d get out of the situat we were in and the economi would go through a solid rebalanc  move away from some sector that had too much go on   that is  hous   to sector which we need to expand   for exampl  the tradabl sector   to deal with some of the global imbal that we had   so i was actual feel veri posit   i felt that thing were go exact the way that i had hope  of cours  thing don   t alway work out that way  and we start to see short after the octob meet a substanti deterior in credit market   my view is that the deterior that we   re see is appropri reflect in the substanti revis to the forecast   i   m veri comfort with the way the staff has revis the forecast downward   it   s obvious someth that is an art becaus you have to do it in term of add factor  but you do want to inform it by scienc  and i think they have appropri done so in term of think about what we   ve learn from past experi that may tell us about how credit disrupt of this type will actual lead to lower spend in mani categori  but i want to talk about whi my sunni disposit is much less sunni right now and whi i   m actual veri  veri worri   not to say depress  but at least a littl more that way than usual  it is becaus i think that the kind of negat scenario that are point out in the  book are veri real possibl   in particular  there are two scenario that they go into separ   the hous correct scenario and the credit crunch scenario   i think that there   s a veri strong possibl those would come togeth becaus  if hous price go down more  that creat a much more serious problem in term of valuat risk  and a serious problem in valuat risk will mean a further credit market disrupt  which then can lead to more macroeconom risk becaus it lead to this downward spiral   the real economi get wors   that mean that there is more uncertainti  credit spread get wors  and you get a veri bad scenario happen   that could lead to the credit crunch scenario   similar  a credit crunch scenario  i think  would have a veri negat effect on the real economi  which would mean that hous price would go down  which would then make it much more like that we have the greater hous correct scenario   so that   s the first part of my depress  the second issu is that the  book   not go into the issu of what effect that might have oversea   there has been a lot of discuss in the media about decoupl the u s  economi from foreign economi  and when it   s just trade that   s go on  i think that is usual complet reason   but when it   s financi  then there is veri good reason to think of recoupl becaus a financi disrupt in the unit state is veri like to spread to financi disrupt abroad   we  of cours  have alreadi seen that   it   s remark that what happen in the subprim sector has in some sector affect european bank mayb even more than american bank   so the possibl that problem develop in the unit state and lead to problem in europ and other advanc countri and then those problem actual spill over back into the unit state again mean that there   s a third scenario that could be all tie togeth  when you look at all of this  i get veri nervous   the bottom line is that my modal forecast is certain down  veri much along the line of what the staff has suggest   but i think there is a signific probabl that thing will go south   you don   t like to use the r word  but the probabl of recess is  i think  near    percent  and that realli worri me veri much   i also think that there   s even a possibl that a recess could be reason sever  though not a disast   luckili all of this has happen with an economi that was pretti strong and with bank have good balanc sheet  otherwis it could realli be a potenti disast   i don   t see that  but i do see that there is substanti risk that the economi could have a sever negat hit to it that would be veri  veri problemat  now  when i look at the issu of inflat  i have a differ view from mani of the peopl at this tabl   i feel strong that the one thing a central bank can never afford to do is to lose it nomin anchor   if we do that  it   s a disast   with that viewpoint  i should say that  if shock occur such that recess was go to occur and the onli way we could stop a recess from occur was to inflat the economi  we couldn   t allow that to happen   we actual have to preserv the nomin anchor becaus  in the long run  the pursuit of price stabil is what make good monetari polici and has been a key reason for the remark success of monetari polici by the central banker throughout the world in recent year that i think nobodi would have predict  but when i look at what   s go on in term of inflat right now  i realli do not see the substanti upsid risk that a lot of peopl are talk about   for me the key driver of inflat is  as you know  inflat expect   the question is whether inflat expect are ground  and i think the answer is    yes      in fact  we   ve had a situat in which higher energi price have not led to ani upward movement in expect inflat as far as i can tell   neither has the dollar declin   that actual happen when the economi was do much better  now we   re face a situat in which we have some substanti negat shock to the economi  and those substanti negat shock actual  if anyth  put some downsid risk in term of inflat   i don   t see that inflat will move much from   percent   one thing that has happen recent is that we have not seen some of the favor inflat number   presid   talk about the fact that we   ve seen less favor inflat number  but that   s becaus we had temporari factor that were go to make inflat look over good and drive it below   percent   the staff strong indic to us in the  book and in past  book that those temporari factor were not go to persist   they got that one right  but there   s no inform from the fact that those temporari factor are no longer present that say that inflat pressur have actual heat up   inde  what we see is that inflat seem to be move around   percent  that   s where i think inflat expect are ground  and i see no tendenc at all for thing to get much wors in that regard   i   m not say that couldn   t chang  and so i think we have to be veri vigil   but in the current environ  where i see a veri negat potenti path of the economi  the idea that inflat is our primari concern right now is not where i am   with that let me end
thank you  governor   well  again  thank you for a veri help discuss   let me just tri to briefli summar and then offer a few addit comment  mani particip obvious gave consider attent to the resurg of stress in financi market  includ the increas loss by financi institut  widen spread  and poor function market   some express concern that these develop were like to result in tighter credit   not just in mortgag  where condit are alreadi tight  but in other area as well   perhap result in spillov to the broader economi   a weaken economi could caus financi condit to worsen further  lead to a negat feedback loop  and inde  there are sign of some broader credit deterior   impend mortgag rate reset and foreclosur pose further risk   some took these develop as increas downsid risk to growth  perhap signific   howev  other particip note some mitig factor  includ the fact that bank came into the situat with a lot of capit   some institut have rais capit   there   s the possibl that other credit provid could take over from money center bank   corpor balanc sheet are strong   the credit problem have a region focus in some case  and there is a lack of effect so far on mani on main street   some also note that the price discoveri process was inevit and need  with respect to the macroeconom data  overal the incom data were slight weaker than expect  particular in hous and consumpt  although  again  the anecdot were somewhat mix   fundament for consumpt are weaker but not collaps  with the labor market and perhap wealth still provid some support and mix inform on retail sale  differ across region and product were note   with the possibl except of commerci real estat in some case  invest is not yet much affect by credit condit   improv in inventori manag were cite as a posit   unemploy remain low  and wage pressur exist in some area  but they were less cite  i think it   s fair to say  than in past meet  export demand relat to the weaker dollar and strong foreign growth provid some help to the manufactur sector  although it was note that other countri might not be immun to a slowdown in u s  growth   overal  most particip saw slower growth  but there is greater agreement that the outlook is in ani case more uncertain  on inflat  some took a relat benign view note the restraint from a slow economi and less tight in labor market   other note some recent increas in core inflat and continu pressur from energi  food  and the dollar   mani stress that stabl inflat expect cannot be taken as a given   ani comment or question  let me just add a bit to the discuss becaus  as usual  it has alreadi been veri thorough  again  if one look at the incom macro data  i think a fair judgment is that it was a littl weaker than we expect   the economi has been a littl slower than we expect   hous data  consumpt  and i would argu invest and product number were all somewhat lower than we thought was go to be the case at the end of octob   i would also argu that  in particular  the consum  who of cours is crucial to the expans  is face somewhat weaker condit   includ higher oil price  less wealth from lower stock and hous price  and perhap tighter credit   than was the case a month and a half ago   i think it is noteworthi that the unexplain portion of consum sen ent has declin consider   there seem to be attitud or  if you like  forecast among consum that are even weaker than would be suggest by some of the condit they are current see  and i think that is a concern  now  there have certain been posit develop in the data   the labor market has held up pretti well   the unemploy rate actual drop a bit last week   stock have come back a bit from their so call correct  although i should say that this is condit on a lot of expect eas by the feder reserv   ism survey show manufactur as flat  but manufactur is still grow  and there was a bit of good news ye day in hous  with some slight indic of improv pend sale   i think it   s interest that the michigan survey note that prospect homebuy are actual a bit upbeat becaus they see interest rate as low and price as more favor   so  again  the data suggest some weak  but the stori is not entir unmix  so how would we interpret this   i think you could take a more sanguin view that we are see the continu of a zigzag pattern that we   ve seen for quit a while   we had veri weak growth in the first quarter of this year  for exampl  but even with the zero growth project for the fourth quarter  we will see     percent growth in the first half of       and     percent growth in the second half of         so it could be that we   re just see a zigzag pattern  and some of that is certain true   it   s also still true that a lot of the weak we   re see is in the hous sector   for exampl  for all of        growth exclud hous is about     percent   so again  not suggest of great weak   now  all of that be note  i don   t think i   d go quit as far as governor    i tri to maintain an even keel here in my mood    laughter
i believ   and his fellow can provid you with some pill   laughter
but i think i   m in the camp of those who see a fundament soften go on here   one indic is the pattern of final demand   this zigzag pattern has been most in a situat with basic about   percent growth in final demand but with quarter to quarter variat in export and inventori   we see in this case the opposit   growth in privat domest final demand is project by the  book to fall to minus     percent in the fourth quarter and anoth minus     percent in the first quarter of next year   it   seem to have been a step down in econom growth outsid of hous  the other issu is the financi market  which so mani peopl have comment on   i just note that there are sever element to this   first are the loss and the downgrad that have hit capit   these have been onli partial offset by new capit issuanc   in particular  we   ve seen about     billion in write down or loss in the financi sector  of which     billion has occur sinc our last meet  at a  e when we thought thing were clear up   critic loan by our supervisor for the top fifti bank hold compani rose from    to    percent over the last quarter  so we   re see continu loss  and i expect to see that to go forward   the second element of this is the pressur on balanc sheet   bank are take off balanc sheet asset onto the balanc sheet  an exampl that governor   mention is the leverag loan market  which was open for a while and now seem to be close  and securit market remain close  moreov  and i think this is particular worrisom go forward  supervisor   and you all  of cours  talk to your supervisor   are increas concern about credit qualiti as it look like to evolv   commerci real estat is one area in which we   ve seen essenti no default yet  but these thing tend to lag  and there   s a lot of expect both among banker and among supervisor of that sector weaken   one indic of bank    view is that they have been rais their loan loss provis at a rapid rate      billion in the third quarter   it was at a twenti year high  and we are certain hear from  for exampl  the feder advisori council that they expect credit qualiti to continu to deterior   the result of this is that  although i do not expect insolv or near insolv among major financi institut  they are certain go to becom much more cautious  and i think that will affect their lend behavior and their willing to extend new credit   as has been point out  some of the natur substitut like the so call shadow bank system are not realli there at this point  and i would also be less sanguin than some about region and communiti bank  which face their own problem   lack of securit outlet and a lot of exposur to commerci real estat  so i do think that we   re go to see some tighten of credit and that it could get wors  experi suggest that  while financi condit are alway differ and the financi structur has chang signific  credit crunch can have a big effect on the economi   the case that   s been cite the most is the         crunch  when the capit loss were pretti limit region but  nevertheless  there was a nation impact   anoth smaller  perhap less relev  exampl is the carter credit control in march       which were veri small in their aspir yet somehow manag to creat a short recess   so i believ that the financi condit are go to be a signific drag   it is go to go on for a while   given the low growth expect  it could lead us into a negat growth area   i see realist onli one way in which we could avoid a drag from the financi system  which would be if  in fact  we get lucki and the hous market begin to stabil and there   s a sens that we   ve reach bottom there and hous price are stabil   i think that would do a tremend amount of good for the financi system   it might lead to suffici improv as to avoid some of these consequ  you know  i do think that we have to take note of the fact that the two year govern yield is down about    basi point in real term sinc our last meet and that five year bond yield are down about    basi point in real term   that   s certain a market view on what   s happen to growth expect  and it   s not terribl inconsist with some of the figur that come out of the  book calcul   so obvious there are mix view  but i think it is veri hard to argu that both the modal growth forecast and the rest of that output forecast have not shift advers  with respect to inflat   again  peopl made these point as well   it is unfortun that we do have some instabl  some risk there   we saw some stabil of the dollar over the past six week   that is obvious not exogen   it depend on our behavior and our communic   i think oil price depend also to some extent on our polici  direct or indirect   we will be see some ugli near term inflat number with oil price increas  which we hope will move out of the data short  but we   re not sure   so obvious we have to watch that   i think there are a few thing that are slight help on that front   one is that  relat to the previous intermeet period  there   s more convict now that other countri may be eas monetari polici   in fact  we   ve seen cut in canada and the unit kingdom   i think that take a bit of the risk away from the dollar  i do not know how big the impact of the nation intellig es  about iran will be  but it certain reduc a bit the geopolit risk that has been around oil over the past coupl of year  but  of cours  i agre with governor   and mani other that  whatev we might be tempt to do in term of tri to get ahead of the financi condit and what i fulli believ will be ul  a main street problem as well as a wall street problem  we need to be high cogniz   this is not a ritual but an honest statement   of those implic for inflat expect and the dollar as well   so let me stop there  just ad that i think the situat is veri difficult and we need to recogn the uncertainti that we   re face   i believ that in respons we will have to make sure that we are suffici flexibl  open mind  will to accept new evid and new inform  and will to respond activ and quick when we do get that new inform   let me stop there  and let me now ask for volunt   oh  sorri   befor we do that    will introduc the polici go round
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the draft announc languag in tabl    which is unchang from the version distribut in the bluebook and which is includ in the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      as shown in section   of the left hand column  follow the octob meet the committe issu a statement that conclud that the upsid risk to inflat rough balanc the downsid risk to growth  suggest that the committe saw reason good odd that  after    basi point of eas  the stanc of polici would fo  sustain econom growth and price stabil over  e   as mani of you have note  howev  event over the intermeet period have undermin this view   the staff and the market have interpret incom inform as point to a distinct weaker outlook for the economi   as dave discuss  the staff has lower it forecast for aggreg demand in light of deterior condit in financi market  incom data on spend and output that were weaker than expect  and the higher path for energi price suggest by futur market   that weaker forecast for aggreg demand was reflect in a    basi point declin in the  book consist measur of the equilibrium real feder fund rate  which place it about    basi point below the current real feder fund rate   these develop have prompt the staff to tilt down it assum trajectori for monetari polici  with a    basi point eas at this meet and anoth   point move in        the assum eas is not quit fast enough to offset the advers shock to aggreg demand  and a small degre of econom slack consequ emerg over the next year or so that was not present in the octob  book   that slack can be seen as purpos  as the staff has also interpret incom inform as impli a modest advers shock to aggreg suppli   recent inflat data and higher energi price point to higher total and core inflat in the third and fourth quarter and  in the staff forecast  over the next few quarter as well   given the restraint on inflat result from the project emerg of modest slack  the staff judg that it assum path for monetari polici will leav total inflat and core inflat  respect  at the same     percent and     percent annual rate in      that were project in the octob  book   should the committe find the staff forecast persuas as a modal forecast  view that outcom as satisfactori  and see the risk around that project  while perhap larger than previous  as not sharpli skew in either direct  it might be inclin to eas polici by the quarter point assum in the staff forecast and adopt a statement along the line shown as altern b in tabl     like the staff  member might see the incom evid as suggest that the outlook for real activ has weaken and perhap that the downsid risk to growth have increas   the deterior in financi market  in particular  might be a sourc not onli of a downward revis to your outlook but also of a greater sens of uncertainti about prospect for aggreg demand   the financi system is deal with signific    materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     credit loss and result capit eros and constrict on balanc sheet capac  the eventu effect of those problem on the avail of credit to household and firm is unknown   in particular  the potenti interact of financi stress with real econom develop  especi those in the hous sector  are difficult to assess  in view of these consider  as shown in section   the suggest rational languag for altern b would state that econom growth is slow  would cite soften in recent spend data  and would indic that financi strain have increas in recent week   while the committe may see signific downsid risk to spend  it might also remain worri about the potenti for an increas in inflat pressur and might view inflat risk as have risen a bit over the past six week   the recent inflat pictur look slight less benign than it did earlier  moreov  the increas in oil futur price suggest that energi price could continu to boost overal and core inflat   member may also view downward pressur on the dollar as like to persist   the languag shown in section   would continu to cite the same concern about inflat that the committe has recogn in recent statement   in circumst of increas risk to growth and continu substanti inflat risk  the committe might  as back in septemb  prefer not to express an overal assess of the balanc of risk   as shown in section    the committe could say that    recent develop  includ the deterior in financi market condit  have increas the uncertainti surround the outlook for econom growth and inflat      howev  if the committe   s predilect is that further eas will probabl be necessari but it still wish to underscor it concern about inflat  you could insert a sentenc after the first sentenc in section   say that    on balanc  the committe see downsid risk to growth as have increas  but it must also remain attent to the upsid pressur on inflat      most dealer expect you to coupl a   point eas today with an assess that the risk are skew to the downsid  but even the version without an explicit risk assess probabl would be read as consist with further polici eas go forward  particular sinc you eas in octob follow a statement in septemb that was compar to the one shown in section     it might be worth note that mani market particip expect the feder reserv to augment it monetari polici action today with some announc regard the discount window   for exampl  a reduct in the primari credit spread   as the chairman note earlier today  the absenc of such a refer in today   s announc could prompt some investor disappoint  but given your monetari polici action under altern b  the effect on market interest rate seem like to be limit  and presum  ani effect today will be revers tomorrow   if the committe is alreadi persuad that the econom outlook has weaken more sharpli than in the  book or if it has becom signific more concern about the downsid risk to growth  it might prefer the    basi point eas of altern a   the committe might see the larger move at this  e as warrant particular by risk manag consider   the  book present two altern scenario   a    greater hous correct    and a    credit crunch      that illustr downsid risk and suggest that the committe may need to eas mark further over come quarter   in the case of the credit crunch scenario  for exampl  the es  version of the taylor rule call for a fund rate that trough at     percent  well below the low point current built into market interest rate   as shown in the second column  the languag suggest for altern a explicit cite both a weaker outlook and greater downsid risk in explain the relat larg polici move   as in altern b  the languag on inflat would be near unchang from that employ in octob   but in section   of altern a  the committe would indic a judgment that   follow the further reduct in interest rate   the upsid risk to inflat rough balanc the downsid risk to growth   or the risk languag shown in red in section   of altern b could instead be employ under altern a  this might be appropri if the committe felt that the same elev risk that motiv it to eas    basi point also suggest that it was difficult to weigh the remain risk after the action   in either case  short  and intermedi term market interest rate would like declin notic under altern a   in contempl the pros and con of altern a  one consider might be whether the committe view this combin of sharp eas and the associ languag  particular the version coupl with an inconclus risk assess  as like to lead market particip to worri about what inform the committe might have that would lead it to take such a substanti step  and so undermin investor confid   if  in contrast  the committe saw the downsid risk to growth as somewhat greater but was not yet convinc that the outlook had deterior substanti and remain concern about inflat prospect  it might consid implement of altern c   as indic in the right hand column  under this altern the committe would maintain the stanc of polici at this meet but conclud that the downsid risk to growth now are the predomin concern   with overal inflat on the high side and upward pressur stem from energi price and dollar depreci  member might be concern that polici eas could go too far   the stanc of polici has alreadi been eas    basi point despit onli limit evid to date that econom weak is spread to a signific degre beyond the hous sector   inde  as some of you suggest  the incom indic of slow growth over the intermeet period may be broad in line with what you expect in octob   if so  the committe may feel that it monetari polici action to date   and  at the margin  the establish of the taf as well as swap line with foreign central bank   probabl will provid suffici insur that financi problem will remain contain and will not great restrict the avail of credit to household and busi   thus member may believ that further eas is not and probabl will not be necessari   inde  member may find worrisom the prescript of the op  control simul in the bluebook that a slight degre of polici firm would be appropri over come quarter if the committe were pursu a     percent long run object for inflat   even with such uneas about inflat prospect  though  the committe may be suffici concern about the current threat to growth to judg that  on balanc  the risk are tilt to the downsid with an unchang stanc of polici   i will conclud by respond belat to a question that presid   pose at the last meet   he ask what the experi has been with includ an indic of downsid risk in the polici statement   in particular  would market like see such a risk assess as signal a likelihood of an immin polici eas   answer the question on the basi of the histor record is not entir straightforward  part becaus the committe   s practic have evolv over  e  as presid   note  it has been onli sinc      that the committe has releas a risk assess or some other form of a tilt along with it announc   despit some qualif  the basic answer seem to be  not surpris  that the risk assess have been predict of futur committe action   the experi from decemb      through januari      make this point clear   dure that period  at fourteen meet in a row the committe indic that    the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur      in eleven of those fourteen instanc  that indic was follow by a polici eas at the next meet   later  toward the end of       one of two indic of downsid risk was follow by an eas  and in june       a differ balanc of risk   one concern with disinfl   was follow by an eas   all in all  it seem reason to judg in current circumst that maintain the stanc of polici while assess that the risk are tilt to the downsid  as under altern c  would lead market particip to continu to put high odd on futur polici eas   but the absenc of polici action at this meet despit near unanim expect of polici eas would mean that the expect of a downtilt in rate would begin from a notabl higher level and might be less steep  prompt a signific upward shift in short  and intermedi term interest rate  that conclud my prepar remark
thank you veri much   question for     presid
thank you veri much for that answer   i have a clarifi question becaus i   m not quit sure i caught  in the way you talk about the econom risk in section   of altern b  how they could be ad   one thing that i want to ask about is that in section   there   s no mention of downsid econom risk   at least the five or six  e i read it  i couldn   t find it   that seem differ from altern c and altern a  and also the octob statement  at least in the balanc of risk  mention downsid risk to growth   is there a particular messag that we   re think about send with that   i guess part of the question is that  without some mention of expect slow  are we mayb undercut our novemb forecast that we publish   it seem natur that there would be some discuss about how thing have slow relat to what we were expect   i mean  that might be one way that those forecast would be interpret and use   but i lay that out as a question
presid    in respons to your first question  the suggest for section   of altern b would be to add after the    recent develop      sentenc     on balanc  the committe see downsid risk to growth as have increas  but it must also remain attent to the upsid pressur on inflat      with regard to your other question  i think that character whether the slow in econom growth right now is what you anticip may be a littl difficult   it is relat earli in term of the inform that   s avail for the fourth quarter  so it may be difficult to pin that down veri precis
ani other question   all right   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   weak in econom data report sinc the last meet  continu financi turmoil  and a forecast that place us uncomfort close to a recess call for action  and my strong prefer is for the decis action reflect in altern a   with well anchor inflat expect and the possibl of unemploy rise abov our es  of the nairu  the risk to inflat from this action seem quit low   howev  the possibl that the economi will soon be in a recess is too high  and our action should be signific enough to substanti reduc that risk
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   with respect to polici  i also favor altern a  a    basi point rate cut   let me explain my reason   otherwis i certain agre with what presid   said   first  i think the equilibrium real rate of interest is low relat to it long run averag   the rang of medium run measur of r  report in the bluebook is between     and     percent  and this rang includ the  book consist measur and the staff   s kalman filter model es  of     percent   market percept of futur real interest rate are also veri low  with yield on five year treasuri inflat index bond now below    percent  i think the headwind from financi market turmoil and the more general reassess of risk that is take place in global market are good reason whi the equilibrium real rate may be low in the current situat   we do have histor preced for this   for exampl  kalman filter es  of r  fell notic dure the credit crunch of the earli     s  given the current state of the economi with inflat near a level consist with price stabil and resourc util near it equilibrium level  polici should be close to neutral  which impli a nomin fund rate of   to    percent   the forecast and risk assess must also enter the analysi   with an assum    basi point cut at this meet  the  book forese the economi bare skirt a recess  so ani more bad news could put us over the edg  and the possibl of get bad news   in particular  a signific credit crunch   seem far from remot  to my mind  the risk to the forecast and the risk of a vicious cycl  in which deterior financi condit and a weaken economi and hous price feed on each other  argu for adopt a risk manag strategi that  at the veri minimum  move our polici stanc to the low end of neutral   name  a cut of    basi point   and i think it argu for do so now rather than take a    wait and see    approach and lower it onli grudg   this may not be enough to avoid a recess   we may soon need outright accommod   but it would at least help cushion the blow and lessen the risk of a prolong downturn   i should also say that my recommend assum that the implement of the taf  even if it succeed in improv liquid in the money market  will not appreci allevi macroeconom condit  regardless of the polici action taken at this meet  i think we need to be veri care in these unsettl condit about how we communic our assess of risk and like futur polici action   we should maintain maximum flexibl so that our futur action can  in governor kohn   s well chosen word  be nimbl   if the committe choos to cut the fund rate    point  i would favor the assess of risk from section    altern b  in tabl     this appropri leav open what the futur polici will be and stress that it depend on develop   if the committe goe with the    basi point cut  then i would support use the assess of risk from section    altern c  which state clear that the predomin concern is the downsid risk to growth   otherwis i fear that market particip may mark up their expect path for polici over the next year  lead to further eros in financi condit   final  i would suggest that  given the long period of  e between today and the next fomc meet  we be open to the possibl of a special intermeet videoconfer to assess econom and financi develop  and this meet could also benefit from an assess of the effect of the taf onc it   s in place
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor a   point reduct in the fund rate and the languag of altern b   perhap more than usual i think it is import to preserv some flexibl now to respond to incom inform   i would not be surpris if we want to reduc the fund rate anoth   point at the end of januari  but i don   t want to send a signal that would encourag market particip to presum anoth cut then   so i guess i am in the    grudg    camp to which presid   refer   besid  i would welcom a perman move away from the balanc of risk assess machineri   i do believ we face a good size risk of thing unravel and substanti weaker growth in the near term   but my sens is that the risk just isn   t larg enough to make me want to support    basi point now   while i wouldn   t be surpris with a januari rate cut  i don   t think it should be a foregon conclus   i think we need to be more deliber about such action as we go forward   the magnitud of the fallout from our mortgag problem could be substanti clearer in the first half of next year   if the fallout turn out to be smaller and more manag than we fear  the downsid risk to growth prospect could dissip  even though we still would be work through a bulg of mortgag reset and default  some of us have given a warn that we may need to revers cours prompt and rais rate should condit improv   you know  it is alway attract to comfort ourselv as we cut interest rate and to promis ourselv that we are will to do so  but there alway seem to be a reluct to start a sequenc of fund rate increas after a seri of rate cut   the usual thing is a fear of sort of an exagger reaction in the yield curv   these pressur are like to be especi acut if  when the  e come  we are still in the midst of signific distress among subprim mortgag borrow and the hous market   that seem like   so i think we need to be realist about prospect for revers field   to the extent that such pressur would be hard to resist   and i think they would be   we should be veri cautious  more cautious than we otherwis would be  about lower rate  anoth reason to be cautious is that overal inflat is well abov our target   as     point out  we have a record of forecast for food and energi price base on futur market price come in too op ist over the past sever year   i think we need to be concern about that   i am concern that market particip might have come to believ that we have place our concern about inflat entir on hold for the durat of the hous market difficulti we face   such a lexicograph reaction function is what led to the stop go polici pattern in the pre      era   so i believ it would be a mistak to take our eye entir off inflat right now   i am doubt that a forc restat of our assess of upsid inflat risk will be veri effect in that regard   we have been do that  and i think it is fall on increas deaf ear   i think that we may come to believ that action is requir to back up that sen ent   if inflat drift up or overal inflat  sn   t come down  i think we need to be prepar to respond to real weak less than we otherwis would have befor  thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i would say that when governor   talk about the import of maintain long anchor expect about inflat  i agre with that   i think that is more vulner than other do  and so if it were on the tabl  i would support maintain the rate   i think inflat risk are elev   i am uneasi about lower rate into a rise inflat environ  and i think we should have allow more  e for the    basi point to work   have said that  howev  i also acknowledg that the downsid risk to growth may be larger than i judg it to be   there is a lot of evid out there right now  and i have heard it from around the tabl   thus  i can accept the    basi point cut  if that is the committe   s prefer action   i would be veri uneasi with a    basi point cut at this  e  and i do not think a    basi point cut is warrant in conjunct with tomorrow   s announc of a term auction facil   i think that would send a signal to financi market that we view the outlook as more dire than it is  thus ad to financi turmoil rather than allevi it   so i ask the committe to keep that veri care in mind as we go forward with this discuss   thank you  mr  chairman
presid hoenig  did you have a view on the statement
i do   turn to the statement  i think the languag in altern b is the right languag  regardless of which   a  b  or c   we choos   i think in particular i would prefer that we not assess a balanc of risk and instead simpli state that recent event have increas the uncertainti on output and inflat   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b  includ the languag  and let me outlin how i get there   first  i think that it is import to recogn that the  book outlook alreadi take account  as best we can or as best the staff can  of a lot of the dismal financi news that is out there   there is a probabl distribut around that   we don   t want to doubl count the financi distress   it is alreadi in the baselin forecast  and we don   t want to think of all the weight of the financi distress effect as be down from there   so there could be an outcom that is certain stronger than the  book outcom   in fact  i think it is true histor  if you look at forecast accuraci  ani forecast  includ the  book staff    not have a standard error all that much below a veri nave outlook that just say that gdp will grow at potenti   so i believ that there is genuin weight abov the  book forecast in the probabl distribut  and i think the  book forecast is a veri good baselin for our discuss   second  clear  should the unemploy rate rise signific  credit problem are like to multipli rapid   we could have a great deal of distress that would accumul  possibl veri quick   on the other side  should the nonhous sector prove more resili than the  book forecast  we could be face by upsid surpris  especi on inflat  certain  i would come down hard on the side that follow a polici that tempor on inflat onli build in a much deeper problem in the futur  and it is better to take the medicin earli  if necessari  to deal with inflat  i would also note that  over next year  there will be an increas high bar on ani chang in the feder fund target   there is an elect in novemb   i have tremend confid in the nonpolit outlook of everi singl member of the committe  everi singl particip  inde it is a veri deep part of the cultur of the institut   nevertheless  there are t i issu involv with maintain the appear of imparti  and i think histor dure an elect year there is a strong presumpt to tri to stay as low key as possibl   the way you do that is not chang the fed fund rate target at all unless there is a realli good case  and that is increas true as you come up to the novemb elect   so as we go through the year  there is go to be an increas high bar  it seem to me  and if we overshoot on the eas side  it may be difficult to come back until         i think that everi cut is like to be perman through next year in ani event   that tell me that we should pursu a strategi   i say    we     but it is more    you    becaus the next meet is my last
you will be sail
not quit after that meet   it is still a littl cold    laughter   but my instinct is that we have demonstr a willing to act decis when there is a veri good case in the data   so if data come in with veri bad employ report  addit financi distress  and all of that  i don   t think there is ani question that the market will then anticip decis action   that wasn   t so true back in august  by the way  but the fact that there was a    basi point move in septemb has condit the market to respond differ   i would be in favor of a strategi that say at this point  if we inde go down anoth    basi point  we will have cut the target by       a strategi that is veri open but in a sens follow the market  now  if it turn out that we have a lot of weak news in the week ahead  the market is go to build in further rate cut   it will do a lot of the work for us without our have to be out front  you will get the benefit brought forward becaus the market is go to bid those in  and therefor  i think a strategi that tri to follow the data  to demonstr a clear willing to respond to the incom inform  give us the best chanc for stabil over the come year  despit the memo that i distribut  which i think was an option that we should consid  i think that we should not have ani balanc of risk view becaus it is high desir to leav everyth veri open   meet by meet  we  or you  will have to decid whether the case is be made from the data   of cours  i think that the speech and other communic will be veri import to tri to explain the strategi and the process by which we assess and respond to the data  maintain alway a longer term view and not get carri away with the most recent observ   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the action and languag of altern b   i think rate are too high right now to support the economi   s remain near full employ and higher than they need to be to contain inflat   when we left the meet last  e  we thought we might be where we need to be  but that was premis on a lack of spillov outsid the hous sector and improv financi market  and both of those have proven not to be the case   so i think we need to move   how much is a tough question   if we were to do     we would still have restrict polici base on the staff forecast becaus    basi point move the unemploy rate abov full employ   so it is still on the restrict side  even with    in the  book   of cours  we would be outrag tight relat to the market    expect of what we need to do   so i think    basi point still leav us a littl on the tight side  and i suspect we will have to do more over  e   but i am comfort do    at this meet  there is just a huge amount of uncertainti about how the financi market are evolv  especi befor the end of the year   i think we will have a littl better sens of what the net deterior is when we get past the year end  into januari  and see what effect  if ani  our auction facil has   some of the sign we have had in the incom data haven   t been that negat   the employ report   which is a realli key report  and the fact that there is continu growth in employ give me a littl reassur that we are not in some huge downdraft in the market and that we don   t need to move that aggress   we do have high headlin inflat that we are look at and some inflat risk   so i think at this point that    basi point would send a signal that the feder reserv is awak and on the job  and i would stick with languag that give us maximum flexibl  which i think altern b  section        presid   ask     what would a declin in the feder fund rate do      i think it would do quit a bit   it  sn   t address those loss direct  i agre   but i think it would offset some of the tighten in financi condit or would move in that direct   it would help asset price   i also ask myself when you ask that question  presid    what would happen if we didn   t lower rate   i think we would have much tighter financi condit in the market ad to what is alreadi a distress situat   so i realli think that the    will be benefici   a lot of peopl around the tabl have said   and presid   rais the question about whether there are some downsid risk   that somehow we could express someth more in the statement   i wouldn   t object  mr  chairman  if someon found some languag to put a littl more sens of downsid risk about the outlook somewher in the altern b statement  thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i think we clear should be reduc the feder fund rate at this point   while i think it is a close call  i guess i would come out with do a quarter at this meet   basic  i get there by just tri to weigh the risk   i think the princip risk is the dysfunct in financi market and what that could impli prospect for the perform of the economi   i think that is the basic case for take action now   i think the risk are asymmetr   i don   t see the same risk to the near or intermedi term in term of inflat outlook   yes  we may get some high headlin number  but we hope at least that those will dissip rather quick   so that is where i come out  i would support the languag under altern b   just to add one thought on that   you know  last  e we tri to character the balanc of risk  and i don   t think it turn out to be persuas   we would do well to be veri  veri cautious at this point   obvious  there is a lot of uncertainti out there  and at this point  discret is the better part of valor
rule versus discret    laughter   thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the last two meet  the committe cut the fund rate    basi point   we did so becaus the outlook for the economi has clear deterior relat to our view in earli august   we have argu that we have been act preemptiv to help forestal and to mitig potenti fallout from the deterior hous market and financi disrupt   how success have those rate cut been   i think it is too earli to tell   it is still true that the effect of monetari polici on the broader economi   especi on spend  output  and employ   oper with a consider lag   it is my guess that our previous cut or anyth we do today will not have measur effect on the broader economi in term of spend and output until late in the first quarter of next year and more like in the second and third quarter   so i don   t think anyth we do today will have an appreci effect  if ani  on the economi   s first quarter perform   thus  one   s view about the futur path of the economi dure the second half of       depend critic on what you think the effect of our decis will be go forward   now  contrari to what some may think  i am not immun to the drum beat of downbeat news that we have heard   i am keen awar of the concern express around this tabl and by other who are more concern and anticip a much more prolong period of reduc growth   i have mark down my forecast for the first half of        but my view of the second half has not chang veri much   thus  while i am okay with the    basi point cut at this meet  i would like to highlight that there are risk to that decis   i would oppos a    basi point cut  as suggest in my earlier remark  i do think that there are increas under inflat pressur  and although we have not seen inflationari expect chang veri much in the data  i do think they are fragil   befor i stop  i would just like to give one exampl of that concern   in the last philadelphia fed survey of profession forecast  conduct in earli novemb  we ask a special question   we ask panelist whether they believ that the fomc has an inflat target   about half the survey respond said that they believ the fomc has an inflat target  and of those  close to    percent respond that they thought our target was for core pce inflat   they also provid their view on what the target was   the median es  of that target was between     and     percent   among these forecast  almost all those who thought that we had a target also indic that their long term   that is  their ten year   forecast of pce core inflat was systemat    basi point     percentag point  higher than what they thought our target must be   we ask the forecast  if their forecast was differ from the target  whi it was   almost all the forecast present a variat on a veri similar theme   mani of them said     well  the fed realli has goal other than inflat     or    they wouldn   t stick to it     or    they would find it pain and  therefor  not commit to the goal     or    they lack credibl      now  this is a small subsampl of peopl   nevertheless  i find it interest that these profession forecast are realli not terribl sure about our commit to price stabil   the issu is not what they thought the target was per se but what the differenti between their forecast and the target was  final  just regard languag  i have been uncomfort for some  e with the practic of summar the balanc of risk  and i share presid     s concern in that i would like to get rid of it   so i would support altern b with the languag   i will also reiter the point that  while we may be make ourselv feel better  the fact is that we need to be prepar to act quick if thing revers themselv and we have to revers the rate cut   i agre with that   on the other hand  i think the histori of this institut is such that it is in fact more difficult to do than it is to say  so i think we need to have some caution   so i favor altern b and the languag as express   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i listen to the first go round comment  i chart everyon in a quadrant chart with high risk to growth and benign inflat in the upper left hand corner   then  i had of cours three other squar or quadrant  and so far i am seven for eight listen to the remark   so mayb this predict power has some influenc or some spillov into how i come out on this   i don   t suppos      would fli    laughter   you know  on balanc i find myself in the upper left hand quadrant  more concern about downsid risk to the economi and view  at least for the present  inflat as a relat benign consider   so given my sens of the downsid risk and the uncertainti that is associ with the financi market  my recommend is    basi point at this meet  and my prefer is to remain  as much as possibl  agnost on the januari action   i take note from the advic i get from some of my own staff that taylor rule project suggest that the medium term nomin equilibrium rate is about   percent  and   percent come the closest to be the like neutral rate   it is relat like that incom data will suggest that a cumul cut of at least    basi point is warrant by the end of januari   so in my view  move to that rate now is realli the most prudenti   in some respect  that is the most conserv and risk attent polici   i continu to adher to the risk manag perspect in deal with our challeng  and continu to take out insur against extrem downsid scenario seem correct to me   notwithstand the view that the fed is  and should be  reluct to take back a rate cut  i prefer face up to that difficult decis possibl next spring to undershoot the need of the situat and potenti compound the problem   so i don   t see a lot to be gain from an increment approach of    basi point cut   it has been argu with much valid that overnight liquid isn   t realli the problem and won   t cure the inform gap that beset the market   but i would argu that  given the profound unsettl state of the financi market  er on the side of more aggress action provid some insur against continu liquid seizur   to the extent that psycholog and confid matter   and i think they matter a great deal in these circumst   it is on it face a stronger messag  regard the statement  i actual prefer altern b   i think the finess  if you will  of the balanc of risk and it mention of increas uncertainti come closest to my view   so i suggest consider of the thrust of altern b  possibl with the insert that   mention  connect to a    basi point polici action   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i don   t think i could have said it better than governor kohn said it   i am on his wavelength   i would just add a coupl of thing that i would suggest we consid   first of all  with regard to the financi situat  which is obvious drive this convers  i appreci the medic patholog that the vice chairman suggest   we have gone now from cardiolog  which is my thing  to this fever and the fever break  and so on   i combin it with a bit of the strawman that governor   rais   no one has suggest a panacea   no one has suggest that the exist pool of ersatz money  outsid money  or shadow money is fulli suffici to reliev the stress the system is under   what has chang  howev  sinc the august crisi is the process of price discoveri   we are begin to actual get realist price   i spent twenti one year buy distress asset on wall street   i think i understand the process   it is a patient process  and it take  e   but i think that is the onli differ   we have begun the process  it has a long way to go   we have enorm risk  and i fulli agre with vice chairman   that there is signific risk that might stem from this  but let   s not also underst the fact that some adjust has begun and that is good news  i would suggest    basi point  mr  chairman  becaus i think we have to be veri wari of shoot an entir bolt here   if we do    basi point plus the taf plus the swap line   this is all veri subject   my opinion is that we would scare the hell out of the market   there is a signific risk if we send a signal  as was previous said   i think   may have said this   that we have inform that other peopl do not have   presid   refer to delic psycholog   from a risk manag standpoint  i think the psycholog is the opposit of what he state  which is that we are at risk of interf with the begin of the adjust process that i just describ   if peopl feel that we know more than they do  that we have greater fear of the downsid  you are go to see a delay in that adjust   they are want to step up and cherri pick a littl befor you start go through the whole orchard   so those would be the two factor that i would suggest   i want to come back to the last point   our job is to keep inflat at bay   the nomin anchor you mention is critic   i heard more peopl speak around this tabl about be worri about inflat than did not so speak  and a second to the last point   i agre with presid pool and the suggest of  i think        i would like to be like the reserv bank of australia and rais the rate despit the polit elect  if we had to   but i think the scrutini of this institut will be intens  and my prefer mode is just to stay out of the way   i think it is polit veri brave and possibl foolish to say that  well  if we do too much here  we can alway pull it back   there will be a lot differ circumst next year  and i worri that we may do too much   i would be against    basi point   i would be in favor of    basi point  and i would be in favor of altern b as state  if i had a vote   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor a   point reduct in the fed fund rate today   as i note earlier  assum some eas in polici  my forecast is that the economi will experi subpar growth stretch into the middl of      but then recov as we move into      and that inflat will remain contain   our forecast assum that the disrupt in financi market will generat more restrict credit condit for consum and busi than we have seen to date  though not to the degre assum in the  book baselin   in light of my outlook  i think that polici should be somewhat accommod  and given that i think the long run neutral nomin fund rate is somewher around     to    percent  i support further eas   given our expect of come financi restraint  there is a good chanc that we will ul  want to reduc the fund rate    basi point  but i prefer to go slower than that and move down onli    basi point today  the slow in consumpt that we have recent seen reflect onli a coupl of month of data that follow quit strong growth dure the summer  and much of that soften may reflect the transitori jump in gasolin price   so i don   t think it is clear that we have seen a real chang in the trajectori of consumpt   i think the degre of financi spillov built into the  book baselin is a plausibl scenario  but we have not seen such spillov yet   the pessimist view is a veri forward look one  and i applaud forward look think   i am not quit there yet  but that is definit a risk   i hesit to say that we will know more next meet becaus it is such an obvious thing to say  but i definit agre with governor kohn that by the end of januari we will at least have a better idea of how the taf fund went and how much of the recent increas in liquid demand and relat disrupt are transitori end of year problem as oppos to more fundament problem that would imping dramat on credit condit for nonfinanci borrow   we will also know more about the actual strength of consumpt and invest   anoth concern i have about a    basi point move today is that the public might see it as an indic that we have read the incom news more negat than i at least think we should have  so i agre with presid hoenig and   on that   this would have negat implic for the alreadi fragil state of consum and market sen ent  but from here to a   percent fed fund rate  i think that the inflat risk are accept   beyond that  i think it depend import on inflat develop and also develop in the economi  in term of the statement  i prefer altern b   i like the addit sentenc that   was suggest in section   for the balanc of risk   but howev that come out  in read section    when i was ask the question  it just seem to me natur that after    incom inform suggest that econom growth is slow    someth like    somewhat more than previous expect    might be help  but nobodi els has realli mention that  and i am okay with that  final  on the polit concern  my memori is that we rais the fund rate dure the      and      elect  so i am not realli concern about that  although peopl will wonder  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor a    basi point cut in our fed fund rate target and the languag in altern b   more loss at financi compani  in combin with uncertain year end fund pressur  obvious have unsettl financi market again   as i said earlier  sen ent about busi condit next year have becom consider more pessimist in the past few week   in this environ  lean toward caution and provid the ad short term liquid that market appear to need make sens to me   although i can see the argument for a    basi point adjust in our polici rate  i am inclin to think that a lesser polici respons is call for  as other have indic  it may be that a    basi point action is go to prove to be insuffici  and anoth cut might be necessari   but i am also mind that effort to address the problem that are affect the real economi have the potenti to aggrav inflat expect   inde  by some cut of the tip data and from a few report that i am receiv from busi contact about rise commod price and rise import price  inflat expect may be tug on their anchor just a bit   given these consider uncertainti  i think smaller move are prefer to larger one   at this  e  i simpli can   t assess with ani use precis how to weigh the risk we face  onli that the risk we face are veri difficult  consequ  i favor the languag express in altern b as it is current written   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b as is   without monetari polici action  it   strike me that the harm to the real economi could be larger and longer than otherwis   similar  i would say that without employ the liquid tool that we discuss when we met by videoconfer  monetari polici may well be insuffici to bring about real improv over a reason period of  e   so i like the combin as a veri use  natur experi to help us figur out what the diagnosi of the patient realli is   it   concern me that  if we go with    basi point today along with the taf  the swap  and other action  it would be harder to disentangl what exact ail these market  which is some combin of capit and liquid  with respect to the question of how much   again  back to the    or    basi point move   it strike me at least that this is a veri hard  e for us to be evalu what the equilibrium fed fund rate is   if polici is a function of both the fed fund rate target and what is go on and how capit market are read and process that inform  these market are in a period of incred dysfunct   that suggest to me that we should go slower and be more cautious in tri to get to equilibrium   it is easier to assess that when market are function at level that are superior to where they are function now  and i hope by the  e we meet next that the market will be give us a clearer read  so we can approach equilibrium or at least understand it better  final  with respect to some of the discuss around altern b  section    i think as written it give us maximum flexibl  as was referenc earlier   i don   t happen to think that market expect would be chang much if we ad a sentenc about downsid risk to growth   i think last  e around they took our uncertainti paragraph  learn that it meant that there was a rate cut come  and i don   t think we need to push farther than that at this point  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i think we have two front on which we have to work   both the macro risk  in particular the hous risk and the liquid issu  and their interact  as a lot of peopl have discuss   so i favor a    basi point reduct with the other action that we will be take with respect to liquid   the taf and the swap   i think it is veri import  at least in my think  to see them as a packag  to tri to work on both margin  becaus mani peopl have rais concern about the liquid issu perhap spill over into be real economi issu   so liquid issu turn into capit issu that can turn into credit constrict issu   with respect to the macro risk  most peopl around the tabl have said that those are real and that we need to work on those   then  of cours  there is an interact between the two   part of the reason for the difficulti of reviv the price discoveri process is uncertainti about what is go to happen in some market  particular hous market   so provid a littl more insur there is valuabl   but there is also a concern that  even independ of that  there could be liquid problem that caus difficulti  so work on these two front is certain veri valuabl   we will  then  have cut the feder fund rate     basi point and will have taken some step  both with the reduct of the differ between the fed fund rate and the discount rate and these new action  to tri to provid more liquid  with respect to the statement  i think the statement as it is in altern b is probabl the most effect   it is import for us to express the uncertainti with respect to the balanc of risk rather than tri to describ the balanc of risk   i don   t realli see what would be ad by talk about particular downsid risk when we can simpli say that there is uncertainti   i agre with governor   that the market would interpret this as that there may be more to come and that we will mind and watch what is go on   particular in the context of the new liquid action that we will be take  it is better to say that we are uncertain than to say that we are uncertain with downsid risk and then take these other action   it is more appropri for us to convey that the combin of action leav us uncertain becaus that  rather than uncertainti with downsid risk  may help unlock some of these market   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   the modal forecast suggest a cut of at least    basi point   in fact  it indic that we need to have further declin after that   as governor kohn point out  the    basi point cut still leav us as somewhat restrict   so we could just sit at a    basi point cut and not move further and keep our option open   i think governor kohn made a veri good argument for that   howev  i do realli worri about the signific probabl that thing could go south in a vicious circl   in that context  i think that the issu of macroeconom risk is realli a sever one  and an action of    basi point could help deal with that risk   so i would prefer altern a   if the committe were go that way  which it is not  i would have ad a sentenc about high uncertainti becaus i think the balanc of risk sentenc   creat certain problem   there is a question about whether you should have that at all   but if you have it in there in situat like this  we definit should emphas the uncertainti much more and use a sentenc like the one that is in altern b in that case  so let me just lay out this argument   would a    basi point cut matter   this is a question that presid   has ask   i think the answer is veri much    yes      it is not the actual cut itself that matter  it is the manag of expect that realli matter   in fact  whenev we make a    basi point cut and you ask     how big an impact   that have on the economi     the answer is     not a whole lot      that come out of our simul   it is realli the path of interest rate impli by our action that is import   in particular  the idea here of a    basi point cut is that  by get ahead of the curv  we provid a signal to the market that we would be will to take step to react to event in the financi market that might indic that we are get into a vicious circl type of situat   that is exact what i felt we did in the septemb meet   that move was veri success  and the market realli improv veri dramat afterward   the signal we were send at that point was that  if thing got much wors  we might have to do it again  now  as i said  we thought in octob that thing were look pretti good   i thought we had this great game plan  we were on board for the game plan  and  of cours  the game plan is unfortun out the window   so i think that take an action like a    basi point cut would have an import impact and would provid the signal and the manag of expect that can have critic implic for how the economi evolv  particular how the credit market evolv   it also rais the issu that one thing we do need to do  no matter what  is to indic to the market that we understand that our job is to prevent bad shock from propag in a veri bad way   we can   t prevent the shock   becaus thing happen   but our job is to make sure that they don   t propag in a veri bad way  the same issu come up in term of inflat   i have talk about the real side and the justif for a    basi point cut in that case   but what about inflat   normal this committe act in a veri inerti way  and under normal condit  there are good reason for do so in term of the way you manag expect about the term structur and so forth   but think that way about oper in a situat of financi disrupt is not the right way to think   in fact  the word that i realli like in this context is governor kohn   s    nimbl     which was exact the right word   you have to be nimbl   what do i mean by that   well  as all of us complet agre  keep inflat expect contain is the most critic thing that we do  we do need to worri about the real side of the economi  but we know that  if you unravel inflat expect  then the jig is up  and you get veri bad monetari polici outcom  not just for inflat but also for the real side of the economi   that is one of the key lesson that we have learn in the past fifti year about monetari polici   so the question here is  is this a problem   well  i don   t see that there is a problem right now with inflat expect get unhing  but it could happen  and could happen quick  in the futur   that say that we have to be awar of this and possibl chang polici veri quick and that the word is    nimbl      i don   t know if that is what you meant by    nimbl     but i like the word   this requir that we revers cours veri quick  now  the problem that presid   and other have rais is that the committe has not act that way in the past  and that realli is a serious concern of mine   there are way to oper differ on that  which is to recogn that if you are go to revers cours  you are not go to do it on the basi of what is go on in the real economi or what is go on in term of actual inflat   just as right now our decis is realli not so much about the incom econom data as much as it is about the problem in financi market and the credit disrupt  i think we are oper in a veri proactiv  forward look way   in that regard  we would have to act similar in term of think about inflat   there are two case in which there would be signal that we would have to act veri differ   one is that credit condit could improv veri quick   we are hope that this would happen  and actual some  you do see these thing just turn around on a dime   all of a sudden a virtuous circl occur   if that actual start to happen  it would be imper if we did a    basi point cut that we revers veri quick on that action   second  we have inform about inflat expect  and if we saw those number start to go in a bad direct  we should also oper veri quick in a revers direct   it is extrem import not to be in the taylor rule type of framework  where you wait to see actual inflat and output outcom to drive your polici   it realli has to be much more proactiv than that   there have been mistak in the past  at least in my viewpoint  when we could have react more quick   for exampl  in        it was veri appropri for us to cut rate the way we did   but we were a bit slow to rais them  and i think part of the reason was that we were react more to what was go on   i   m not sure   you can correct me in privat afterward  don   but i think that inertia was there  and if we think about do thing differ  it could work out veri well  i have to say that i do not worri about the polit issu of the elect   it is a chang in the way this committe oper  but i believ that we can chang    laughter   if we just think about it and have a framework with which to think about it  we could be much more nimbl than we were in the past  so let me finish   although i prefer altern a  i am go to accept altern b   i am perfect happi with the languag of altern b becaus i think there is a lot of uncertainti in the marketplac right now   in particular  i feel that show that the fomc has consensus in a veri difficult situat like this will be benefici to the market   if i were not will to accept altern b  it could creat some problem in term of the marketplac  and i certain am not will to do that   thank you veri much
thank you   thank you  everyon   oh  sorri   vice chairman    laughter
i support the reduct in the fed fund rate of    basi point and the languag in altern b for almost all the reason that were rais around the tabl   i just want to say two quick thing   one is that  if we start act as though we are constrain by the polit calendar of this countri and choos to shade our judgment one way or the other becaus of knowledg of that calendar  i think it would be a dark day for the futur of the central bank   i also think that mani of you are be a littl unfair to the histori of the committe   i am not sure you can look at the evid of monetari polici respons over the last two decad and say that there is systemat evid of a committe that is quick to lurch down and slow and reluct to tighten   if that were the case  you would have had a level of gdp volatil and a level of inflat expect and a volatil of inflat expect that are substanti higher than they have been relat to central bank that oper with a differ kind of regim   i wasn   t here for that period  but i am a littl surpris by the strength of the convict mani of you have express that we have been systemat vulner as a committe to that basic bias   but  mr  chairman  i like this option and the languag in it   i think the choic ahead of us are go to be harder than this one   we may have some    basi point move ahead of us  but i think at the moment this is the best of the altern
thank you   well  again  thank you  thank you all   i do think we need to move today   onc we take into account the drag from financi condit  arguabl the current rate is neutral or even somewhat restrict   for exampl  the taylor rule in the bluebook have the neutral rate between   and    percent   moreov  there has been quit a market chang   whether you look at market or look at simul  the frb us equilibrium real fund rate  for exampl  is down    basi point sinc the last meet  which of cours is just a summari of the revis of the forecast   on the other hand  you get similar number when you look at actual market indic   so i think there is a sens in which our polici becom de facto more restrict and need to be address   on top of that  there is some case for insur  although the discuss around the tabl illustr that that is a complex idea when you  in fact  have a dual mandat and there are risk in both direct  if the choic were between   and    basi point  i would be veri tempt to do    basi point   i think it would move us more toward accommod  and it would be veri pleasant to get the same kind of market respons we got after septemb in term of improv function and credit extens   that said  i think there are some risk to go with    basi point   i acknowledg what other have said  which is that it is not just about the rate but also about what the messag is   in particular the market alreadi expect us to eas quit a bit more   we are not push strong back against it with    basi point   if we do     we may be say to the market that we are will to do even more than you current expect   i think that pose some risk to inflat expect and pose some risk to the dollar  which is a littl fragil right now   you can imagin it even have revers effect with respect to the economi   for exampl  if it caus oil price to jump or if it caus nomin interest rate to rise  therebi rais nomin mortgag rate   the other concern i have is that  for better or wors  given our communic and market expect  at this point a    basi point cut would be view as someth of a lurch and might signal  as other have suggest  more concern or privat inform about the economi that we in fact don   t necessarili have   you can tell that i am quit conflict about it  and i think there is a good chanc that we may have to move further at subsequ meet   in that respect  it is veri import that both in our statement and in our intermeet communic that we signal our flexibl  our nimbl   we are not lock in  we are respons to condit on both side of the mandat  and we are alert to new develop  with all of that in mind   and although i don   t think the taf is realli a signific substitut for monetari polici  on the margin i think it is help   i recommend    basi point and altern b   i did not hear much support for a downsid risk sentenc  and i agre that ad it would probabl not veri substanti affect the signal that we are send today   so that is my propos   ani comment   if not  could you pleas call the roll
the vote today encompass the direct from the bluebook and the languag of altern b that was in the bluebook and in the handout   the direct read as follow      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     chairman bernank vice chairman    presid    presid hoenig governor kohn  governor    governor   presid pool  presid    governor   yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no yes
okay   thank you   we need to recess briefli here for the discount rate   meet recess
okay   whi don   t we reconven   again  thank you all   let me just reiter what i was say about the statement   i hope as we go through the intermeet period that we will tri to maintain our flexibl   as we discuss the outlook in public  we should of cours give our honest and full view on the outlook and the risk   but we should tri to maintain  with respect to polici action  flexibl in the abil to respond to new condit   that way i hope when we come to januari we will be abl to respond as the data and the market best indic  we are no longer do communic in our two day meet  so there is a question of what to do in that  e    laughter   we would like to suggest sever thing to the committe   first  as part of the intern process and the effort of the presid   s work group to studi the lesson that we have gain so far from financi turmoil  there are numer work stream go on about differ aspect of the turmoil  includ a lot of work be done by peopl in the system   so we would like to propos   and i hope that we would consid it complementari to our polici discuss   a present in januari by the staff on various polici lesson learn from the experi we have had with the financi turmoil  again  this is materi that will be feed into intern discuss about how polici  financi regul  and so on might respond to these situat in the futur   the subsequ two day meet is in april   the staff is work hard on the issu of interest on reserv   they would like to present to us what they have done and get feedback from us on some paramet of the process   it is in fact quit relev to our current situat becaus it bear on issu of monetari control   if we have interest on reserv  we would  for exampl  be better abl to manag the overnight fund rate   so if there is no object  we would like to put that on the schedul for april   subsequ to that  we would like to go back to our practic of have present on topic of interest   we would like to put special emphasi on research take place at reserv bank  and we will be send out a memo solicit idea from the committe and from the reserv bank in the hope that individu bank  in collabor with other  might take the lead in make present of relev research   so that is the current plan for two day meet   are there ani comment  okay   final  the next meet is tuesday and wednesday  januari    and      we will adjourn in a moment for lunch  and over lunch la  blanchard will give us a brief present of congression matter
mr  chairman  may i make one point about januari  which  as you are all awar  is that i don   t think ani of us   and it is realli not the staff   will be in a posit in januari to provid a definit set of convict about realli what work  what didn   t work  what realli contribut to it  and what we did to the incent that financi market particip face   just to make sure that we don   t rais expect too much for the committe  i think that it will be at best an initi  tentat diagnosi with some initi  tentat sens of the thing we want to look at and that it will probabl be the end of the begin  not the begin of the end  of that process    laughter   is that okay  mr  chairman
