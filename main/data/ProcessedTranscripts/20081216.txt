thank you  mr  chairman   unfortun this packag is a littl thicker than usual  but that   s the way it goe  i guess   the s ulus provid by monetari polici to the real economi depend not onli on the level of the feder fund rate but also on the health of the financi system   the abil of market particip to intermedi and act effect as the transmiss channel between the chang in the feder fund rate target and financi asset price is critic   when bank and dealer balanc sheet are constrain as they are now  this transmiss mechan is impair  and tradit monetari polici instrument becom limit in their abil to support econom activ      the materi use by mr    are attach to this transcript  appendix     decemb                of     the recent sharp deterior in the macroeconom outlook and the forc deleverag of the nonbank portion of the financi sector have led to sharp declin in asset valu dure the past few month   the consequ will be further big mark to market loss for invest and commerci bank trade book and a signific increas in loan loss provis on commerci bank loan book   these loss are like to intensifi the vise on financi firm balanc sheet  and that is like to further imped the feder reserv   s effort to eas financi condit   as a consequ  a broaden of our suit of liquid facil that bypass bank and dealer may prove to be necessari   equiti  corpor debt  and securit asset   especi commerci mortgag back secur  cmbs    have all been hard hit  and the commod sector  the prefer asset class of choic earlier in the year  has been clobber   as shown in exhibit   of the handout  u s  equiti price fell sharpli begin in septemb   although the aggreg index have bounc off their low point  the s p     index had still fallen    percent between the end of august and the end of novemb   this is the relev quarter for goldman sach and morgan stanley  which report this week   in the current calendar quarter  despit the rebound  the s p     index has declin about    percent   the carnag has also been evid abroad  especi in emerg market   the corpor debt market has scarc been more hospit   the high yield corpor bond yield for some broad index has climb abov    percent  exhibit      assum a    percent recoveri rate on default  yield level in this sector appear to fulli discount a default experi consist with the peak reach in the great depress   the securit market have perform littl better   not onli are most securit market shut to new issuanc  but also the yield on even the highest rate outstand tranch have climb sharpli   exhibit   illustr the current spread for differ type of aaa rate consum securit   credit card  auto loan  and student loan  exhibit   illustr the sharp deterior in valuat in the cmbs market   the left panel show spread on a basket of post      vintag   the right panel show the price perform of particular aaa rate cmbs tranch   most have fallen about    point in the past quarter   commod price also continu to plummet   as shown in exhibit    the declin have been particular pronounc in the energi and industri metal sector   in contrast  gold price have held up quit well  exhibit     especi sinc the octob fomc meet   gold price presum have been support by the drop in global short term interest rate  which reduc the carri cost of own gold   it is also possibl that gold is view as a hedg against the risk that central bank polici action could ul  prove inflationari   presum  the fear may be that the exit from these polici could be delay or prove more difficult to engin than general anticip   this poor perform of financi and real asset has a number of import implic   in particular  the earn of most major financi intermediari will be veri poor this quarter   for exampl  the two invest bank that report this decemb                of     week are almost certain like to record larg mark to market loss  the wall street journal report earlier that goldman sach will report a loss of around    billion when it report tomorrow morn   this may actual underst the carnag becaus compens book for previous quarter can be revers and the revers of incom tax paid will reduc the size of the loss   commerci bank will also not be spare when they report next month   not onli will they have signific loss on their trade book  but also loan loss provis are like to climb sharpli  jpmorgan indic last week that the current quarter has been terribl  and they have been one of the best perform commerci bank   the sharp declin in asset price is also like to reinforc the deleverag process that is occur throughout the financi sector   although hedg fund perform in novemb was better than in the previous month  preliminari figur show that the aggreg index continu to slide  exhibit      we   re down about    or    percent so far this year  and that   s the worst perform in hedg fund histori in the aggreg by a signific margin   although the redempt deadlin for year end have general pass  this pressur will persist into the first quarter and beyond for two reason   first  mani fund of fund manag will get anoth round of redempt request befor year end  which will caus them to ask for moni from the hedg fund that are part of their fund of fund famili in the first quarter  second  some hedg fund restrict or    gate    the rate of withdraw   for exampl  citadel suspend all redempt for their two biggest fund through march     this mean that there will be a backlog in unfulfil request that will take  e to satisfi   the bernard madoff scandal may also lead to addit redempt request   the loss suffer by dealer and bank mean that their balanc sheet constraint will continu to stymi the feder reserv   s effort to suppli liquid to prospect borrow   as shown in exhibit    recent taf auction have been undersubscrib  and as shown in exhibit    the amount of dollar liquid suppli via our swap line has stabil even though term libor remain elev well abov the minimum bid rate that we charg on those auction and the fact that swap are open end in size   the problem is no longer one of suppli suffici liquid to the bank and dealer   the problem is get these intermediari to pass the liquid onward to their client   balanc sheet constraint reveal themselv in mani guis   although libor oi spread have narrow somewhat  they remain veri elev relat to histor level  exhibit    and      jumbo mortgag rate spread remain wide relat to conform mortgag rate  exhibit      and cash instrument that take balanc sheet room trade at signific higher spread than the correspond deriv that don   t   exhibit    illustr the spread between high yield cash bond and the correspond cdx high yield deriv index   this widen in that basi is one reason that some bank have taken larg loss in the fourth quarter   evid that balanc sheet constraint are imped the avail and cost of credit continu to prolifer   this is obvious import becaus  if credit is not avail on reason term  this is like to exacerb the downward pressur on the economi  decemb                of     a darker econom outlook  in turn  threaten to lead to more loss and balanc sheet pressur  reinforc the downward dynam   in term of credit avail  the commerci mortgag area appear to be particular vulner   accord to industri sourc  about      billion of mortgag debt   most put on five to seven year ago   need to be refinanc when it come due in        in recent year  commerci bank and the cmbs market provid the major sourc of fund for the commerci mortgag market   the owner of this commerci real estat are worri that  without new feder reserv and treasuri initi  fund will not be avail to refin this mortgag debt in      on virtual ani term   invest grade and high yield corpor debt will also have to be refinanc   exhibit    illustr that more than      billion of term invest grade corpor debt will need to be refinanc in        so far  this market still look open for busi  but it may becom less so if the macroeconom environ continu to deterior   enough gloomi news   in the credit market  are there ani area that have shown improv   the answer  of cours  is    yes      in those area in which the feder govern  includ the feder reserv  has appli the most forc  the situat has general stabil or improv   let me briefli give a few exampl   first  the fdic fund guarante  the citigroup intervent  and the      billion of tarp money alloc for bank capit seem to have stabil the bank sector   as shown in exhibit    and     cds spread have been pretti stabl recent despit the deterior in the macroeconom outlook   second  the commerci paper fund facil  cpff  has led to signific improv in the commerci paper market  as shown in exhibit     the yield on high rate commerci paper have declin  as this has occur  the cpff has becom less attract  and the number of issuer and the amount of commerci paper purchas each day by the cpff have moder sharpli  exhibit       just as import  after an initi surg in which the cpff repres virtual all of the long date matur issuanc  the cpff share of long date issuanc has fallen signific  exhibit       so far  the cpff has work pretti much as design   third  our announc and purchas of agenc debt have brought in agenc debt spread relat to treasuri   for exampl  in the five year sector  debt spread for fanni mae and freddi mac have narrow more than    basi point sinc the last fomc meet   fourth  our announc that the feder reserv would purchas up to      billion in gse mortgag back secur has caus the spread between conform mortgag and treasuri to narrow sharpli   coupl with the fall in treasuri yield   encourag somewhat by the chairman   s suggest in a speech that the feder reserv might buy long date treasuri for the soma   this has caus conform mortgag rate to drop sharpli  exhibit         and       as a result  mortgag refinanc activ has climb sharpli   exhibit    illustr the spike upward in the mortgag banker associ mortgag applic to refin index that has occur in the past two week   decemb                of     exhibit    and    contrast the perform in market with feder govern intervent to those market without   spread have general narrow where there has been intervent and widen elsewher   the contrast in the behavior of spread suggest that one might wish to expand our exist facil further   the talf is an obvious potenti candid given that it could conceiv be extend in multipl dimens   includ the scope of asset class  vintag  and credit qualiti   in my opinion  the liquid facil should be view as part of our suit of monetari polici tool   the impuls of monetari polici to the real economi depend not just on the level of the feder fund rate but  more import  also on the impact on financi condit   in normal  e  movement in the feder fund rate result in move in financi condit in the same direct   market do the work  and financi condit eas as the feder fund rate is cut   but in extraordinari  e such as the present  in which bank and dealer are unwil to on lend liquid becaus of balanc sheet constraint  feder fund rate reduct alon may be ineffect in eas financi condit   in such an environ  special liquid facil that bypass the bank and dealer may prove necessari to eas financi condit  howev  expans of our liquid tool   blow up our balanc sheet   exhibit    show the growth of the balanc sheet and the chang in it composit over  e  sinc late septemb  the balanc sheet has grown sharpli main becaus of the expans of our foreign exchang swap program  shown in light blue   the cpff  shown in brown   and the taf program  shown in purpl    as shown in exhibit     which is a snapshot of our balanc sheet late last week  this has caus excess reserv to rise sharpli   the growth in excess reserv has been exacerb by the roll off of the treasuri sfp  supplementari financ program  bill   we peak at about      billion earlier  and now we have      billion of sfp bill on our balanc sheet   the treasuri was unwil to continu this program at it earlier level becaus of worri about reach the debt limit ceil in the first quarter and becaus they would have had to notifi the congress    day befor that   turn now to the desk   s effort to implement monetari polici and the fomc   s direct  the effect feder fund rate has continu to trade soft relat to the target rate  exhibit       the interest rate paid on excess reserv  ioer rate  has not been a perfect substitut for the treasuri sfp program   becaus the ioer rate for the two week reserv mainten period is set at the lowest level that occur any  dure that period  the sharp drop last thursday evid in the exhibit occur becaus bank anticip a substanti cut in the feder fund rate target and the ioer rate at this fomc meet   the drop in the effect rate has occur even though we have increas the rate paid on excess reserv to equal the feder fund rate target   although some of this soft in the effect rate relat to the target reflect the sale of feder fund by gses that are not elig to be paid interest on excess reserv  this is by no mean the whole stori   the unwilling of major bank to bid more aggress for these fund is an import factor   this unwilling to fulli arbitrag the gap between the ioer rate and the effect feder fund rate is anoth consequ of the lack of balanc sheet capac in the bank sector   although we are explor way to remov most of the gse effect from the pictur  even if we were to be success in do this  we expect that the decemb                of     balanc sheet constraint would still be power enough to caus the effect feder fund rate to trade soft relat to the target   also  if the gse feder fund volum were remov  it is not clear what the effect target would repres becaus trade volum could then turn out to be veri  veri low   the drop in the effect feder fund rate has been accompani by a correspond drop in other short term interest rate   in particular  general collater repo rate have collaps almost all the way to zero  exhibit       this is like to lead to a rise in treasuri fail becaus  when general collater repo rate are veri low  the cost of short treasuri secur becom neglig   as fail climb  in turn  this erod market function in the treasuri market and reduc the use of the treasuri market as a hedg vehicl for other fix incom asset   the effect of fail on treasuri market function can be seen in exhibit     which show how error in our treasuri yield curv model have increas as short term interest rate have fallen close to zero   in term of monetari polici expect  the feder fund rate futur curv  exhibit     and the eurodollar futur curv  exhibit     continu to shift lower  howev  with the effect feder fund rate persist trade below the target rate  it is unclear how much of this shift repres a chang in expect about what the committe will do with respect to the target   the primari dealer credit survey shed consider more light here   as shown in exhibit    and     rate expect have shift lower sinc the last fomc meet   all    respond to our most recent survey expect the fomc to reduc the target  with most     out of     call for a    basi point reduct in the target rate   no dealer expect a    basi point cut at this meet   two are at a    basi point cut  and one anticip a     basi point reduct in the target rate   a slim major     out of      expect a    basi point target to be the trough for the target rate   most expect that the fomc will not cut the target at futur meet  and no rate hike are expect by anyon until the second half of      at the earliest   compar exhibit    and     the most recent survey show consider less dispers in the four quarter ahead feder fund rate forecast   final  for complet  i includ our standard chart on inflat expect as measur by the board   s and barclay    measur of the five year  five year forward breakeven inflat rate  exhibit       i don   t think these breakeven rate provid much inform right now becaus the tip market has been heavili influenc by the sharp fall in cpi inflat that will accru to tip over the next few month and by the grow illiquid of tip versus nomin treasuri   interest  the most recent primari dealer survey show no chang in five year  five year forward expect for cpi inflat  with the averag of the group remain at     percent  there is  howev  somewhat greater dispers on both side indic uncertainti about how success the feder reserv will be in keep core pce inflat in the    comfort zone    of     to   percent on a longer term basi  exhibit      decemb                of     there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote as alway to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the octob fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
thank you   there was a sharp declin in the spike in the fail  recent
yes   there are two potenti explan  and it   s realli hard to sort out what   s drive it   one is just that trade volum have come down  and as trade volum have come down  fail have come down   so that   s part of it   it   s just tie to trade volum   the second explan is that the treasuri market practic group publish a best practic report basic argu that a penalti rate should be put on fail  and it is go to design a road map to show how that might be implement in practic   it may be that  given that public  peopl who befor might have been more cavali about short treasuri secur at veri low interest rate are now somewhat less inclin to do so just becaus of the moral suasion of that report that it is not a good thing to do   so it is some combin of those two  i think
thank you   question for bill   presid hoenig
bill  in your discuss on exhibit    and around the idea that a number of reset are come for mortgag   the earlier seven year arm and so forth   and as you also look forward to where mortgag rate are  whi are you anticip troubl with the abil to refin  given the outlook for mortgag rate
i think you have to distinguish between conform mortgag market and everyth els   the conform mortgag market is do fine   some spread are a littl wider than they have been histor  but our action seem to have been pretti success in bring those spread in a bit   so the conform mortgag market rate is fine   the problem is in decemb                 of     commerci mortgag back secur and nonconform mortgag   the appetit to provid financ there is veri  veri much impair  especi in the commerci mortgag market
right   okay   that clarifi   thank you
bill  has the fdic   s temporari liquid guarante program interf with or ad to the confus in the purchas and sale of fed fund  or has our exclud sale under one month chang the pictur
i don   t think it has creat much confus   the biggest confus is who is guarante and who is not and which instrument are guarante and which instrument are not   i think peopl will have troubl sort that out   most of the issuanc has been long term   three year   peopl say     well  if i   m pay    basi point  let me get the most valu for that      so there hasn   t realli been much channel conflict with the veri short end  and i think that the fact that one month and in is not cover also has reduc that potenti channel conflict
is that pretti well understood in the marketplac
i think so
then speak of guarante  i have just one more question  if i may  mr  chairman   in chart     are these net of credit that might have some kind of govern guarante
this is total   in fact  when you look at the issuanc of invest grade corpor debt recent  there   s quit a bit of it  but most of it is the guarante stuff
so exclud the guarante stuff  the issuanc volum do not look as robust as the aggreg number suggest becaus so much of that is the guarante stuff
i don   t have the number off the top of my head
it   s not this total
ani other question   presid bullard
at the begin of your comment  you said that you expect further big mark to market loss   do you mean over and abov what market anticip now
no   i mean that in the fourth quarter they will reflect the declin that occur from august    to novemb    for the invest bank   septemb    to decemb    just hasn   t been yet record on their balanc sheet   they haven   t announc it yet
you cite that goldman number of    billion  but that   s been wide report
that has been wide report   morgan stanley is also go to report this week  and it is high like they will have similar loss
then i just want to understand   on exhibit   you said someth about a fulli discount default rate last seen in the great depress   what did you mean by that
well  if you basic take that    percent and compar it with the default rate in the great depress and write down some number for recoveri  if you had a default rate equal to the great depress default rate and you had a    percent recoveri  you   d actual do pretti well own high yield debt at these level right now   so the level of yield fulli discount horrif default rate
in fair  these are junk bond   these are low rate compani
well  yes   it is possibl that we could have default rate greater than those of the great depress   i   m just say that these level discount that kind of outcom   obvious  the high yield debt market today is differ from general default rate   yeah  i think that   s a fair point
do we know   was there someth like a junk market in the great depress that we can compar this with
well  there were certain leverag util compani that you could argu were pretti junki
corpor grade becam junk in the great depress
michael milken hadn   t been born yet    laughter   presid
that   s a calcul that emb risk neutral into the extrapol
well  you could solv for the risk premium that was left over  and we did a back of the envelop calcul in new york on that   it was an excess return of about     basi point
sn   t that depend on the assumpt about the correl between
look   this is back of the envelop   obvious  you   d have to dig down pretti deepli to tri to separ what   s the default rate and what   s the risk premium   but the point here is that the market is discount veri advers outcom
i just want to follow up on that   would you say that that repres a tremend amount of pessim out there  or are you say that you think we   re go to get default rate like the great depress
no  i think it   s some combin   i don   t think you can realli separ how much of it is default rate versus how much of it is risk premium   the point is that there   s probabl a consider amount of both   clear the risk premium are high becaus we see risk premium on safe asset be veri  veri high   the classic exampl is the student loan  which is    percent guarante by the feder govern  trade at libor plus     or libor plus      that   s probabl a pretti good measur of risk premium   that   s your under risk premium on all asset  mayb a few hundr basi point
presid   has a two hander
first  about the risk premium  it   s either a lot of pessim or a lot of correl between default and bad state of the world and essenti low growth   the second thing  i took a look at the student loan asset back secur that you talk about   ffelp   i think you have a chart here   it turn out that the trust are guarante a rate of return equal to the commerci paper rate  and ani excess over that they have to return to the depart of educ  they get a payment if the return is below that   your coupon is     point abov libor  and libor is trade a bit abov commerci paper rate  right   so there   s a negat spread built into the trust document   they   re pay     basi point more than they   re earn on the trust   so a littl extra premium seem pretti reason   is my understand of that secur correct  bill
i think what you   re describ is the perspect from the issuer of the oblig   the issuer of the oblig has a problem becaus on one side they get commerci paper and on the other side they get libor  and so they have a mismatch   they have essenti a basi risk   but about where secur are trade in the market or what end investor can invest in the secur   i think you   re refer more to the issuer of the secur  and the chart i show is what investor in the aaa tranch get   so i think it   s a slight differ thing
well  wouldn   t investor want to discount or take into account the fact that the trust  which is their onli sourc of payment  is earn about     basi point less than the coupon   wouldn   t that show up in a higher premium on what the investor is will to pay
i don   t see it that way
presid    it   s a complic secur  but it   s wrap by a guarante that ul  the depart of educ will make good on to the tune of    cent on the dollar   there   s one littl detail that is caus anoth piec of friction in the market  and that is that  if the servic  sn   t perform on the loan  then the depart of educ has the right to not make good on the guarante   but other than that  it   s about    percent guarante
we think they   re pretti safe   not perfect safe  but pretti safe
appar the abil of the depart of educ not to make good on the guarante is veri rare exercis
but the depart of educ  sn   t guarante libor plus a     basi point coupon   it guarante the commerci paper rate
i believ bill   s point is that it guarante a return to the investor
that still  sn   t seem that irrat price   thank you
okay   other question for bill   if not  we need a motion to ratifi domest open market oper
i so move
ani object   all right   thank you   let   s turn now to    and we   ll have a staff present on the zero lower bound   i   m be remind that this is a decemb                 of     joint board   fomc meet   i   m reconven a board meet that began this morn   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as the committe request at your last meet  the staff has provid background for your discuss today of issu relat to the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate   ten day ago  we sent you    note cover lesson from the u s  and japanes experi in disinflationari or deflationari environ  the possibl cost to financi market and institut of veri low interest rate  the potenti benefit of further rate reduct  and the advantag and disadvantag of nonstandard approach to provid macroeconom s ulus that could be employ when the feder fund rate cannot be reduc further   numer staff member contribut to these note   too mani to recogn individu right now   but i would nevertheless like to thank them collect for their intens effort on this project when mani were alreadi quit busi with other import assign       will now summar the key conclus from the staff work  and then i will review the suggest question for discuss that we sent to you last week
thank you      by way of background  the  book and mani privat forecast project a sizabl drop in real gdp from mid      to mid       follow by sluggish growth into       even with short term interest rate bare abov zero and with substanti fiscal s ulus   the board staff and the median forecast in the decemb blue chip survey predict that unemploy will peak around      percent in        the  book forecast show core pce inflat drop below   percent in       mani privat forecast envis similar disinfl   moreov  respons to a special question in the latest blue chip survey indic that privat forecast see a sizabl risk of deflat  and stochast simul of frb us that take the  book forecast as the baselin suggest a rough   in   chanc that the core pce price index will declin over one or more of the next five year   in short  forecast general suggest that addit s ulus would be desir   with the target feder fund rate at   percent and the effect rate signific lower  the committe has littl scope for use convent monetari polici to s ul the economi   as a practic matter  the system   s larg liquid provid oper and the treasuri   s decis to scale back the supplementari financ program make it like that the effect feder fund rate will remain quit low into the new year   even so  the committe could choos to appli some addit s ulus by reduc it target feder fund rate and push the effect fund rate closer to zero   the research literatur strong suggest that a central bank should quick cut it target rate to zero when it face a substanti probabl that convent monetari polici will  in a few quarter  be constrain by the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate   but as discuss in sever of the note you receiv on decemb    decemb                 of     drive short term interest rate to zero would have cost as well as benefit   zero or near zero rate caus a high volum of fail in the treasuri secur market  lead to decreas liquid in that market and potenti in other fix incom market  and if short term rate remain veri close to zero  some money market fund probabl will close   such cost may argu against cut the target fund rate to zero and drive the effect rate closer to zero   whether or not the committe choos to cut it target rate to zero  policymak may find it help to expand the use of nonstandard monetari tool   in the current environ  use such tool has two potenti benefit   first  they may help the feder reserv achiev better expect outcom on both part of the dual mandat  second  nonstandard tool could help mitig the risk of an even more negat outcom   it may prove use to group nonstandard tool into four broad categori and treat each categori in turn   the first categori is simpl quantit eas   this approach use convent open market oper such as buy short term govern debt and conduct repurchas agreement to rais excess reserv in the bank system to a level well beyond that requir to drive short term interbank rate to zero   the object is to spur bank lend by ensur that bank have ampl fund at veri low cost   the japanes experi suggest that great expand excess reserv  per se  has limit success in spur bank lend  and thus has modest macroeconom effect  when bank and borrow have weak balanc sheet   the second categori of nonstandard polici tool is target open market purchas of longer term secur   the object here would be to reduc term spread or credit spread and thus

nonstandard polici tool   in current circumst  the committe might use such strategi in an effort to lower market expect of futur short term interest rate and thus reduc long term rate  or it might wish to prevent expect of deflat from take hold   i will mention three strategi that the committe might pursu   decemb                 of     first  research suggest that it would be help for the committe to be explicit about it longer term goal  particular about it goal for inflat   foreign experi support the theoret predict that an explicit and credibl inflat object help anchor longer run inflat expect and thus can help prevent a downward drift in expect inflat and an upward drift in real interest rate dure a protract period of high unemploy and slow inflat   that is  an explicit longer run inflat target can prevent the public from think that the feder reserv will allow inflat to remain persist below rate that the committe has previous said are desir   the committe has discuss the pros and con of a numer object for inflat sever  e   you may wish to consid whether the signific risk of deflat and the near certainti that the zero lower bound will constrain convent monetari polici have chang the cost   benefit calculus   second  the committe could announc that it will seek to run a somewhat higher rate of inflat for a number of year than it will seek in the long run   such a promis  if deem credibl  would s ul real activ by rais inflat expect and reduc medium  and long term real interest rate   research have propos sever approach for deal with the zero lower bound that would oper in this fashion  includ target a slowli rise price level   these approach would be a signific departur from histor practic  and so their pros and con would need to be evalu care   third  research suggest that it would be help for the committe to provid more explicit inform about it view on the like futur path of the feder fund rate   suppos  for exampl  that the committe conclud that it most like will need to keep the feder fund rate close to zero for some  e to spur an econom recoveri and to prevent a persist declin in inflat   in the current environ  an announc to that effect might lead market particip to expect the fund rate to remain near zero for a longer  e than they now think like  the announc might also lead to an increas in expect inflat   those chang in expect would lower nomin and real bond yield  provid some s ulus to econom activ   theori suggest that it would be import to make clear that the committe   s current view about the like futur path of polici is condit on current inform and the current outlook and to spell out how the actual polici path would depend on a rang of possibl futur outcom   communic this condit could be difficult   the bottom line from the staff   s analysi is that unconvent monetari polici tool can be use complement to well design fiscal s ulus and to step to recapit and strengthen the financi system   addit purchas of longer term secur  expans of target lend facil  and explicit statement of policymak    goal and intent all seem like to be use when convent monetari polici is constrain by the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate  our limit experi with these tool make it difficult to es  the amount of macroeconom s ulus that would be generat by each and thus make it difficult to calibr their applic   if the committe and the board choos to make greater decemb                 of     use of nonstandard tool now or in the near futur  it may be appropri to deal with the uncertainti by use the tool in combin   final  the bank of japan s experi suggest that nonstandard tool are more like to be effect if they are use aggress   i   ll now turn back to
the staff provid eight question to help frame your discuss  and those question are includ in the packag we have place befor you   a singl page with a blue cover sheet   i would like to comment briefli on each of them   the first question deal with the issu of whether polici adjust should be acceler when the zero bound loom  as the research literatur indic  or whether the committe should    keep it powder dri      for exampl  if it believ that the announc of rate cut have some special abil to buoy confid   in present circumst  a key practic consider is that the system   s liquid program have alreadi result in a veri low effect feder fund rate   absent a veri substanti unwind of those facil  the effect fund rate will remain close to zero for the forese futur even if the committe adopt a signific posit target for the feder fund rate   still  the announc of cut in the target rate probabl would trigger further reduct in the prime rate and thus in rate paid by a sizabl fraction of debtor   altern  the committe might set a target rate signific abov zero to convey it intent for the stanc of monetari polici over a period longer than the intermeet period   the second question concern your view of the cost of veri low interest rate  in the financi market  veri low short term rate are like to erod liquid  fail will increas  and the return avail on some short term invest simpli will not overcom the transact cost   the staff research conclud that certain financi intermediari  such as treasuri onli money market fund  will clear be advers affect by veri low interest rate  and those advers effect could have spillov effect into other market  such as the repo market   but not all financi institut will be hurt by low rate  there will be winner and loser  depend part on their asset   liabil mix   moreov  our work suggest that financi institut in the aggreg tend to benefit from the macroeconom s ulus of monetari polici eas   overal  judg the point at which the margin cost of rate reduct exceed the margin benefit is quit difficult   the third question ask whether you see a net benefit from communic your intent for inflat beyond the next few year or your view about the like stanc of monetari polici over some period longer than the intermeet period  specif  we suggest that you comment on the desir of state     that you intend to hold the fund rate at veri low level until specifi condit prevail      that the committe is concern about the risk of excess disinfl and will act to mitig that risk  or     that the committe will be will to temporarili accept higher rate of inflat in the next few year in order to limit the econom downturn    the materi use by mr  madigan are attach to this transcript  appendix     decemb                 of     and encourag recoveri   the draft statement present in the    polici altern    section of the bluebook includ languag that you might consid if you decid to pursu one or more of these possibl   question   through   cover nonstandard polici tool   question   ask your view about the benefit of larg open market oper in agenc debt  agenc mbs  and treasuri secur   such purchas are clear within the author of the fomc  and the staff research suggest that they have definit potenti to s ul econom activ by lower longer term interest rate  although calibr those effect is difficult   howev  member could be troubl by the fact that purchas of agenc debt and mbs could be regard as steer fund to the gses and to particular econom sector   in your respons to this question  you may want to comment on whether you are concern by the credit alloc aspect of such purchas   you may also want to provid your view on the channel through which purchas of treasuri or agenc secur would have a benefici effect   in particular  do you see the power of such tool as aris from their effect in reduc long term yield and spread and support aggreg demand through those channel   or would you emphas the increas in excess reserv and the monetari base that would accompani such purchas and the possibl effect on bank lend   question   relat to liquid facil   as   note  the creation of addit lend facil is anoth potenti power polici tool for the feder reserv   particular in current circumst  in which credit flow in some market are sever disrupt   some of those facil appear to have been success in support credit flow and thus econom activ   but even though further addit or expans could be help to credit intermedi  take these step would involv a number of substant issu   also  the design  implement  and ongo oper of such facil pose real resourc challeng to the system  moreov  these program rais govern issu   becaus such program general reli on the section       lend author  author of these program is the respons of the board  and the decis to lend is made by the reserv bank   at the same  e  these program creat reserv and thus potenti affect the fomc   s abil to influenc the fund rate   question   is open end   do you see other nonstandard polici tool besid open market purchas and liquid facil as like to be particular help in current circumst   if so  what are those tool   question   return to govern issu   given that the desk has begun to purchas agenc debt and mbs  how should the fomc specifi it direct to the desk   if the committe instruct the desk to undertak purchas in order to attain specif object for interest rate level or rate spread  serious practic issu could aris   longer term yield are heavili affect by expect of futur polici rate  which are in turn import driven by incom econom news as well as by various risk premium   experi indic that our oper have an effect on longer term yield  but to have an effect that is econom signific  the decemb                 of     oper may need to be veri larg   even then  given the substanti effect of the other factor that affect yield  it might be veri difficult or imposs to achiev specifi rate level or spread   as an altern  the committe could instruct the desk to purchas specif quantiti of particular type of oblig   such an approach is clear feasibl  but it potenti benefit may be harder to communic to the public except in qualit term   anoth issu is whether the direct should be condit on market develop   the bluebook provid draft of direct in which the basic approach is to specifi quantiti of purchas over specifi period of  e but with some allow for qualit judgment about market condit   question   come back to communic issu   if the committe embark on the use of unconvent polici tool  clear communic the natur of the polici and the intend object will be challeng   for exampl  onc the committe has formal brought it target for the feder fund rate to around zero or otherwis has signal that further rate reduct will not be forthcom  there will sure be press stori assert that the committe has    run out of ammunit     potenti undermin the committe   s messag that monetari polici still can provid consider s ulus   overcom these communic challeng will be somewhat easier if the committe is abl to agre on the substanc of what it is tri to accomplish and a broad approach to explain it to the public   but achiev such agreement is complic by signific remain uncertainti about the effect of the various unconvent polici tool  a veri uncertain econom outlook  and other factor   in your remark  you may wish to provid your view of the best practic mean for the committe to address these communic challeng   thank you   we would be happi to respond to your question
thank you veri much   i would like to give special thank to the staff  some of whom are here and some of whom are not  for an extraordinari amount of work on these difficult topic over a short period of  e   we veri much appreci those effort  are there question for   or   or anyon els   if there are no question  we   re readi for the go round on this topic   i   d like to ask your indulg   there   s an aw lot here  and i   d like to go first this  e and tri to clear out some underbrush and to lay down some issu in the hope that it will perhap focus our discuss a bit more  as you know  we are at a histor junctur   both for the u s  economi and for the feder reserv   the financi and econom crisi is sever despit extraordinari effort not onli by the feder reserv but also by other policymak here and around the world   with respect to decemb                 of     monetari polici  we are at this point move away from the standard interest rate target approach and  of necess  move toward new approach   obvious  these are veri deep and difficult issu that we are go to have to address collect today and tomorrow   i want to say that  although we are certain move in a new direct and the outlin of that new direct are not yet clear  this is a work in progress   the discuss we   re have today is a begin   it   s not a conclus   everyon can rest assur that this convers is go to continu for addit meet  and today we   re not go to be set in stone an approach that will be use indefinit  in fact  it would be hubrist to do so  given all the uncertainti and chang that we face   i   m not go to tri to address all of these question  but i thought it would be use for me to talk a bit  first  about nontradit polici and then  second  about the import issu of govern  which i know a lot of peopl are concern about  so let me start  first  with nontradit polici   i want to note that we are work and we should continu to work to improv our control of the effect fund rate   the interest rate paid on reserv is not current suffici to keep the rate at the target   that   s for a lot of reason with which you are all familiar   i would just note that the staff is still work   we should not give up on that   the interest rate on reserv may be more effect as peopl get use to it  as balanc sheet constraint eas  and as the rate get higher if we decid to rais rate   so i think that is still a tool that we should keep and be awar of   there are other strategi   open term account of various kind  take step to encourag arbitrag  use treasuri bill  or perhap issu our own bill   in fact  we have had a lengthi discuss in this committe of altern structur for implement monetari polici that involv differ way of set up reserv requir  so first of all  let   s just acknowledg that  although we are not keep the effect fund rate at the target current  we should not assum that that   s alway go to be the case   we do decemb                 of     have some option in that direct   that be said  it   s obvious that the effect fund rate now is quit low  and given the amount of excess reserv in the system  we   re go to have to find other way at least in the near term to address the econom crisi   one approach  as was discuss by   and other  is communic   here  in particular  i think  we are at earli stage   i don   t think we   re go to come to ani conclus today   there is a lot of interest in term of possibl   the one thing i would say is that  if we do use communic as a way of provid inform about futur polici move  we should be veri care to make those interest rate forecast  if you will  condit on the state of the economi   it should be veri clear  if we give forward guidanc of some kind  that the evolut of the polici rate will depend on how the economi evolv   the more clariti we can provid in that direct  the more effect our polici will be and the less problem we will have exit from that strategi in the futur  the statement that were circul in the bluebook gave two exampl just for discuss  both of them in altern a   in paragraph    there was some suggest languag for use an inflat target as a way of manag expect   let me just read the sentenc      in support of it dual mandat  the committe will seek to achiev a rate of inflat  as measur by the price index for person consumpt expenditur  of about   percent in the medium term      the idea there would be to tri to stabil inflat expect  avert deflationari expect  and keep real rate lower than they otherwis would be   the   percent in that statement is a placehold  obvious if we do this  we would have to talk more about what   percent mean   is it a perman level   is it a temporari number   but that is one strategi  i would add that  of cours  as we have discuss  adopt what might be a de facto inflat target is a pretti big deal  and if we decid to do that  i would like to have some opportun to consult with the congress appropri   but if we decid to go in this direct  i do decemb                 of     think that this might be a good  e becaus it is certain not a negat as far as employ growth is concern in this context  and so it might be easier to explain  the other exampl of communic  also in altern a  tie polici to econom forecast      the committe anticip that weak econom condit are like to warrant feder fund rate near zero for some  e      i note that this is a forecast of polici rather than a commit to polici  but it   provid some inform about the committe   s expect and should affect market rate   so  again  i think we   re at earli stage of this particular approach  but it may be promis  and i hope today   s discuss will provid some insight  the second general approach to conduct nontradit monetari polici is by use of the balanc sheet   we have alreadi begun to do this to some extent  as you know   in some respect our polici are similar to the quantit eas of the japanes  but i would argu that  when you look at it more care  what we   re do is fundament differ from the japanes approach   let me talk about that a bit   the japanes approach  the quantit eas approach  was focus on the liabil side of the balanc sheet   specif the quantiti of bank reserv  the monetari base  or howev you want to put it  in the system   the theori behind quantit eas was that provid enorm amount of veri cheap liquid to bank  as   discuss  would encourag them to lend and that lend  in turn  would increas the broader measur of the money suppli  which in turn would rais price and s ul asset price  and so on  and that would suffic to s ul the economi   again  the focus of the quantit eas was on the liabil side  and inde  there were target  as you know  for the amount of excess reserv or reserv in the system  i think that the verdict on quantit eas is fair negat   it didn   t seem to have a great deal of effect  most becaus bank would not lend out the reserv that they were hold   the one thing that it did seem to do was affect expect of polici rate becaus everyon understood it would decemb                 of     take some  e to unwind the quantit eas   therefor  that push out into the futur the increas in the polici rate  so i would argu that what we are do is differ from quantit eas becaus  unlik the japanes focus on the liabil side of the balanc sheet  we are focus on the asset side of the balanc sheet   in particular  we have adopt a seri of program  all of which involv some type of lend or asset purchas  which has brought onto our balanc sheet secur other than the typic treasuri that we usual transact in   you are all awar of the lend facil for bank and dealer  the swap with foreign central bank  the promis purchas of mbs  the various credit facil for which even i do not know all the acronym anymor    laughter   in this case  rather than be a target of polici  the quantiti of excess reserv in the system is a byproduct of the decis to make these various type of credit avail   i think that   s a veri differ strategi  and bill gave some evid   we can debat it further   that these differ polici have had some effect on the market at which they   re aim  again  to distinguish between the balanc sheet  quantit eas  liabil side approach and the asset side approach that we have been use  i do not think   and i feel this quit strong   that it make ani sens for us to have or tri to describ monetari polici with a singl number  which is the size of the balanc sheet or the size of our liabil  as the japanes did   there are a number of reason for this  but the least import reason is probabl just the fact that mani of our program don   t have fix size   they are open end   like the swap program  for exampl  also  mani of the program have differ  e  differ durat  matur  begin point  end point  and the like  and so in that respect i think it would be difficult to put in a singl number   more import  the program on the asset side of our balanc sheet serv differ purpos and have differ structur  and aggreg a dollar of mbs purchas  a dollar of decemb                 of     commerci paper purchas  and a dollar of swap to make three dollar strike me as be appl and orang   i do not think that is the right way to think about it   furthermor  and final  these program obvious have differ oper cost and risk  differ risk of loss  differ matur  and most import  they present differ issu with respect to the exit strategi  which we will want to talk about   rather than look at this as a singl number  as a measur of the liabil side of the balanc sheet  i think we ought to think about it as a portfolio of asset  a combin of thing that we are do on the asset side of our balanc sheet  that have specif purpos and that may or may not be effect  but we can look at them individu  let me turn now quick to the govern issu   befor get into them  let me just say that  whatev difficulti we may have find appropri govern  it is certain the case that the feder reserv act did not exact contempl the situat in which we find ourselv today  i think we all agre that get the right polici for the u s  economi is the top prioriti and  whatev we do  we need to find a way to get the right polici in place   frank  i think the best way to achiev that   i am go to talk about some detail   is through oper in good faith  if we work togeth and keep each other appris of develop and our view  we will be abl to make this work   if we take too narrow an approach  too legalist an approach  i think it will be much more difficult  so let me make a few comment   i think i can focus this best by simpli answer the question   if the feder fund rate is at zero and the fomc no longer set the target  then what is the role of the fomc in monetari polici   i have four answer to that question   the first is that the feder reserv   s outlook is the fomc   s outlook   that is  the fomc   s view about the evolut of the economi  of price  and of financi condit will govern our polici decis  in particular  it is the fomc   s outlook that appear in the minut  it is the fomc   s outlook that decemb                 of     appear in the project  and it is the fomc   s outlook that appear in our communic  therefor  if your board member ask you with respect to monetari polici     well  what are we do now     the answer is     keep tell us what you are see in the economi and financi market   we will transmit that to the full fomc becaus the fomc   s outlook is the perspect that govern the polici action that we take     the second role of the fomc  i believ  is in the communic polici  both in the narrow and in the larg   in the narrow  if we decid to adopt a target  make a commit about the length of  e in which we hold rate low  or make ani other kind of verbal promis in our statement or in other context  that is obvious the fomc   s prerog  and i think we understand that that   s how it would work  the third area is the most difficult one  and that has to do with the balanc sheet   the law provid a kind of odd co depend  if you will  between the board and the fomc with respect to the balanc sheet   both the board and the fomc are enjoin by the feder reserv act to pursu the dual mandat  and both the board and the fomc have power that affect the size and composit of the balanc sheet   in particular  the fomc has author over treasuri  agenc purchas  and swap  wherea the board has  in particular  the       author  which has been util a lot late for credit program   so we have dual author  and we have dual or joint respons   i think the onli way to deal with that essenti is through close consult and collabor   my commit to you is that we will work togeth even more close  even more collegi  go forward to make sure that everyon is on board and understand what we are do with respect to our various program on the asset side of our balanc sheet and that each person on this committe is well inform and is abl to give view and input into the discuss that we have  decemb                 of     the legal author are what they are  but i do think that a collect and cooper effort can help us solv this problem   in particular  i understand that the brief session that i have provid have been use   i am will to commit to do those as frequent as necessari  and i am will to make them into meet if we need to have two way discuss and input from the committe with respect to polici action   so it is a bit awkward  but i hope that cooper will allow us to work togeth on the balanc sheet  now  there is a special issu here  though  which is the unwind issu   one way in which the balanc sheet affect the respons of the fomc is that  if the fomc is go to be rais interest rate at some point in the futur  clear  it need to have inform and understand about the constraint be place on polici by the size and composit of the balanc sheet   so i think that keep the fomc as a whole inform about the balanc sheet  about the program  about the constraint that may be place on the unwind  and about altern strategi for rais rate onc the  e come  is incumb upon me and the rest of the board to do   as a down payment on that  i have ask bill    if there is  e tomorrow  to give you a bit of an updat on the talf  the asset back secur loan facil  and talk to you about some issu that it rais for the unwind and for futur interest rate polici  fourth  and final  with respect to the fomc respons  is communic to the public   the public  sn   t make the distinct between the board of governor and the fomc  the public understand the feder reserv   what we need to do is to come togeth and decid what polici we want to pursu and then collect take respons for those polici and communic them in a coher and consist way to the broad public   that is the respons of all of us  and i hope we can work togeth to provid everybodi with the inform that they need to do that effect   in particular  i am go to say that  given the decemb                 of     state of confid in the market and in the economi  i hope whatev disagr we may have that as much as possibl we can keep them within these wall   with respect to the public  we need  as much as possibl  to communic a clear strategi go forward  so those are just some thought on govern   i recogn the problem   i am eager to hear your view about how to do it better   i am also interest in know how you think these govern issu should translat into the statement and into the direct   i think we have thrown out some suggest there   we are not in ani way wed to them   if other peopl have other idea  we are veri open to adopt those idea   but at least i want to say that i am fulli awar of these issu  and i think that howev mani structur we may impos  noth is go to substitut for a good faith  collabor effort in make this work   let me stop there and begin the go round with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   let me echo your comment about the staff   s work   they have provid us with a veri comprehens compendium of research and experi relev to the polici problem that we are face now   and they have present it in a surpris digest form  all thing consid    laughter   this was no small feat  as you and   note  given the other demand on the staff   s  e over the past few month  clear  as you said  mr  chairman  this is a critic moment for the fed and the economi   whatev we do and say at this meet is go to mark a discret chang in the way we have conduct polici and communic about it to the public in recent year   some of this chang  as has been note  is alreadi under way   we exhaust our abil to  il the addit reserv creat through credit expans at about the same  e we implement interest on excess reserv   begin with this meet  we have to articul how we would decemb                 of     intend to conduct monetari polici and pursu the goal of our dual mandat with the fund rate at a veri  veri low level  perhap zero  and perhap for a veri extend period of  e  befor address specif the question that   has laid out for us  i want to make clear what i think is one of the central issu at hand  and that is the committe   s control over the monetari base and it conduct of monetari polici   when we target the fed fund rate at ani rate abov zero  we instruct the desk to manag reserv or  equival  the monetari base so as to keep the effect fund rate at our target   monetari polici has alway been about control the base  and this continu to be true at the zero lower bound on interest rate   in fact  the path of the monetari base is even more critic at the zero bound becaus that is how we prevent deflat   by manag the public   s expect about futur base growth and futur inflat  we manag current real rate and influenc real activ   in essenc  we prevent deflat by convinc the public that futur base growth will be inconsist with a fall price level  just as a thought experi  imagin that we commit to keep interest rate at the zero bound for an extrem long  e period  say infinit   if we do that   this is a clear result from the literatur   it   not prevent a deflationari equilibrium   but if we can commit to keep the monetari base at a finit level  not fall  then that   rule out a deflationari equilibrium  so it is key that expect about the base  not just nomin interest rate  are vital for our abil to prevent a deflationari equilibrium  i think that focus on the monetari base is go to help communic  and the reason is that a lot of peopl out there might not understand the relationship between credit spread and growth or inflat or various other thing that we are do   but in almost everyon   s mind is the phrase    too much money chase too few good      it provid  for a lot of decemb                 of     peopl  an intuit link between money and inflat  and i think we   for all the wart of our polici in the earli     s under chairman volcker   exploit that well  to convey to the public that we were commit to bring inflat down in a simpl  intuit way   i think that can help us now  analog  in convinc the public that we are go to be abl to prevent deflat becaus we control money  the committe   s manag of the base or bank reserv is distinct  in my view   as you note  mr  chairman   from the initi that use our balanc sheet to target specif financi market spread   credit market program may have macroeconom effect   inde  that is their intend effect   to have benefici macroeconom effect on growth and inflat  it is the same as other fiscal polici initi that also may have macroeconom effect   but they are not monetari polici  and i think that is fair clear  this committe  i take it as given  is respons for monetari polici   at the end of the day  monetari polici is about control the monetari base or bank reserv   from the point of view of fomc polici  what is import about the nonstandard tool and credit market program is their effect on the monetari base   again  to make this contrast stark  a policymak control spread cannot prevent deflat   a monetari polici maker control the base can  i should note that the abil to pay interest on reserv mean that we face this issu generic  whether or not the fund rate is zero  becaus now  with interest on reserv  we can vari the monetari base independ of how we vari the feder fund rate   this make it even more import that we make this transit in a way that clarifi the committe   s role  turn now to     s question  i think the most import one is number    the one about the direct to the desk   i believ that  if the direct is not go to specifi a numer target for the fund rate  then we need to find a way to specifi some numer target or rang for decemb                 of     the growth in the monetari base or the growth in bank reserv   now  i realiz that the direct is to the desk  which has control over the soma account  and under a strict constructionist interpret  that  sn   t necessarili equal the quantiti of the monetari base   in fact  the discrep has gotten fair larg now with all of these credit program   but if the committe  sn   t provid direct about the interest rate  that is fix at a floor  and if the committe  sn   t provid direct about a monetari aggreg  the committe realli isn   t do monetari polici  in my view   the committe can also choos specif asset categori for the desk to buy for the system open market account  but that shouldn   t be confus with monetari polici as long as the monetari base is be determin at the margin by our credit program   to put it slight differ  individu reserv bank can propos their own credit program  subject to the board of governor    approv   but if they want to monet those asset  then i would expect that the committe   s prior approv would be requir if an alter in the base target were need   that is what i would propos for the direct  question   flow direct from question     what we should communic is that we are target a quantiti of the monetari base or bank reserv  and this communic should be made in a way that is broad similar to the way we talk about interest rate polici  state that our goal are for growth in the monetari base that support the achiev of sustain real growth and our medium term goal for inflat  question   also deal with communic  but more from the point of view of the fund rate path   i think in the present environ we should communic that we anticip that it will be near zero for some  e   or someth to that effect   regard part b of question    instead of cite the risk of deflat  i think we should presum some measur of success and communic that we intend to use the growth of reserv to minim the risk of inflat decemb                 of     run below our medium term inflat goal   regard part c  i think we should stick to communic our goal for inflat  question   and   are about the mean by which we grow our balanc sheet and the monetari base  and i think the committe should strive to maintain as much distanc as possibl from credit alloc   to me that mean tri to have as littl effect as possibl on relat price among nonmonetari asset  and i say that becaus i don   t think we realli know enough to second guess those outcom   so i would like to see us focus on long term treasuri  let me close with a few remark about the committe   in the     s  each individu reserv bank made open market oper decis on it own  in an uncoordin way   that prove ineffect  and at  e we were oper at cross purpos  one reserv bank sell while anoth was buy   in respons  the confer of presid form the open market invest committe to coordin our decis and make all the purchas through the good offic of the feder reserv bank of new york   but the role of the board of governor in that committe was unclear   in fact  the board at  e tri to order the open market invest committe to do thing that the presid didn   t want it to do  and they came to an impass  this was remedi with the legisl of the     s that creat the feder open market committe  now we do thing that weren   t envis then  that   s for sure   but  sure  the guid principl there was that they want one singl govern bodi in the feder reserv system to be respons for the monetari condit in our countri  and i take that to be the guid spirit of the fomc as well   this is the onli bodi in the feder reserv system in which we all come togeth as one and subject ourselv to the disciplin of listen to each other   s differ view and form a workabl consensus on the way forward   i agre  mr  chairman  that we decemb                 of     shouldn   t be split hair about legal niceti about who is respons for what   i agre wholeheart that we should work toward consensus for that  and that is whi i think the committe has to have a serious role in monetari polici   i don   t think that focus the committe   s decis on just what the system open market account   and leav all these other program to have whatev affect they might on the base is the right way forward   thank you
i won   t tri to respond  but i do want to ask you what your interpret of the japanes experi is   they had enorm increas in the base  no increas in m   and no inflat
first  let me say that there are model and set of polici rule under which in the short run there is an irrelev proposit  a kind of modigliani   miller theorem  about exchang of monetari asset for short term liquid secur that are virtual perfect substitut and at the zero lower bound are definit perfect substitut   so that is definit true   the point i made about the base in the long run is true as well   it has to do with elimin certain possibl conjectur that the public might make about our willing to toler deflat   in the japanes case  they were wide known to be quit eager to lift interest rate   it was known that they view the problem in the bank sector as exacerb by low interest rate   they thought that rais real interest rate would provid more disciplin and forc more restructur in the bank system   so they continu had to fight to keep the long end of the yield curv down   i don   t view that experi as provid the best evid about what a firm commit to prevent deflat could be
presid    you had a two hander
yes  sir   i just want to ask a question   again acknowledg that i am the least well educ on this subject matter and not as erudit in my understand   so this is a tutori question   what we have been do is implicit acknowledg that standard monetari tool are not as effect as they could be becaus of the financi friction that we have encount in the marketplac   so we have been target deal with those financi friction  my question  presid    is just from an educ standpoint   do we know how much monetari base or balanc sheet expans would be need to bring credit spread back into normal order or to deal with these financi friction   if we are go to target the monetari base  i worri about the oper consequ of do so  sinc it seem to me that is an open end question   that is my question
that is a veri good question   we don   t have ani model to draw on becaus we don   t have ani data that would allow us to uncov a structur relationship between spread and the quantiti of the base   in ani event  even were we to focus sole on our primari object for growth and inflat  i think we would have troubl there   i think we would have a great deal of difficulti figur out a quantit relationship between the monetari base at the zero bound and our object   but we start the way we usual do thing   without a serious quantit understand of the relationship between the fund rate and growth and inflat  and we grope and grope and found our way   we are go to grope and tri to find our way in this new regim  and we are go to have to think hard about it and make some guess   by trial and error   just the way we learn how to do fund rate target
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to add my prais to the staff   it was an extraordinari set of memo  as   indic  make reason clear veri difficult decemb                 of     literatur on a complex topic   so i want to thank them   read through them was veri help to me in tri to sort out some of my own view as well  as we know  the nomin fund rate has been trade well below our target   it is near zero   the real fund rate is about minus   percent   the outlook for growth is now even weaker than it was befor   in that case  we would want our polici rate to declin with the equilibrium real rate   but the zero bound  of cours  may constrain us  and our abil to do that is complic by the prospect of declin inflat expect  which make more difficult our abil to let the fund rate fall   onc we are in the situat in which our polici rate is effect zero  it   becom a constraint on monetari polici   as has been well explain   in that case  theori suggest that our polici strategi must focus on way of rais expect of inflat  so that  near the zero bound  real rate can declin while nomin rate remain close to zero   one way to implement such a strategi is to credibl commit to keep polici accommod for some period of  e after the fund rate is no longer constrain by the zero bound and befor move polici back to more neutral rate  therebi rais expect of inflat   eventu  howev  we would need to bring polici rate back up in line with econom condit  to avoid a perman increas in long run inflat expect   that will be a t i task to be sure   what we promis to do with polici in the futur is of overrid import in this framework  now  i am sympathet to this theoret analysi  but i have some concern as well  the model that deliv these result are model of full commit and thus presum that policymak have alreadi in some sens credibl commit to deliv on an inflat target and to deliv this strategi in the event that the near zero bound becom bind  which in these model amount to have a price level target as oppos to an inflat target   i would like to decemb                 of     think that we are commit and credibl policymak as far as the public is concern  but  frank  i have my doubt   i would feel more comfort if this committe had agre to a well articul inflat target   had we done so  the current task befor us might have had a greater chanc of success  unfortun  we do not have that luxuri   consequ  i am somewhat less confid of how the public and the marketplac will react to our effort   the t  we face now is how to make these promis understand and credibl   one difficulti is that the op  polici for mani model in these circumst is veri complic and veri difficult to understand  much less communic   if we hope to affect expect  we need to explain our polici in a way that the public can understand   even approxim of op  polici in these circumst would involv price level target  as i said  and it would be veri difficult to explain  particular sinc the fomc has never formal it inflat target  let alon a price level target   i think we would be better off tri to communic someth simpler   first  we need to tell the public that we have lower the fund rate as low as we think it is benefici to go  i do have some concern about lower the target rate all the way to zero   we still do not understand whi have interest rate on reserv isn   t work to keep the fund rate at it target  and there may well be unintend consequ of move our target to zero  beyond those well articul in the board   s staff note   whether that lowest rate is     basi point     basi point     basi point  or    basi point is veri hard to say   howev  given the law of unintend consequ and our lack of experi at the lower bound in this countri  i do not want to go all the way to zero   but i think we do need to communic clear to the public that  when we reach whatev that effect zero rate is  we are done   a way of communic that might be by give a fund rate target or rang  say  between zero and some percent  decemb                 of     there are two addit practic advantag i see that argu for bound our target rate abov zero   first  it will allow addit  e for bank to becom more profici at manag their reserv  so that our interest rate on reserv regim can becom effect   by go to zero  we will effect shut out that learn process   second  i believ that when the  e come to rais rate  even by modest amount  we will be in a better posit to do so from a non zero posit than from a zero posit   next  we need to communic that the fomc desir inflat rate that are higher than perhap our long run target and communic an inflat rang we are aim for   that is somewhat difficult becaus we have refus to communic such a target in the past   we certain need to communic that we do not wish deflat in a veri weak economi   we also may wish to convey that we are go to keep the nomin fund rate low for some period of  e becaus we desir higher inflat  and that current seem to be expect   communic this serv to increas commit  and it also limit misunderstand when inflat rate might temporarili be abov a longer run target  thus  i think we need to say ex ant that we desir higher inflat rate than current   as suggest earlier  this would be easier to communic had we adopt a target earlier  regard the use of nonstandard polici tool   in my view  we are alreadi there   with the fund rate trade below target  we are effect conduct monetari polici through quantit eas  which i defin as increas in reserv either by open market oper or by ani other mean   inde  expans of our balanc sheet  includ un il lend  is monetari polici  as it is monet the debt  either public or privat   as an asid  i find the descript of such a polici as nonstandard a bit peculiar sinc use balanc sheet quantiti as instrument of polici has had a long tradit in monetari polici   inde  even the feder reserv has target nonborrow reserv at various point in it histori   in principl  i have decemb                 of     no object to quantit eas of this form   but if that is how we view the new regim  then we need to public acknowledg that we have chang   that we have a new instrument   and communic how monetari polici will be determin go forward  intern  we also need to resolv  as has been point out  how decis about our lend and liquid facil will be made  particular now that these have becom the main instrument of monetari polici as oppos to be the mechan for provid liquid to improv market function  which is then  il   the fomc  and not onli the board of governor  need to be involv in decis about the magnitud of such lend and the choic of asset   in effect  these are choic about the extent of the fed   s balanc sheet and it expans or contract  there are a number of way in which one might proceed   first  i believ we need to public convey that we have enter a new regim   otherwis  it may look as though we have lost control of monetari polici or that the fomc  which set the target fund rate  and the board of governor  which larg is control the liquid provis  are at odd   one obvious step would be to chang the direct to the desk  which is releas in the minut  in a way that clear indic that the new regim is now oper and that the fomc has deliber chosen to be in that regim   we would then have to communic someth about the size of the balanc sheet go forward in term of limit  rang  or maximum of some form  such as presid   was suggest   my prefer is for the direct to specifi object in term of asset quantiti rather than the level of non fund rate interest rate or interest rate spread   that is question   of the staff memo   these latter two are not under our control and  even more so than befor  reflect counterparti risk not liquid impair   moreov  the decemb                 of     transmiss mechan from reserv quantiti to rate and spread is not precis enough for these to be oper object  set a quantiti limit on the size of the balanc sheet is more familiar   similar to our experi with oper a reserv base target   in this quantit regim  it mean that the board of governor wish to implement new lend program that expand the balanc sheet   that is  that are not  il   the board of governor would have to seek approv of the fomc to get such an expans but not necessarili for the composit of the asset  as i have articul befor  i believ we need to remain cogniz of the line between monetari polici and fiscal polici   i would prefer to see us purchas treasuri rather than riskier asset  as i would favor the purchas of long term treasuri over new       facil  this refer to question   and     to the extent that some of our lend program are target at aid specif market  my prefer would be to shift those asset from the fed   s balanc sheet to the treasuri and substitut treasuri secur   this would help distinguish monetari polici from credit polici and preserv our abil to conduct independ monetari polici  we also need to recogn that  as the economi begin to recov  these program will need to be unwound  and this may occur befor all financi institut are fulli recov  some of our facil have termin date and will shrink natur as those date are reach  but other  like the agenc mbs program or the talf  will complic the problem   under a well function corridor system  should we get there  the target rate will be somewher between the upper and lower bound  and we will have to shrink the balanc sheet if we expect to hit our target   the reduct may be quit signific if it is accompani by a general fall in the demand for reserv by bank  decemb                 of     even if we imagin go to a floor system in which  in principl  we can rais the target rate without shrink the balanc sheet  we need to be concern about the health of our balanc sheet so that we can ensur that we can financ the interest rate on reserv and pay them   note that if we do go to a floor system  the rate paid on excess reserv will becom our instrument  and we will need to agre on how to set that rate go forward   in my view  that rate should be decid by the fomc  in summari  under a quantit eas regim  the magnitud of the quantit eas should be an fomc decis   to the extent that the qualiti of asset on our balanc sheet complic futur monetari polici decis  the asset makeup of the fed   s balanc sheet should also be in the fomc   s purview   one option that has been discuss is for the fed to issu it own debt   other than feder reserv note  i assum   i am uncomfort with this propos   it is like to requir congression approv  and oversight will no doubt be sought sinc the fed   s secur will be public debt   this potenti generat opportun for the congress to control our debt ceil and perhap the price of our secur  in way that may limit our abil to conduct independ monetari polici   thus  i am veri skeptic that this would be a good path to follow   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   this is an extrem import discuss  and i am glad that you have arrang a special session   i veri much appreci the comprehens and outstand memo from the staff   at our octob meet  we agre to take whatev step were necessari to support the recoveri of the economi  and that principl guid my think on monetari polici at the zero bound   in most circumst  i see few decemb                 of     advantag to gradual  and certain whenev we approach the zero bound  i think the fund rate target should be quick reduc toward zero  as to the level of the lower bound  my default posit is that we should move the target fund rate all the way to zero becaus that would provid the most macroeconom s ulus   for exampl  everi    basi point cut in the target typic take about    basi point off the prime rate and associ borrow rate   the institut concern about treasuri fail and treasuri onli money market fund merit consider  but i don   t consid them serious enough to ban lower the target to a veri low level   still  the surpris result we obtain from pay interest on reserv should make us chari about predict the reaction of financi market to new circumst  so there may be some benefit from allow the fund rate to trade between zero and  say     basi point  let me now turn to the third set of question on communic strategi   look ahead  i believ that there could be signific benefit to communic effect the fomc   s intent to hold the target fund rate at a veri low level   the japanes experi at the zero bound suggest that this is one channel that can work  and the evid suggest that our own guidanc that began in      similar influenc longer term rate   we learn then  though  that it is hard to convey the condit of such intent and the multipl influenc on the op  set of the fund rate   still  i favor tri to includ forward look communic on polici expect in futur fomc statement  we could also consid use the fomc minut to provid quantit inform on our expect   for exampl  we could reveal the fund rate project that implicit accompani our quarter econom project  publish rang and central tendenc of the feder fund rate along with those for gdp growth  unemploy  and inflat   the decemb                 of     advantag of this approach is that it would provid a clear futur path to the fund rate that is condit on the econom environ pertain to output and inflat relat to our goal  we did discuss this approach befor  and i rememb that a number of you were uncomfort with it   but circumst have chang  and there could be particular valu now in ad the feder fund rate to our project  and in fact  we could consid a trial run  i believ that  in addit to provid guidanc on the like path of futur interest rate  we should becom more communic about our longer term inflat object to avoid a declin in inflat expect as inflat drop over the next few year below desir level  one way to accomplish this is to includ quantit inform on our longer term project in the summari of econom project  sep   as the subcommitte on communic has recommend   we could go even further to endors a committe wide long term inflat object  although that is someth that we would have to further consid care   we could supplement includ longer term project in the sep with languag in the fomc statement that is akin to that use in       when the committe refer to an unwelcom declin in inflat   altern b   take a step in that direct  the bracket languag in altern a goe further by specifi a medium term committe inflat target   this is a big step  and one that deserv thorough debat   there are theoret paper demonstr the potenti benefit in a liquid trap of commit to an inflat rate after the economi recov that is higher than we would actual want ex post becaus rais inflat expect lower real rate  therebi s ul the economi   in theori  by commit to more inflat than we actual want later on  we could generat extra s ulus now   but this strategi requir a strong commit devic becaus the committe will have an incent to reneg later on when the economi has recov   i do understand the decemb                 of     attract of such a strategi in theori  but i am not at all convinc that the benefit would exceed the cost in practic   it would be enorm difficult to explain and could harm the fed   s overal credibl as an institut   moreov  it is not onli real rate but also nomin rate that influenc hous demand  and ani increas in longer term nomin rate trigger by higher inflat expect could advers affect this key sector  let me now turn to the nonstandard polici tool that the fomc and the board have author   i wholeheart support the mani action that have been taken to increas liquid in the financi system  as well as those design to increas credit avail and lower borrow cost   go forward  i support both the purchas of agenc debt and mbs by the system open market account and purchas of long term treasuri debt   both exist evid and the market respons we just saw to the recent announc and comment concern such program suggest to me that such purchas can push longer term borrow rate down  other new program   for exampl  to improv credit market function in a  p  commerci paper and in commerci and privat label residenti mortgag back secur   are well worthi of consider   natur  the potenti benefit and cost of each new facil or program need to be assess befor adopt   formul the guidanc from the fomc to the desk regard how these new program should be describ remain a challeng   i think a possibl formul could have the fomc set some object for level or movement in treasuri yield or mbs spread  but those open up thorni issu  and i think that this is someth we realli have to studi further  with respect to the fomc   s oper regim go forward  i oppos switch from a regim base on target of the fed fund rate to one base on a quantit target for the monetari base  excess reserv  or the overal size of our balanc sheet   the board or the fomc decemb                 of     or both  in my view  should consid the merit of each program on it own  without ani presumpt of paygo   most of you probabl recal that paygo was a budget devic employ by the congress to constrain the feder deficit to a target level   in our case  an overarch decis by the fomc about the size of our balanc sheet or the monetari base would forc tradeoff among our various program to hit that total  similar to paygo  imagin  howev  that the commerci paper market were to reviv  allow us to termin the cpff   excess reserv would declin  but that declin would have no negat effect on econom activ  so there should be no presumpt that some other program should be expand to restor the monetari base to it previous level   theori suggest that when the monetari base is increas by purchas convent soma asset  it expans should have littl or no effect on the behavior of bank or asset price more general after the zero bound has been reach   abstract from expect effect  the evid general support this view  while the quantiti of money is sure link to the price level in the veri long run  most evid suggest that variat in the base have onli insignific econom effect in the short or medium term under liquid trap condit   this make the base an inappropri oper instrument for monetari polici in a zero bound regim   as japan found dure it quantit eas program  increas the size of the monetari base abov level need to provid ampl liquid to the bank system had no discern econom effect asid from those associ with communic the bank of japan   s commit to the zero interest rate polici   i think my view on this mirror those that you express in your open comment  mr  chairman  with respect to the direct  the version propos in the current bluebook specifi the type and amount of mortgag relat asset that the desk should buy and the object of these purchas   name  to boost activ in the mortgag and hous market   languag of this decemb                 of     type is consist with the polici approach i support  in which each credit facil program and asset purchas decis is judg on it own merit  accord to whether it improv the avail of credit or lower it cost  thus s ul the economi   i support this approach to draft the direct go forward   it is one way in which the committe communic the logic of monetari polici   but i think we do need to go further   as you emphas  mr  chairman   in provid clear explan to the public about the object of the various facil  how they work  and whi they are part of a coher monetari polici strategi  with respect to govern  i endors the suggest that you made  mr  chairman  about how we should proceed   that is  to work togeth collect to forg and communic a consensus view of the entir committe to the public  while adher to the particular respons that the board and the fomc each have accord to our govern legal document  which is the feder reserv act
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to thank the staff for prepar these memo   they are veri s ul  a great discuss of a veri difficult topic  and i know it was a lot of work   i also want to agre with the chairman that all comment in this arena are in the spirit of op  monetari polici  which is the onli way i would make ani comment here at the tabl   what is the best polici   what will get the economi back on track soonest   that is alway what we are tri to think about here   the truth is that there are lot of way that you might think about what the op  polici is  so that is what the debat is about  let me begin with the first part of the memo ask for comment say whether we should go quick or gradual to zero   i think the most import element is somehow to switch away from nomin interest rate target onc the target approach zero becaus at that point decemb                 of     the target just ceas to make ani sens and you leav the privat sector in the dark about ani signal that they might be receiv about where the committe intend inflat and monetari polici more general to be go forward   to go quick to zero is effect what we have alreadi done with respect to the feder fund rate  at least in term of the actual feder fund rate  and if i am read the  book appropri  accord to the staff  book forecast  it is evid not go to help veri much go forward   i think we did go to zero fair quick here  i do not find the reifschneid     paper  which i know carri some weight around here  veri compel  so let me give the brief reason behind that   for one thing  you are take a model and you are extrapol far outsid the experi on which the model is base   that might be a first pass  but that is probabl not a good way to make polici  and i wouldn   t base polici on someth like that   there are also import nonlinear   this whole debat is about nonlinear as you get to the zero bound  and in my view  they are not taken into account appropri in this analysi   you have household and busi that are go to understand veri well that there is a zero bound   it has been wide discuss for the past year   they are go to take this into account when they are make their decis  so you have to incorpor that into the analysi   that is a tall order   there are paper around that tri to do that  and mani other assumpt have to go into that  the third thing i think is import is that  in other context  gradual or polici inertia is actual celebr as an import part of a success  op  monetari polici     woodford  in particular  has paper on op  monetari polici inertia  and mani other have work on it   in those paper  it is all about make your action gradual and make sure that they convey some benefit to the equilibrium that you will get   all of a sudden  in this particular decemb                 of     analysi  when you are face a zero bound  that goe out the window  and i don   t think that it is taken into account appropri in the analysi   also  it is thrown out the window exact at a  e when you might think that the inertia and the gradual are most import  which would be in  e of crisi when you want to steer the ship in a steadi way   so i think that we have a long way to go to understand exact how to behav near a zero bound  and i would not make polici base on that particular analysi or the subsequ work   but as i state at the begin  i think it is a moot point anyway becaus the effect fed fund rate is trade near zero   we are there   we have arriv    the zero bound impos signific cost on financi institut   in general  to this i would say    no     as the market can adjust   more import  market should be expect to adjust to the op  monetari polici that we set   we are not in the busi of keep particular market work in the particular way that they have work in the past   i don   t want to disrupt thing so rapid that we upset the appl cart   on the other hand  i think the attitud should be that  given enough  e  we should expect market to adjust appropri   i guess that is what i think about that issu of go quick or not  we talk for a minut about communic strategi   three were mention in the memo   the first was to hold the feder fund rate at zero until specifi condit obtain   the second one was the fomc will act to counter inflat below target  and the third one was to accept higher inflat later   in general  i think that the communic idea is import and valuabl to think about in this situat   this is becaus it play to the ration expect  forward look aspect of the behavior of household and busi   my sens is that the benchmark forecast model embodi in the  book or in a promin privat sector forecast such as macroeconom advis may underst these kind of effect becaus they decemb                 of     don   t complet incorpor the forward look element probabl as much as we would like  that is becaus it is veri difficult to do  so i think that the communic thing is the right idea   but i do not think that communic that we intend to hold the feder fund rate at zero until specifi condit obtain will have much effect becaus the market alreadi expect that we will maintain the rate at zero until condit improv   that strike me as a way of say that we have hit our constraint  we are bound by our constraint  and so we are effect do noth further   i wouldn   t want to get into that kind of messag in the communic game  and the communic game is a t i one   if we went that rout  i think deflat would develop   the economi would becom mire in a deflationari trap similar to japan   s  which i illustr last  e   in general  my feel is that understand the japanes situat as someth like a steadi state is more how we need to think of it   in a steadi state  the market are clear  the expect are consist with outcom  and there is no pretens of return to the previous situat unless you elimin that steadi state or somehow shock the system out of that steadi state   in japan the polici rate has not been abov   percent for fourteen year   fourteen year   that start to sound to me as though the best way to think about this is that there may be multipl steadi state out there  and you may be at risk that the dynam will send you to the deflationari trap  our understand about the dynam of those   i know becaus i have work on them myself   is veri poor   exact how they would work and how you would get coordin on one versus the other is a veri difficult question   that research is in it infanc   but the concept that you might think about the possibl in the situat as be multipl steadi state should perhap be entertain more serious around the tabl here  decemb                 of     it is much better to say  as far as a communic strategi  that we are constrain on interest rate and therefor we are switch to someth els   i think a monetari base  reserv  or some kind of quantiti measur would be fine   the reason you want to do this is that you want to remind the privat sector that we control inflat and that we intend to keep inflat close to our target   this is a way to tell a stori about how you are go to do that   a way to signal to the privat sector   so to get the intend effect in the mind of the privat sector  you elimin refer to the feder fund target and forc them to rethink their view of monetari polici and rethink what we are do   of cours  this has to be done in a reason way   it can   t be done in a willi nilli way   also  all the issu that have ever come up around this tabl about monetari target and reserv and all the difficulti with that would come up again   but i think it is a great way to make the switch  much as volcker did in       and get the privat sector to reorient to the new realiti  so  yes  it is veri import to stress that we will counter inflat below target   i guess that is the second part of this question   and the idea of  well  you could say we are go to accept higher inflat later  perhap much later   although be a theori guy i like that becaus you are play on ration expect  it  sn   t seem as credibl to me with the privat sector   the way we are look at it now  you would be talk far into the futur  promis some more inflat   you know  in      we will do   percent or someth like that   it just seem too far away to have a lot of effect on our situat right now  let me talk briefli about purchas of agenc and longer term treasuri   in general  i think this is okay  but i do not think we should expect a lot of impact from this   i think the effect will be margin   i might remind the committe that the famous oper twist from the     s was general judg to be ineffect  and that is whi i think the central bank did not  decemb                 of     general speak  play game on the yield curv in the past   i guess i would prefer agenc to the longer term treasuri becaus of the more direct correl with the mortgag market   i think that might help our case a littl in this current situat  but i wouldn   t expect a lot out of that polici  expans of       credit backstop   i see this as like  the way polici is go   i think it is help in some circumst   i would like to see us work harder  mayb much harder  on the metric for success of these facil and perhap rework or discontinu facil that may not be meet expect   we saw some justif here earlier in the report by bill    which i interpret as say that the goal is to reduc risk premium from what market say they should otherwis be   frank  i am not sure in all case what the purpos of the program is   we have a lot of them out there   we have idea   we should quantifi that   we should be assess  and then we should turn around and say     this one is work   this one is not work      i would like to see a lot more in that direct   i understand that we haven   t done it so far becaus  obvious  we are run on all cylind   we are fight veri hard here   but go forward  that is someth we should be think about  our other nonstandard tool are use   again  i think we need to reestablish with the privat sector that the central bank control the medium term inflat rate  even in environ where the nomin interest rate is zero   a simpl way to communic this is to start talk more about reserv  the monetari base  and the monetari aggreg   again  this has to be done in a reason way   we understand that take out a program is go to chang thing  and we need to communic that effect   we understand that the link between money growth and inflat may not be exact what we would like them to be  but this is the situat we are in decemb                 of     becaus our interest rate channel has turn off   so in normal  e  i would prefer to communic in term of interest rate  but that is not the situat that we are in right now  let me talk a bit about the direct to the desk   in my opinion  the direct should be in term of the quantiti of reserv  let the level of the feder fund rate trade as necessari   again  not unlik the volcker situat   presum  the feder fund rate would trade close to zero on averag   the prescript to express the direct in term of reserv quantiti has a long tradit here on the committe   that languag was use at least through       if i have it correct   i rememb when i was first in the feder reserv system we would talk about the degre of pressur on reserv posit  and so there is ampl preced insid the system to work this way   i think that would keep everyth work smooth in term of govern   i see no reason not to go in that direct  the introduct of new program that are intend to have a minim effect on the level of reserv  as occur befor septemb of this year  would not interfer with the reserv object of the committe   other do interfer with that object  and in that case they would need to be approv here   but my sens of the committe here  though i can   t speak for everybodi  is that i don   t think we would have ani pushback on that  and we would keep the govern thing veri clear if we did it that way   so that would be my prefer   i agre with the chairman that we want the best polici   we want to work in a cooper manner  and i think that is one way to do it here  when the market turmoil abat  then we should begin set target rang for reserv or monetari base growth   onc the crisi is past  then we can begin set a feder fund target again  mayb come back with a rang initi for the feder fund rate and then gradual decemb                 of     move back into the target regim  which i agre in normal  e is a much better way to communic polici  let me talk just for thirti second on the communic of altern tool   abov all  we have to communic that we control medium term inflat even when nomin interest rate are zero and that we intend to keep inflat near target   that is the overrid object in this situat   otherwis  you are go to let inflat probabl drift far below target  and the market will be scratch it head about  well  what are you go to do about it   okay   thank veri much
thank you   whi don   t we take fifteen minut for coffe and then come back and continu   coffe break
presid hoenig  whenev you are readi
all right   thank you  mr  chairman   i would like to start off also by say how much i appreci this   i think it is an import opportun for us not necessarili to agre   becaus committe are design to bring differ view togeth and  one hope  to come to consensus   but to hear one anoth and to feel more comfort know where we are as we move from here   so i realli do appreci this opportun  i am go to go through the question in somewhat the order they were given  and let me begin by discuss the first two question on polici strategi   the key issu here are how low to move the fed fund rate target and at what speed   i agre with the view that keep your powder dri is no argument for not go immedi to zero   howev  i think that there are other good reason for not go to zero at this  e   in fact  the condit of the financi decemb                 of     market is a strong argument for be especi cautious at this junctur about go toward zero and about how fast if we were to choos to do that  it is clear from the studi  at least the way i read the studi that were provid   which i would also add were just excel   that the market dysfunct in some veri import market  includ the treasuri market  increas substanti as you move toward the zero bound   at what precis level this occur is not defin  but evid   suggest that it is a genuin issu  inde  market are clear show sign of impair in that the effect feder fund rate is trade well below the current target of     basi point   it would be unfortun if our monetari polici action were to caus major and avoid effect on the function of these market  especi with the current fragil state of the financi system and when the benefit  as i interpret them  are not obvious signific  i believ we can minim the damag  so to speak  in these market by maintain the fed fund target abov    basi point   i prefer       and by take action to ensur that the effect fund rate trade closer to the target over  e  recogn where we are start from  the way to do this  of cours  is to put limit on the size of the current swap and liquid program   i suppos that is  as other have said  a size limit on the balanc sheet   to the point that the desk can begin to  il the reserv inject of these other program   we are not there  i realiz  but i would like to see that as the goal  turn to question   on communic strategi  there is evid that communic about the futur polici path may have measur effect on interest rate and other asset price  especi in circumst where the market and the central bank have differ view about the futur polici path that need to be reconcil   especi in the unit state  a statement about the polici path is like to be more influenti on market expect decemb                 of     than a statement on inflat right now   as to the statement about the polici path  it is possibl to have a signific effect on longer term rate when market view about the polici path differ signific from our view and there is credibl commit to keep the target rate low for a veri long period of  e   in general  i think that it is difficult to construct a veri specif statement that is credibl to market and   not unduli tie the hand of this committe  consequ  if the committe decid to adopt languag about futur polici action  i would prefer more general rather than more specif condit statement   i would note that the more general languag we use in       through       appear to have been more effect than the bank of japan   s more specif condit statement dure the period of quantit eas  as to the inflat communic  i would be oppos to a statement that suggest that inflat risk have threaten the dual mandat and that the committe will act to mitig this risk   i also expect inflat to come down over the next few month  but this reflect consider unwind of temporari factor  as we note elsewher  and the risk of deflat is modest at this  e   i also would be strong oppos to a statement that suggest that we would accept higher than normal inflat rate in the next few year   while such a statement might be appropri in a deflationari environ  the u s  economi is not yet at that point   instead  our inflat rate has been higher than accept for the past five year  i believ in part becaus of our willing   understand  but still our willing   to err on the side of accommod  in the futur  should inflat come in veri low for a sustain period of  e  such a statement about accept higher inflat might have some benefit in prevent a sharp declin in inflationari expect   but in today   s circumst  such a statement could lead market again to conclud that we would respond veri slowli to higher inflat pressur in the futur   i think it would confus and not actual clarifi  decemb                 of     on nonstandard polici tool  i am okay with expand the purchas of agenc debt and mortgag back secur and longer term treasuri   right now  all  in my view  are govern guarante   howev  i am not in favor of direct support of privat secur through backstop credit facil or other procedur   i am of the view that we have step far in the direct of credit alloc and have undertaken action that are fiscal measur and not appropri for a central bank  even in a crisi like this   in my opinion  the long run cost to the economi and the feder reserv of engag in credit alloc exceed the near term benefit of support limit segment of the market   there is a relat price effect   in term of agenc and treasuri purchas  i agre that the immedi focus should be on reduc the agenc spread over compar treasuri   treasuri rate have come down a good deal  but agenc spread have widen   normal  privat yield move with the treasuri rate  as we know  howev  the current crisi has larg broken the usual connect   therefor  i don   t think that action to lower treasuri rate further will have much effect on other rate  and i would concentr more on bring other rate down   howev  in the come month  as the economi begin to recov  treasuri rate will like come under upward pressur   to the extent that market begin to incorpor a view of the polici path that differ from our  i think we might want to consid purchas  as discuss here  of longer term treasuri at that  e or perhap alter our communic strategi then  on the form of the direct  i would general favor quantit target for desk purchas   although it will be somewhat difficult for this committe to determin appropri quantit target  i don   t think we want to move in the direct of specifi target for interest rate or spread for these other instrument becaus the exit strategi for these approach could be veri disrupt for the financi market  decemb                 of     in term of communic our use of nonstandard tool  if we go that way  i think that the more we say  the better for everyon   it is import to articul the rang of option under discuss  and when they are announc  it is import to discuss not onli how they will be implement but also how they would be expect to help in achiev our object   right now confid is quit fragil  as we all know  and so it is import that we send posit and construct messag and not unduli surpris the market with our action  two other issu not direct relat   as we talk about our polici go forward  i think we realli do need to spend a littl more  e talk about what it mean in term of the deleverag process that is go on   peopl talk about it freeli  but i don   t think it is clear in anyon   s mind and would perhap affect our action   also we need to talk about the potenti effect of the fiscal polici that will be unveil soon   thank you veri much
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i add my thank to the staff for the excel summari  particular those that cover the japanes experi   my read of that experi argu for act aggress and move direct to whatev lower bound we consid the effect minimum   the econom outlook has deterior sharpli  and as i look at the incom data and our near term forecast  i find it reason to expect that we will see more troubl data by the  e of our januari meet  i concur with the  book assess that the outlook call for a cumul reduct of    basi point over the next two meet   at the risk of jump ahead a littl  my prefer is to get there at this meet   if there is an argument for a more gradual two step approach  it is that more communic is need to explain the committe   s strategi and condit the market for a zero lower bound polici regim   i was on the receiv end of this decemb                 of     argument at my atlanta board meet last week   which don kohn wit as a guest   at which some director strong resist move to the lower bound without  in their view  a clear articul statement about how polici will oper go forward   mr  chairman  in your speech two week ago you made a good effort to prepar the public for the possibl that the committe may soon have to oper with polici target that are unfamiliar   but it strike me that there is a chicken   egg problem of when it is appropri to lay out the new approach  again  i read the japanes lesson as move aggress but at the same  e communic veri clear the whys and how of the polici cours   presid   point out in his memo circul last week   and i believ presid   note last meet   that we have at least implicit enter into a quantit eas regim alreadi   the fed fund rate has been trade for some week near the level that we are like to find as the lower bound   i think we must move to a decis at this meet on communic strategi  independ of whether or not we move to the lower bound in one step   i don   t see that this need is signific reduc by delay the move to the lower bound  especi if that destin is inevit  as i believ it to be  on the question of cost of the zero lower bound polici to market and financi institut  in my read of the analysi and the background memo taken as a whole  maintain the effect fund rate at a level somewher near    basi point may help avoid problem in some market that would otherwis arriv at zero   i think we have to be concern that at absolut zero the infrastructur of some market might atrophi as market particip shift resourc in the direct of oper where profit are more attain   these concern might argu for state the feder fund rate target in term of a rang  and i would support a lower bound in the rang of   to    basi point  decemb                 of     as regard communic strategi  to state the obvious  financi market particip would prefer to know as much as possibl about the level of rate in a zero lower bound regim  the durat of adher to that polici  and when and on what basi the polici will chang   the committe can   t fulli satisfi those need  but we can provid assur that equip market particip with a clear framework for plan and anticip chang of polici   i think it is import to communic that we intend to stay the cours with this polici until some combin of materi improv condit obtain in both financi market and the general economi   that is to say  we should indic that the polici is not short term shock treatment to be quick revers  unless  of cours  condit dictat  as regard indic specif condit that would inform a chang of polici or a chang of cours  i favor an approach that address condit in general term use languag such as    the committe intend to hold the feder fund rate target at this level until such  e that it judg condit are present for materi and sustain improv in financi market function and econom growth      i prefer to refer general econom condit rather than to use phrase like    near zero for some  e    as in bluebook altern b  further  i think it is appropri to reinforc that our polici will be calibr base on our longer term inflat object   i am not comfort with formal statement indic that the committe is will to accept higher rate of inflat than it normal would find desir   in my view  the goal is to avoid entrench expect that deviat too much from our explicit or implicit price stabil object in both inflationari and deflationari direct   i think this goal is best pursu by state our commit to medium term price stabil   this statement can be in general term  but i would also support the more explicit numer refer in bluebook altern a  decemb                 of     as regard more purchas of agenc debt  agenc mbs  and long date treasuri  my view is that open market oper should be conduct in the manner that enhanc overal market liquid in the most effici and least disrupt way   this may well be by purchas of agenc debt and mbs beyond the level announc   howev  to the extent that enhanc overal market liquid requir effort to direct manipul price in particular market beyond the feder fund market  i think we may be better serv by develop specif target facil to do so  as regard the further expans of liquid facil  to date we have attack dysfunct market condit in the interbank fund market  the treasuri market  the commerci paper market  the mortgag market  and  short  the asset back secur market  the more we migrat with these facil in the direct of general corpor debt and other nonfinanci issuer    market  the more our polici action involv contenti issu of moral hazard  possibl distort of the necessari process of relat price discoveri  and the appropri divis of labor between the central bank and the treasuri   i think that we just need to keep this in mind as new facil are consid   the extens and broaden of exist facil  and possibl new facil  may be necessari   i judg that the broad polici of target facil has been success to date  regard nonstandard tool  i find myself in agreement with the thrust of presid     s suggest   in a quantit eas regim  it make most sens to express our direct in term of a quantit target   and as regard your comment earlier  mr  chairman  i tend to look at this target question as a tradeoff between target quantiti versus price or rate  and i believ that the quantit target approach is the correct approach  even if we decid to oper with the common understand that our short term object is  for exampl  decemb                 of     to generat a particular path for long term treasuri or agenc debt   base on my read of the literatur and histori as well as on my own experi  i have doubt about our capac to reliabl control specif relat asset price  at least in market unlik the feder fund market  where we are the monopoli supplier of the asset be trade   but that   not preclud set quantit target for the purchas of particular asset and evalu the appropri of those target against a varieti of outcom  includ the interest rate that emerg in those market  i am  howev  predispos toward the line of think express by presid   in his pre meet memo   by choos to express the direct in term of the monetari base or some measur of reserv  the decis of the committe remain in the rang of tradit monetari polici   my conjectur is that a reserv base quantit direct would help to draw a clear line between tradit monetari polici decis in the purview of the fomc and the enhanc credit polici implement under       author  let me move to the communic approach   again  intern the japanes experi  we will be well serv by a signific and coordin communic effort   our press statement might be supplement by an addit explan of whatev new oper procedur we adopt  follow by a public statement  perhap even a press confer  by the chairman   throughout this crisi  we have been provid excel support in the form of talk point   these have been a great help to me and my staff in provid accur and  e inform on the various polici action taken by the feder reserv   with similar assist in this case  i think we can collect commit to provid the sort of common voic on the fact that will promot public understand of the direct in which we decid to head   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  would like to add my thank to the staff for an excel set of memo   veri good analysi   i would agre with pretti much everyon that the econom outlook and financi stress warrant further relief for financi condit  so i am go to be support  ul   further quantit eas as need   i have to admit that i am not quit sure what the most effect form of that eas is   it just  sn   t seem obvious to me   but i certain embrac your suggest  mr  chairman  of continu the regular brief  and when necessari  those should be meet to affirm certain program that are on the tabl   i agre with all of your comment about how import confid is  let me turn to some of the specif of the question about the standard polici issu with the fed fund target   with a deep recess loom and inflat reced  i see no reason to keep our fed fund powder dri   there is no reason uncertainti at this point about the deep of the recess or the financi stress  and i think the economi would benefit from further financi accommod   becaus we can   t realli hit our fed fund target becaus of the breadth of our lend program that are on our balanc sheet today  i think the damag to the treasuri repo and money market mutual fund is unavoid at this point  for our polici action  i think that we should continu to communic in term of our object   in my opinion  this strategi cover most of the issu ask of us   the fed fund rate will be low for some  e under our forecast   i don   t think there is much doubt about that  and our forecast help with that   disinfl risk are part of this outlook  and i think that should be well understood   we can communic that in our speak   if our inflat target were explicit and we talk about it more   higher futur inflat expect than just  if it were the case     percent or lower   that would be part of the communic calculus   as thing stand  decemb                 of     our long term project may be adequ here  but more explicit in general would be help   it is interest to me that altern a encompass all of these in relat mute languag   frank  if we are expect a big impact from that statement  i think we need to includ a bold font typefac   laughter  becaus i don   t think it will be pick up necessarili  but i think it is realli well done  in term of the question on particular intervent  the memo brought forward pretti clear that the effect of the intervent depend on the size of the oper and where the market are   the memo were veri good about talk about individu market and make me awar of a number of detail  but they were often pretti much in isol of how they would flow through to other market   it is not exact clear to me how import that segment or separ is to achiev the goal that we are hope for from those intervent   i suppos in well function market you might expect more of those fund to be flow across those market  and so you would be general provid market liquid   it would flow around   in the current situat  with more stress  there probabl is more separ   is that ul  go to mean we are more effect   i am not even sure becaus there is the ad stress that has to be dealt with   so the particular intervent are not exact obvious to me  and portfolio rebalanc could have implic  in one of them  there was a correl matrix   for a particular size of oper  where agenc are influenc in one way or treasuri are influenc   about when we would see other price move around   that is possibl a guid to this leakag   but  of cours  those are uncondit correl  as i understood them  and i am not exact sure how the exogen intervent that we are talk about would translat from those correl   it is realli an identif problem at some level   my takeaway from that is that i find most comfort the decemb                 of     quantit eas addit that improv total market liquid   it seem to me that the treasuri and agenc purchas are the safest   when we get into credit alloc  we have these facil in place  and we will probabl need to do more   mr  chairman  you talk about the unwind consequ that the committe will have to worri about  and i think that they are also pretti import  last  on the nonstandard approach for quantit eas and what that mean for the desk  i guess this is a harder problem with the dual govern issu than i had realli anticip   i would have thought that it was relat straightforward   onc we hit the zero bound on the fund rate that we would identifi that we need to expand the balanc sheet   i kind of like it in term of the asset side   the committe could author a broad rang of what that would mean   we could reaffirm the exist lend program   not approv them  for that is the role of the board   and point to the import role that they are play   our statement could provid guidanc on the size  which would pretti much just be a restat of the exist size of the program   but we could provid rang of how the committe might expect that to be conduct over the intermeet period if someth aros that requir an addit  or we were be brief on new program as they were roll out  that could be part of it   all of that said  i accept your good faith approach   the more we talk and the more that we understand this and are consult  it should be adequ  in term of communic to the public  under the approach that i just mention we would basic state that the fed fund target is essenti zero becaus of all of the lend facil   we   d have some statement about the rang of the balanc sheet  someth that is not suppos to be so constrain but that would be somewhat help   the descript of the fed lend program would be part of that   they are well done   and the term sheet  and we would decemb                 of     reinforc our commit to the polici mandat that we have in our statement and our forecast  so  just to conclud  i think we can go further down the quantit eas polici path   i am not realli convinc that this is go to do everyth that we are hope  and i am a littl concern as we get to the point where we have an intens desir to effect more that we might tend to disagre a littl more   but i am confid that we will think it through veri care  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to join the other in thank the staff for their work   these are veri difficult issu  and i think you have brought to bear a lot of what littl inform we have on these subject and have kind of kept me out of troubl for the last week   my wife thank you as well    laughter  i think the question in the first set are larg moot  as a number of peopl have said  we are alreadi close to the zero bound  and becaus i think move there aggress under the current circumst is the right thing to do  i don   t have ani regret about that   like presid    i came into this situat  at least a coupl of month ago  wonder whi zero wasn   t the right lower bound   i recogn the market issu that might obtain   sort of as presid bullard said  i wonder whether market won   t adjust as we go on   but so close to zero  the differ between     basi point and zero isn   t go to matter veri much   but i think we ought to keep our eye on how market are function  whether they adjust  and where we should be  now  onc we are at a minimum   and i think we ought to get wherev we are go at this meet  as soon as possibl  a number of peopl have said that  and i agre    we can   t decemb                 of     influenc actual expect short term rate with our action   we do need to reli on other method to chang relat asset price   longer term rate relat to short term rate  privat rate relat to govern rate  nomin rate relat to expect inflat   and that is where the communic and the size and the composit of the asset portfolio come in   both the communic and the portfolio action can be effect and influenti  but i think we need to recogn that we are lose our most power polici instrument   the effect of these other aspect of our polici are uncertain  and it will requir some trial and error to figur out where we are go  with respect to communic  i do think it would be use to tell peopl the condit under which we expect to keep rate low and the condit under which we would be prepar to rais interest rate   i think we can tell them if we think it is go to be soon or if it is go to take some  e   but i agre with your point at the begin  mr  chairman   and presid   and other said this   we should emphas the condit rather than the  e period   we shouldn   t commit to a  e path   i think someth like this should help long term nomin rate better reflect our expect for the path of polici and could be especi import if market come to anticip a firm befor we actual anticip firm   it could come into play  particular in the context of some massiv fiscal s ulus  which seem to be come   i don   t think we want the effect of that fiscal s ulus diminish or crowd out by increas in long term rate that are base on a fals assumpt about the effect of the fiscal s ulus on monetari polici  i think be clear about where we want inflat to be over the long run will probabl help anchor inflat expect a bit better   keep them from drift down when inflat itself is veri low and keep real interest rate from rise   and therebi reduc the odd of decemb                 of     persist deflat take hold   we will have an import opportun to take a step in that direct if we agre to our longer term forecast in januari   as presid   note  the subcommitte on communic is recommend that   i think vote on an inflat target would be a substanti bigger step   that is  we would have to reach agreement on that   it could be a more power signal of our intent  and it might becom necessari   i certain think we ought to discuss it   it has a lot of implic that we need to look at  includ where we will be in a coupl of year   i think we need to be care  a number of peopl   outsid comment  anyhow   have note that they thought that we kept our eye too much on macro variabl in the low inflat period and that gave rise to these asset price increas   i disagre  but i think it is an open question   i have seen comment from other member of the fomc wonder whether we should look at more than just the path for consum price when we are set monetari polici   but let   s not do someth now without think about how it is go to play five or ten year down the road   i also agre with your point  mr  chairman  about congression consult   have an inflat target won   t have ani effect if it is repudi by the congress   as soon as we make it  it could have a negat effect  i think chang in the size and composit of our portfolio can affect relat asset price   i guess i think  presid    that chang are more like to be effect at  e like these  when market are illiquid and particip have veri  veri strong prefer for one sector or anoth   when privat parti seem unwil to lend to each other  substitut feder reserv credit for privat credit can be quit effect   care design program can reduc the cost of credit and increas the avail of capit to household and busi   i see where we are as a natur extens of where we have been   realli sinc august       we decemb                 of     have been use our balanc sheet to tri to s ul credit market   at first we  il that by sell treasuri secur   then we  il it by the treasuri sell treasuri secur  then that program ran out  and we thought we could  il it by interest on excess reserv  and it didn   t work   but i don   t think we have cross a sudden barrier in the last month or two  it is true that the base has begun to rise becaus we have run out of the other  il option  but i do think it is a natur extens of where we have been for a while  that bring me to the monetari base   i find myself more skeptic about the effect of increas in the monetari base per se than what i hear around the room   such increas i think are suppos to affect asset price by induc bank to substitut into higher yield asset  give them a bunch of reserv  and they substitut into higher yield asset like loan   but i wonder how effect that is when short term rate don   t declin with the increas in the base becaus we are pin at zero   that is  we are in a liquid trap   and when bank are reluct to expand portfolio becaus they are concern about capit and their leverag ratio   so i don   t realli understand the channel through which an increas in the monetari base  under these circumst  is suppos to affect econom activ   we have seen a huge increas in the base over the last coupl of month and no effect on the money suppli   now  that is veri short term  i agre   your observ  mr  chairman  was that we saw a big increas in the base in japan   i agre with presid   that they weren   t as dedic to that as they might have been  but i just don   t see ani evid that the base isn   t go to be absorb in a declin money multipli rather than an expand money suppli and increas activ   i don   t understand the channel   i think the base  as we are set this out  is determin by the peopl who use our credit facil   i think that is veri import  and i don   t want to upset that   so i would be veri  veri hesit to restructur the direct in term of the quantiti of reserv or the monetari decemb                 of     base   i would have to understand much better what that mean  and i wouldn   t want to constrain the use of liquid facil with such a restraint  i think the situat in the     s and earli     s was veri differ   first of all  the octob          meet that went to monetari target was a natur evolut of a lot of work that had reli more and more on the money suppli as a way of communic about polici over  e   second  it was about constrain inflat  hold it down   i do agre     that    too much money chase too few good    is someth that peopl kind of understand   i am not sure that they understand the opposit   too littl money chase too mani good  or whatev  as a caus for deflat   i think it would be veri  veri difficult to communic what that meant and how that was suppos to work   so it is a veri differ situat than we had back then  i do think we can help by increas and direct our asset expans in particular direct   we have seen evid  as bill show us in the mbs and gse purchas and the commerci paper facil   also i favor the consider of purchas of long term treasuri bond   i think that will help to lower longer term rate in an environ of larg liquid and term premium   i would consid expand our purchas of mbs and gse debt  if it look as though they might help bring down mortgag rate   i agre with other who have said that they would be veri reluct to specifi such oper with a rate target becaus i don   t think we can realli control that   so i think that talk about quantiti would be much better  as we have done with the mbs   i would also continu to look for other way to use our discount window to help restart credit market or substitut for privat market in which the function is impair  and i would be open to a varieti of possibl  decemb                 of     i agre that credit alloc is veri uncomfort for the central bank   we are into that  we have been into that for a while   i wish we didn   t have to be there   but i don   t see ani evid that the privat sector is go to start lend any  soon on it own   if i saw that some of those other market with which we weren   t involv and weren   t like to get involv   like the junk bond market that bill show us in that chart   were begin to open up without our help  that would be fine   but noth is happen out there in the market that we are not touch   i don   t think that is onli becaus everybodi is wait for us to interven in those particular market  becaus there are a bunch of them that they know we can   t or won   t interven in   so we need to remain open to possibl further credit market intervent  this rais veri difficult govern issu   our inabl to  il and the huge increas in our balanc sheet rais veri difficult question about how the board and the reserv bank togeth carri out their share respons for achiev the object of the feder reserv act   it is not so much about legal as it is about how to reach the best decis and how best to explain those decis to the world at larg   we have alway work in a collabor and cooper way  and i think we need to continu to do that   crisi manag strain the normal collabor and delib mode of feder reserv oper   decis get made on short notic  often over a weekend  but as you said  mr  chairman  we can work at improv our collabor   the fomc  as a bodi  will continu to have the major influenc on our communic about the outlook  the like path of rate  and the accept of the inflat outcom   the key element in our communic have alway been and will remain under the control of this group  and that is a larg part of what we will be do   i agre that we should  when consist with fulfil our oblig to protect financi stabil  consult more and earlier on liquid facil  decemb                 of     i hope that we can emerg from this discuss and subsequ one with an agre upon framework for what we are do and what motiv it under these unusu circumst   i think we   the feder reserv system  the fomc  all of us   should consid issu an explanatori document on these matter that we can all agre to   i wrote this befor this meet  now that i have heard the meet  i am not sure it is possibl   but i think it might be worth the effort   thank you  mr  chairman
are you in charg of draft it    laughter   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make some comment  first about nonstandard polici  then about communic  and final a bit about the balanc sheet  govern  and so forth   with regard to the nonstandard polici  bill     s chart    and    show the spread narrow with intervent and spread tend to widen elsewher seem to make a pretti compel start point at least  not onli for the valu of the program in place but perhap for consid addit one   i guess i am kind of wari about that at this point   a sentenc in one of the staff paper that pertain to this   let me also compliment the staff for the qualiti and the volum of what they have produc here   caught my attent      it is difficult to provid specif recommend for further intervent at this  e  in part becaus facil that are most obvious valuabl to address current condit have alreadi been put in place or are in train      that is one concern i have   that we may be head toward diminish return   in addit  as i think somebodi has alreadi observ  there is a possibl that  if we carri this too far  we interfer with what would otherwis be normal and healthi market adjust   some of that is go to have to work it way through   final  one thing from the japanes experi is the so call preserv of zombi  which  whatev you decemb                 of     might say about it short run valu  clear wasn   t of valu to the long run health of the economi   so my prefer as far as nonstandard tool would be to emphas purchas of longer term treasuri and of gses and mortgag back secur   at least at this point  that is where i would want to put my emphasi  with regard to communic  as i think presid   said  reiter our longer run object  indic   given condit as we perceiv and expect them   that the fund rate is like to remain low for a consider period of  e or  altern  that reserv provis is go to remain generous  howev we want to say it  is accept   there could be some valu  if we can get there  in specifi an inflat target  and certain the effort to provid longer term steadi state forecast will work in that direct   i think we need to be a littl care  though  as governor kohn suggest  to think through a varieti of issu that are associ with this   i can even imagin that  even if we were to agre on an inflat target and even if the congress had no object  it might be a bit of a distract at this point and there could be a lot of debat extern to the system whether it is the right target and whi or whi not  and so on and so forth   of cours  that is not our princip concern at the moment  with regard to the balanc sheet and govern issu  i certain can get comfort with the consult  collabor approach you describ   there might be some valu from a credibl point of view   i put this more as a question than a conclus   in tri to specifi some numer rang for the base  reserv  or someth in that the public could monitor whether in fact we are do what we say we are do   to the extent that we are concern about the possibl of excess disinfl or of deflat  this would be a way for the public not onli to take our word for it but also to monitor that in fact we were conduct polici in a way consist with that   presid    in his discuss  indic that emphas the decemb                 of     base was a way to emphas  at least in the longer run  that we weren   t intend to let inflat get too low   i put this as a question   this could be a way of help credibl becaus the public could monitor it   thank you
i would also like to join the chorus of peopl thank the staff  in particular the staff member who were work on the memo on japan   have done some work on japan myself  i know that get the institut detail right is far from easi  particular when you are not a nativ speaker   so i much appreci the work in that area  the probabl of a sever econom downturn accompani by deflat is too high  and the effect fed fund rate is alreadi veri close to zero   this combin call for aggress  nontradit polici   my read of the parallel japanes experi highlight two general principl   the first is one that presid  n highlight   there is a macroeconom impact from what we do in bank supervis   bank problem should be address expediti  with realist write down of problem asset and recapit of problem bank   in particular  we should prevent pervers incent where problem borrow are support while healthier borrow are starv for credit as bank tri to satisfi balanc sheet constraint and avoid further loss recognit   second  monetari and macroeconom polici to address financi disloc should be proactiv and forc rather than releas gradual over an extend period of  e   in the context of the question that we have been ask to address  i   d like to encourag us to take three action  first  i would explicit state that the committe seek to achiev a core pce inflat rate of   percent in the medium term   for the second  e this decad we are approach the zero nomin interest rate bound   set too low an inflat target threaten to place us in our current decemb                 of     predica too often   in contrast  by set an explicit target at   percent  we will indic our resolv to take nontradit polici necessari to achiev that goal   becaus the inflat target adopt under the current circumst would be design to rais inflat expect and s ul the economi  this may be a particular propiti  e to adopt such an explicit target   a   percent target would also be consist with our own reveal prefer as the core pce inflat rate has averag      percent  veri close to   percent  over the past ten year  second  dure the past recess     year convent mortgag rate reach    percent  the current rate has been hover at     percent and has reach that level onli sinc we announc our program to purchas      billion in gse debt and mortgag back secur   the hous sector remain the epicent of our problem   given the current outlook  i would suggest use facil to move toward an interest rate target  for exampl  by reduc by     basi point from current level the convent    year mortgag rate   lower the    year convent mortgag rate would reduc the cost of purchas new home  encourag refinanc by those with suffici high credit score and equiti in their home  and support fiscal polici that are target at more troubl homebuy   it would help troubl and healthi homeown  s ul the most distress area of our economi  and help financi institut expos to problem in hous  such a target would be understand to the general public  and action alreadi taken have made some progress in this area and serv as an exampl   i would focus on the mortgag rate rather than the treasuri yield curv becaus lower treasuri rate seem to be have littl effect on rate paid by household and busi  and the desir to avoid credit risk has alreadi brought    year treasuri rate to low not seen in most recent recess  third  our facil for short term credit have been success   short term commerci paper rate have fallen as a result of our program  as was highlight by bill    and the decemb                 of     rollov risk at the end of the year has been mitig by the commerci paper program  increas  howev  i have been hear complaint about bank pull line of credit when they are up for renew primarili becaus the bank are face balanc sheet issu   one possibl remedi might be to extend our commerci paper facil to high rate firm for longer matur than are cover by the commerci paper market   all three suggest would be easili communic and understood by the public  would address direct the area of the economi in which financ has becom particular difficult  and would highlight our resolv to avoid a deflationari economi  such as japan experienc for over a decad  i would just end with the note that i agre with the governor kohn on the monetari base for two reason   the first is that i do not think our facil have been particular well design to set a quantit target   mani of the facil are open end   go through the follow thought experi   suppos a money market fund onc again break the buck   the amlf will probabl go up      billion or      billion   i would expect the commerci paper facil to go up   i would expect that most of the bank facil would also go up   if we were limit by a quantit target at the veri  e that we actual want those facil to be expand  we would be constrain   i do not think that is a good idea in the current situat   the second reason come from my read of what happen in japan  and this goe to some of the remark that the chairman made   the monetari base in japan did expand veri rapid   when bank are capit constrain  expand reserv veri rapid   not translat into an expans of the broader balanc sheet   so we could veri easili see a situat in the unit state in which bank continu to be capit constrain for some  e   despit increas the monetari base  we might not see an expans in term of other asset   that is exact whi i agre with the chairman that we should be focus on the asset  not the liabil  side of the balanc sheet
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to start by thank the staff for the excel background materi they provid   while i certain wish we were not in this circumst  i do think that this is a critic convers for us to be have at this meet  and the background materi were extrem help   i am go to proceed direct to the question that   provid as i believ they cover the major issu well   i have some general answer to the question  but i think that we are go to be learn a lot in the process of implement polici into ever more unchart water  on the question of whether the committe should quick move the target fed fund rate toward the zero bound or get there more gradual  i strong support move quick   i agre with the memo that the japanes experi point to the valu of move aggress   also  we have alreadi move beyond the target fed fund rate as mani have comment  and so we are mere confirm a realiti  on the question pertain to the cost to financi market or institut and the limit to our rate reduct  i think the note cover veri well the cost to some money market fund  banker in my district have also express concern about addit margin squeez that they will face with a lower fed fund rate   so  yes  there are signific cost to financi market and institut   howev  i believ that the current environ and our need to allow the fed fund rate to trade close to zero trump these cost  and in my view a    basi point fed fund rate is an appropri minimum  regard the question about the communic strategi  i think anoth lesson that we have learn from the japanes experi is the role of effect communic and the role of anchor inflat expect   so i do see the benefit in communic that the feder reserv decemb                 of     intend to hold the target fed fund rate at a veri low level until specifi condit are obtain  and that the committe see a sizabl risk that inflat in the come quarter could be appreci lower than is consist with price stabil   i also see that there may be some valu to communic that our polici might result in a temporarili higher inflat rate in the futur  both to indic this possibl and to signal a willing to make sure that the risk of deflat dissip befor we alter our cours   although we have not adopt a formal inflat target  i do believ that the releas of our longer term project as suggest by the subcommitte on communic will be help in manag inflat expect  move to question   and   regard nonstandard polici tool  my own prefer is for a mix strategi   that is  some direct treasuri and agenc purchas and some expans of our privat asset purchas use the talf   i support your view  mr  chairman  that we should keep our focus on expand the asset side of our balanc sheet   i think we should consid increas the purchas of agenc debt and mortgag back secur beyond the level that we have alreadi announc   i also see advantag in initi larg scale purchas of longer term treasuri secur   these action should help to lower interest rate across a broad spectrum of longer term asset   as we have talk about  direct purchas also fit more natur into the fomc   s govern structur  wherea the talf like approach is more awkward to fit into the fomc   s purview   as some have comment  direct purchas might expos our system open market account to some capit loss  but that seem an accept risk for monetari polici in such a challeng environ  i do think that the focus of our fomc meet next year should be on evalu and adjust the composit and size of our purchas of secur in respons to chang econom condit so that the direct need not build in explicit condit on market and econom decemb                 of     circumst   further expans of our credit backstop facil under section       is also like to be benefici in current circumst   i think the cpff has been a help addit to our facil  and i am hope that the talf will be equal effect   so  in summari  i favor appli all of these approach and remain flexibl   i also believ that a clear start point on how the committe would formul it direct would be to direct the desk to purchas specif quantiti of asset   as a formal matter  we might need to includ    up to    in our direct languag  but we should anticip that the desk would be success in meet that object   i think that the uncertainti surround the effect of our action make longer term interest rate or spread too unreli to be communic as target  final  on the question of effect communic nonstandard polici tool  i like the languag in some of the bluebook altern for our polici option   howev  becaus of the histor natur of implement nonstandard polici tool  i think that a good communic plan should also includ a formal press confer or a speech in which  mr  chairman  you announc the chang   that would serv to emphas the chang in our procedur and elimin some of the uncertainti about the role of the fed fund rate target   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   first vice presid cum
thank you   again  i   d also like to thank the staff for the excel note  it   s use to start out with our near term goal  as most of us have done  to provid s ulus and support for the econom recoveri and to prevent too larg a fall in inflat   the root problem  i think  are worth focus on for a second   insuffici global demand  hurdl to econom activ from a sever impair financi system  and as i   ll report tomorrow  behavior that is influenc by confus and fear among busi and household that are tend to reinforc the downward trend of the economi  decemb                 of     that environ  i think  give us some goalpost to look for in term of frame the strategi   i find veri appeal marvin goodfriend   s character of the dualiti of the central bank   s polici   we have a monetari and what he call a credit polici at the same  e   in normal  e set the fed fund rate influenc financi condit  especi credit market  in a fair predict manner  and this committe from  e to  e has discuss where overnight rate and financi condit have diverg   in these  e  we   re observ a major disconnect between overnight rate and financi condit that is reflect in huge spread but also in a lack of transact and in nonpric ration in market  so come back to the question of what some of our goal are   to address the problem that we see  communic is realli the essenti element  and we should be aim for maximum impact in whatev action we take and also in our communic   i think  therefor  that we should bring rate down now as far as we think we can take them   but the more import decis is articul what we are go to do go forward  whi we are do it  how long we are plan to do it  and under what condit we would stop do it   some of the confus that is out there about what the feder reserv has been do reflect the fact that our oper realli cover two veri differ kind of thing   on one side we are expand liquid and support the recoveri of financi market by the cpff  the mbs purchas  and the upcom talf   in other facil we are prevent catastroph market outcom through asset disposit  such as the bear stearn transact  aig  and the recent transact we   ve had with citi   in addit  there are a lot of technic and legal to these facil that make it hard for the general public to understand what we are do   so more fundament we need to communic what we want to accomplish  and that import involv our commit to price stabil  as mani have said here decemb                 of     in the sens of keep price in the medium term rise in line with our     to   percent prefer  and our commit to a resumpt of sustain econom activ  when i turn to look at what kind of facil we should be think about go forward  onc interest rate are down to their minimum level  there are realli a few thing that i would highlight   first  in mani way we could influenc expect about short term polici rate through our long term debt purchas  as mani have said   in particular  when we tri to lean against expect express in the yield curv that rate are go to rise soon  and we   re see some of that today  we can interven in market that direct affect major element of aggreg demand  and i would see that as a veri import role of our agenc mbs program and also the cpff to address where firm are realli be starv of work capit   becaus of it structur  the talf provid a veri broad umbrella under which we could do intervent  again  where we see credit market fail and econom activ imped by the lack of financ of a wide varieti   i think that we should look at the cpff and the talf more as backstop facil that provid the credit we need but also build in a kind of exit strategi so that  when spread come down  there is an opportun for the market basic to tell us     you can wind this down now     we need to communic the criteria by which we are choos these market   we have mention these three big market segment   i think simpler is much better than have someth that   s veri complic or have mani  mani facil   as part of this  the crucial thing is to provid to the marketplac some kind of condit commit   if we don   t feel that we   re readi yet for the inflat target  certain between this meet and the next we realli need to think about what kind of condit commit we could make   what condit in the marketplac would lead us to feel that our work was larg done  decemb                 of     i would also note  though  that the histor note made the excel point that the risk is that we withdraw s ulus too quick   that we believ the patient is heal when  in fact  the patient is mere stabil   so our commit must be both ambiti in it level and compel as it is communic to the public   i think we need to return to the expositori approach that the fed and then governor bernank took dure      and       by which we care laid out the element  the foundat  and the expect outcom of our approach in that period   as valuabl as it was in          it is even more valuabl today  when confus and anxieti are shape behavior that will amplifi the downward forc in the economi   i also endors the recommend that mani have made to think about a press confer   the need for reassur communic to the public is  i think  veri great  i would add two more thought   of cours  it is realli crucial that we are coordin our polici with treasuri  and there are mani way in which we do that today   certain  we need coordin of fiscal and monetari polici   i frank would like to see more of our asset disposit activ taken on by the u s  govern so that it would be easier for us to describ the facil that we have as support the market and restor market function   i also believ  as i   m sure that mani of you do  that we will probabl need some kind of agreement with the treasuri vis  vis our exit strategi   i particular underlin the real possibl  which sever have mention here  that we may want to rais interest rate well befor the market are realli fulli heal or fulli sustain by themselv   we   ll need to be abl to negoti that in the sens of both the path we take and the understand we have with the fiscal author  then just to conclud here  i also veri much want to endors the point that presid   made about need to fix the bank system and do it sooner rather than later  there realli is no abil for the economi to function without a strong bank system   certain i decemb                 of     believ that you are hear  as i am  of mani instanc in which the ration that is go on through the bank system right now is reach a destruct potenti   in that kind of world  i think we need to turn our attent to that   the feder reserv is one of the most import supervisor in our countri and in the world  and i think we can do a lot to lead to the veri tough action that need to be taken there   thank you
thank you   sever peopl have mention press confer   i should say that we   re look veri care at the idea of do quarter press confer with the releas of the project  along the line of the bank of england   if we decid to do that   and input from the committe is welcom   the first one would be in februari   it would coincid in this case with the humphrey hawkin addit present   i have a speech at the london school of econom in mid januari in which i will be abl to lay out a lot of these issu   i don   t know if that   s soon enough  but i don   t know whether we think we should do more communic or not   that   s someth we can talk about tomorrow perhap  but i did want you to know that we are look at the quarter press confer model   presid
mr  chairman  my colleagu harvey rosenblum made an interest point the other day that we   re at risk of be perceiv as migrat from the patron saint of milton friedman and   taylor to a new patron saint   rube goldberg    laughter   by the way  i   m go to give a speech on rube goldberg next thursday   i do think that it is import not to make it needless complic   so i think it   s veri import that we have this discuss   i welcom the discuss and welcom the paper so that we can not onli have a cognit road map for ourselv but also figur out how we   re go to clear articul a deliber chang in regim to the public   i want to underscor what you said at the begin of this convers  mr  chairman  decemb                 of     we should be guid by what   s best for the countri   period   and not get into internecin concern about govern   it   s what   s best for our economi and what   s best for the world economi  i   d like to talk about three point   i want to talk about the current predica in veri general term   i want to touch on govern and then on communic   first  with regard to our current situat  it   s pretti clear that purchas and sale of fed fund have been distort by risk avers  distrust of counterparti  and fear of pend bank insolv   quantit eas result in massiv excess reserv  we   ve talk about that  complic aris from the transit to pay interest on requir and excess reserv   as you point out earlier  this is a regim shift that we   re still tri to effect and perfect  the need for gses to invest overnight money at ani posit rate  bank capit shortag that prevent the gse fund from be arbitrag  and quit possibl the fdic   s temporari liquid guarante  although that seem to be a minor factor   in these circumst  focus on the fed fund target seem to me to be a divers of our focus and energi  and i sent around a memo to that effect   moreov  the short term riskless rate  the t bill rate  is virtual zero   reduct in the target fed fund rate cannot lower the riskless rate ani further  ad to our difficulti is the fact that we simpli do not know how financi intermediari or money and capit market will behav and function when interest rate get this low   we do have the japanes exampl   we are not japan   i have work and live in japan  and we have learn from what they   ve done   but the fact is that we have no sustain experi in the modern era in the unit state with t bill rate and the effect fed fund rate trade near zero   we do know that money market fund will becom unprofit if rate get much lower   let me just say to those who sort of dismiss that  i think we might look a littl foolish if we drove some of them out of busi  especi after creat two special facil to support their continu decemb                 of     intermedi function on the basi that they were critic need for their role in the commerci paper market  furthermor  i   ve spoken with sever communiti banker  and i subject governor duke to some of that dure her visit to dalla   their unanim respons to a further reduct in the target fed fund rate would be to set a floor for their prime rate at it current   percent level or some of them are suggest that they would switch to a lend rate base off libor   again  with a floor to protect their margin  which are be sever test   to the extent that larger bank depend on deposit as a sourc of fund  reduct in the fed fund target rate from current level could damag their profit also  and this goe to one of the point made by presid   and first vice presid cum   we do have to bear in mind that it   s import to have a vibrant and healthi bank system across the countri  in this new and untest interest rate environ  it is  in my opinion  tenuous to assum that the fed fund target rate is the margin cost of fund to a bank and that all of the usual and customari cost in price relationship will hold   if deposit rate approach zero  as they are like to do for all but the zombi bank  it   s probabl that the demand for currenc will increas  a prospect that i would prefer to avoid   to sum up  we   re in an interest rate environ in which the linear properti of our model are like break down   so where   this leav us  it leav us with the critic need to refocus our strategi and communic effort on what we have been do and will continu to do   name  restor the public   s confid and trust in financi intermediari and financi market  reduc term liquid and credit spread to someth approach more normal level  improv the flow of credit through financi intermediari and financi market  and restor econom growth and revers the spillov of inflationari pressur from asset market to the market for good and servic   oper it seem to me that we need decemb                 of     to shift our focus away from the fed fund rate target   parenthet  which we cannot control   to someth that we might better influenc   name  the reduct  or perhap a better phrase  the normal of liquid and credit spread   the fact is that we have alreadi enter this domain  and by state it that way   that is  approach the normal of liquid and credit spread   we would have a clear exit strategi  and we could discontinu this focus when spread return to someth approach normal  this has the addit advantag that it is a condit commit   i would avoid ani refer to specif target for the monetari base or the size of our balanc sheet   we simpli do not know in current circumst how fast or how far  as i referenc earlier in my question to presid    we need to expand our balanc sheet to restor normal spread or normal credit flow   some of our facil   for exampl  the mmiff   have work with almost no usag  other have acquir extens usag   in sum  it seem clear to me that focus on the target fed fund rate is misplac in the current environ   if we are to restor the function of the credit market  we need to address that object explicit  with regard to govern  in addit to read the    paper that were sent out and the bluebook  this last week i read a novel call world without end written by ken follett   it should have been call a book without end becaus it goe on for       page    laughter   it   s about the plagu in the fourteenth centuri   one of the interest lesson from read that book is that the monk in that period  who domin societi  revert to the old orthodoxi learn from the greek   they were the best educ   they were the oxford educ intelligentsia   but by revert to the old orthodoxi  they did not learn what the nun learn  which is what you learn from practic   the reason i mention this  mr  chairman  is that i think there is great valu  as we tri to figur out and articul the new regim  to have these share discuss at the tabl   i want to decemb                 of     thank you in that sens for your comment  not onli about good faith but also about the need to have this discuss broad within the fomc and not just adher to the old orthodoxi   all of us have differ level of experi and background  and we learn from those differ level of experi and background  final  on the issu of communic  one of my colleagu often say that  if you   re elton    you are expect to sing    benni and the jet    everi singl  e and at everi singl concert   it seem to me that  onc we get and hone our messag  we must repeat it incess and stay on messag in order to have it penetr   in austin  you gave what i consid to be a hallmark and   not tri to flatter you   for monetari polici a histor speech   what was bloomberg   s first reaction   the fed may cut rate further   the messag was lost   we all need to stay on messag  but i think it   s veri import  whether we have press confer or whether you give speech  that we need to hammer the theme of the new regim that we are about to embrac over and over and over again   so i didn   t pick    benni and the jet    just becaus of your name  mr  chairman   laughter   but i do hope you rememb that we must have that constant refrain   if we   re go to sell someth  we have to sell it by repeat it  not ask the press to interpret it for us but to get the messag out in   excus me  governor kohn   full frontal view   thank you  mr  chairman
i   m in awe of a present that has rube goldberg  the black death     benni and the jet     and full frontal view all in it    laughter   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m a visual thinker    laughter   so i   ll begin where governor   end his remark   to thank       and nathan for two reason  first  obvious i thought you did a great job  and second  i didn   t want to be the first jerk around this tabl not to acknowledg you   so i felt some burden now to be    for    and thank you for the work  decemb                 of     let me make three background point and then tri to answer some of the question that   ask of us   first  i think we have two risk in the zero lower bound discuss   one is overst the import of our judgment today in help the economi get back to potenti  the second risk is underst the import of prospect fed action given our frustrat that our polici accommod to this point has onli partial offset the deterior and credit weak in the real economi   the first t  is get that balanc right  recogn that our action are import but probabl not determin  at least sole determin of the outcom  given what market will end up do with the messag we send and given the need for fiscal and other polici   the second t  is that  notwithstand our announc or what we take to be our target  the effect rate is like to be veri close to zero for quit some  e   so mayb more precis in this context  the zero lower bound problem could be understood to mean that the expect protract period of weak will come becaus monetari polici is unabl to provid enough s ulus to generat a robust recoveri   that is true as far as it goe  but we shouldn   t assign more import to this problem than it deserv   that is  the protract period of weak is not simpli or larg about monetari s ulus   it   s about a broken financi architectur of which the offici sector respons  includ monetari polici  is onli one piec   at the same  e  monetari polici can   t be as efficaci as desir and is constrain by these zero lower bound problem  thus  we don   t have a free pass to stand idl   increment interest rate polici may be of limit valu  but it   s still relev in s ul demand  second point   the judgment today are made harder by the degre of market discontinu and market dysfunct   i take veri serious the risk that reduc the fed fund rate to zero could further degrad the function of financi market and do so at a veri inauspici moment  get that market function is our way out of this mess  and though we would in normal decemb                 of     market expect money market mutual fund and regul and unregul financi institut to adjust  there   s a lot about their behavior in the past six month that hasn   t follow normal custom  i worri at this  e  when we   re tri to get market to respond  about put an increment burden on their reaction function   the current period is distinguish from      and other anteced by the broader system fear about our system of credit intermedi  and i agre strong with the idea advanc in the materi that were present last week that the level of the treasuri repo rate is more critic to treasuri market function and the function of other market than the target rate or the effect fed fund rate   the deterior in repo market liquid that bill and other spoke about correl strong with lot of other bad thing   fail in treasuri market  the inabl to predict market clear price  and the inabl to hedg other asset   dure this period  in which we have seen this unfortun behavior  everyth els seem to have gone wrong as well  so it is hard to draw ani causat here   but i do worri about those market effect  as a third point  on balanc i   m inclin to believ that the macroeconom benefit of push the envelop to get to zero may be outweigh  particular now  by addit financi market problem   in more normal circumst  disrupt in these market could be address quick by chang in market practic   but there is reason to worri this  e how quick they could come  let me turn now to some of the question that   rais   first  on the question of whether we should move or keep our powder dri  i think it   s clear that  onc we decid and we know where we want to go  we should move as swift as possibl to get there   but i think the key word there is    readi      so when we want to make this final move  we need to be readi in three respect   first  the board and the fomc have to be readi in term of what our consensus is  decemb                 of     second  the market must realli understand whi we are make this chang in regim   they need to comprehend fulli what is drive our polici   third  we have to have an oper abil to perform and execut  and that   s realli a question for bill and his colleagu as we continu to expand our facil  the second question was about the cost of reduc the fed fund rate target to zero   i would put it simpli that the zero lower bound in my opinion isn   t zero  but it is lower than   percent   i   m not sure if it   s    or     but i would be probabl cautious about push beyond the point of our comfort  third  in term of the benefit of communic  we are judg by our action far more than our word  and i think the market have gather a view of what our reaction function is   so when we talk about the need for our communic languag to emphas the condit of it  i think that   s quit consist with how we   ve talk previous about our forecast   our judgment on polici are dictat by our forecast   as our forecast chang  so too might our decis   so i think i   d put our communic in that regard  in term of introduc or reintroduc an inflat target at this point  i   m not sure that it would  at least in the short and medium term  drive the kind of market reaction that we would expect   i think market would be wonder  after long discuss over the previous eighteen month about subcommitte and communic polici and inflat target   whi now   is it that we   re actual now more concern about inflat expect and the medium term view of what   s consist with price stabil than we were dure much of that period in which we were talk about inflat that was higher than our expect rang   i   m not sure i have been abl to intern and conclud whi that would be appropri at this veri moment to introduc into our statement  decemb                 of     in term of nonstandard polici tool and the purchas of larg amount of agenc and treasuri  i think that the chairman   s point about the composit of the asset side of our balanc sheet is key   in a differ regim  i would have been uncomfort about agenc   but my view is that they are ward of the state at this  e   the u s  govern has said so   to the extent that we can provid our fire power to both the treasuri market and the agenc market  it is probabl worthwhil to do both   we probabl have an opportun to test the import of some of these nonstandard polici tool in execut the  e and process and make public our announc to this point of provid up to      billion in aid to this market   i would prefer to avoid set a ceil on convent rate   that   s not the role of the fed   better to leav that announc to other   i think it is also critic import with respect to agenc that we make sure we understand the postur and polici of the new administr   if they think that the agenc are effect go to be treat like ward of the state  i   d feel more comfort  in term of the expans of credit backstop facil  my first concern would be that i   d defer to bill and his colleagu about oper bandwidth   second  i think we probabl have an opportun   and you do  mr  chairman  in your speech earli next year   in announc what our criteria are and what our framework is for expand our credit backstop facil   third  i   d say that we do need to address  probabl in that same period  our exit strategi and clean up ani edg problem that might have develop dure this period   the cmbs market is in lousi shape   i think that   s not larg becaus of what we   ve done  but there is a gravit pull on the bit of liquid that is out there to the residenti market and away from the cmbs market   there   s probabl an opportun for us to tri to clarifi that in the context of the talf program  final  in term of other nonstandard tool that would be particular use  again  i think it would be import to state public in all of our discuss the need for the fiscal author to be decemb                 of     take first loss and ensur that the new administr  the new treasuri  is prepar to support the fed in that so that they   re in the credit loss busi and we are realli just use our facil and knowledg to put that into place   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
i thank you veri much   i will make it    out of    on the excel work of the staff  but i think also someth that come through from that is that we have to have a great deal of humil given the situat that we   re in   we can use analog from japan   we can use analog from other part of histori or from sweden  but there are a lot of part that are uniqu  and a lot of what we   re do is  as i think presid bullard said  outsid where some of the data have been in the past   so we do have to come at this with a littl humil   actual  the japanes experi weigh veri heavili on me becaus that   s perhap one that i know well and in which i see perhap the closest analog   one of the fact that presid bullard mention is extrem import and weigh heavili on me   they have had their target rate at less than   percent for almost a decad and a half   but someth that presid bullard didn   t focus on is how littl growth they have had in that period   we are move into an era of veri low interest rate  and we want to reviv growth and think about how we can do that  and that get to the overal object   i think we also want to avoid the problem that japan has had becaus it would probabl not be a good idea to be in a regim in which we feel forc to have the fed fund rate at less than   percent for a decad and a half  clear  there are theoret  empir  and practic reason for move rapid   the japanes exampl is veri clear on that   practic  we are larg alreadi there   also  i simpli can   t imagin that over the next   or even    week we   re go to get data that would make us think that we shouldn   t be move interest rate down or that we aren   t in a state of the economi in decemb                 of     which we have to do someth fair aggress   we alreadi see some disrupt in the market becaus of the low effect rate   we have to be mind of these consequ and monitor them close  as has been mention a coupl of  e  we have the comparison of the market in which we   ve interven that seem to be work a bit better and the market in which we didn   t interven that aren   t work as well   although i actual do agre with that interpret  we have to be a bit care about that in go forward becaus there could be some unintend consequ  such as in commerci paper   a  p  intervent can help that market out  but they could have some unintend consequ for a  p    just becaus the other market are not improv as these are  we have to be care about draw conclus that it must mean that we need to interven in market y and market z and a  b  c down the line   that   s not to say that i think that what we   ve done so far has not been help   i do believ that it has been  but i think we just have to be veri  veri care about those unintend consequ  communic strategi  as so mani peopl have said  is crucial becaus we   re step into a new world   we basic have a lot of explain to do  and one of the key thing to explain is that we have not gotten to the end of our tether  that there   s still a lot more that we can do  even though a lot of the world think that  onc we have    given up    on interest rate or gotten down to our lower bound  we can   t be that effect   we have to be veri effect in argu that  no  that   s not the case   in the discuss  a number of peopl mention that tri to provid a framework for understand this is realli  realli crucial   explain that we may need to keep interest rate at a low level for a while base on the condit in the economi is import  but that  sn   t mean that low interest rate are not help econom recoveri   we should be express concern that decemb                 of     inflat could fall below the level that we consid consist with our dual mandat   i think that   s someth that is also veri import to talk about   method that we could use to attack that  i think this   in the broad sens rais the valu of an inflat target   but i would be veri concern  as i think presid  n and some other mention  at this point about get into that debat becaus  even if we did go to the congress and a few member of the congress said that   s okay  that still would be a veri big debat and i think a distract from exact where we want to go   but we need to think about that over the long run  particular if we start to see the inflat rate go down or if we see that we   re not be effect at fight expect of deflat   but i think for the moment that it would be too much of a burden on our communic and would perhap caus too much confus in the market   they have gotten all of these new facil  we   re step into a new world potenti depend on our decis tomorrow   if we also then introduc an inflat target at this  e  it may just be a lot to digest   but i think it is a discuss that we need to continu to have  in term of the specif of the action that we need to take move forward  onc again  i think the lesson of japan are import   we want to focus a littl more on the asset side than on the liabil side   the chairman character thing in a veri effect way to argu that we   re not do precis the same thing and that we potenti can be more effect   i think it   s not just about some particular reserv level   the exampl that presid   gave is one that weigh on me   we need to be nimbl in respond to differ problem   we may have new facil  we may purchas more or fewer secur   be constrain by or pick out a particular number for reserv  sn   t seem to be the most effect way to build our credibl that we will fight these problem   although there is a long histori in the fed of look at thing like the monetari base  nonborrow reserv  and such  i think there are good reason that we move away decemb                 of     from them   of cours  i   m from the univers of chicago  and so milton friedman is spin right now   laughter  but money demand has not prove to be a veri stabl function over  e  particular now   the money multipli has certain been anyth but stabl  make it more difficult for us to focus credibl on a particular reserv level to see what the ramif are for the rest of the economi   that is not to say that we shouldn   t have an eye on those issu   but given the uncertainti  i would be reluct to focus on that   i think a focus on the asset side is much more effect  ul  in all the program and action that we undertak  we have to think about the exit strategi  as a number of peopl have mention   i think that   s veri import for us both with longer run expect and in just make sure that  as we do interven  we minim the amount of distort   in some sens we are purpos distort what the market is do now  but in some sens we think of the market as be distort from where it normal would oper   so we have to be at peac with that   we need to do that   but we also want to make sure that as much as possibl we tri to restor that function   make clear that we do these thing with reluct and do want to get out of them to restor the normal market function will again be a veri import part of our communic strategi to make this all work   thank
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to make it unanim in thank the staff  for me  particular  you have extend the process by which everi hour that i   ve been here has been deepli educ and have help put the thing i   ve been do sinc i got here in some sort of a context   along those line  the one thing i thought i might address is the econom of the world from whenc i came   and that is the econom that bank manag are face today   becaus i think that   s an import part of this discuss   i   m sure most of you have heard from decemb                 of     banker realli plead not to lower the rate  and there   s a veri good reason for that   i actual expand the number of bank that i normal talk to   in addit to feder advisori committe  the north  ina banker and some of the texa banker   and the plea was unanim   pleas don   t lower the rate   the reason for that realli goe to the prime rate  not the fed fund rate   if the prime rate move down  i do believ that dollar for dollar it   s go to reduc bank profit   if we were to go to zero  if prime were to go to   percent  i think it would take our entir bank system on an oper basi to an unprofit level  to give you an idea  the non interest oper cost of bank have not chang an aw lot over the last seven or eight year   they fluctuat about   basi point  but it   s a littl over   percent of asset in non interest oper cost   the non interest incom that offset that may be    basi point   so you are look at a     basi point hurdl that margin have to get over   the interest yield right now are    basi point lower than they were in       go into the   percent fed fund rate   credit cost are certain higher   they   re higher by    to    basi point   fee incom is lower by    to    basi point   if you put all of that togeth  profit is alreadi lower by    to    basi point   on a margin basi  deposit competit is fierc   cd rate are in the     to     percent rang   money market account are around   percent   new entrant into the insur deposit arena are intensifi this competit still further  and the bank are incred bitter about nonbank come into that arena   lower cost fund is avail from some nondeposit sourc  but the bank are feel pressur from their examin to limit usag of noncor fund  includ discount window borrow   a bank issu the fdic guarante debt last week  three year at a cost of   percent plus the     basi point that they pay the fdic   so that cost is   percent   all of these cost are in excess of the prime rate  decemb                 of     on the asset side  the bank are shi away from purchas of secur becaus of mark to market concern   the new loan that are be book are be tie to prime  but they   re tie to prime with floor  with those floor general in the   to     percent rang   some exist loan have floor  although mani do not   home equiti loan  credit card loan  and smaller bank commerci loan are typic tie to prime   prime might refer that bank   s own prime   and some bank did not lower their prime or were slower to lower their prime the last  e we chang the fed fund target   but more common it will refer new york or wall street prime   larger loan and mortgag are more like to be tie to libor  although i understand that competit in recent year has move toward contract that give the borrow the option at ani  e of use a prime base rate or a libor base rate  with pressur on both side of the interest margin  credit cost are sure to rise  and with the prospect for fee incom down  the bank are uniform beg for no chang   when ask how they might manag with lower rate  most said that the onli choic they would have at this point would be to shrink their balanc sheet rather than compet for busi at a negat spread  the other rate that affect bank profit have not move with the fed fund rate  and so in this case it is about spread  not rate   now  it   s certain possibl that individu bank are exagger the effect that lower rate will have on their institut and that their reaction will not be as strong as they claim   howev  my question is  what if they are right   if we get down to a    basi point regim and we find out that it simpli put our bank system out of busi  how do we then revers that and move back up  and how do we explain that chang  i   m not as familiar with the econom of money market fund  but i have to assum that their pressur are similar  and the note indic that they might be will to oper at a loss for a  e   but the more we communic that this would be an extend amount of  e  how long decemb                 of     would they be will to oper at a loss   no matter where we set our fed fund target  there   s realli veri littl that we can do differ  as in start tomorrow   the current actual rate reflect a broken market   there are much lower volum in the fed fund market right now  and a much higher percentag of those are with institut that can   t earn interest on reserv  so  bill  i still see some hope for the fed fund market come back   over  e  as bank get more comfort with each other  the opportun to get a littl higher yield as well as to open up an unsecur borrow sourc will lead bank back into the fed fund market   but if that market did start to reviv a bit  i would hate for us to be in a regim in which  at that point  we had to pressur it again to bring the rate back down   for this reason i think suspend the fed fund target as a  polici tool rather than lower it might be the safer cours becaus it would let prime find it own level and the bank might not necessarili feel push to lower prime if we did not chang our target  i had a number of note on communic  most of which have been said   but the one point i   d like to make is that  when i think of communic  i think of it on a retail level   i think about our communic to consum and to busi owner rather than to the more sophist audienc that the note tend to refer to   i think we have to be sure that we do communic on a retail level   that we communic on the night news  local newspap level   mani of you have background in educ  and i think at this point it   s our job to teach and explain what we   re do and how it might affect individu consum and individu busi   in that sens  it   s import that we stay on messag and that we have veri clear terminolog that we use over and over again   even in the convers today  the term    quantit eas    was use differ by differ speaker  decemb                 of     i do think we have to be care  again  on the fed fund rate target   i notic the same thing that presid   did as far as the chairman   s decemb   speech   ani  e we talk about the fed fund rate  it is the onli thing that   s go to be report   final  i also think we have to be care about refer to the experi in japan   we should emphas the differ and the reason that we expect to be success becaus  in mani place  refer to the experi in japan lead peopl to believ that we   re in for a veri  veri dismal futur  and i don   t think that   s what we want to communic   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   thank you all   i actual would like to tri to distil some impress from our discuss and  go even a step further  mayb draw some veri tentat conclus for the statement and decis tomorrow   i do that in the spirit of fair becaus tomorrow you have a chanc to rebut what i say now   so let me just draw some tentat conclus  and if you disagre or if there are multipl option  perhap you can respond in our go round tomorrow  first  with respect to the level of the fed fund rate  i think general speak peopl want to be aggress   they recogn the difficulti  the sever  of the situat   some were somewhat fatalist  say  well  we can   t realli keep the rate much abov zero anyway  so it   s somewhat of a moot question   with that said  governor duke was just the last of a number of peopl who did point out that there are various institut  market  and other consider that would suggest tri to keep the rate abov zero if possibl  although she had a veri interest altern  which is just not to have a target  which might be help in at least a few context   let me ask bill about feasibl here   suppos for the sake of argument that we had a rang of    to    and we set the interest rate on reserv at      would that be feasibl   could that work
it might work eventu  but right now i would guess the spread between the effect fund rate and the target would be bigger than that   we   re sort of run that experi right now   the market consensus is that the fed is go to reduc the target    basi point at this meet   that   s incorpor in the current feder fund rate trade becaus it   s the lowest interest on excess reserv dure the two week mainten period   we   re trade in a rang of about    to    basi point   we don   t have that much inform  but right now that spread is probabl    to    basi point   so i think we probabl couldn   t do what you said   if we work on it   you know  took the gses and made it so that they couldn   t sell fed fund and did a few other thing   mayb we could get that spread down to    basi point over  e      do you have anyth
all right   well  that   s relev inform   so it may be that our option are a rang of   to    or no target  but those are two option that i would point to   i should also say  as i discuss the statement here  i think that in a veri real sens this is a transit meet   i mean  we can   t go from   to    in one meet  and i think we have to allow for the possibl that there will be further refin as we go forward into januari   so i rais  as the first point  exact how we state the polici decis   do we make refer to the fund rate   are we okay with a   to    rang   i hear and recogn the concern about too low a rate  and it   s just a question of feasibl in the short term   one advantag about have a rang is that we could indic that over  e we   re tri to get to      that would be at least slight help  i think  the second issu i want to mention is communic   i thought there was actual a good bit of consensus   a number of peopl spoke somewhat approv of an inflat target or some broader inflat object  but i didn   t hear much sen ent for do it immedi or in the veri decemb                  of     near term   i think it is someth that we ought to take veri serious  particular if inflat start to drop further   we should do it in a prepar way  and i need to consult and so on   but i agre with the comment that this is a long term object that we have   this may be an excel opportun to do it becaus not onli is there no tradeoff between growth and inflat in this context but also there won   t be ani suspicion that we   re choos a rate that   s conveni   i mean  we are probabl below the rate that we would choos as a target   so it might be worth consid in the longer term  for tomorrow  though  i did hear quit a bit of interest in condit in term of the zirp  zero interest rate polici  type of strategi   we had   i think it was in altern a  paragraph     a statement that said     the committe anticip that weak econom condit are like to warrant a feder fund rate near zero for some  e      i wonder if that meet what peopl were talk about  or were there peopl who want to express it more explicit in term of our qualit object or otherwis   i hear a willing to have at least a qualit condit for our polici   i would invit overnight or tomorrow ani altern phrase that peopl think might be more effect   it is an import decis to make  the third issu   and i   m just make veri high level comment here  i have a whole bunch of note that i   m not go to repeat at this point   has to do with our various program and purchas   i think that the great major of the committe is comfort with mbs and treasuri purchas   at least that   s what i heard   i took a major to be in favor of  or at least accept  the credit facil that we have   there were request for more metric  more explan  more criteria  more exit strategi  and so on  and i think those were all valid point   what i take from this is that these asset side program  the credit facil as well as the mbs and other program  are part of our new regim  that most peopl view them as part of our new regim  and that the decemb                  of     inclus in our statement of some refer to these kind of program  as in the variant that were circul in the bluebook  would probabl be desir  a point of consider discuss and some content  with respect to both govern and communic  was the use of a measur of the base or excess reserv as a quantit indic of monetari polici   with those who advoc it  i think there were realli two object  if i may   one was to have a measur of monetari polici that would influenc expect and  if effect  would rais inflat expect and the like   but anoth function of that  i believ  was the desir to have  from a govern perspect  the fomc set some kind of indic of monetari polici   with respect to the use of  say  the base as a measur of monetari polici  i would say that for tomorrow we   re pretti far from be abl to feel comfort do that   we haven   t done the work   we haven   t done the analysi of the transmiss mechan   we haven   t look at what monitor rang and how they might work   so it would be a radic step to take in one meet   i leav that open as we continu to think about what the right indic of polici are  i understand the desir for govern   i think what i would propos   and again  by all mean  respond tomorrow   would be  at least in our direct  that we have  as somewhat suggest alreadi  the committe affirm or otherwis indic it approv of quantit program        billion mbs       billion gse debt       billion for talf  if you are will  et cetera   and pursuant to that  that the board make a regular practic of bring ani new program or ani expans of exist program to the fomc for review and discuss   that may not be entir satisfactori  but it would certain indic to the public that the fomc has review it from a monetari polici perspect  and it would appear in the direct  the minut  and so on   i put that out as just a possibl compromis on that issu  decemb                  of     i think those are the main element of the statement and the direct   i heard a lot about a desir for an explanatori document  talk point  other support materi  speech  and press confer   we hear that  and it will be veri import for us to tri to develop such materi   i said at the begin that i think it   s unusu import for us to tri to speak in a unifi way extern  not becaus i want to avoid dissent   and of cours  everyon   s view can be express   but as governor duke point out  becaus i think we have an educ mission here that need to be taken serious   so the more consist we can be in our explan and our discuss  the better it will be  those are just some thing that i drew from the discuss   again  you   ll have an opportun tomorrow  at least one go round or mayb two go round  to agre or disagre   ani comment   final thought  all right   the first question is  what  e do we begin tomorrow   we are schedul for      a m   i think that would be adequ     everyon feel comfort keep their econom go round remark reason short   that   s the tradeoff   if everyon is game for that  we   ll start tomorrow morn at      and now adjourn the board meet   you didn   t notic that   and also just remind you that there   s a recept and dinner avail for your conveni   there will be no busi conduct at that dinner   thank you   see you in the morn   meet

note earlier  financi condit have deterior further in recent week   as can be seen in the top left panel  the index of financi stress that we track continu to rise sharpli   one import compon of that increas in stress has been the further widen of corpor bond spread for invest grade issu  shown by the gray shade area in the top right panel    in addit  equiti price are lower than we project  take an even bigger bite out of household resourc   meanwhil  in the extern sector  the path of the dollar  shown in the middl right panel  is somewhat stronger than in our octob forecast  and the outlook for foreign econom activ has weaken further   shaghil ahm will have more to say about these develop short   as you know from read part   of the  book  in light of the intensif of recessionari forc that emerg over the intermeet period  we base this forecast on the assumpt of a lower level of the feder fund rate than in our previous project  not shown    in addit  we now assum that      billion in new fiscal s ulus action will be enact earli next year  on top of the rough      billion in the s ulus packag enact earlier this year   these assum fiscal action includ perman tax cut for most individu  higher transfer payment  grant to state and local govern  and support for hous   as shown in the bottom left panel  these new feder program boost the impetus to gdp growth from fiscal polici consider relat to our assumpt in the octob  book  two other factor also provid more support to real activ in this forecast   first  mortgag rate  the bottom right panel  have fallen about    percentag point sinc the octob  book   with the spread over the    year treasuri yield still quit wide  we project that mortgag rate will fall further over the project period   second  oil price  not shown  have fallen more in recent week than we anticip in the decemb                  of     octob  book  the lag effect of these declin provid a greater lift to spend in        the top left panel of your next exhibit summar our medium term project  on balanc  we expect that the factor restrain activ will far outweigh the support influenc  with real gdp fall at an annual rate of   percent in the first half of next year   the declin is led by a steep drop in busi fix invest  line   and      in the second half of the year  real activ begin a slow recoveri as pce  line    pick up and residenti invest  line    begin to stabil   in       the recoveri is project to gain momentum as household spend strengthen further and busi purchas of equip and softwar begin to rise   as is typic  the recoveri in

 and we don   t see monetari eas as like to generat as much impetus to recoveri   in fact  as the third bullet point note  the feder fund rate is alreadi close to the zero lower bound  great limit the scope for convent monetari polici to provid further s ulus to real activ   the import of this last factor is illustr by the bottom set of panel   the exercis is similar to the simul present in the

combin of greater fiscal s ulus and nontradit monetari action than we have built into the current project   decemb                  of     your final exhibit summar the outlook for inflat   as shown in line   of the top left panel  we now project that total pce price inflat will slow to about   percent in       while the core rate  line    fall to     percent   the declin in inflat reflect a combin of widen slack in resourc util  reduc energi and materi price  and a net declin in core import price  these factor also push down long run inflat expect   i should note that we receiv data on the novemb cpi this morn   the total cpi fell     percent  driven by a sharp drop in energi price   the core cpi was unchang last month   we had been expect an increas of     percent   one measur of resourc util  the unemploy rate  is project to reach    percent in        in our forecast  the wide unemploy rate gap put substanti downward pressur on cost and price   howev  as suggest in the middl left panel  we may be overst the downward pressur on inflat caus by slack   in particular  the current cycl has been associ with especi larg employ declin in sever industri  notabl construct and financ   if these declin are lead to an unusu amount of employ realloc across industri  structur unemploy would increas  which in turn would rais the nairu   the remain panel present some analysi of the issu use a measur of sector realloc and a set of beveridg curv   the middl right panel depict an index of sector employ realloc across industri   the index is base on the growth rate of employ in    industri relat to the growth rate of total employ  adjust at the industri level for typic cyclic movement in employ share and is similar in spirit to a measur construct at the chicago fed   as can be seen  even after remov the typic cyclic behavior  increas in sector realloc often occur around recess  which is not surpris sinc each busi cycl produc a uniqu set of imbal   inde  the amount of sector realloc indic by this measur has been rise over the past year or so  howev  to date it remain low relat to previous spike in realloc   anoth way to determin whether there has been a rise in

index as the measur of job open   if there has been a signific increas in structur unemploy  then one would expect that for a given level of the job open rate  the unemploy rate would be unusu high   that is  to the right of the plot beveridg curv   this might occur  for exampl  if mani of the job open were for nurs but a disproportion number of the unemploy were bond trader  who are not qualifi for the job open   laughter   so  what do these beveridg curv say about structur unemploy   the blue and red circl in the two panel show the data point for the third quarter of      and for the most recent month avail   the latest read from the jolt decemb                  of     do stand to the right of the es  curv  while the latest read from the help want index are close in line with past experi   at this point we are reluct to draw strong conclus from just a coupl of observ from either measur  and we read the evid as consist with at most a small increas in structur unemploy thus far

thank you   remind me what your anticip of the current account deficit is for next year
i think the deficit goe down to about   percent
yes   we see the current account deficit  as shaghil said  bounc between   and     percent of gdp through      and        in the near term  you have much weaker foreign growth and a stronger dollar  but that is offset by the lower level of oil price  so that keep the current account deficit around the   to     percent rang
okay   thank you   question for our colleagu   presid bullard
i was just look at the polici rate abroad here   this is the pictur in exhibit    i guess   it show the ecb  the bank of canada  and the bank of england all level out befor they get to zero   do you have a sens of what the plan are there  or what they are say about that  or are we go to see a sort of global move to zero   what is your sens of that
look at the polici that is go forward  first of all  we are forecast here what we think they will do  not necessarili what we think they should do   given their past decemb                  of     behavior  we think that they will be ratchet up the rate the first chanc they get   the  e is a bit differ  but the rate are broad in line with market particip    expect   in the case of the euro area  for exampl  at the end we are even a littl lower than the market particip are expect
so this is from survey of market particip
no   this is our project
right   but you are get the inform from survey and other thing
it is inform by survey  yes
i would add that i think the ecb in particular has a real avers to polici activ   in fact  trichet was on the wire this morn indic that they are not realli comfort with where they are right now   they may paus in januari  and i think it realli would take a more sever outcom for activ in the euro area than what we have incorpor in our forecast to get the ecb down to zero   nevertheless  that is a risk   i would say that there are downsid risk here   i would put a higher probabl on see the bank of england or the bank of canada go to zero   but as shaghil emphas  here we are basic just write down what we think they are go to do  and we general follow the futur market fair close  but it certain would be a surpris to me if  over the next six month  we saw other major central bank in the proxim of zero
just a comment on the project for china   these number seem to be less than what they are say offici   am i correct
yes   these number are less
that sort of jibe with the report that i am hear back from the ceo do busi in china   in fact  the cutback has been much more dramat than they expect  semiconductor firm  for exampl  have put ship stop order  mean they are stop for lack of payment  and the retail are see a notic drop in attend at their store   but i think that our number are more fit
i think the latest offici number don   t incorpor the novemb data  which just came out   actual  they came out ye day   and some trade data sinc the  book
but you are say that we do expect further currenc depreci
in the near term  yes  through the first half of next year
i have three question  mr  chairman   one on the commerci paper market   what is the spread between a  p  and a  p  right now
for term  it is a huge spread  probabl     basi point or so  but overnight it is much smaller
as you go out the term  it is even more
so the incent for a  p  borrow is to do everyth they can to keep that status  obvious   it is a much more attract proposit
yes  mr     which lead to more conserv financi manag and busi manag   you do everyth you can not to becom an a  p  borrow  to slip off the a  p  ladder
histor bbb was the sweet spot of the corpor capit structur  and that was associ with a  p  commerci paper borrow  which peopl thought was safe   it turn out not to be quit as attract as they had thought  mr covitz   i think over histori this isn   t the onli  e when a  p s have come under stress   whenev there were disrupt in the market   for exampl  after the california util default in the earli part of the decad   a  p  outstand plummet  and a  p  spread rose  though not near to this magnitud   this is truli extraordinari   but that is a portion of the market that is under stress becaus this market in general tend to be veri  veri skittish   at the first sign of troubl  there is quantiti ration   i didn   t show the outstand of the a  p s  but they have gone down   as i think i mention      percent in the last coupl of month   so quantiti ration is alreadi take place  and they are have troubl get over year end
i guess my point is that the way in which it work is that it give peopl incent to be even more conserv in the financi manag of their oper   on household credit  do we have a sens of how much shift is take place between credit card usag and debit card usag   under these condit of duress  has that been a notic chang  or is it just margin
i don   t know those data
it might be someth to look at next  e   final  on the inflat tabl in exhibit     and you have talk about the number that were releas this morn   do you see addit month deflationari number on the headlin cpi  or could you see this happen for a prolong period  say for a quarter   we have a tabl here for             and        on the top line  the pce price index  do we envis month or perhap quarter extens of deflationari headlin number
no   we have anoth two month of small declin anticip as the energi price continu to pass through and then  beyond that  some small increas   so we don   t see this as an extend period of negat headlin
so decemb januari
decemb januari   exact
and what is the order of magnitud
we are look for about minus     percent in decemb and minus     in januari   we are also not expect the core figur to remain as low as they have been run for the past month or two   we do think that they have been held down by some veri signific declin in air fare   that could continu for anoth month or two   again  as the energi price pass through work   they have also been held down by some veri larg declin in lodg away from home  which is a volatil seri  and it is not like to sustain this level  despit the fact that we don   t see them as low as they have been the past two month   that is  declin to flat   we are expect some fair small increas go forward   we have core inflat head down  and all of these exhibit have shown a signific reduct in price pressur come from import price  from energi price  and from broader commod price as well as the increas in slack that  as stephani point out  is keep a real lid on labor cost
thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   our staff   such a fine job   mayb my hear is go  but i miss the name of our staff present   can we get them introduc to us
i   m stephani aaronson
i   m dan covitz
great   thank you veri much   i have a question for stephani   you know  they do such a great job
are you feel okay    laughter
we apolog for our lack of manner    laughter
mayb it is a southern thing  i don   t know    laughter   the sector realloc is realli intrigu  and it is someth that i have been curious about in this whole episod   the measur is not one i am familiar with   it is one for which you count each industri as a unit  right
exact   it is a lilien type of dispers index   this isn   t actual how we calcul it  but it is essenti how the industri   s share of employ chang relat to total employ   so it is the growth in that industri   s employ relat to total employ   what we do is that we know that over the busi cycl each industri has a typic pattern   durabl employ goe down a lot dure recess wherea  say  health care  sn   t go down that much   those type of chang aren   t typic associ with sector realloc   that is  we don   t realli think of those thing that are typic over the cycl as be associ with an increas in the nairu   we want to take those out  so we take out the typic cyclic movement  such as manufactur alway goe down in a recess and financ is acycl
and hous alway goe down in a recess
hous and construct alway go down  so we take that out  and then we say  okay  so now there are these atyp movement that are greater than we usual decemb                  of     see   that is what we would consid the sector realloc   that is what is left over   you can see  as i mention in the brief  that actual dure recess there is a lot of sector realloc  even onc you take out the usual declin in employ that differ across industri   that is becaus each recess has differ caus   differ industri have grown a lot dure the boom   like financ recent or  say  communic dure the late     s   and those sector are go to shrink more than usual dure the recess and get back to more of an equilibrium state   that is what is go on here
yes   so it is sort of a bummer that these go up in the recess if you are tri to measur what is happen to the nairu   but i alway thought of the phrase    sector realloc    as have to do with the theori of the busi cycl in which cyclic downturn are caus by an unexpect declin in a given industri that caus resourc to shift out of that industri and that it take  e for them to be absorb into some other industri   from that point of view   if you are tri to measur that compon as oppos to polici induc  widespread declin in activ   i would think you would want not to take out the cyclic part  i am think about hous   we devot a lot of resourc to hous in       much less now  those resourc thrown on the market  in fact  are the proxim caus of the initi downturn in employ growth   a lot of ancillari industri are relat  so i would think that  if we didn   t take out the usual hous cyclic thing  which is realli sharp in the earli period  you would see a bigger rise here
i have look at that  and actual  it  sn   t make that much of a differ   construct goe down in everi recess  and so by that measur sector realloc is higher in everi recess   i mean  construct is contribut more to sector realloc here than in previous recess becaus the declin have been larger   so that fact decemb                  of     is captur   the fact that construct is have a larger than typic declin is precis what is captur here   but even if you said  okay  well  mayb in everi recess industri shrink and that is associ with some sector realloc  the measur actual look veri similar   not just across the current episod but across all the episod
yes  yes   i guess it is also relat to how you think about the nairu  to some extent  if unemploy goe up in recess  then what unemploy is suppos to be goe up in recess as well  it seem   i have a question about the first exhibit   it is the first set of exhibit   it is also about commerci paper   would you folk encourag us to view the improv that has taken place in the a  p  market as a measur of how the a  p  market might have improv had we not interven   it is sort of a baselin  right   it is like the control group
i think it is veri difficult to interpret it that way becaus the intervent did happen and the bulk of the improv happen subsequ to the intervent
what sort of spillov from our intervent in a  p  do we expect perhap to have influenc or to have led to an improv in a  p
i think that the declin in the a  p  overnight suggest improv   but there is some concern about sampl select  and you have to worri about that at the same  e   it could be just that you are get higher qualiti issuer in the a  p  sector   but it turn out you   re not   it turn out that it explain onli about half of that declin
you know  it also may have help the money market fund industri to keep it money know that there was a facil outstand that could provid liquid for that sector becaus we did see inflow back into the money market mutual fund
so their willing to buy a  p  may have been affect by anoth program  not the cp one   you are say the money market fund program
they provid more stabil to the system as a whole
to the prime money fund
so we can   t separ the individu program
there is a second factor   there has been discuss of extend the a  p  program to a  p   which the industri is certain awar of  but i would highlight with the a  p  that a lot of the mutual fund do not want to hold it over the end of the year   most of the a  p  borrow are have troubl roll over year end   there is a real risk that that market will have to reli on backup line of credit  and it   s not clear whether the a  p  market come back after the new year  if that happen  or in what capac it     so i think the real test will be to look at this chart in januari or februari
well  you wouldn   t expect specul about immin extens of the program to a  p  to support the overnight rate for a  p  unless they expect it to be implement overnight   a question about strain   to what extent are we abl to disentangl whether the market is strain or the issuer are strain
in the cp market itself
you can look at credit rate  for exampl  or what   s happen to their profit   it is high like that the strain in the cp market are more dramat than ani chang in the under financi condit of the a  p  borrow
you could think about what the default risk is  say  for the corpor sector  you could break down a pretti simpl model of default condit upon our outlook for the economi  and that would have the default rate rise
but you don   t observ investor    expect default themselv
you don   t  but you can take a guess at what you think that is  and it is higher   it is not at great depress level under ani of the model i   ve look at   it   s not even at the level of default rate in
so you are say that this paper is underpr   is that how you measur strain   i am alway curious as to what strain mean
the way  that i   m refer to it is just that risk premium are realli  realli larg   i   m not say that they are necessarili irrat   i am just say that they are realli  realli larg
thank   great job
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a question or observ  which is of the op ist varieti although it present sort of a challeng   in the medium term outlook in exhibit    if you focus on       the  book project has real gdp grow at     percent   we   re begin to come out of this   the unemploy rate is peak   if you could implement the op  control feder fund rate  it would be bottom out   mayb that would mean whatev quantit eas credit program we would be do would be at their peak and mayb would be come off   but it is also the  e that the inflat rate is low and continu to fall   this is go to be a tension for us as we start think about  and we are about to engag in mention  the possibl that inflat could be   well  whatev   lower than ideal   what would you guess the risk might be around that inflat forecast   how hard is it go to be for us not to continu to worri about inflat be low or to communic that inflat is go to continu to be low even though thing are improv   just ani kind of advic would be help
my guess is that  if our baselin forecast evolv in the way we are expect here  you are still go to be worri about the downsid risk to inflat even if  in fact  we were in the process of bottom out becaus there will still be a veri substanti output gap   on the commod price side  thing are fair stabl  and at least in our forecast  inflat expect are probabl drift down some   on the other hand  there are upsid risk to that inflat forecast as well   i do actual think that our baselin forecast  on the assumpt that we have had to make in construct it  is reason well balanc becaus anoth possibl is  in contrast to the gradual downtrend that we   re expect in inflat expect  that inflat expect will be stickier  you will be abl to convey a greater sens that you wouldn   t want inflat over the longer haul move down below   percent  we won   t get as much disinfl into inflat expect or into labor cost  and you   ll get greater stabil there than we   re expect   so to my mind  look ahead  monitor how those inflat expect evolv in the context of an economi where thing are weaken will be veri import
on the same topic   the medium term outlook and  in particular  the op  control exercis at the bottom  which is show us how we   re constrain   is there some quantit polici that we could undertak that would get us to the   line here  mayb by creat more inflat than we would think desir in the long run
the point of construct this op  control is to say that  gee  if you weren   t constrain  here is how we thought op  behavior   the sort of op  outcom   would be  given the shock   you   re ask me whether or not there are quantit polici that you could put in place   i was actual hope that you folk were go to be abl to tell me  decemb                  of      laughter   you face a challeng in construct polici  but we have collect a challeng in understand how whatev polici you implement are actual go to show through into our longer term outlook   the point here is that  in the absenc of some nonconvent monetari polici action or substanti fiscal s ulus  we see a veri extend period of weak activ  high output gap  and declin inflat
some  what peopl do is they say  okay  suppos you could just control inflat direct  which we know is hard  but suppos then you just trace out an op  path for inflat that would get you to the   line
obvious  if you could levit inflat expect  that would be one thing   the other thing is that note    in the packag we sent you includ some exercis that suggest  if you took action that could signific reduc the long term treasuri rate and compress mortgag spread  there would be way in which you   d be abl to provid more s ulus for the economi   now  all those thing we suggest  at least the one that we show in that note  weren   t suffici to get you back to equilibrium quick   but there are polici  obvious  that we think will be abl to provid some s ulus
this op  control exercis then would have an object that would be a quadrat object in some real output or unemploy
minim the unemploy rate and the deviat of inflat from it target
that   s say that you wouldn   t be will to suspend your inflat target for a while to improv thing on the real side   i think that might be help as well becaus then the committe could think about what those tradeoff are   in ordinari  e  you might have a certain weight on the two object  but you might shift that in other situat
if i can also just put this in a littl more context   by the end of       the gap on the unemploy rate between the baselin and the op  control is about   percentag point   so if you use a simpl rule of thumb from an     s law type of model  that would be a coupl of percentag point on the level of gdp   gdp would have to grow a coupl of percentag point fa  over      and      to close that   percentag point gap in the unemploy rate between the baselin and the op  control
question for nathan   in an earlier meet  if i recal correct  there was mention of the european bank    exposur to emerg market sovereign debt   a concern about the trend line in that sovereign debt   are you track that in ani sens   my concern is that there could be anoth full blown debt crisi of some kind come   it is not cover in these chart  but do you have a sens of default risk on the part of emerg market sovereign
the european bank are particular expos  much more so than u s  bank or japanes bank   a big chunk of that exposur is to central and ea n europ  and as you suggest  we see signific risk to the european bank as a result of that exposur   what make it even a littl dicier is that exposur is concentr in sever countri  particular sweden  austria  and to a slight lesser extent itali   recent there has been signific econom turmoil in hungari and ukrain   the fund has step in  and the eu has help as well with larg financ packag   the latest one we   re watch veri close is the situat in latvia  where the exchang rate is signific overvalu   the extern posit look veri  veri dicey   the fund is in there negoti a program   there has been a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the exchang rate regim   the bank system also look vulner   so what should be done with the bank   it is not exact clear how all that is go to be resolv   my person feel is that  given decemb                  of     the risk   and the european recogn the extent of the risk   if latvia goe  it could blow out the rest of the baltic and then sweep around into central and ea n europ and then feed back into we n europ   so i see the risk there as be of first order for the european  given that recognit  i think that the eu and major european govern are go to do what   s necessari to make sure that the situat in latvia stabil at least for a while   the end game over the next sever year is veri much an open issu for a lot of these economi that were in erm ii and evolv into hope to adopt the euro   i think that there are potenti some veri pronounc vulner and some pain adjust that will need to happen in some of those central and ea n european countri   so absolut that is a major risk   it   s one we   re watch as close as we can
nathan  you would probabl have been arrest for treason if you had said that in latvia   liter   the economist who give a negat forecast is arrest for treason   stay here    laughter
other question   if not  let   s start our go round with first vice presid cum
thank you   i thought i would make a coupl of point that underscor the substanti increas in the downsid risk that we incorpor into the forecast that you all receiv on friday   that chang was realli encourag by our econom advisori panel  which suggest that the downsid risk were much larger than we were es  at the end of novemb  first  we have been meet  as of cours all of you do  with small busi peopl   bill   put a panel of investor togeth  too  and i have a coupl observ out of that and our discuss with communiti banker   one is that the cutback in financ are veri real   there is a decemb                  of     lot of evid that the bank are go in and look at line and cut them back to both investor and the small busi communiti   the small busi communiti is also on the receiv end of much tighter financi manag at their larger custom   that is  the peopl they   re suppli   as those firm are not pay their bill or are extend the term on which they pay their bill to a much greater number of day   that has induc a hunker down mental on the part of the small busi owner   the other sober thing they point out to us   and this is veri much in line with governor duke   s comment about the communiti bank ye day  we hear the same thing   is that small busi and the communiti bank can hold out for a while but not forev  margin are get squeez  and financ is get squeez   the precautionari action that the small busi are take will help them for a while  but they can   t hold out for more than six or nine month  that is a particular sober statement for us in the second district becaus  despit the fact that we are at the epicent of the financi industri in new york   a major driver for the second district economi   we have onli just bare start to feel the effect of layoff and reduct in activ in the citi   our region lead indic index went down veri  veri sharpli in the month of octob  but that is still to be realiz in the economi   in particular  when we have look at past episod  the declin in incom that we have suffer in the region have rang between   percent and    percent in the financi industri when we actual get into one of these advers period   that declin is usual spread over three or four year  so we are realli talk about someth that could last a good bit longer than six to nine month in our district  second  we do a survey of inflat expect that is in mani way similar to the michigan survey  and our survey result are almost complet and are veri similar to those of the michigan survey   but we do ask one question that isn   t ask there  and that is about the longer decemb                  of     run   that is  the         outlook for price and inflat   from that we can imput a risk of deflat  which was   or   percent in earli octob and is now    percent   so that risk of deflat seem to be grow even in the kind of popul that is survey by the michigan folk   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as request  i will be brief   like the  book  we see an economi in which the unemploy rate remain veri elev  and inflat is below my target for sever year   our own equat would indic that these elev unemploy rate are like to put even more downward pressur on the inflat rate than forecast in the  book   the labor market is extrem weak  and there is a signific risk of deflat   i believ that greater use of nontradit polici will be need to mitig more sever outcom than encompass in the baselin forecast  on the financi side i would just highlight two point   first  mani bank are place interest rate floor on home equiti loan and on commerci loan   pervas use of floor may make the choic of which low feder fund target to pick of littl relev to actual borrow cost   we may want to consid survey bank to get a better understand of where these floor are current be set   second  mani firm are report that their line are not be renew and are assert that it reflect problem with the bank not the borrow   discuss with communiti bank indic that  for smaller borrow  communiti bank are benefit from this trend  howev  it may be use to understand better how the reduct in line  particular at troubl bank  are affect the overal economi  just a general point   i think bank micro behavior is go to be veri import for macroeconom outcom  and we might want to increas the amount of effort that we are put decemb                  of     into understand both their financi condit and how their behavior may be chang over the next six to nine month   whether that   s done through the bank supervis process or the loan offic survey or which mechan we use  i think we need to probabl get a littl more intellig on exact what those trend are   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom news sinc the last meet has certain been grim  and our present today bore that out   our director and other district contact are quit gloomi  and their report are also consist with a broad base pullback in discretionari outlay by consum and firm  in these circumst with the fund rate around     percent  it is hard to see a benefit of prolong ani further reduct   i agre with the staff analysi that ani potenti disloc in money market institut is like to be minor  and i observ that  to the extent that money market institut provid valu to the economi in the form of circumvent of prohibit on interest and other legal restrict on financi arrang  the tradit welfar analysi would count their demis as a benefit rather than a cost   but i have to admit i haven   t tri explain that to a money market fund manag    laughter  the hard question now  i think  concern the possibl of deflat   we have seen negat overal inflat sinc energi price peak in juli   it was     percent for the pce at an annual rate sinc then and     percent befor today   s releas for the cpi   and the core index have soften notabl as well   i still think we are go to be abl to avoid this fair easili  but i do not think the risk is neglig   it is one of the most danger prospect we face right now  and we have to pay veri close attent to it   the reason i think it is go to be easi to avoid is that we have seen declin in core inflat befor when energi price fell   mid      and late      are recent decemb                  of     exampl   further  compens growth   not yet appear to be slow rapid  although those data are fair date and so it is hard to sens what the last coupl of month are go to look like  the key to avoid deflat  of cours  is our abil to shape expect about the futur cours of monetari polici   i had a spirit discuss about this last night over salad with governor kohn and mr  eggertsson   this is essenti what all the model tell you   that stay out of a deflationari equilibrium requir commit to path for the monetari base that are inconsist with a steadili fall price level and that commit to keep the nomin interest rate low is not suffici  now  it is sort of hard to get a handl on this   it took me a while  but the key to think about this is that model with taylor type rule emb within them the perfect credibl of inflat return in the long run or over a medium term to the target rate that is built into the taylor reaction function   if instead you take those model and just allow arbitrari fiscal and monetari polici rule  that is when you are forc to face the result that commit to an infinit seri of zero nomin rate is not suffici and that you have to keep a monetari aggreg from declin along with the price level  one way to think about this is that it is just like prevent inflat   to prevent inflat  we have to prevent expect that the valu of money will fall in the futur   to rule that out  we have to rule out expect that the quantiti of money is go to rise continu  and we do that with interest rate   this line of reason is differ from the reason you get in a phillip curv with pure backward look expect  where you have a recurs relationship between real growth and inflat   instead  in ani model with a littl forward look stuff  you have expect drive thing   prevent deflat is the same thing   prevent expect that the valu of money will rise indefinit   to do that you need to prevent expect that the decemb                  of     quantiti of money will fall indefinit  and you would like to do that with low interest rate  but you cannot at the zero bound   so you have to influenc expect about the futur cours of the base   this to me is the simpl intuit for that   all of this is just to suggest that our abil to communic is go to be crucial
includ over salad    laughter
all of these strategi are  e inconsist  of cours   so we have to be will as a committe to sit here and accept higher than normal inflat ex post   i just point that out   we have to ask ourselv if we would be will and if the public would be will to accept that
e inconsist    is anoth way to say that they requir commit
i understand   i   m just say that there are also differ way to do it   we could also just target a higher inflat rate  which is probabl anoth way of do it
right   you could target the inflat rate not fall   i mean  we don   t have to go all the way   this is the subtl thing about this   i think the pure taylor rule overst our credibl  but peopl do not think that we are go to follow it perfect   they don   t have veri diffus prior over what polici   we are somewher in between  and i think bol  that credibl is import   someth i was go to say in the polici round   given that we haven   t announc a target  we ought to tri that first   that come first  befor say that we are go to move our target up for a littl while
i would just comment   and i think that your point is a good one   as we go forward  we are go to be think hard about how to influenc expect  absolut   your point is also right  as we discuss earlier  about whi we need addit polici besid our zero rate polici  either other kind of quantit polici that are obvious link to decemb                  of     base movement or fiscal or other polici as well   so i don   t think there is that much disagr on the analysi
no  i do not think so   the point i was make about the base is that none of those is suffici to rule out deflat without specifi what the base is
okay   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   the report from my contact have been veri weak for sever week now   sad  i feel as though the data have been catch up with the anecdot comment that i have been receiv for a while   i have been hear a lot of comment along the line of    order have fallen off a sheer cliff        the light were sudden switch off     and    my busi is dead in the water      one thing i have notic is that the negat outlook has spread to more and more corner of the economi  even those corner that had remain robust for a relat longer period   for exampl  one of my director  who run a manufactur compani and export    percent of his product  is a produc of high special equip that is use in steel product   he has few competitor and no debt  and until recent he was feel veri comfort with a two and a half year backlog   last week he report that the backlog has essenti vanish  his custom    problem have now becom his problem   this has becom a typic refrain   we had becom use to hear compani talk about their desir to hold onto liquid   now busi are also focus on how they are go to protect themselv in this weaken economi   even busi with a healthi amount of cash are cut back sharpli on invest  hire  and product plan  in this environ  it is clear that forecast need to be revis down sharpli   like the  book  my own project  which seem pretti dire just a month ago  has also been revis down sharpli with the incom data and anecdot   the question now is how long and how deep a decemb                  of     declin we will experi   at the same  e  it also remain difficult to judg how far disinfl will go   my project see substanti output gap and energi price that are like to remain low  that has caus me to lower my inflat project further as well   my inflat forecast now is clear below desir level for much of        still  it look as though the risk remain veri much to the downsid for output and inflat  if onli becaus further downsid miss are get more and more problemat   the insur metaphor  i think  has been exhaust   we are now more in a situat of treat mass trauma   perhap some of our action will later be judg as have gone too far   but in my view  right now it clear is better to ensur that the treatment is larg enough rather than risk fall short   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   the third district econom news is similar to the nation news   it   s all bad   our decemb busi outlook survey  which remain confidenti until thursday  will post anoth veri weak number   in novemb the number was minus       the decemb read will be releas  and it will be minus        somewhat better but still deepli in negat territori   new order  shipment  and employ are all veri weak   price index on the survey have fallen appreci below zero for the past two month and are near their lowest level sinc we began the survey in        this is after be at near their highest level over the same interv just a few month ago   moreov  firm are expect price to continu to declin  novemb   s read mark the first  e that the futur price paid index has been negat   the mood is general quit grim   the  book also paint a veri bleak pictur   i would like to think that this isn   t the most like outcom  but it is increas difficult to argu against that base on recent econom data   i have revis down my own forecast  of cours   although i   m still not quit as pessimist as the  book  i admit that the  book is no longer an outlier as i am use to decemb                  of     think about it   the forecast for output are near as bad as or are wors than the economi experienc in           inflat has moder signific  and near term inflationari expect have also moder   our decemb livingston survey particip see cpi inflat averag just    percent in        in the  book  forecast core inflat will be just over   percent next year and will deceler to   percent in       with the growth prospect so weak and inflat expect deceler  the appropri real fund rate obvious will probabl declin  rais the possibl as we discuss ye day that the zero bound on nomin rate will pose a problem for us   at the same  e  sinc mid septemb the effect fund rate has been trade well below the fomc   s target of   percent   as we discuss ye day  we are effect conduct monetari polici through quantit eas   by which i mean an expans of the fed   s balanc sheet by both convent and nonconvent mean   i have no object in principl to this eas process  but as i discuss ye day  i believ that we need to acknowledg public that we are now in a new regim  with a new way of implement monetari polici  and that it is a deliber choic of this committe   otherwis we risk confus market particip or impli that we are no longer in control of monetari polici  but in do so  we need to communic how this polici will be conduct go forward   the board of governor and the fomc will have to decid how they will handl the govern issu surround this new regim   it seem clear to me that monetari polici determin should remain in the purview of the fomc regardless of whether we are use standard or nonstandard polici tool  thus  i think we have to come to grip with three veri import polici issu at this junctur   they includ     how to implement monetari polici via an expans of our balanc sheet for standard fed fund target      what decisionmak process the fomc and the board decemb                  of     should use in implement these polici via the balanc sheet expans  and     how to communic all of these to the public in a transpar and  most import  credibl fashion   i agre with the chairman that we need to maintain and embrac the collabor process between the board of governor and the fomc  which has been our method of move forward dure this crisi   but i remain convinc that in these  e of uncertainti we need to be explicit and to communic that monetari polici remain under the purview of the fomc   as we discuss ye day  our primari goal is to set polici that yield the best econom outcom for the economi  consist with our dual mandat   i think our histori demonstr that the institut structur of the fomc and clear articul goal and method yield the best polici   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   i think presid   at the last meet actual propos that  sinc we all knew where the economi was  we just suspend discuss and get on to what to do about it   forgiv me for a six week reaction function here  presid    but i tend to agre with that   i will be veri brief   the point i will make have either been made or will be made  i am sure    laughter   we are face dysfunct financi market  a rapid weaken real economi  and a veri negat psycholog  a darken mood   in addit  i am pick up in my contact uncertainti or even question of what can be done and what good anyth close to convent monetari polici will do   my board of director  advisori council  and other contact reflect deepen pessim  and mani of those contact confirm the view that consum activ and the economi in general pull back dramat in septemb and octob  i have adjust my forecast similar to the  book and commerci forecast   i think it is veri difficult at this point to forecast with ani confid that condit will gel in a way decemb                  of     necessari for a recoveri   the  book see a somewhat sharper snapback by midyear  reflect the influenc of a fiscal s ulus  than i am prepar at this  e to project   our forecast assum a protract period of weak through all of       somewhat more along the line of the    more financi stress    scenario in the  book  regard financi market  i would just comment that the pressur on the hedg fund sector have clear not abat and may be intensifi   over the weekend we pick up rumor of a fed intervent that has not been discuss here  so i presum that it was just a rumor  nonetheless  rumor were circul that a major hedg fund group was about to collaps and that our peopl were    in     so to speak  over the weekend   as bill mention ye day  the madoff scandal certain has not help the pictur regard hedg fund  regard risk  it is not my baselin scenario  but the risk of deflat obvious cannot be ignor  and the appar speed of disinfl is quit a concern   the atlanta staff prepar sever forecast scenario  and there were some plausibl downsid scenario that realli were quit ugli  so to preview later comment  i think the balanc of risk at this point is decid to the downsid and justifi a trauma manag approach   or  in more normal term  a risk manag approach   of act aggress at this meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  and if there has been ani intervent in hedg fund  the chairman is unawar of it    laughter
i am reliev to hear that
he just want you to know about it  mr  chairman
you said    has been       laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district   s economi  like the other  has systemat worsen   layoff are increas   our retail sale are down   the hous market is certain not improv  and manufactur has weaken   in our two stronger area  energi is show a pretti good slowdown with these falloff in price  and rig are be stack  the agricultur sector is also feel the pressur as commod price fall   so it is uniform poor  as far as the nation economi and outlook go  i have no major differ with the outlook that has been present by other   i would tell you that we have done differ project ourselv   i think a lot depend on what will be develop on the fiscal side as we move from here  and i am kind of wait to see about that  i do have one other comment and perhap request as we think about this  and it follow on ye day   s convers   it strike me  as i look broad and see what   s happen in our own region  that the intermedi process is broken as it goe through the bank industri and then more broad than that   the deleverag process that is under way is actual acceler   it is worsen and complic our abil to fix the intermedi process   as a result  we as the central bank are go around that process as we tri to get credit work  and i understand that  but it   have consequ   some good for those particular market where we   re bring intermedi forward but also perhap some not so good as other sector are left behind in that  my point is that we realli do have to focus  in work on the fiscal side with the treasuri or whomev  on fix the broken intermedi process  and that is the bank industri   i know we are work with the tarp   it need some addit work   but out of that come my request  we spent a fair amount of  e ye day talk about the japanes experi   i wonder if we wouldn   t benefit if we look at the nordic experi of the earli      s   how you go in  take a look at that  and how you conduct polici around that   and have a discuss among ourselv decemb                  of     becaus i think there are some lesson there that we might learn to our benefit as we move forward from here   that   s a suggest i have  not just my report on the district   thank you
thank you   it was a good suggest   i have look at that exampl and had a chanc to talk with stefan ingv  who is the governor of the central bank of sweden and was veri much involv in that   it was a veri good and prompt respons  but it was differ from our current situat in that the bank were alreadi most insolv and no longer function when the govern interven   they took the standard step of take off nonperform loan   so the usual process   they still had a signific recess   i think the basic lesson are there  but we have some characterist in this particular episod   bank still function  the complex of the asset  and so on   that make it even more difficult
i agre with that  but at the same  e  i see the similar   when you don   t go in and tri to drive it back quick  you get the japanes outcom of prolong it   i don   t know where the bank are yet  but i know that thing are get wors and that the intermedi process is broken   so just mayb there is someth in between   someth that can be done that forc outcom for some of these bank   even though they are not insolv as such  we have pour a ton of equiti into those institut  and i am not sure if we shouldn   t have ad some other element to that that might have help on the other side   that   s my point
if you can indulg just one more observ  which is that one thing we learn from these episod is that the polit economi matter tremend   the public is veri reluct to get involv in put money into bank  and onli when they becom persuad that do so is essenti do you get that result   in japan it took a long  e   in sweden it was much quicker  and that   s an import element   a two hander from presid bullard   yes

thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in my view  cumul recessionari dynam are deepli entrench  with mount job loss lead to weaker consum spend  tighter credit  more job loss  and so on  and this nasti set of econom linkag is gain momentum  like the  book  i anticip a long period of declin  and in fact  the consensus forecast is that we   re now in the longest and one of the deepest postwar recess  i hope that a recoveri will begin in the middl of next year  but the risk seem skew to the downsid for sever reason   first  compar with the averag recess  we face unusu difficult financi condit   my contact complain bitter that even firm with  l credit rate have difficulti secur credit   some bank appear reluct to lend becaus financi market are skeptic about the qualiti of their asset and their report net worth   an account joke concern the balanc sheet of mani financi institut is now make the round  and it summar the situat as follow   on the left hand side  noth is right  and on the right hand side  noth is left    laughter   the second factor skew risk to the downsid is the unusu fear and pessimist psycholog that   s develop   one director  who head a nation depart chain  predict carnag in the retail sector after year end  as store close after tri to hold on through the holiday   although some store have been abl to keep sale up to reason level  heavi price discount will translat into huge loss   busi have also general turn veri decemb                  of     cautious  hoard cash and slash capit spend   a third factor that worri me is that  in contrast to mani past recess  this one is global in natur  and the fact that it   s a worldwid slowdown   while lower commod price  which is good   is also go to make it harder for us to pull out  turn just veri briefli to the labor market  the beveridg curv chart that stephani present dure her brief suggest that we have seen an unusu larg increas in the unemploy rate recent in comparison with the declin in job open  at least in the jolt data   i think one interpret might be that the unemploy rate has risen in part becaus we have had an unusu rise in labor forc particip dure this recess   labor forc particip has been higher than would be expect  particular for three demograph group   young adult  marri women  and older worker near retir   analysi by my staff es  that this rise in particip could reflect behavior respons to unusu credit constraint and wealth declin  specif  young adult age    to    year appear to be enter the labor forc in unusu number  and that might reflect diminish access to student loan   similar  more marri women are enter the labor forc  and that   s a possibl reflect of diminish access to home equiti and credit card loan   final  an unusu larg number of older worker are in the labor market  and that may reflect the negat wealth shock associ with the collaps of hous valu and the plummet stock market   all in all  i expect the anomal increas in labor forc particip to put continu upward pressur on the unemploy rate  with respect to inflat  develop sinc our octob meet have again lower the outlook   i   m particular concern about the disinflationari effect of actual and prospect econom slack   dure the postwar period  core pce inflat has actual fallen at least   percentag point in everi singl year in which unemploy has averag     percent or more  decemb                  of     given that in each of the next two year the unemploy rate is predict to averag at least   percent  it seem quit like that by the end of      core inflat will have fallen at least     percentag point   that creat a veri real risk of deflat   so under these circumst  i definit believ that we should do everyth in our power to s ul aggreg demand
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as gloomi as our last meet was  condit have deterior substanti further sinc then   practic all of my contact report that econom event had turn sharpli lower onc again in the last three to five week   this goe well beyond the auto sector and other part of the district that have been struggl for some  e   the most op ist comment from my director was this     at least iowa is go to hell slower than everywher els       laughter   it is tough to follow that account joke  you know   that was good   more serious  the most op ist theme i heard from a number of busi contact went someth like this     we are conserv cash and furious cut cost by year end   but we hope to paus in the first quarter and take stock of where condit appear to be head   then  we will act accord      frank  i doubt such a wait and see paus in cost cut will occur that soon  for the purpos of this meet and our action over the next few month  i agre with the main thrust of the  book project   we are face larg contract in the next two quarter  and i don   t expect to see meaning posit growth befor the fourth quarter   i think we need substanti further accommod after today   s meet   i see the  e and the size of those action for the most part be shape by the larg recessionari forc in train and the enorm financi headwind  decemb                  of     the disinflationari forc in play clear are strong  but current i do not expect that they will prove larg enough to generat outright deflat   in term of my earlier question about the  book forecast   as i understand the way it was put togeth   if the quantit eas help  monetari polici would be somewher between the fund rate at zero and the op  control   so  in fact  it would be a littl better than i first suspect   inflat would be somewhat abov that path   that might be a use benchmark to watch for if we are fortun enough for the forecast to be that stabl  but  e will tell  quantit eas should also lead to an increas in the monetari base   i don   t know if there was ani last conflict between your comment and presid     s  but i think that what we have contempl will lead to the base increas and that will generat expect about inflat beyond just taylor rule dynam  i would guess   in fact  there is certain a lot of discuss and critic out there that our balanc sheet is go to lead to larg inflationari risk   i don   t share that  given how i think we will unwind the program   but that certain would help  and it would move us in that direct   so i will keep an open mind on deflationari risk   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  as just about everyon has said   and i certain agre   the near term outlook is grim   virtual all the anecdot of ani consequ that i have receiv recent have been negat   payrol employ has been  obvious  drop signific  and if you look at the trajectori  if that kind of trajectori continu for ani length of  e beyond the next month or so  it will surpass the declin in employ that we typic have seen  certain in the last three recess  decemb                  of     my outlook for the real economi for the next five or six quarter has essenti the same profil as the current  book   i do have a somewhat better recoveri start in the second or third quarter of       but at this point i have to admit that it is more hope than convict   it is base on a diminut of mani of the factor that are current restrain the economi and produc the signific contract that is under way  as far as the inflat outlook is concern  i don   t have quit as much disinfl as the  book    but i wouldn   t say that we are all that far apart at this point   one footnot to that   i do get a lot of comment and question along the line that presid   mention      gee  with that expans in your balanc sheet  with all those reserv  aren   t we go to have a lot of inflat in the futur      mayb i ought to say    yes    to that question
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be brief   in the eighth district  there is a clear and sharp downturn  as in the nation pictur   there is a clear turn to surviv strategi  and you realli see that when key ceo and other figur start talk about lower capit expenditur for       cut the lower level in      in half or more   i think that   s veri consist with the  book   the effect on our district from ani auto restructur may be substanti  and that is someth i have ratchet up here in the last few month   a common theme among all contact   and it echo some of what has been said around the tabl here   is that rate cut at this point will have no effect on the macroeconomi   their think is  well  of cours  sinc short term treasuri are trade at zero   i think one month treasuri actual hit zero here a bit ago   they are not go to have ani effect   but as governor duke point out ye day  and i think this is an import concern  the impact on bank profit may be substanti  exact at the wrong  e   first vice presid cum pick that up  too   i think decemb                  of     that is a concern   i think it suggest favor an option of de emphas the feder fund rate as a target at this meet  as we will get to in the polici discuss   but then you might not trigger this prime rate cut that would otherwis normal accompani a major move by the fed  on the nation pictur  i expect a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter and the first quarter   expect are extrem negat now and extrem fluid   i think that is probabl the biggest factor face us go forward into        the expect are so fluid that they portend a deflationari environ if we do not control the situat veri soon   i am also veri concern about the global aspect becaus we haven   t realli seen this kind of coordin across the globe in the rapid movement to probabl zero interest rate   i don   t think we realli know what that mean go forward   we are go to be look at bad news come in at least until summer  and we have no way at this point to signal a reaction to that bad news via normal polici   that is the graviti of the situat  and in some way it is the downsid of a preemptiv polici   had i been on the committe earlier this year  i would have support the preemptiv polici to tri to avoid this situat   but one downsid of it is that you do not have the abil to continu react as bad news come in  in sum  i think we are move to a japanes style deflationari  zero nomin interest rate  situat at an alarm pace   to stay in the game and control expect  we need a volcker like transform  someth like   although the situat is differ   the       announc  which knock privat sector prior off the idea that they should trigger all reaction to announc on nomin interest rate   you need a dramat move that emphas this new realiti   continu focus on the feder fund rate at this point would not face that realiti  abov all  we have to establish in the mind of the privat sector   and mayb in our own mind as well   that we control medium term inflat   we should take the attitud that we can decemb                  of     creat the inflat we need to stay near target by one mean or anoth   i think  actual  this may be an excel  e to set the inflat target  although it sound as though we are drift away from that   but if i can argu for it for a few minut here  i think it might have an import effect on the navig through the recess dure        of cours  in normal  e  to undertak some action like that  we would want a lot of studi  and we would want to have  e to talk it through with the congress and other interest parti  as we would for interest on reserv   but we don   t have that luxuri right now   we want to take the action now to help control the situat  and i think we could sell that as a work in progress  which can be modifi later   but we do want to keep these expect under control in this veri fluid situat   thank you
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  thank you   presid   talk about micro behavior  and at the begin  first vice presid cum talk about the hunker down mental   i have been focus on the microeconom behavior respons to our current situat   as one of my ceo contact outsid my region said  we are basic all  in his word     chase the anvil down the stair     and that is that the behavior respons of both busi and consum are drive us into a slow growth cul de sac and a deflationari trap  one ceo i talk with was quit pleas that he could borrow     million over the weekend for a total of        that is great from a commerci paper standpoint  he is an a  p  issuer   howev  were he to go to the longer term debt market  it would cost him     percent  so they can financ their daili oper easili   but in term of their long term plan  they and other are respond   and i see this uniform across my contact   out of concern about the high cost of debt and the spread over treasuri  by do what ani businesswoman or decemb                  of     businessman would do   they are plan on less cap ex  and they are cut back on their plan for acquisit of the weak  which they would like to take advantag of under the current circumst   they are also respond to the situat by cut back on head count   so  chris  there is veri much a hunker down mental  not just in my district but across the countri   that lead to further econom weak   that plus the fact that they are chari about issu and pay for thing with share in a veri weak market   i am hear more and more worri about their pension liabil and how they are go to be abl to financ those  obvious this is lead to the kind of econom behavior that none of us would like to see  on the consum side  you see a similar behavior pattern   it seem that after black friday  accord to my sourc  there was weaker behavior than one had expect   the spend puls data that i get from one of the larg credit card compani reflect what one would expect under these circumst   that is  a shift to nonbrand product  smaller purchas of item  a rotat out of credit card to debit card and cash payment accord to the pay cycl  and overal an expect  on both the busi and the consum side  that thing will get cheaper if they wait longer and they postpon either their cap ex or their consum purchas  the one ray of sunshin that i was abl to find is that one larg law firm  cravath  has announc that it is not increas it bill rate in        laughter  and other law firm are actual plan to respond by cut their bill rate   one woman whom i know summar it this way      this is the divorc from hell   my net worth has been cut in half  but i am still stuck with my husband       laughter
thank you   governor kohn
i am not go to even tri to top either of those anecdot or joke   i agre certain with the thrust of the comment around the room   the economi is in a steep declin  decemb                  of     there was a break in confid somewher in septemb that took what had been a gradual declin in employ  product  and output and made it much  much  much  much steeper  the feedback loop between the financi market and the real economi just intensifi   turn up mani  mani notch at that  e   household and busi  as presid   was remark  are veri worri  and they are act in a way to protect themselv   they have cut back on spend  and they have cut back on lend  i think the respons of busi is particular interest   they respond veri  veri rapid to the falloff in demand with cut in employ and product   so we are not even get the sort of automat stabil effect that we usual get from a buildup in inventori and a bit of labor hoard as demand drop   thus busi    action are just accentu the weak   as mani have remark  the weak is global  everywher  includ in emerg market economi where  as shaghil show us  the inflow of capit has slow substanti  there is no real region to lead the globe out of this swamp we are in  financi market remain veri strain   i think of particular concern are the securit market   when they are not oper  a lot of credit to household and busi won   t be avail at the same  e that the bank are tighten up veri sharpli   we have seen in these chart that household and busi borrow with anyth less than veri high credit score are just find credit either extraordinarili expens or unavail   as a consequ  a veri sizabl output gap has open up   i think we can see that the declin is go to remain steep for some  e   the multipli   acceler effect of the drop in demand we have seen over the last coupl of month have to feed back through consumpt and invest   i don   t think we have seen the full effect of the tighten in credit condit and the declin in wealth from the end of septemb on  decemb                  of     you can see the continu econom declin in the initi claim data  the week ip  and the anecdot we heard around the tabl on sale  and financi market are go to remain impair for a while despit our best effort to open them up   there are huge loss in the capit of intermediari to absorb  so folk will be veri cautious about make loan   as long as investor  saver  household  and busi see the economi in steep declin  the fear that is grip the financi market and the economi isn   t go to abat veri rapid  inflat is deceler across a broad front  and that is go to continu   econom slack will be increas  cost pressur will be abat  and the abil to pass through cost increas will be high constrain   so far  longer term inflat expect seem to have been reason well anchor  though they are veri hard to measur   but i agre with presid bullard that we are go to need to watch this veri  veri close for sign of a disinflationari dynam take hold   i think what happen to the economi and inflat over the latter part of next year is extrem uncertain   we have huge chang in forecast in veri short period of  e  and i suspect  like the staff  that the improv in financi market and the rebound in the economi will be gradual  in part reflect the limit power of monetari polici   but even if we thought that a sharper rebound next year was a distinct possibl  i don   t think it would matter veri much for our polici purpos here today   the trajectori  the econom declin  the extent of the output gap  and the degre of disinfl in train all impli that our task at this  e is to tri to limit econom weak   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   sever quick point   first  the latest leg of deterior  which began in mid septemb  is show few sign of abat  as governor kohn suggest   i think the novemb retail sale data look like a head fake   revis to decemb                  of     septemb and octob  as the  book suggest  make us think that novemb was probabl wors and decemb wors still   so in some way i think our job is difficult becaus the weak seem to be acceler  global  the deterior is found everywher   the data are play catch up   i am less op ist that foreign activ will perform as well as the  book suggest and that foreign activ will respond in      becaus of lag in polici respons and less flexibl in their labor market  their product market  and their polit market   the depth and the degre of the fall in data and policymak    expect oversea  particular in asia  are remark  shock even  and i think we are like to see polici respons there that are hard to judg but are like to be chang pretti quick  in term of u s  household  real household net worth has collaps about    percent or so through the end of the third quarter   more than in      and more than in        ongo declin in financi market and hous price are like to depress wealth further in the fourth quarter and beyond   so call save from lower energi price look as though they pale in comparison to what els is happen to u s  household balanc sheet   as we have discuss befor  everi asset everywher in the world is be revalu  and household are feel it  in term of financi market  i will underscor what dan suggest and what bill suggest ye day   the signific overal deterior in condit   we all have a tendenc at this point in the year to say     well  there are a lot of year end effect  and we are not go to realli know until we get through this period      we have had babi version of year end effect in the quarter end effect in almost everi meet that we have had  and i have been a littl dismiss of those   i would say that there   appear to be more year end stuff go on in these market than there has been sinc this period of weak began  decemb                  of     if you think about the two former invest bank that have balanc sheet and year end that close at the end of novemb  this is the last quarter in which they will have that   they have had more demand and more interest in  in effect  rent out their balanc sheet as their custom    balanc sheet end in decemb than they ever have had   the price that are be paid for them to rent their balanc sheet   to take exposur off the balanc sheet of their client   suggest that mayb  just mayb  the year end effect are more signific this  e than they were in the previous six or seven quarter   it  sn   t give me a ton of op   but in januari  market function could look a littl better  and i think that would be the best news we have seen for a while   you have heard me say befor that  until we see market function improv and until we see these market clear  it is unrealist to expect the real economi to turn   i still think that is true  turn to two final item  inflat and the fiscal packag   on the inflat front  although there are risk in this environ for price to fall below those consist with price stabil  i still believ that these risk are not like to materi in the medium term   so i take stock of  but ul  discount  the  book   s deflat altern simul   on the fiscal front  more  bigger  fa  is what is go to happen inevit to what i would describ as the first fiscal packag of        the trillion dollar number over two year  which is now be bandi about  is larger than the  book forecast and look almost assur  with a greater share go to the state in my view than in the  book forecast  more toward public infrastructur  perhap less toward tax cut on a relat basi than in the  book  but bigger  i would be surpris if that initi packag isn   t supplement through larger annual appropri and anoth s ulus packag  if not by the end of      then by        as a result  my own sens would be that the      deficit is like to be signific larger than the decemb                  of      book forecast   now  know the precis contour of this fiscal packag is tough   i would say the onli good news is that the durat of the slowdown is like to suggest that the fiscal packag may end up be somewhat more perman in it incent and somewhat more perman in it effect  and i suspect  becaus of that  it is like to provid some good news to the economi   but i wouldn   t expect that to happen in the next twelv or eighteen month  other than perhap a bit of benefit on the arithmet   in term of chang the overal contour  pace  and strength of the resili economi  i would say that is still quit a way off   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank   presid     s forecast about what member would say about the forecast i think has turn out to be right  and i certain don   t want to disappoint   laughter   so i agre with what other have said  and i think most everyth has been said about the intensif of the recessionari flame around the world   what i will do is just quick look at it from the perspect of part of the bank    balanc sheet and the thing that may not be left on those balanc sheet  to just underscor how i think this is go to be protract for the financi servic sector for a while  on the consum side  as mani peopl have mention  the veri sharp step down in employ  the veri larg job loss  the increas in the unemploy rate  and the decreas in wealth have been lead to veri signific increas in consum delinqu and veri high roll rate   that is  peopl who becom delinqu roll direct into charg off   this is happen not onli on the credit card side and on a lot of differ part of the consum side but also in mortgag  for which we are see exact the same kind of thing   although the most recent number that came out from the mortgag banker associ suggest some decemb                  of     stabil in foreclosur start  that actual had more to do with the law in various state slow down that process rather than ani real chang in the under econom   of cours  we still have a lot of option arm type of reset that will be come through in        so a lot of pressur is there  and as was mention  hous price are still go down  we haven   t yet seen as much of an actual downturn in commerci real estat  but undoubt that will occur as fewer peopl are shop in shop mall and as a lot of other commerci real estat project don   t have the payoff that peopl expect   also  an enorm amount of refinanc is go to be necessari dure the next few month  and have to pay an addit     or     basi point realli chang the econom of a lot of these project  if they can even get the refinanc at an addit     to     basi point   for leverag loan  anoth piec of the balanc sheet  as peopl have said  there is veri littl activ go on in takeov   the onli posit there is that the failur of certain deal has taken some of the pressur off certain bank    balanc sheet  on the commerci and industri side  as we have note  the invest grade market for debt issuanc seem to have maintain itself  but that is realli one of the few market that is there   if ani challeng come in there  it could be veri  veri difficult for firm to financ invest   we certain have seen the spread go up recent  even if the volum has come back a bit   but as we have seen in the non invest grade part  the spread have blown out  and the financ is not there   that tend to be a littl more of what mani bank have on their balanc sheet  and so i think that is repres of the challeng that the bank are go to have   that suggest that we have a lot of challeng in bank and financi institut    balanc sheet to come that have noth to do with ani particular level of asset or account decemb                  of     issu but just real econom factor that are go to be affect the balanc sheet   so the credit headwind are go to be veri  veri strong for a number of quarter go forward  the point that presid   made are extrem import one   we have to think about  as we move to the zero lower bound  how that is go to affect behavior of financi institut   certain  the staff memo were good on address some issu  but i think that other thing that have been mention  like impos minimum or floor on interest rate on loan  we have not care analyz or realli understand well   there may be a varieti of other respons that we don   t understand well that we realli do need to get a better handl on  both to see how the effect of tradit monetari polici chang   the transmiss mechan   and to think about the nontradit aspect of monetari polici that we would be undertak by use our balanc sheet   so where can we use it most effect   if the financi institut are chang their behavior  we need to be cogniz of that and think about where we need to tri to unfreez market if we are go to be use our balanc sheet in that way  and i think it is veri import that we do so  i will underscor also what other peopl have said about the great import of clear articul what we are do   it is not that we have given up and that the fed is impot but that  through chang in our balanc sheet  we can be quit potent in particular market and in general   that then bring us to whether we can be too potent and rais inflat concern  exact as presid  n said  we should be so lucki to have that as our problem   we do need to make sure that we maintain credibl and show that we feel that we can and do act to offset concern about deflat   it is veri difficult to tell what the price level evolut is like to be over the next year  but i do think that there is a real concern about that  and we have to take that veri  veri serious go forward   i think we would  obvious  be abl to get out of these decemb                  of     differ program  and we need to think about get out of them at some point   but right now the key is get into the program  use the nontradit approach  to make sure that we offset a deflationari psycholog that could develop   thank you
thank you   governor duke
thank you  mr  chairman   ye day i talk about the incom statement of the bank   i would like to talk a bit about the balanc sheet now   up to this point  for the small and medium size communiti bank  it has been pretti much busi as usual   but now even those bank are find it increas difficult to lend   communiti bank and region bank are tri  but it is tough   fund is tight and expens   it cost     percent to keep a cd and   percent and up to attract one   the smaller bank are especi bitter about price against citi and those nonbank that have recent convert to bank hold compani and thrift hold compani charter  for a bank to qualifi for tarp fund  the examin are rais the bar on noncor fund   one bank report a meet with both the occ and the fed in which the occ critic  and the fed defend  the bank   s use of the discount window   examin are rais the bar on capit      is the new    on risk base capit   borrow are not in near as good shape as they were   the best credit are choos not to borrow  and they are adjust their plan so that they get through on their own cash flow   so the request come into the bank are more and more like to be desper request   loan to cover oper loss or to meet payrol   crack are appear in c i loan   some bank are exit loan to entir industri  especi auto dealer  marin and construct trade  and retail   the perform of commerci real estat  especi retail properti  is deterior   hospit is fall off rapid  and offic build are expect to be next   apart are still okay  and all of this is decemb                  of     in addit to problem with construct loan   lower mortgag rate are help refin  but it is not the best  e of the year to judg what it is go to happen with purchas activ  there are still issu with jumbo  with down payment  and with requir for veri high credit score  as we have talk here  it occur to me that perhap the tradit tool of monetari polici are all direct at bank credit  and the strongest nontradit tool that we have are address more to the securit market   the talf and the purchas of gses   in this instanc  most of the problem are not realli caus by a cutback in bank lend but a complet collaps of the securit market  and so that is whi these tool may be more necessari  i ask question also about the tarp capit and got differ reaction   sever banker said that they didn   t need it  they were scare off by the abil of the congress to chang the term at ani  e  and they had elect not to take it   some took it becaus they thought they could leverag it into good busi   some took it as cheap insur   some took it to be in a posit to acquir in what they see as the necessari weed out of weaker player  and they think that should happen sooner rather than later   sever complain about delay in provid term for smaller bank   everi singl bank was adam about the evil of mark to market account and other than temporari impair   there is a big divers between market loss and credit loss  so that lead to banker who are afraid to buy secur becaus they are worri about further mark as the market go down   but they are also unwil to sell secur becaus they don   t believ that the current market price adequ reflect the potenti credit loss   there is some specul that the mark to market loss will absorb all of the tarp capit that was just inject  and i think that is someth we might want to decemb                  of     calcul as fourth quarter report come out   then  the next big writedown is on servic portfolio as lower rate spur refinanc activ   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   and thank  everyon  for a veri concis but also veri inform roundtabl   whi don   t we take a coffe break until         thank you   coffe break
whi don   t we reconven  have a brief summari of our go round  and then i will make just a few addit comment   the particip note that the econom downturn has intensifi sharpli recent with signific downsid risk to the outlook   recessionari dynam have set in  with interplay among real and financi variabl  the economi is like to contract through earli next year  with consider uncertainti about subsequ develop   consumpt  employ  and product indic have weaken further   financi condit remain veri strain  with improv in some area  but mani the same or wors   the global economi has also slow mark  look more specif at differ sector  credit condit continu to tighten  with credit line not be renew and bank  includ smaller bank  hunker down  securit market are still larg dysfunct   the overal deleverag process continu to be a power drag on activ   delinqu are increas  impli greater credit loss for bank and other lender  with small busi be among the borrow face tighter condit   bank continu to face intens balanc sheet pressur and are reluct to lend or make market  and feedback effect from worsen credit qualiti to the balanc sheet of financi institut are evid  regard the consum  spend continu to contract  as household face ongo pressur with respect to wealth  incom  credit avail  and job secur   psycholog is veri decemb                  of     negat  and luxuri and discretionari expenditur are be cut back   labor market develop have been negat as well  with acceler job loss and particip final declin after remain high for a period of  e   the latest hous number suggest a continu contract in that sector   the fall in mortgag rate has spark some refinanc and purchas mortgag applic  but the longer term impact on hous demand is not yet evid   nonresidenti construct is project to fall signific  reflect poor fundament and tight credit   feder fiscal polici will like provid aid to state  includ fund for infrastructur  but the size and the  e of the econom impact of that polici remain uncertain  manufactur product continu to slow  along with new order  capit spend  and busi expect  mine and drill activ have been react to the declin in commod price  as has agricultur activ to some extent   export demand has weaken with the sharp slow in the global economi of recent month and the strengthen of the dollar sinc the summer   the sharp global slowdown  includ emerg market  will make recoveri more difficult   manufactur survey show that firm expect consider near term weak and declin price power  final  inflat look set to declin signific  reflect fall commod price  rise slack  limit price power  and fall inflat expect   particip cite the risk that inflat could fall below desir level   that is just a veri quick summari   ani comment  let me make just a few addit comment  but i won   t add  i think  a great deal of insight to our discuss   i will just note for the record here that the nber has final recogn that a recess began in decemb        i said in the christma tree light decemb                  of     ceremoni that they also recogn that christma was on decemb    last year    laughter  the committe was a littl more forward think   we began cut rate  of cours  in septemb      and did     basi point of cut in januari       despit our effort  this recess  in term of durat and depth  is like to be equal to or greater than the two largest previous postwar recess  those in         and          there are a number of reason that may be the case  and some of them were alreadi discuss by the staff   the financi condit are the most obvious differ between this recess and the earlier one   a number of previous recess have had financi headwind of one type or anoth   for exampl  the current financi crisi and hous correct bear some famili relationship to the stock market declin and the capit overhang in the      recess   but overal  the financi aspect of this episod are  i think  much more serious than in previous case   to cite two aspect   one  as governor   note  there has been a big impact on household wealth   the flow of fund account show a declin in nomin wealth of about    percent in the last year or  as he said  a declin in real wealth of about    percent   this is go to lead to an increas in save  which would be desir in the longer term but in the short term is go to creat disloc   two  this financi crisi has affect the intermedi of credit far more sever than ani other episod sinc the     s   we have alreadi seen a big impact on intermediari capit and bank activ   the deleverag process is continu   it is veri intens   again  reduc risk take  deleverag  all of those thing are not necessarili bad  but the adjust process is a veri difficult one  a second reason that this recess could well be more sever than the previous one has to do with the cyclic posit of monetari polici  a fact also note by the staff   the         and         recess were basic generat by a tighten of monetari polici  and when decemb                  of     the feder reserv decid to let up  essenti condit began to rebound   obvious  in this case  other factor have driven the downturn   monetari polici was proactiv in tri to promot recoveri   but given where we are today  at the zero lower bound  we are unabl to eas polici in the way that we saw in those previous episod   this suggest  as other have note  the need for addit polici action  either on our part or by the fiscal author  to get the economi move again  final  a third reason that i think this episod is particular sever is the global natur of the downturn  which a number of peopl have also note   it has alway been said that  if the unit state sneez  the rest of the world catch cold   so there has alway been a certain amount of coher or synchron between u s  downturn and those around the world   but the extent of the global downturn this  e is realli quit except   it is strike that global growth over the past few year has been between   and   percent  and now the  book is look at a     percent declin for global activ in the fourth quarter and a declin of about     percent in the first quarter   that is quit a big differ between what we might think of as potenti and actual growth  so  as i said  there are a number of reason to think that this is go to be a veri sever episod and that we are far from be at the turn point   i won   t go through the sector   we have all discuss consumpt  employ  hous  commerci real estat  and financi market   these are all aspect of the downturn that continu to be except and veri worrisom as we look forward  i will make just a coupl of comment about inflat or disinfl   the forecast is for signific disinfl   perhap not deflat  although deflat is easili within the standard error of the forecast   a number of factor may affect this forecast or creat risk on both side  decemb                  of     stephani talk about structur unemploy perhap be a factor that might make the effect of slack less than otherwis   on the other hand  there may be some evid that the phillip curv is steeper when unemploy is high   that is  recess tend to have a greater impact on inflat than do small chang in growth   that onli goe to say that there is a lot of uncertainti about exact how far the inflat rate will fall   although we might reach a technic deflat  i guess it is worth point out here that there is noth special about zero  that is  from this point on  ani further disinfl will have the effect of make a given nomin interest rate a higher real interest rate   it is make monetari polici de facto tighter and perhap have debt deflat effect as the real valu of debt and debt payment becom greater as inflat fall   becaus we are alreadi at the zero lower bound  obvious that constraint is alreadi in play   so i think we shouldn   t focus too much or focus the public too much on the deflat line  on that zero number   it is not all that consequenti   rather  the disinfl process   and a veri low rate of inflat   is a sourc of concern  just to summar  i don   t think my outlook differ veri signific from what i have heard around the tabl   i think the issu are what we do about it  and in that spirit  we should turn now to the polici round   so let me turn to   to introduc the monetari polici altern
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      this packag includ the octob polici statement  draft polici statement for this meet  and associ draft direct to the desk   altern a and b have been revis somewhat relat to the version that were distribut in the bluebook  part reflect ye day   s discuss   in addit  as shown in bold in paragraph   of altern a  it seem appropri in current circumst to incorpor a sentenc on financi condit  as the committe has done in it recent statement  the same sentenc has also been includ in altern b   we have present a total of four polici altern for your consider   given the unusu circumst     the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     decemb                  of     the statement associ with all four altern depart to some degre from the statement that have typic been issu by the committe in recent year   altern a repres the sharpest departur   rather than start with the polici action  the statement would begin by describ the econom situat  note that the econom outlook has weaken further   it goe on to say that inflat pressur have diminish quick and that inflat could declin for a  e below the rate that best fo  econom growth and price stabil   reflect what seem to be a consensus ye day  the sentenc in bracket articul a medium term inflat object has been drop   we have also bracket the claus indic that inflat could drop for a  e to veri low level  part becaus some committe member might not yet be convinc that such an outcom is a serious risk at this  e and to avoid rais such concern prematur   the third paragraph would indic that the committe judg that it is not use to set a specif target for the fund rate   it would explain that judgment by note that  as a result of the larg volum of reserv provid through liquid program  the feder fund rate has alreadi declin to veri low level   it would also note that econom condit are like to warrant except low level of the feder fund rate for some  e  avoid the use of the    near zero    phrase   the claus    weak econom condit are like to warrant    impli some condit  but the condit under which rate would be rais are not spell out   the fourth paragraph would set out a general plan for implement unconvent polici to support the function of financi market and s ul the economi   it reiter that the feder reserv will be buy agenc debt and mortgag back secur and indic that those purchas could be ramp up if condit warrant   it indic further that the fomc is evalu the potenti benefit of buy longer term treasuri   it also indic that the feder reserv will be consid other way of use it balanc sheet to support credit market and econom activ   we suggest drop the word    activ    to avoid a suggest that a new facil will be announc immin   over recent month  the discount rate has move in lockstep with the target feder fund rate  at a level   percentag point abov that rate  and veri recent the rate on requir and excess reserv have been set essenti by formula equal to the target feder fund rate   becaus a target feder fund rate would not be establish under this altern  those formula could not be use   we have suggest that  under this altern  the board act to lower the discount rate    basi point  to    percent  and that the interest rate on requir and excess reserv balanc be reduc to   percent   the posit interest rate on reserv would maintain some upward pressur  albeit perhap modest  on the feder fund rate  consist with a view that there are some cost in term of financi market perform of drive the fund rate liter to zero   the discount rate of    percent would maintain a fair small penalti for borrow at the window   decemb                  of     in certain substant respect  altern b  the next page  is similar to altern a   most import  feder fund would trade at about the same veri low rate as in altern a  part becaus the discount and reserv interest rate  discuss in paragraph    would be set at the same level as in altern a   also  the word of the rational section of the statement   paragraph   and     is essenti ident to the correspond paragraph for altern a   howev  altern b differ from altern a by explicit set a target rang for the feder fund rate of   to   percent  as shown in paragraph     we have restructur the introduct to the discuss of unconvent polici measur in paragraph   so that it is general similar to the correspond paragraph in alter a   also  the final sentenc of altern a  paragraph    has been substitut as the last sentenc of altern b  paragraph     both altern a and b would put the committe clear in the realm of unconvent policymak go forward   the various polici interest rate would be reduc to veri low level  sever unconvent polici tool will alreadi have been implement  and the statement would indic clear that further unconvent tool could be deploy   the committe might choos either of these altern if member had an outlook similar to that of the  book or if they were especi concern about the downsid risk   both altern would constitut somewhat more vigor polici action than market particip anticip for this meet  and accord it is possibl that financi market would respond favor   on the other hand  there is some risk that confid could be undermin if the main messag that come through is that the feder reserv is out of ammunit   as was note ye day  such altern place a premium on fed communic that convinc indic that the feder reserv can still provid monetari s ulus   under altern c  on the next page  the committe would reduc the feder fund target rate    basi point today   the committe might choos this option if it agre that further monetari s ulus is warrant by the evolv econom outlook but was unsur that it would be necessari  or desir  to reduc the target feder fund rate to around zero   the rational for the action present in paragraph   and   would be fair similar to those of altern a and b   paragraph   note the downsid risk to the outlook and indic that the committe will use all avail tool to promot it dual object  suggest that the committe will consid further reduct in the target feder fund rate and that further liquid measur could be forthcom   you could fine tune the messag regard the feder fund rate by explicit indic that you are will to or not will to cut the fund rate further   under this altern  we have assum that the discount rate would be lower in line with the target feder fund rate to    basi point  the draft includ in the bluebook erron indic that the rate would be lower to    basi point   becaus the fomc would set a target rate under this altern  we have assum that the reserv interest rate would continu to be set via the exist formula  so that those rate would move down to    percent absent further chang to the target fund rate   as bill note ye day  although these interest rate on decemb                  of     reserv would provid some upward pressur on the fund rate  that pressur is like to be more than offset by the larg suppli of reserv  and paragraph   note that feder fund are like to trade below    percent   although this approach provid a straightforward expect for the fund rate  it has an unapp aspect in that the committe would be chang it target while simultan admit that the target will not be hit  implicit rais the question of the mean of the target  nonetheless  this statement is like consist overal with market expect  and a pronounc market reaction one way or the other seem unlik   under altern d  the committe would keep the target feder fund rate at   percent   the rational portion of the statement would acknowledg that the near term outlook has deterior and that signific downsid risk are present  howev  the statement would note that the broad rang of polici action taken in recent month should help  over  e  to improv credit condit and support a return to moder growth   the statement would recogn that the feder fund rate would like averag signific below the target for some  e  but it would not impli that a further reduct of the target rate is be contempl   it thus suggest that the committe would seek to return the actual feder fund rate to   percent over  e   overal  this statement would surpris market particip consider  both in term of the decis regard the target fund rate and in suggest that further monetari polici s ulus  through convent or unconvent polici  is unlik   the final two page of the packag provid draft direct to the desk that incorpor some chang relat to the version that were includ in the bluebook  the direct for altern a would provid some quantit guidanc for the desk   s open market oper while reserv some role for an assess of evolv market condit  specif the languag that    the committe direct the desk to purchas gse debt and agenc guarante mbs  with the aim of provid support to the mortgag and hous market   the  e and pace of these purchas should depend on condit in the market for such secur and on a broader assess of condit in primari mortgag market and the hous sector   by the end of the second quarter of next year  the desk is expect to purchas up to      billion in hous relat gse debt and up to      billion in agenc guarante mbs      the direct would not specifi a target rang for the feder fund rate  while that for altern b would   the direct for altern a would state explicit that the committe has suspend set a target for the feder fund rate and that it expect feder fund to trade at except low level  the direct for b establish the fed fund rang of   to   percent   in line with one of the point rais ye day  that the size and the composit of our entir balanc sheet affect the feder reserv   s monetari polici stanc  the final sentenc of the revis direct for altern a and b state an expect that the soma manag and the committe   s secretari will keep the committe inform of ongo develop regard the system   s balanc sheet that could affect the attain over  e of the committe   s object of maximum employ and price stabil  decemb                  of      the direct for altern c  on the next page  is general similar to that for altern b   but it would acknowledg that feder fund are like to trade below the    percent target rate set under this altern   the direct for altern d would includ a similar recognit but with a target feder fund rate of   percent  in addit  this altern would not provid specif guidanc on open market purchas   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   question for     presid
thank you  mr  chairman      the first sentenc in altern b say     the feder open market committe decid today to establish a target rang for the feder fund rate of   to   percent      in the staff analysi of various option for implement interest on excess reserv  i think option   was the one that is closest to the realiti of what we are implement now   just a straight interest rate on excess reserv and an overprovis of reserv to drive it down to the floor   in that analysi  the staff anticip that it would be a floor  which it turn out not to be   but it anticip that  with that floor in place  the effect fund rate would general be abov the floor  and it envis choos a rate on excess reserv   point below our target rate   so do you envis in this that we would have to take ani measur if sudden the downward forc on the effect rate would bring the fund rate abov     or is this just under the supposit that it would take a while and that it is unlik to get abov     you see  back in the earli analysi there were forc that you believ would lead it abov    so i am wonder how you are think about it
presid    the forc that we were think would bring it abov   were larg a risk premium   the differ between feder fund  which have some amount of credit risk  and deposit at the feder reserv  which of cours do not   i think we would not anticip that we would need to do anyth veri differ from what we have been do   just continu to provid a veri larg amount of reserv  which is a byproduct of our decemb                  of     liquid provis   with the interest rate on balanc set at   percent  that configur of balanc and rate would result in a feder fund rate somewher in the rang of   to
okay   well  the reason i ask is that i am a littl hesit to set an upper bound on a rang without understand what sort of mechan we would have for make that credibl   that is whi i ask about that   two more question   one  the word    zero      can you help me understand the think about whi we should be a littl avers to use that word
well  one reason might be that  if you gave some weight to the view that veri low interest rate do have cost in financi market and you want to preserv some rhetor or substant leeway  you would want to have a somewhat posit interest rate  to the degre that you could achiev one  but still a low level
okay   one final question   we  in the late     s  adopt a set of guidelin regard agenc debt and modifi that in the late     s   i don   t have a copi with me   i think the latest adopt of that was januari       and i believ it is perman   i think it is still in effect   i think it state that our purchas are not intend to channel fund to ani specif sector   i am wonder about the staff   s interpret of the consist between our gse debt and agenc guarante mbs purchas  and that guidanc
i do have that guidelin here  and you are correct  presid    the first paragraph of the guidelin say that system open market oper in agenc issu are an integr part of open market oper  design to influenc bank reserv  money market condit  and monetari aggreg   the second paragraph say that open market oper in those issu are not design to support individu sector of the market or to channel fund into issu of particular agenc   as you rememb  in my brief ye day i did rais the question as to committe member    view of the alloc of fund to particular firm or decemb                  of     sector   it is possibl that the committe may want to modifi  suspend  or repeal this guidelin at some point
they do seem inconsist  though  and i think it is someth  mr  chairman  that we ought to consid
note   i think i am somewhat at fault here   i did consult with everyon on the committe and discuss what we were go to do   i would say that  go forward  we should probabl bring all such plan to the committe
thank   it would be good to have that public   it is a public document  is it not   or it is not a public document yet   it is on the committe record  right
i believ it is public
okay   it would be nice to have that in conform with what we are actual do   thank you  mr  chairman   i appreci that
may i ask two question  pleas   with regard to altern a  i am curious     as to how you think the banker would respond to that in term of their price behavior and loan and prime   second  our friend from the new york desk  how do you think the market might respond to altern a   not overnight  by the way  which i couldn   t care less about  but over the longer term
on the former  just a guess  i would think that without ani target feder fund rate   and given the well known issu that we have been discuss about pressur on bank   it is possibl that the prime rate would not be reduc by the full extent of the implicit reduct in the money market condit that the fomc would be target   but i don   t realli have a good sens as to what would happen quantit
i think the market will be slight confus  but i think they will figur it out quit quick   they will scan the document and figur out  well  what   this realli mean   they will be surpris by the magnitud of the interest rate reduct   as i said ye day  most of the dealer are clu  around a    basi point reduct in the target
even though we are not state a specif target  it would be implicit in the chang in the level of the discount rate
we are say here that we are at except low level of the fund rate for some  e   i think they will understand that this is it and that the fund rate is go to be veri  veri low   obvious  the next day you will probabl observ a feder fund rate that is no more than a coupl of basi point  would be my guess
just a follow up on that   i am a littl confus that we don   t set a target but we are oper under an interest on reserv scheme by which we pay a deposit rate  which in fact we just lower   is there some kind of disconnect between what is in altern a  paragraph     lower the discount rate and the interest rate on reserv   and not note a chang in the target rate when  in fact  we have alreadi establish that the deposit rate is go to be the target rate   so i am confus   mayb the market will see through this  but i don   t know   i am not quit sure i understand what is go on and how this would work  in term of communic or interpret
i think the market would look at this as say it is a substanti rate cut   the fund rate has been trade soft to the interest rate on excess reserv by a consider margin   the interest rate on excess reserv was cut consider  so they will figur out that  decemb                  of     therefor  the fund rate is go to trade at an except low level   but you are right   it will not be quit as straightforward as put it out there right up front
i guess my troubl is that the committe judg that it is not use to set a specif target for the fund rate and yet this will be interpret as that we reduc the target in effect
we can discuss this in the go round   presid
may i just ask bill   if he could describ how he anticip his oper would differ between altern a and altern b   how would you do thing differ
i think we wouldn   t do thing differ to ani meaning degre
other question   i think it might be help to flag just a few thing about which i would particular appreci the committe   s advic   the first is the issu that presid   was discuss  which is altern a   not specifi a rang or a target   or altern b   specifi a rang   i think that the argument for specifi a rang is that it seem a littl clearer   if you look at  for exampl  the japanes experi  even when they were in quantit eas  they still had a target for the call rate  as i understand it   there are some counter argument  which governor duke and other have rais  about the impact on bank and so on   that is question number     question number     and this  sn   t preclud other point  of cours   is that in paragraph   of altern b  for exampl  we have bracket just for your refer the risk of inflat   s declin below op  level   i would be interest to know your view on whether or not to includ that bracket phrase  third   again look at altern b   in paragraph   we have the condit statement that    weak econom condit are like to warrant except low level of the feder decemb                  of     fund rate      a littl inform poll suggest that peopl were sort of okay with this way of state the condit   but if there are ani concern about that or  altern  if you would like to includ a refer to disinfl as one of the condit  that is just someth i want to flag as a question  a fourth and final point i want to flag   and presid   point this out to me   in paragraph   we have a sentenc say that    the committe is also evalu the potenti benefit of purchas longer term treasuri secur      i think to put that in there we should feel that some  in the next few meet there is a signific chanc that we would in fact engag in some kind of a program   we don   t want to put it in there if it is a complet red herring  so those are four point that i have  but of cours  you may have other question or issu that you want to rais   governor duke
mr  chairman  just one respons to presid     s and presid     s observ  which i think are relat   if you set the rate that we are go to pay for interest on reserv the same as the target rate for fed fund and the market   repair itself and resum  then you would expect there to be some risk spread over the rate that we are pay on interest on reserv   so if we don   t set a target or we set the target someth higher than the rate that we are pay  at least if the market do start to resum  then the desk isn   t in a posit of then have to tri to drive the rate back down again
thank you   all right   let   s begin the go round   we   ll begin with presid
the bleak outlook call for aggress action   with the effect feder fund rate alreadi well below our target  there is a logic to move to the floor at this decemb                  of     meet and redirect attent to nontradit polici   thus  i am comfort with altern b and would reduc the interest rate on requir and excess reserv to    basi point  in term of the question that the chairman just pose  i am comfort specifi the rang of   to   percent   i would actual keep the bracket inform   i am okay with the condit   i would remov the refer to the treasuri secur  and for the futur i would certain want to think about expand the purchas of gse and agenc mortgag back secur beyond      billion   also i would support  at a futur date  set a target of   percent for the core pce inflat rate
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern a  so let me just talk for a few minut about what i like about it   i like the languag    not use to set a specif target for the feder fund rate    in altern a becaus i think this will begin the process of get the privat sector to think in altern term about monetari polici   that would be similar to the move made dure the         period   let me just stress that i think the whole process is go to be veri difficult   we have an entir generat of privat sector financi market particip who are condit to think onli in term of a feder fund rate target as the whole definit of what monetari polici is   i might remind the committe   if it need remind  and it probabl  sn   t   that it is a big countri out there   when you start talk to other outsid the particular particip in financi market  the level of understand of monetari polici is veri limit   the subtleti get lost  and so it is go to take a lot of  e and effort to convinc everyon and to explain to everyon that we are switch to new polici  i expect  in fact  that it will probabl be a three year period that will be mark by controversi decemb                  of     over headlin that are of the form     what is the fed do       much like the         period  when there was continu controversi and continu effort to explain  i also like the paragraph that place emphasi on altern polici   i would keep the bracket inform   i thought the condit was okay   i will say about the altern polici  those polici have unknown impact  and so we don   t want to be too detail here becaus they may have to evolv in the futur   i would take out the part about the longer term treasuri secur  i would put in the inflat target   i said befor that i think it is an import point to be abl to reassur and anchor expect in this veri fluid situat  which may rapid unravel on us   this is a good opportun to do this  and i would go ahead with that   i don   t think it is that differ from our longer term project  but it is much more direct and communic much more clear to market that we have a medium term inflat target  on the question of what should be in the direct  i will say this   i see it as somewhat danger for this committe and for the nation to say noth about the level of reserv or the monetari base   it is true that it may not be inflationari now or in normal  e  and it may not have been inflationari in japan   but there are mani exampl around the world where money suppli got out of control and inflat was a veri serious problem   it could be explos in some part of the world  especi if there were a larg loss of confid in the u s  govern or in the perform of this committe   so i think we want to reassur the world that we are care monitor that situat  that we have our eye on it   as sever peopl have comment around here  a common refrain among busi leader we talk to is     what the hell is go on   you know  your balanc sheet is way up   isn   t that go to be inflationari     and we are say    no     but i think we need to give continu reassur that we are decemb                  of     monitor that situat  we have it under control  and we are think about it   i also think  as presid  n said ye day  that it would help signal our intent to keep inflat near target  other than simpli promis to do so  which is just pure relianc on our credibl   you have someth quantit that you can point to   obvious  it has to be done in a sensibl way that allow us to bring in other program and expand the balanc sheet in other way   i think it is just a matter of make a statement that we are keep our eye on the whole situat  as far as the other altern  let me disparag them for a minut    laughter   i don   t know   we haven   t gone all around the tabl here   but i don   t want to be name target that we don   t intend to hit   so i don   t want to say that we have a target but we are not actual go to do it   if we are go to do that  then we have to chang the languag somehow that whatev the number that we are name is not realli a target   okay   i would be veri avers to do anyth like that  in altern b  the first sentenc state a target rang for the feder fund rate   my feel about this is that effect  in the big pictur  no one will read past that first sentenc  they will just say     oh  yes  the fed lower interest rate      the idea that we are switch to some new regim or that market have to start think in altern way about monetari polici is go to be lost   if you want to put a more aggress spin on this  this is the do noth option   the effect feder fund rate is near zero anyway  so this is just say     well  this is busi as usual   we are go to sit on our hand   we are constrain by the zero bound  and we are not go to realli chang anyth      so i see it as import to get the market off this  and i see altern a as one way to do that   but mayb you all will convinc me otherwis   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   given the dismal state of the economi  and with the fund rate averag around     percent anyway  i don   t see ani reason to wait to bring the fed fund rate down to effect zero   i agre with the staff analysi that ani disloc of the money fund is like to be minor   my board put in for a    basi point cut in the discount rate   when i look over at my small banker  i was afraid one of them was go to throw a shoe at me    laughter   i escap that
that is go around    laughter
so i support altern a   i think it make sens to deemphas the fund rate target   for reason that were illumin by   earlier and reason that governor duke allud to as well  i don   t think a target rang is use   we don   t want to discourag hope among our communiti banker that we might get abov   percent should condit normal to some degre   we do set an interest rate on excess reserv balanc  or more precis  the committe   s reduct in the feder fund rate target reduc the rate on excess reserv  given the board   s adopt formula for set the excess reserv rate   we have a similar sort of govern disconnect between the discount rate approv decis of the board of governor and the feder fund rate decis taken by the feder open market committe   we have manag to coordin those veri effect  with cohes and with consensus   it seem to me to make sens to take the same approach to the excess reserv rate  i like the languag in altern a  paragraph    where we abandon the target and indic that the fund rate is like to be near zero for a while   the condit  the way it is express there or in b   is fine with me   i like the idea of shift attent to the interest rate on reserv by includ the statement in the relat action sentenc of a   that further cement the govern coordin that we have in mind there  decemb                  of     i think it make emin sens to be veri explicit veri soon about our numer object for inflat   monetari polici at the zero bound is all about discourag expect of deflat   if we haven   t tri first announc an explicit object for inflat  we don   t have ani excus if we fail to prevent a fall into a deflationari equilibrium   but i am sympathet to the notion that it might not be best to slip it in the statement in the dead of night without ani fanfar   it might encourag the view that it is a temporari expedi and that we might abandon this languag in some futur statement  should we find it conveni   i think it would be better to do this and issu a separ statement veri clear articul that the committe has adopt a numer inflat object  here is what it mean  here is how we interpret it  and here is whi we do it   perhap januari would be the right  e to do that  and we could  between now and then  lay the groundwork for a clearer and more forc communic   i think it is like to have a bigger effect on financi market particip and the public should we do so   without that statement about an object  the sentenc that preced it   specif the phrase that is in bracket in a    is a littl scari   so i would prefer to leav that bracket thing out if we are not go to includ the inflat object  the fourth paragraph in altern a and the correspond paragraph in b and c discuss how we are go to conduct monetari polici while the fund rate is at zero   i think they are intend to signal a shift toward quantit measur  but i found the languag ambigu and confus   none say anyth about the monetari base   none say anyth about the size of our balanc sheet   in other word  they don   t indic that the credit program wouldn   t be  il   i think the phrase    use our balanc sheet    is ambigu   it  sn   t necessarili mean expand the size  it could mean put some stuff on it   so i would like to see us find a way to decemb                  of     improv the clariti of the languag in paragraph   regard the quantit measur that i think it is intend to communic  that paragraph also mention two program   the agenc debt purchas  which we talk about earlier   let me set that asid   and the talf  which the committe has not been ask to formal consid and approv   now  i can appreci the strict constructionist govern view of who get to approv them  it is not import that we vote on them   but i have been think about this in term of the ideal   the vision you portray and describ for us ye day of a cohes consensus build decisionmak process   i compar the talf and what the committe has heard about it   contrast that with the deliber we gave to the extens of foreign exchang swap line to emerg market countri   there were fair extens brief memorandum provid to the committe  and there was a fair lengthi discuss of that step  in contrast  we were basic inform about the talf rather than consult in ani meaning sens  part of the problem here is that this paragraph conflat the use of our balanc sheet with expans of the base  and these are two distinct polici action   in the current circumst  un il lend   increas the base   but we have been do these program sinc befor that was true  and the distinct  sn   t come through clear in the languag here   there is a tension here becaus a coupl of differ plausibl theori are float around about how this stuff affect the economi and our object and how thing are go to work at the zero bound  i am not sure that we are go to settl on a singl theori   in fact  i am sure that we are not go to settl on a singl theori   but we should strive  in the interest of consensus  for a statement that encompass a rang of plausibl view   we have done that in the past in decemb                  of     finess thing like differ view of the phillip curv and the like  and i would urg us to tri to do that here rather than take a monolith approach  final  let me say someth about the direct   the new draft of a  b  and c add a sentenc  the oper word of which are    keep the committe inform     and it is that the secretari and the system open market account manag would keep the committe inform  this is somewhat short of the languag you use ye day  which admit might not be appropri for the direct   but i wrote the languag down  and it is that the board would bring program to the fomc for review and discuss   i like the sentenc that is ad in the sens that it is a step in the right direct toward your vision of a collabor bodi seek consensus on these issu   but i am afraid that this languag won   t do much to dispel question that have arisen in the press about our govern cohes and decisionmak   so i person would prefer to go as far as we could in that direct   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
i just want to make a coupl of comment   a veri small one is that  in an earli draft  instead of say    entail the use of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet    we had    entail increas the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet      we thought that might not be appropri becaus thing go on and off
other thing pull it down
right   we were probabl go to do that as a trend  mayb not day to day  but it has some of the flavor of increas the base   so that is one just observ   on the talf  we have ad a present today from bill   and pat parkinson
excel   thank you
final  on the direct  there is a bit of a differ  which is that i do think we need to bring new program  et cetera  for your inform  as i said befor  but this is actual a stronger statement in that it also mean that we should report to you on the ongo implic of exist program for the base and for the balanc sheet   so there is a bit of a differ in those two concept
thank you   mr  chairman  i do like the    increas    statement  and i think we could easili explain that we are look at a partial differenti effect
all right   one possibl is    entail increas the size     there is some risk there  but i think that would be the general trend that we are consid  other can comment
i think the real issu is what happen to the cpff  what happen to the swap program  and the take up of the taf   those are the three big element  and they conceiv could run down in the first quarter
you could say    increas over  e the size    or someth like that
or    like to
yes   that was the reason we switch
the statement  sn   t have to stand for the whole first quarter    it
no   but i think the issu is that  becaus we have open facil  we just can   t guarante what their take up is go to be relat to what they are today   the swap line are rough      billion  those could come down
well  each facil make the balanc sheet bigger than it otherwis would be
a lot of these could go down quit substanti if condit improv  and we wouldn   t control that
right   that was the concern we had   that it wouldn   t necessarili be a monoton increas  that it could have up and down depend on usag and so on
well  i have in mind here the confus that some around this tabl have report hear from the public about what we are do with our balanc sheet   i think acknowledg that it is expand in size would be an import featur
all right   well  we can hear from other about that as well  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain agre that more accommod is need   we need to take action to provid  as best we can  the quantit eas equival of the op  control path as discuss in the brief   i am not sure ul  how feasibl that will be  but it is a good goal for us over the next few month  now  in term of the differ between altern a and altern b  as i understood bill    there is no oper differ in these two option   it realli come down to how we want to communic with ourselv and also the public   i tend to favor altern b  certain for now  and mayb altern a later   after all  if the fund rate is go to go to zero in realiti  then altern a might be the right languag   but we will have  e to see that   this is a reason sequenc   the action today that we are drop the fund rate target rang    to     basi point is big  and certain that will be the first thing that they see in the first line  i think they will continu read   the languag on the condit about the fund rate be except low is certain okay today   the languag say     the committe anticip that decemb                  of     weak econom condit are like to warrant      i guess there is some question as to whether or not we should includ the dual mandat here   that disinflationari forc are also part of that   i could go with the consensus there  but i would just rais that as a question  regard the bracket risk that inflat could declin for a  e below op  rate   the rate that we think are best   back in      this is what got a tremend amount of attent  that is anoth reason that  as peopl read further  it could have a veri larg effect   it seem to be accur   one way to deal with that would be to allow the minut to captur that discuss  at least this  e  and perhap to put it in next  e   it depend on the accumul of how mani of these larg noteworthi develop we want in the statement here   i would be even more comfort if that type of statement were accompani by a context such as that we would be seek condit of inflat be around   percent   i realiz that this may not be the ideal  e to includ that without a more extend discuss   but i would be okay with the bracket inform  if that is the consensus  i think we should probabl omit the treasuri purchas if we don   t think that we are go to do that by march   certain  omit it today is low cost   given all the inform  it is probabl overload  i am okay with the languag in the direct   accompani the languag is all of the discuss about the collabor that we have between the board and the committe general  and so i have a veri good feel about that   i think that it will tend to evolv as this goe on  whether or not it is maximum threshold or just chang the composit of all of this   so those are my prefer   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like the other who have spoken befor me  i think this situat is veri serious   we need to do all we can  and i think we need to recogn the realiti of where we are   so either altern a or altern b   that to a signific extent   i guess i have a slight prefer for altern a as a better recognit that we are not realli control the feder fund rate in here   we have these other balanc sheet thing go on  and to me altern b has a littl of the flavor of draw your target around the hole we have alreadi made in the barn door  or whatev  and pretend that you have some control that you don   t realli have   so i think a is better   presid bullard made a veri good point that a tend to refocus attent on these altern polici that we all agre will be the focus of our attent go forward   but i could live with either a or b  in term of some of the issu you rais   so go down altern a   in paragraph    the bracket languag  here i agre with presid     i think my slight prefer would be to wait until januari to do this   whether or not we have an explicit inflat target as we come out of the januari meet  we can debat in januari   we will  i hope  have at least these long run project  and this bracket languag can be explain in term of those long run project   right now  it kind of sit out there   we haven   t yet explain what we think the rate are that best fo  econom growth and price stabil in the longer term   by the end of the januari meet  we can do that   so i think i would wait for that  i think the condit languag in the third paragraph is help  and i would favor keep it in   it is appropri condit on weak econom condit   if other peopl want to add    the disinflationari forc     which i think come primarili from the weak econom condit  that would be okay with me  too   but i am fine with this  decemb                  of     in the first sentenc of paragraph     this is a small point   i would take out the    to continu         the focus of polici go forward will be to support the function            when i first read the    to continu     it sound as though we are just go to continu what we are do now   so i would take that out  but that is a small point   on the discuss about whether we should put the size in  i am a littl worri about put it in becaus the balanc sheet has grown so rapid   if it came down becaus year end pressur abat and becaus the swap with all of those foreign central bank might tend to come down after the end of the year  i don   t think that the committe would necessarili want bill to be replac everi dollar of eurodollar swap that came down with someth els   i think we are talk about a long run trend in the base  and we need to be care about not tri to leav the impress that in everi intermeet period we would expect the base to increas  especi when we don   t control that size   so i would be a littl cautious about that   certain  if we did includ    increas the size of the balanc sheet     i also would say someth about the composit   in my view  it is actual the composit more than the size that is go to influenc relat asset price  even though i do recogn that over veri long period  if we keep the base from declin  it would be hard to have price declin   but i am not sure that is realli an effect way to deal with expect in the short or intermedi run  i would includ the purchas of longer term treasuri secur   among other thing  i think we ought to do it some  in the next few month   the fact that you have alreadi talk about it  if we omit it   i guess i disagre with presid   here   i don   t think that will be low cost   we have a seri of thing we are do  and that is not part of it   i think there could be an advers market reaction   go back to the base for a second  i agre that we need to do a better job of explain  as i said ye day  what this new framework is  how the increas in decemb                  of     reserv and the base fit into it   if we can come to some conclus on that   and whi under these circumst a veri larg increas in the base isn   t inflationari and how that come about  we need to do a much better job of explain these kind of thing   but  again  i would be hesit to put an explicit target in term of the level of reserv or the base in there becaus i don   t realli understand the channel through which they influenc price or activ in the short and intermedi term  final  on bank profit and the effect there  ordinarili i wouldn   t worri about bank profit   it is just a transfer between the owner of bank and household and busi  and quit frank  transfer some incom to household and busi seem like a pretti good idea most of the  e in these circumst   i agre that it is more ambigu than usual  given the worri about the financi sector   still  we are do a lot for the bank   we are give them capit   we are guarante their liabil   we  the govern  that is   this will reduc the rate at which they borrow from the discount window and from each other  so they are get someth there   i think bank are go to need to figur out how to oper at these realli low interest rate  so i wouldn   t let my concern about bank profit stop me from do either altern a or altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman
just a thought in respons to governor kohn   s comment   would the phrase    add to    do a better job than    increas the size of    in convey the sens that these program are go to make the balanc sheet bigger than it otherwis would be  rather than lead to an absolut increas in the size of the balanc sheet
i am not sure those word help me  actual      add to    sound the same as    increas    to me   i have miss the subtleti here
other thing held constant
ceteri paribus   we could put that in there
it is alreadi greek anyway    laughter   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   my prefer is to move in this meet to the consensus lower bound rang for the fund target  and i prefer the rang of   to      so i believ either altern a or altern b will work as servic option  and i can live with either one   but i actual lean toward altern b   i think it is the clearest  and with the inclus of the languag relat to deflat  it is also intern more consist   in particular  my prefer is to indic that the fomc intend to keep the polici rate low until econom and credit condit improv  and i think it is appropri to emphas that our polici will be calibr base on longer term inflat object  as i said ye day  i am think that the condit languag could be stronger  specif  i have in mind someth along the line of a statement that read that    the committe intend to maintain this rang for the feder fund rate until such  e that it judg condit are present for materi and sustain improv in financi market function and econom growth  and the committe believ that this polici cours is consist with it medium term price stabil object      i think that kind of languag could fit at the begin of paragraph    around that area  in altern b   i think that is stronger than the implicit condit that is alreadi in the statement   in my round of contact befor the meet  one convers did reson with me   it was a call from a financi market particip for hear decemb                  of     what the plan is and what the strategi is and affirm that there is a plan   i think stronger condit languag would respond to that need in the marketplac  as regard the question  i think i have alreadi cover some of them   i would prefer the specifi of a rang in altern b   i would lean toward includ the languag    and see some risk that inflat could declin    becaus it tie in with the    all avail tool    languag at the begin of paragraph     in other word  i think  if we includ that languag in paragraph    we are set up a risk and the    employ all avail tool    respond strong to that risk  regard the inclus of the long term treasuri secur  i am persuad by governor kohn   s comment that we should includ it   it is consist with whatev public discuss we have had to date  includ your speech of two week ago   so that is all   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think  at the end of the day  altern a and b realli amount to the same thing in term of polici   so i could live with either  but on communic ground  my own strong prefer would be for b   i think it is import at this junctur for the fomc to state veri clear what it want the feder fund rate to be  that we want it to remain close to zero  and i think we best do that by specifi explicit a rate or  as it is  a rang   both a and b elimin the gap we have had between the target and the realiti of where the fund rate is actual trade  but b elimin that gap by embrac the current realiti as desir  in contrast  it seem to me that a is say that the committe is all but helpless to affect the fund rate  so  after all  it would be a charad to set a target   then it kind of acknowledg  well  but  you know  the fund rate trade near zero is realli not such a bad thing  given the decemb                  of     weak in the economi   i think we have greater command over the fund rate   s destini than altern a suggest   if the board and the fomc realli want to push the effect fund rate up abov zero  say to    or to     basi point  the board could choos to rais the rate paid on reserv and the discount rate  and we could get it up  even though we have all of this enorm quantiti of excess reserv and even though interest on reserv isn   t work in quit the way we expect   i agre that it would be a bit odd to be set the interest on reserv and discount rate abov our target for the feder fund rate   but it seem to me it could be done  and we are not powerless to accomplish it   so i don   t like the suggest that we are just helpless to move the fund rate   i think we should say that we don   t want to move the fund rate up   i don   t want it to trade abov the   to    basi point errang   i certain don   t want that   i think the forecast is grim   i think we should go as low as we can as fast as we can without harm the function of money market  so keep the fund rate trade in the   to    rang is desir   if it were to be the case  follow presid     s earlier question  that we sudden saw the interest on reserv floor work better and fed fund start trade abov      the fund rate could  for exampl  move up to    or so   i would hope that the board would actual lower the interest rate paid on reserv to hold the fund rate in the   to    rang   so i think we should go down and do it decis in one step today  on the other matter  in altern b  paragraph    i favor includ the bracket languag suggest that we expect and are not happi to see inflat declin below level we consid consist with price stabil   i agre with presid   on the merit of do that  i like the forward look languag from a that has been ad in bold to b concern the odd that we will keep the fund rate low for some  e   on the treasuri  i am worri about make an announc or give a hint that we are not go to follow through on them pretti decemb                  of     quick   i am person in favor of and support buy longer term treasuri  and i haven   t heard a lot of opposit to it   if we realli are go to do it and do it pretti soon  i have no problem with includ languag to that effect   but i don   t think we should throw a hint out there unless we intend to follow through   with respect to the word of the direct  i am happi with it   with respect to the issu about the monetari base and increas the size of our balanc sheet  i would endors governor kohn   s remark on that topic
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   if we were still work with the framework of target the fed fund rate  i would prefer d  and i would accept c  and i would vote accord  but i think what i   ve heard in the past two day is that we have realli abandon that framework  and this is kind of a ratif of that   i think that our framework now is actual in a and b in the statement that we are go to    expand it purchas       as condit warrant      if that   s the case  then go with a  in which you don   t set a fed fund rate or talk about it  is probabl prefer  i also think that we   re now in a credit polici type of framework  and it bother me   i have a lot of sympathi for what presid   and bullard said   i would prefer  rather than a statement that say    as condit warrant     that we have some kind of a monetari base criterion for the futur   this is someth that we ought to think about   at the same  e  i do not think that we should have inflat below op  in this statement   i don   t think we   re there  and  at this point  i think it should not be hint at  i think that    purchas longer term treasuri secur    goe with the condit statement anyway   we   ll do what it take  and if it take purchas longer term treasuri  that   s it   that is what we have unless we go back and look at a new framework that we need to get out decemb                  of     and talk about with the public  and i hope that as our meet and our discuss progress  we begin to focus on that   thank you
again  as i said ye day  this is a work in progress
we   ll keep work on it   i didn   t quit get your propos  do you propos leav in the sentenc about treasuri at this meet
if we   re go to have statement that say we   re go to purchas mortgag back secur as condit warrant  i don   t think    purchas longer term treasuri secur    is a much differ step from that  so we can leav it in
okay   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious  for us to counteract the power forc that are weaken our economi and financi market  we should provid maximum monetari polici s ulus as quick as possibl  and conduct monetari polici on the basi of a fed fund rate target is no longer the best strategi   i do think it is  e and it would be help to begin focus the public   s attent on the unconvent approach to monetari polici  and i think altern a   a better job of do that  what i like about altern a is it straightforward character of the polici situat and how we plan to respond to it   i support leav in the languag that is bracket in altern a  paragraph    about the risk that inflat could declin for some  e below rate that best fo  econom growth and price stabil   the reason i say that is that we have been use the languag that the committe expect inflat to moder for some  e now  and given the discuss  i think we expect that situat to be get wors   so i would support leav that in   i would also leav in paragraph   the more forward look languag about keep the low level of the fed decemb                  of     fund rate for some  e   i also would keep in the languag on the potenti benefit of purchas longer term treasuri secur   i assum that the minut that are releas in three week are go to say that we discuss it and that we will be evalu it   so i would just leav it in   also  given the dire econom outlook that we are talk about and the aggress respons that we think monetari polici should take  i think just say mere that we stand readi to expand the purchas of agenc debt and mortgag back secur isn   t aggress enough   i do realiz that there are a lot of import question that are left unansw  such as determin the mix of asset to purchas and how to know when enough is enough  and then how to shrink our balanc sheet when the  e come   but i do think that adopt altern a is take a big step in the direct of give the public some indic of what we plan to do  final  i know you just said that we will come up with some languag and some framework around what we are do   but as discuss in ye day   s convers  have some talk point even in the near term so that we are consist in our languag on what we are do would be help   at a  e when there is a lot of confus out there and market are as fragil as they are  have us all talk about this in the same way would be help   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  as sever peopl have observ   and i agre   i don   t think there   s ani signific polici differ between a and b   that   s certain where i am   from a communic point of view  i have a mild prefer for b   i think it   s a littl clearer on the margin and would be help in that regard   so i would work off b as to some of the issu and suggest that have been rais  with regard to the first issu  i would not includ the inform in bracket in paragraph   at this point   i think governor kohn made a good point that we   re like to be much better decemb                  of     posit to do that in januari in conjunct with the sep and the longer term project   let me be clear   i am in favor of inflat target  but i think exact how and when we get to that is import   so i wouldn   t want to do that simpli in a casual way and do it too rapid  as i look at paragraph    i have a coupl of other question   the first sentenc say that    inflationari pressur have diminish quick     which is certain true  but i think it may be more import that they have diminish appreci   so i would just make that point   i might also say  rather than    the committe expect inflat to moder in come quarter     which i think is probabl true  that you might just say    the committe expect modest inflat in come quarter     the reason i   m put it that way is that i   m tri to get out of this point precis about whether it is or isn   t go to run below what we think might be consist with the dual object  i think the condit in paragraph   is fine   if there   s a good way to strengthen it  do so would also be fine with me   but tri to modifi these thing on the fli is alway difficult  final  i would includ the thought about purchas longer term treasuri   i think we should  and becaus i think we should  i think we should say that   so i guess that cover the topic i want to cover
thank you   mayb i should ask bill   do you see ani pure oper issu in the next few month if we decid to purchas longer term treasuri
we can do it  but we   re under a strain   as long as we don   t start until some  in januari  i think we could manag  as long as you don   t ask us to do it everi day
we won   t
everi other day
how about onc everi coupl of week
thank you  mr  chairman   these are  inde  troubl  e  and i think in troubl  e it   s even more import that we be as transpar and clear as possibl   i think it   s  e that we public convey that we have enter a new monetari polici regim   to do otherwis perpetu the view that we are no longer in control of monetari polici rather than that we have opt to implement polici through a differ mean  particular our balanc sheet  there   s ampl room for judgment here and disagr  but  mr  chairman  with all due respect  i   m deepli troubl by element of the step that we are take today   in effect  i interpret our propos action as substitut credit alloc polici for monetari polici   both the expans of our balanc sheet and the fed fund rate are now determin or will be now determin by decis about which market or firm are deem worthi of our intervent and support and some assess of how much money we want to throw at them   i think we all agre that we are look for the best polici   i think that it   s also true that best polici are base on clear articul goal and object and in credibl and systemat action to achiev those goal and object  and they can also be credibl communic to the public   i feel that our approach to credit polici come up lack in each of these dimens   our goal may be to prevent system risk  but we haven   t clear defin what that is or the criteria that we   re use to decid whom to lend to and when to lend to them   it   s veri import for both clariti and transpar that we rectifi this defici  or we may continu to creat moral hazard and to see market after market after market seek our help  the messag from the literatur we discuss ye day is that near the zero bound our credibl and our commit to generat inflat and prevent expect of deflat to develop are paramount   my read of the propos languag is that it   littl to signal that commit   inde  it seem to suggest that our primari object are and will continu to be decemb                  of     credit intervent   confus our monetari polici object with our credit polici is not the kind of messag that i   m comfort with   i think we need to be care not to convey to the market that monetari polici has becom ineffect  and i don   t think anyon at this tabl wish to do that  presid   articul the import in the current environ of keep inflat expect well anchor  and measur of the base   or if you would rather  look at the asset side of the balanc sheet  either way they   re both measur the balanc sheet   are a mean of anchor those expect   i don   t think the languag of the direct or the statement is clear enough in address either the effect of monetari polici or the credibl commit to avoid deflat or even to maintain inflat near our target  which is clear not deflat   i   m not quit as fear of deflat as presid bullard or some other  but i think we need to be mind and reinforc our commit to low but stabl inflat  on the govern side  i continu to believ that the fomc is the appropri bodi for make monetari polici decis and that replac monetari polici with credit polici that are unconstrain by this committe is to violat both good govern and the spirit of the oper understand of the fomc   ye day and in my memo to the committe earlier this week  i argu that the direct and the statement should clear state that we are in a new regim and should articul how that new regim will oper go forward   my interpret is that the propos languag  particular altern a    help indic that we are move to a new regim   that   s import  and therefor  i lean in that direct   but that languag fail to articul how that new regim will oper  except to say that the board of governor will continu credit market intervent   it say noth about the term and strategi that we   ll employ to do so   the implicit messag is   and i think the market will clear interpret it this way   that the fomc has decemb                  of     cede monetari polici decis to the board of governor  and i think that will be damag  such a step  in my view  is not good polici  nor is it good govern  and it may have polit ramif as well   onc the committe set the preced that the board of governor can assum sole respons for monetari polici  we run the risk of lose the strength and the divers of view that the system has alway brought  my sens is that this committe   s set some kind of cap on the size of the balanc sheet was an effort to clarifi the role of monetari polici in contrast to credit polici   i think the reaction i heard ye day around the tabl was a litani of reason whi set base growth target is not appropri   while that might be an interest debat to have  that was not the point i was propos   i was request that we have a debt ceil  if you will  and that the fomc would review and adjust that debt ceil as it deem appropri   not target for balanc sheet per se  such a debt ceil would not prevent the board of governor from manag the asset side of the balanc sheet via       lend   onli when un il lend exceed the debt ceil might formal approv be requir from the fomc   mr  chairman  my discomfort is not a matter simpli of good govern   it is more fundament about the lack of clariti  disciplin  and transpar that the strategi is offer  and i have deep concern  i   d like to offer a coupl of suggest for the committe to consid about languag  and i   m work off altern a  which i think is probabl the work hypothesi here   so to answer your question  mr  chairman  i have been and continu to be in favor of an explicit inflat target  most of you are awar of that   i am sympathet to the view  as i think presid   said  that slip it in in the dead of night is probabl not the right way to go about it   i would add that i do not like the bracket phrase regard the committe   s see some risk of inflat come in too low   as presid   suggest  it might caus fear in the marketplac   but i do think we decemb                  of     could chang the second bracket statement  which was struck out      in support of it dual mandat  the committe will seek       a rate of inflat       of about   percent      i think we could chang that and heighten the import of inflat to us and our dual mandat by say someth to the effect of    in support of it dual mandat  the committe will seek a low and stabl inflat rate over the intermedi term      that would be short of specifi an inflat target but would reinforc the notion that we are still commit to achiev a low but stabl inflat rate  my biggest problem is with paragraph    which i think could be simplifi great   i would like to emphas that monetari polici remain in the purview of the fomc and that we have enter a new regim   so i would propos  just for the sake of get it on the tabl  that paragraph   be simplifi to say that    the focus of the fomc   s monetari polici go forward will be to continu to support the dual mandat and the function of a financi market to s ul the economi through open market oper and other measur that entail the use of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet      then i would say     today the fomc affirm the expans of the fed   s balanc sheet up to    trillion and will period review and adjust that in the pursuit of our dual mandat      repeat the litani of credit market intervent that we have engag in seem just repeat what we   ve alreadi done   i   m not sure that serv much purpos in the context of monetari polici make at this point   i   m not oppos to buy gses   i   m not oppos to buy longer term treasuri   i think we need to modifi   madigan   s statement about the condit under which we should purchas gses so that we are be intern consist  but i don   t have ani object to it  so i think we could be clearer   we could be less confus in our polici by emphas again our commit to keep inflat stabl and at a posit level and clear indic that quantiti do matter and that this committe is respons for those quantiti and will interact with decemb                  of     the board of governor and our credit polici to see that we can achiev the goal that we all decid on   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  befor i get start  i do think that presid   has rais good issu on the govern matter   i hope that we will continu to discuss this  bear in mind that there may be chang in the composit of the governor with a new presid and given the faith that we built up with the exist governor  so that we have to get at least our line of understand clear as we go through  e   as to the altern that we face  the problem with the economi isn   t the interbank lend rate or even the riskless rate   the problem with the economi and with the financi market is that intermedi has broken down   i think our action should forc be direct toward the clear of blockag in the financi plumb and not just fiddl with the faucet   it   s the avail and distribut of credit that is problemat  in that sens i like altern a   in fact  presid  n  i like it ambigu  and i   ll tell you whi   i am quit worri that state zero to    basi point will bring down upon us the wrath of banker   i do think it   s import that communiti bank be profit and that they be healthi  first vice presid cum point this out in her comment  and to me this altern give us substanti wiggl room  as it were  in it ambigu   vice chairman kohn point out that paragraph   is good for the banker   without state a specif target fed fund rate  it allow them to price their loan accord to how they see fit   that appear to be take place anyway   there is a separ between the fed fund rate and the prime loan rate   so unless i   m miss someth  banker should posit interpret both paragraph   and paragraph   in term of their oper leeway  decemb                  of     i would suggest that this is an import step forward in make clear the way we   re go to oper henceforth   it   indic a regim chang  and as presid bullard point out  i think we have to be forc in do so   i could diddl with the languag  but to be even more forc i would transpos paragraph   and paragraph     that is  the first two paragraph strike me as fine   at this junctur i would not put in an inflat target becaus i don   t think we   re prepar for it as a committe   i   m comfort leav in paragraph   that we see some risk that inflat could declin below op  rate for a  e   after all  we just got the number that make that veri clear   minus     on the headlin rate   but then i would go immedi into what our focus is go to be   i rather like presid     s one edit to make clear that it   s the focus of the fomc   s polici   after we have laid that clear   and if  inde  just parenthet we are go to make some treasuri purchas  we should includ that in there  if we are not  we should not   then in what would be paragraph    strike    in current circumst    and say that    the committe judg that it was not use to set a specif target for the fed fund rate      you   re make it veri clear that we have a regim chang   as to the content of paragraph    assum we are go to be purchas longer term treasuri  i   d leav it as it is   stay on messag   repeat it over and over and over again   you start with your speech in austin  and that make it oper   i have no problem with it  and i would urg it be includ as written  so my suggest  in summari  are that we embrac altern a  we transpos paragraph   and    we take out the word    in current circumst    becaus obvious we   re judg thing in current circumst  and we not includ an inflat target at this junctur but do includ the rest of the bracket languag in paragraph     i believ this is sellabl to our banker  and i believ it   s a good way to proceed   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   first vice presid cum
yes  thank you   like other  i see the circumst as requir the most action we can take   therefor  i would favor altern a somewhat over altern b  but i could live with either   i think that altern a has the advantag  which presid bullard describ and other have refer to  that it   signal a signific chang in what we   re do and draw attent to it   if anyth  it probabl provok more dialogu with us as a central bank  which i think at this point is a good thing  turn to the next paragraph  i   m a bit concern that inflat is  in fact  moder veri quick   this morn   s number for the total cpi is     percent   that would lead me to ask whether we are expect inflat to moder or are  in fact  see inflat moder   this point is similar to presid  n   s   that would also lead me to leav in the bracket point about the futur and the concern there becaus i think it   s better if we put it on the tabl than have peopl say     don   t they see that as a problem      to that end  i also want to endors the kind of broad strategi statement that presid   put forward   i actual came into the meet with a veri similar sentenc from my staff  realli talk about what our goal is   i think it   help to set the stage for what follow here  and this was a focus on improv condit in financi market or financi intermedi and ensur a recoveri in output and maintain low inflat
i   m sorri   what was the begin
i think that presid   was propos that it follow paragraph    perhap in it own paragraph   we would rais the question of the risk of too low inflat but then have the next paragraph realli speak to what our goal would be  and i thought the sentenc that you had sound good
i can confus the matter by say that i was think of it in altern b  and ms  cum has it in altern a   so somewher in there
then continu with this  i would comment on the next paragraph   i   m veri sympathet to the idea that presid   was put forward   that we somehow need to talk about our expect about the size of the balanc sheet   i was go to offer one suggest  perhap for the    entail the use of    phrase in the first sentenc of paragraph   we could substitut    sustain the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet at veri high level      someth that would indic that we expect the balanc sheet to remain realli larg but  sn   t talk about whether we   re increas it from today   just a thought   i would leav in the sentenc on the longer term treasuri in larg part becaus we have alreadi talk about it public and the languag here give us the opportun to evalu and   not necessarili commit us to those purchas in the futur  in ani case  we would need to explain whether or not we   re go to purchas longer term treasuri  have rais it alreadi  on the direct  i would say that i am comfort with the direct as written   there might be room  if we found the right languag for the size of the balanc sheet  for insert that sentenc in here  for exampl  whatev we take from the first sentenc of paragraph     i also think that  as part of this monitor that the system open market account manag and the secretari will provid for the committe  there realli is the opportun to develop much better disclosur of what the committe is do  what our balanc sheet look like  and what action we   re take   some kind of ongo monitor that could be share with the public that i think would also be veri help in explain what the feder reserv is actual pursu in the near term and what it is do with the balanc sheet  i was realli impress by someth that presid   said ye day  which is that   and i paraphras   we are in unchart water but we are grope our way forward   i think that it is a great metaphor for where  in fact  we are   some of these question   such as what specif decemb                  of     forward lean languag we   d like to put in our statement over  e and how we think about the monetari base versus the credit polici type of action that we   re take   are all thing that i think we will continu to learn about and explor   what i had put forward is that  as we come to understand them better  we have an opportun to communic with the public and help them understand better what we are  in fact  do   thank you veri much
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have said  the choic among these altern  particular a  b  and c  is not realli a choic about the effect rate   it   s a choic about our clariti  our convict  and mayb most import  our readi in announc a new regim   as i describ ye day  i think the zero lower bound is not zero  and so there are risk particular in these market of go there or threaten to go there   so the balanc of my suggest and edit come from the zero phobia    laughter  first let me talk about c briefli   altern c is a sort of way station   it is our last chanc to describ the old regim and to pivot to a new regim  whether the new target rate was    or    basi point   but see that there  sn   t seem to be much interest in that  i won   t tri to reconcil the music and lyric of c  which announc a target and then say we   re go to miss it  but i had a coupl of suggest to tri to bring that togeth   so let me confin the balanc of my remark to the choic between a and b  i think in altern a we are all in   it make the new regim explicit   it is like to be somewhat of a surpris to market and put a larg burden on all of us   particular you  mr  chairman   not onli in the next few hour but realli for the next day and week in describ with great rigor what the new regim is   i think we   re up to that  but it is certain a tall task at a  e of great uncertainti in market   the way i would tri to make that task a littl easier is through various decemb                  of     channel   suggest that we are in some way reveal the new target in paragraph   by suggest that the impli effect target is    basi point  given what our chang is on the discount rate and the interest rate on reserv   so that  i think  has a way of make the transit to the new regim less massiv than it might be and reinforc my zero phobia point   i think that   s one way in which the bold  new regim with a lot of explan in the next few week can at least be not as scari to the market in the next coupl of day  what about altern b   if we were to go in that direct  i   d make one modest suggest   in the first paragraph  i would insert the word    between      so    the feder open market committe decid today to establish a target rang for the feder fund rate between zero and   percent      to suggest that you   re not go to be at that endpoint   now  i   ll admit that   s not a massiv chang  but it make me feel a bit better about my phobia and about how market  bank  and other might react know that that is a point you do not want to cross   so a suggest there  now  on your open question  set a rang in term of the op  level of inflat or not  i   m not crazi about a rang   but if we have a rang  i think it is scari  lurchi  to includ it today  and so i wouldn   t do it   condit  i think  is fine   i don   t feel strong about our consid treasuri secur   i do like governor kohn   s suggest about delet    to continu    becaus bold new regim aren   t continu of what we   ve done   they   re bold and new   so i think that   s an import chang by governor kohn   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   obvious you have a bleak outlook   it   s veri import to act quick and decis  and i think it   s clear from the discuss that our choic is between a and b   but as a number of peopl have mention  the econom substanc is probabl decemb                  of     near ident in altern a and b   our exposit of it  though  can make a veri big differ  there are an enorm number of move part  and there is a lot to digest   we potenti have here  as i count them  seven new thing that peopl have brought up   that   s just an enorm amount to deal with  and i think some of them we want to delay   the inflat target is veri import  but it bring up issu here  and i   m not sure that we want to talk about someth like that now   so let me just quick run through these  we have to think about the dynam of what we are go to say next  e   what is this commit us to talk about   first  the rate cut is one veri big issu      versus    basi point  although some market particip think it will be     i think that will still be news  but i think it   s veri import for us to move there   second  just move to a rang is someth new  i think that is someth that is actual quit newsworthi in and of itself   go to no target at all is extrem newsworthi  mayb too newsworthi to includ with all these other thing   i think of this and the discuss that we   ve had as set up an extrem valuabl templat for how we should be think about the statement and what we need to be explain today as well as over the next few meet   so i would actual say that  given all of the move part and all of the chang  talk about a rang either    between    or    of    zero to   percent would make a lot of sens   i don   t think we   re introduc ani more ambigu   i think we   re introduc a bit of ambigu especi for peopl who are not that well inform by say that we don   t have a target anymor   what presid   said was that it could easili be misinterpret as    gosh  we don   t realli have control over these thing anymor anyway      i don   t think ani of us believ that  and i think there   s more of a chanc of that misinterpret  which i don   t want us to have  if we do that today with all the other chang than if we wait a littl   i still think the rang is a pretti big shift  decemb                  of     express concern about inflat be less than the level fo  econom growth   again  i think that   s someth that i would prefer to wait on   i like presid  n   s edit about talk about the appreci diminut of inflationari pressur  but i would wait on put in the phrase about whether the level is too low to be consist with fo  econom growth   i mention the inflat target   i think we should wait on that   we   re introduc condit  which i think is valuabl to do  and i think the phrase there is fine   we   re talk about old and new program as well as balanc sheet issu   as a number of peopl have mention  we have alreadi talk about stand readi to expand the purchas of agenc secur as condit warrant   so that   s forward lean alreadi   if we are commit to do the treasuri secur fair soon  i think we should just go along with that and feel comfort with that   but we do have to think a bit about the preced of make concret new polici that we   ve general talk about in this statement   is it someth that we want to do go forward     this commit us to do that   i don   t think so  but i think we should just think about that  then i think it   s veri import that we talk about the use of the balanc sheet   i agre with governor   that to be bold you don   t say    continu to      but we are talk about some exist program  so in some sens we are continu   i   m not quit sure exact where we want to go on this  but i just want to rais that ambigu   on the balanc sheet  though  i go back to the chairman   s remark from ye day   it is import to think about the composit of the balanc sheet  not just the size in and of itself   governor kohn also made refer to this   so i would be veri wari of focus on the size here   i think that just talk about way to use the balanc sheet is the appropri way to go now   if we have more experi and understand better how the size might evolv over  e  how the differ program we have might fluctuat  i   d feel more comfort with that   if we talk about the size or commit to growth of that size or expect it decemb                  of     to be larg  just as a number of peopl said  it could sudden shrink  and we don   t want peopl to think that we   re chang monetari polici becaus of that   some of these thing would just be chang over  e   thank you
thank you   governor duke
thank you  mr  chairman   i do favor altern a   in term of what will happen with the prime rate  i frank don   t know  but i think it will leav the bank to determin their own prime rate and floor as they wish   i would not minim the fact that we are actual still set a rate for the interest on excess reserv as well as the discount rate   this experi with interest on reserv is brand new for us  and i don   t think we   ve had enough experi to know how it is actual go to work   it   leav room for the spread to establish itself as the fed fund market regener  and i think it give us some room to have some experi with that regim   i think this communic the regim chang better than ani of the other altern  and at the end of the day  this is a communic document   i would strong echo presid pianalto   s comment that  in this new regim  we realli need to stay on the same page to avoid total confus in the marketplac   i know that independ of thought is one of the strength of this bodi  but if we could for a  e set that asid at least in public and all speak from the same talk point  it would make all of our polici more effect  in term of the specif of the statement  i would defer to anoth day the languag in bracket in paragraph   of altern a   the condit languag i would keep in   about the phrase    to continu    and realli all of paragraph    to my mind  although we are continu some of the thing that the board has done  it has not necessarili been clear that all of these have been consid by the fomc   to me this take everyth we are do and put it in the middl of this tabl and give us  e to discuss which of them we like  what we might use or not use  and how we decemb                  of     might express the degre to which we would use all of these tool   we   ve made a lot of progress in a veri short  e in come to the broad outlin of the thing that we might do go forward  and in come meet we   ll actual contour those more and make them more specif   i would includ that as well   as to whether or not we    use    our balanc sheet or    expand    our balanc sheet  i would leav it at this point as    use our balanc sheet    and have further discuss on that  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   boy  you   ve left me a simpl task   yes  a two hander from presid
mr  chairman  i just want to come back to a point i suggest   is there ani sens in transpos paragraph   and   to emphas the new regim
well  let me comment
yes  sir
in light of our discuss of    use of    in this balanc sheet quantit  i was go to point out that presid     s suggest about a specif number for an upper bound on the size of our balanc sheet would remedi the problem that we were discuss there   in addit  it would great allevi the deep discomfort i and perhap other may have about our govern practic and the extent to which they   re public known   i would also emphas that there are two theori about the effect of our balanc sheet and that this is written from the credit spread point of view  and it would be use to encompass both
let me just say  general speak  that we are make a lot of chang here   i   d like to suggest that we move gradual   but one suggest i did like and would propos to see if it help you is first vice presid cum   s suggest of say that decemb                  of     we   ll provid support with measur that sustain the size of the feder reserv balanc sheet at a high level   that make it veri explicit   later we can go further about quantit guidelin and so forth  but for the moment we   re say that the balanc sheet size itself is of import
becaus the word    size    is a quantit word  it   a lot better than    use of     which is ambigu about  il   so to that extent i view first vice presid cum   s suggest as veri posit
presid      that satisfi you for today
would you read that again  pleas   i   m sorri  mr  chairman   this is veri difficult
just for today     the focus of polici go forward will be to support the function of financi market and s ul the economi through open market oper and other measur that sustain the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet at a high level
i think it is the focus of the fomc   s monetari polici
the focus of the committe   s polici
of the committe   s polici   fine
is that okay
yes  much improv
all right   so in the spirit of tri to move gradual and not just overwhelm the market  i would like  as i say  to move halfway to where we want to be   there was a slight major in favor of altern a  but i   m veri concern that  if we don   t say anyth about the fund rate  there is just go to be confus   i am also concern about the view that presid    governor    and other rais if we sort of say that we   re not target it decemb                  of     anymor   it suggest that we   re indiffer to the rate or that we have no abil to rais it   what   it mean to say that rate will be kept low for a long  e  if we don   t have some view on that  again  i would cite the japanes preced   i understand the concern about communiti bank   i do think that   s not a reason that should control our polici  and they certain can chang their price polici   so let me make some suggest      will someon take note   then we can come back   in order to be conserv and avoid risk  i would like to propos altern b   in the first paragraph  i would take governor     s suggest and say    target rang for the feder fund rate between   and   percent
i   m sorri   say that again
target rang for the feder fund rate of between   and   percent
oh  sorri   not    of between    but    a target for the feder fund rate between   and   percent
so the target is between
a target or a target rang
target rang is between
the target rang for the feder fund rate between   and   percent
so the target rang is to be between those two number
all right   okay   scratch it   paragraph   is the same   that   s simpl   paragraph   is the same  includ the addit sentenc about financi market  no decemb                  of     longer bold   paragraph    presid  n was right about    quick      whi don   t we say    appreci      now  a lot of peopl have talk about inflat target   i think we should look at that veri serious   today is not the day to do it   mayb that should be introduc simultan with concern about deflat   i propos that we strike the bracket materi but put the word    further    after    moder         the committe expect inflat to moder further in come quarter      the fourth paragraph as is   most peopl were okay with the condit there   in the fifth paragraph  strike    continu to         the focus of the committe   s polici go forward will be to support the function of financi market and s ul the economi through open market oper and other measur that sustain the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet at a high level      you know  i get the sens from the committe that they will entertain purchas of treasuri secur in the next quarter or so   in order not to jerk the market around too much  i think we should therefor mention it and leav it where it is   so the onli chang in paragraph   that i   m propos is in the first sentenc
so the last sentenc will have    continu to    or not
okay   let   s see   yes  i think it has to be there      the feder reserv will continu to consid way of use it balanc sheet      i think we have to say that becaus we have use it
would that say    the committe
would that say the    committe will    or    the feder reserv will      perhap    the committe will continu to consid way to use the feder reserv balanc sheet
the committe will continu to consid way of use the feder reserv   s balanc sheet      i think we should leav it where it is   just leav it ambigu for decemb                  of     now  if that   s okay   so those are the chang      would you like just to read that   are you abl to read it that   do you have the inform
would you go ahead and read the thing
the feder open market committe decid today to establish a target rang for the feder fund rate of   to   percent   sinc the committe   s last meet  labor market condit have deterior  and the avail data indic that consum spend  busi invest  and industri product have declin   financi market remain quit strain and credit condit tight   overal  the outlook for econom activ has weaken further  meanwhil  inflationari pressur have diminish appreci   in light of the declin in the price of energi and other commod and the weaker prospect for econom activ  the committe expect inflat to moder further in come quarter  the feder reserv will employ all avail tool to promot the resumpt of sustain econom growth and to preserv price stabil   in particular  the committe anticip that weak econom condit are like to warrant except low level of the feder fund rate for some  e  the focus of the committe   s polici go forward will be to support the function of financi market and s ul the economi through open market oper and other measur that sustain the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet at a high level   as previous announc  over the next few quarter the feder reserv will purchas larg quantiti of agenc debt and mortgag back secur to provid support to the mortgag and hous market  and it stand readi to expand it purchas of agenc debt and mortgag back secur as condit warrant   the committe is also evalu the potenti benefit of purchas longer term decemb                  of     treasuri secur   earli next year  the feder reserv will also implement the term asset back secur loan facil to facilit the extens of credit to household and small busi   the feder reserv will continu to consid way of use it balanc sheet to further support credit market and econom activ
and then the relat action   presid
this is a clarif  mr  chairman   i hate to be difficult  but in think about this as a step  we talk about an inflat target   what other step do you see that we need to clarifi as we tri to make this process more   i   m look for some forward look languag here
well  we need to talk about it   i think there are two promis direct   one is to have an inflat target or someth close to an inflat target  depend on how the committe decid  what we think is feasibl  and so on   the other would be to develop a more formal structur for discuss the integr respons we have with respect to the balanc sheet  and that could involv quantit rang  for exampl   i didn   t quit like your ceil becaus i think in some case you might want to have a floor   but i don   t think  as i said ye day  that we can describ our polici in a singl number  and i don   t think that a target for the overal size of the balanc sheet is a suffici statist for what we   re do   but i do think that  for govern and other reason  we can talk about rang  consult  and so on  about the size of the balanc sheet   okay   again  i apolog that this is an imperfect document   given the mani move part  as i said  i want to tri to keep it from be too overwhelm   this is go to be a big enough step as it is   governor kohn
just one further clarif   by sustain the balanc sheet at a high level  we   re not promis that it won   t fall from here  right   just that it will be higher than it ordinarili would be
that it   s go to be abov      billion for some  e i would think is a fair statement     anyon els have a comment   governor
i apolog for the bad english that i offer befor  but an altern to the first sentenc that you read that would  i think  be english to     s fair point   it would be to delet the word    target      so it say     to establish a rang for the feder fund rate between zero and   percent      so those are your two option
but it   s the same issu      rang    is the noun  and you   re say that the rang lie between those thing  and you   re not tell everyon what the rang is
it would be a rang of   to   percent   i think that would be right  particip   right
mr  chairman  i can   t support that  and i   ll tell you whi   i do feel that we had an eleg solut in altern a   i firm believ that if we target   to    basi point   the effect fund rate we all know is trade at        it is go to creat enorm backlash   it is unaccept to me to say that the banker will figur out how to deal with this   they can   t  second  as far as money market fund are concern  the expens load is usual    basi point   so for whatev it is worth  i will be a minor of one  but i cannot support that   altern a was eleg in that it made no statement   then  and i think veri import  by dwell on this busi of what our target rate is  we diminish what we   re do  and what we   re do is chang thing fundament  which i fulli support  decemb                  of     so for whatev it   s worth  i understand all the counter argument     and i have talk about this   i know what peopl are go to say   i think  a  it is an unnecessari distract   b  it creat a potenti polit backlash  and  c  it is counterproduct   so i just want to state it myself straightforward and honest   i may be the onli person at this tabl  but i   ll vote against that   if you give us altern a  i   ll vote for it   i know i   m one of    at this tabl   there are more than    peopl at this tabl   i apolog  but i don   t think it   s necessari to make the fund rate clear   it   s impli in what we   re do  but altern a give peopl enough ambigu to steer around it  and that   s my opinion   i apolog
i think confus is an extraordinarili danger thing for us
the key is paragraph   in altern a   that is what we   re do
no  i agre with that   what b say is that this is the end of one regim and the begin of anoth   the first one say that this is the end  and then we say what are we do go forward   i think that clariti is need   if we did what you   re suggest  i don   t know for sure what would happen  but i think there would be a lot of commentari and question      what are they say   what do they mean      that would be much more than what b     i understand your point   i thought hard about it  and i know that there was a mixtur of view   governor duke
i   d like to ask one question just  again  about go forward   we talk about what you would do differ tomorrow under altern a and b and determin that it was noth   what would you do go forward if feder fund start to trade abov    basi point under altern b
well  i guess we would stop do revers repo to signal our protest of the fact that the fed fund rate is trade soft to it target   that   s the first thing we   d do   i have to decemb                  of     say that i think the probabl of this happen is extrem remot becaus bank are balanc sheet constrain and therefor aren   t go to do that perfect arbitrag   mayb in a normal world it would be possibl to get fed fund to trade abov the interest on excess reserv  but in this world it   s just extraordinarili unlik   but if it were to happen  we would signal our unhappi with that  and the first thing we would do is we   d stop do the revers that we   ve been do everi day to protest the soft in the fund rate
but you would be abl to pull it back down
i don   t know how quick we could pull it back down   look   i don   t think that this is go to happen under almost ani conceiv circumst  but if it were to happen  we would basic add reserv to protest what we   re see    e would pass   we   d have anoth fomc meet  and we would make an adjust to the framework   but i think this is an extrem remot possibl
first vice presid cum
i think that  if we see the risk of institut factor  like the way the prime rate is link to rate  realli get in the way of good polici  we have an oblig to work with the bank communiti  work with other regul if necessari  and work with the sec if necessari to clear those institut obstacl   so i wouldn   t let the institut thing be someth that get in our way  rather they would be someth that we can realli help overcom where we see problem   that link could be chang  and we may want to work activ with the bank communiti to make sure that it happen
no  clear the bank are not requir to move their prime rate with anyth in particular
of cours   they can alway have their markup  but you can also revers the argument and say  so whi do you want to cut rate   again  i think we   re push on a string here  mr  chairman   forgiv me for speak  but the gut of what we   re do and the import of what we   re do  which i fulli support  are in paragraph    and i believ we   re distract from that by focus on the fed fund rate
i agre with what you   re say about the import part  but it is nevertheless the case that   as presid   point out   if we want to  we could rais the fund rate if we put on enough pressur   therefor  in an import sens a decis is be made here to end this particular polici approach and to move clear to anoth one with the word    the focus of the committe   s polici go forward will be    and that is describ in a lengthi paragraph   i am just so concern about what will happen if we say we   re not go to target it  what   that mean   is it go to be   percent tomorrow   i just fear the confus   presid hoenig
in term of what we   re go to be speak about regard the new regim  i think it was easier when we had altern a and we were go to a new regim than when we   re say     well  okay  we   re go to end this regim here      i   m give this speech  i get question   we   re go to end this regim  and we   re go to go to this   so now i   m in the middl of a transit  and i   m tri to explain it  but other than     yes  we left this behind  and here we are go forward      so that   s my concern about the middl step here   i guess in your opinion it   s easier to explain go from    here   s the old regim  we   re go to stick to it for a littl while longer and then
no   today is the end of the old regim   we have hit zero  we can   t go further   go forward  this is what we   re go to do   i think that   s clearer   again  decemb                  of     i   m just concern about not say what we   re do with the fund rate   are we go to let it do whatev it want to do from today   i think that   s just go to creat volatil   again  i   m sorri for those who are in disagr
for what it   s worth  mr  chairman  i agre with you   i think the market will be more confus about altern a than altern b   if that   s import  then that should be part of the decis
but i ask you that dure the question period
i said substant we   re not go to conduct polici ani differ  but the market will be more confus about a than about b in term of have to process what this mean   now  it will get to the right answer eventu  but it will be more confus in term of process inform  in my opinion
i just want to underscor that  becaus that was my concern in move toward b rather than a becaus i certain agre that the econom substanc is the same   but i do think there   s much more of an opportun for misinterpret by the market  and for us to say that we don   t have control of the fed fund rate is the main concern that i have with a   i think b is veri clear   the idea of talk about a rang  includ zero  is someth that at least as far as i know the fed has never done befor  and i think that   s an enorm shift   that will be seen as a real shift  but to go to a would have ambigu and would be veri difficult to explain to peopl who are not real aficionado that we   re not say     gosh  we realli don   t have the opportun to fix the feder fund rate anymor   that piec is broken
i heard eleven peopl argu the case for altern a   i count them
most of them said it was pretti close  and it   s a matter of communic   it   s my judgment that we are just go to caus a lot of critic and a lot of decemb                  of     concern and confus if we do it now   i also agre that it   s fair close   but my feel is that the concern of clariti is more import to me   other   would you call the roll  pleas
mr  chairman

the direct would stand as we   ve written it  with the addit sentenc at the end

the board meet  mr  chairman
the board meet is adjourn   hold on   the board will go into my offic   everyon els  lunch   we will take a half hour break  and then we have just a few short item afterward to complet   okay   thank you  decemb                  of      lunch break
let   s reconven briefli for a coupl of other item   on consider  in order to maintain a unit front with the committe  presid   chang his vote to vote    yes    on the resolut   we have two item   first  governor kohn is go to talk a bit about our longer term project  and then we would like just to hear a bit from bill   and pat parkinson about the talf   we have had sever previous brief on this  but we will updat this and talk a bit about it implic for balanc sheet manag   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   you should have gotten memo from the subcommitte on communic have to do with the longer term project   in consid the trial run and also the current situat  in which the               and       project realli weren   t settl down and didn   t look as though they would soon settl down into what would be consist with where we would want thing to be in the long term   in these circumst  the subcommitte thought it would be a good idea to go ahead with a quarter extens of the project to give the public a better idea of where we thought output  growth  employ  and inflat were expect to be over the longer run  we made four recommend within that overal recommend   we recommend that we do it quarter  not just onc a year  and that the discuss be integr with the rest of the quarter project process in the summari of econom project   we also recommend that we continu to do this for total pce inflat but  as we did in the trial run  not do it for core pce to emphas to the public that it was the total we were look at over the long run and not the core   we thought that the questionnair should ask each particip to provid    your best assess of the rate to which each variabl would converg over the longer decemb                  of     term  say  five to six year from now  in the absenc of shock and assum appropri monetari polici      this would be someth that didn   t emphas the fact that it was five or six year but where thing would settl down and it might take five or six year to settl down   so those are our recommend   did i miss anyth   i   m look at the subcommitte member  after today   s and ye day   s discuss  i think the subcommitte will also take anoth look at whether the committe should move further in the direct of an inflat target and get some materi to the committe befor the januari meet   i think we are not look for a vote on this today  but if anybodi has ani view about whether this is the appropri direct in which to go  i would like to hear them
i think the subcommitte ought to consid whether  if the committe adopt a   percent or whatev inflat object  it might be more confus than clarifi for us to also be issu these long rang converg project   my first cut at think this through   i haven   t given this a lot of thought   is that  if we are go to say our target is x  i don   t see whi we would even need these
this is whi they need to look at it now becaus i think they realli are substitut
yes  i think they are substitut
you might still need the output and unemploy
what for   we don   t control   well  you know that   sorri
ani other comment or question
i guess  given the zero lower bound issu that we have been discuss and some of the consequ of be there  the difficulti of deal with polici in that environ  in previous meet on this topic we have talk about the prospect of specifi the fund rate path or the rang of the fund rate path of committe member and their project   it was suggest earlier that  had we done that previous  we might be in a posit to signal to the market more about our commit to inflat or someth like that   so i guess what i   m say  in the context of both inflat target and it project  give that a second round of thought  in term of how it might fit in with that  would be use under some circumst
okay   anyon els   all right   let me turn to bill  who veri kind learn that he was on the program about fifteen hour ago
it is better than the  e i found out i had to discuss a stiglitz paper in grad school about    hour ahead of  e   that was harder   i read the stiglitz paper three  e  and then i start to understand it    laughter   what i thought i would do  if i could  is invert the order and start with the balanc sheet issu and then go into the talf becaus i think that there is a broader question of our exit from all our liquid program   that is a veri legi  issu   you can imagin a circumst that some  in the futur we still have an inflat balanc sheet  and we actual want to rais the feder fund rate target   the question is  would we be abl to do so   the good news  of cours  is that a lot of our facil are go to go away pretti natur   the swap  the cpff  and the taf   we may have to give it a bit of a nudg  but those program should downsiz pretti automat   even after that  we are still go to have on our book a lot more agenc debt and a lot more agenc mortgag back secur   we   re go to have loan outstand that are associ with bear stearn and aig   we are go to have longer term treasuri  we have potenti a veri larg fund oblig to citigroup  if it loss go through the fdic and tarp money   then  of cours  the talf could also still be on our balanc sheet  depend on what the term of those talf loan are   i am go to come back to that a littl later   general  i am not worri about our abil to rais the level of interest rate  even if our balanc sheet is still inflat at the  e  for a number of reason   first  i think the interest rate on excess reserv   work  just not quit as well as we had decemb                  of     hope   the gap between the interest on excess reserv and the effect fund rate has been run in the    to    basi point rang   that mean that  if we were to rais the interest rate on excess reserv  we would rais the whole complex of interest rate  includ the effect fed fund rate   the gap is as larg as it is becaus  when balanc sheet capac is scarc  peopl have to be paid to use their balanc sheet to arbitrag that differ   but i think that gap today is pretti stabl  and we can expect that  as the balanc sheet return to a more normal condit  over  e that gap might actual narrow as peopl say     well  gee  i have more balanc sheet capac to do this arbitrag      so that would be point number     point number   is that we can probabl take activ step that reduc the cost of that arbitrag to bank today   we can limit the gses in term of their fed fund sale  and we can also reduc the balanc sheet consequ of the arbitrag by potenti remov those purchas from the leverag ratio  give them a littl regulatori relief  which actual make some sens becaus there is realli no risk to a bank that is buy fed fund from anoth bank and put them on deposit with the fed  there is no interest rate risk overnight   so that is someth that we might want to consid   anoth thing that i think is import to recogn is that there may be other mean of address our excess reserv problem   the first point is that interest on excess reserv is probabl good enough to do a reason  if somewhat sloppi  job in push up interest rate   in addit to that  we have other way of address excess reserv in the system   we have the abil to chang our monetari polici framework   we had a meet earlier this year in which we discuss some of the potenti place we might want to go   to drain excess reserv  if we decid that was necessari to get better control of the feder fund rate  we could do revers repo with a broader set of counterparti  like money market mutual fund   we could do that use the agenc debt on our balanc sheet and use the treasuri debt on our balanc sheet  and we could probabl do that in size  sinc the money market fund would be veri happi to be our counterpart   second  we could also chang the monetari framework in a more radic way  one can imagin a system by which we set voluntari reserv target for bank at pretti high level  where the rate they got if they were abov the target drop off consider and the rate they got below the target drop off consider   so we could basic give the bank incent to hold the amount of their excess reserv that actual are in the bank system   third  the treasuri could help us  as it was help us for a while   the sfp bill actual did work   the problem was that  as the treasuri   s borrow need skyrocket  it start to worri about run into the debt limit   what actual happen   it was a polit issu   it didn   t want to notifi the congress    day ahead of  e that it might hit the debt limit  and that is realli whi it start back away from the sfps   now  we could resolv this in a coupl of differ way   one  if the debt limit were rais enough  you would have plenti of room   or you could decemb                  of     potenti exempt the sfps from the debt limit  and you could argu that do so make sens becaus there is debt here and there is cash on the feder reserv balanc sheet  so no real net debt is creat   last  you could gain legisl author to issu fed bill  which i think is actual a littl more radic step   but the attract of that  of cours  is then we have complet control over our destini  and you don   t have the mush togeth of church and state  where we are at least somewhat depend on the treasuri for manag our monetari polici   so the bottom line for me is that i don   t think we should be concern about the larg size of our balanc sheet constrain our abil to manag our interest rate polici go forward   that should not be a driver of what we decid about our liquid facil   so whi is this import   well  the talf  just to recap  is a program in which we would basic lend fund against aaa rate consum asset back secur on a nonrecours basi to basic anyon   not quit anyon  not foreign  but pretti much anyon who want to do it   and we would conduct these transact through the dealer communiti   in the talf program we would be offer three thing to investor   first  they would be offer more leverag than they can get today becaus the haircut that we would put on the secur would not be the    percent type of haircut that the market is put in place today   they might be    percent     percent  or    percent   we are still negoti  determin that   so investor could get a lot more leverag than they can get today   the second thing that would be offer is protect against tail risk  and that is someth that investor veri definit can   t get today   becaus the loan would be nonrecours  the investor could lose onli the amount of the haircut  and that is realli import in a world where price are veri volatil   so that would signific reduc the mark to market risk of invest in the secur from the perspect of investor   final  probabl the most import thing  we would be provid term fund   peopl could buy these secur  which are of relat long durat   it depend on what secur you are look at  but the secur probabl rang in durat from two year to seven or eight year  if you are look at student loan   so this facil would not work if the term were veri  veri short   we have been in the process of go out and talk quit extens to issuer and investor over the past coupl of week   the board staff has been involv   the new york fed staff has been involv   basic what we found out is that they like the program   the leverag is not quit as import as we thought   they said they could live with less leverag rather than more leverag   they like the protect against the tail risk   the nonrecours natur of the loan  of cours  is veri attract  but the main thing on which they focus and that they said was most import for the success of the program was the length of the term of the loan   when we went forward with the initi term sheet  we were talk about a one year term  and the investor have come back quit forc and said that a one year term is not suffici   the program will not work with a one year term   now  mayb they are exagger the degre to which it wouldn   t work  but it   seem fair credibl decemb                  of     that there is no reassur that one year from now we are go to be complet out of the situat that we are in today   so  certain  it is complet legi  to be worri as an investor about the rollov risk one year from now  given that these are asset of longer durat   where i come out on all of this is that i think we realli do need to be attent to that concern  and we should tri to make the term of the talf loan as long as possibl  subject to protect the fed  obvious  from credit loss   if we were to make it short term  i think there is a high probabl that the program would fail   i think that would be a huge blow to our credibl   up to now we have done pretti well in wheel out program that have done what we said they were go to do   i think this is a particular import program becaus of it abil to be expand in multipl direct   the treasuri is veri  veri interest in this program as a way of use tarp capit effici   so to wheel this out on term that are too short and that make the program unattract would be veri  veri damag to our credibl  my view is that we should be will to offer these loan at term   i would favor three year   i think if we do that  this program will be success   obvious  if we do that  we are go to have more balanc on our book   this program was origin conceiv of as about a      billion program   that is probabl as big as it would get for consum ab  but obvious  if we expand it to cmbs and other thing  it could be consider larger than that   so that is sort of where we are   pat  do you have anyth you want to add
no  i don   t think so   again  i think the messag  as bill is say  from the investor and the issuer was that a three year term would great enhanc the chanc of success   inde  i think our friend in the treasuri depart  at least in the case of govern guarante loan  would like to go even longer than that   but both the board staff and the new york staff thought that it would work best at three year
three year get you far enough along that reason peopl will believ that three year from now you might actual be abl to get privat sector financ for this stuff
i am go to need to consult on an inform basi with the other board member on this   but in the spirit of our discuss ye day  i invit question or comment  which will inform our think on this as well     anyon have ani question or thought on this   presid
you said that investor who bought this and put this and got the lend would have the haircut at risk  right
they would get all of the upsid
so if spread close in the marketplac  then they get the upsid   so we are essenti lend to them to make a leverag bet on the secur
the purpos of this facil is not to give investor profit   the purpos of this facil is to address the fact that lend spread on aaa rate secur are extrem wide right now and the securit market is close   the idea is that  if you offer more attract term than those avail in the market  the demand for these secur will increas  issuer will be abl to sell these secur at better price and lower spread  and the consequ of that will be lower lend rate and improv credit avail to household  the goal at the end of the day is not to do anyth for investor   the goal is to har investor    profit motiv to drive down spread in the aaa market
i understand   now  whi are spread high
our view is that spread are high main becaus peopl can   t get leverag   that is number     number    the tradit buyer of these aaa rate asset either have disappear complet  like siv and bank conduit  or have balanc sheet constraint   so the risk capit hasn   t realli been will to come in becaus they can   t get the financ to make it worth their while   you know  libor plus     is not an attract proposit for someon who is use capit on an unleverag basi
when i think about leverag and the demand for a given secur  if i  as an investor  am go to make a leverag purchas  then whoever is give me a loan to make that is also take a risk posit in the secur   so the demand that leverag investor make is realli a joint demand by them and the lender   everyth you have said sound as if demand is low   am i miss someth here
the demand is low for these secur today   it is low becaus of lack of leverag
in other word  i   m say that peopl who would provid fund also have a low demand or a low evalu of the valu of those secur   this all amount to a bunch of peopl out there put a low valu on these secur
no  i don   t think that is quit right   we are in basic a market disequilibrium  where the tradit buyer of these secur have vanish   in a normal market environ  it would be complet reason to lend against these secur on a leverag basi   but the peopl who would do that lend   bank and dealer   are balanc sheet constrain  and that is whi they are not will to make those loan   if we had a normal bank and dealer situat today in which they were will to extend loan to their counterparti  they would be provid the leverag   but that is just not happen
do you mean they are not make purchas   they still exist   right    you said buyer vanish
the lender  i think he was say   some of the buyer vanish in the sens that they were siv or a lot of them were actual secur lender who were reinvest their cash collater in this  and they have learn a lesson about do that
what evid do you have that their absenc from the market  sn   t reflect just advers view about the valu of the secur that we should treat the way we treat all other secur evalu decis that market particip make
well  i think the counterfactu is what the investor tell us   they tell us that that is not the case
well  wait   these are the one who would be aid by this program  right
if you look at aaa rate asset  the histor credit risk on these asset is veri  veri low
over the cycl or in a recess
ye day we talk about aaa tranch of student loan  which are    percent back by the depart of educ   they are sell at libor plus     or libor plus       it is hard to say that those secur are price there becaus of credit risk
what would a secur like that have sold for in      or
i would be veri surpris if you saw anyth similar to what we are see today
well  they didn   t exist them  so we can   t look it up  for one   so how do we know these are out of bound with what they would have trade at
this is all a judgment call   we have been make lot of judgment call
yes  i know   but you are not give us ani evid about this  bill  you are not bring anyth coher that is
there is an ongo discuss about whether price in market are in some sens pareto op  price or whether there is liquid risk  other premium  that the central bank could do someth about   i don   t know ani way to resolv it  we have the same discuss each  e   presid hoenig
all right   so we are go to give them a three year term to give them assur that they don   t have to worri about roll over   i am assum that  as the market improv   and it should over the next year or    month   this would be almost self liquid becaus it would then becom attract to these parti to leav now and that would be take it off our balanc sheet   is that the oper assumpt
well  it realli depend on what rate we are charg for the loan  presum we are go to charg for the loan at a rate that is attract in  e of extremi and somewhat expens in normal  e   so the question realli is  will the market financ improv quick enough to make the market a cheaper sourc of fund   i don   t think we can count on all of these loan go away befor the end of the term   i think we have to presum that the term could actual be three year becaus we just don   t know whether the financ will be avail from the privat sector sooner
that put us at risk of take a loss  then  if we should decid to revers the polici action
but we could acceler that process by rais the minimum rate at which we would lend and so make it a higher spread abov libor   if we are go to do it through an auction   there are still some question about how to alloc the credit within this program   and if there is a minimum rate at which we would make fund avail in the auction  that would be the decemb                  of     spread over libor  and we adjust that spread upward  we   re give them more of a push to go back to reli on market financ
that would be the ideal   to push them back out as quick as possibl when the market straighten out
well  i think the idea would be that the window for this program would not be three year   it would be a shorter period of  e   so the program would come to an end by the end of      perhap  but the loan that we had made dure that period could be outstand for some  e beyond that
but we   re talk about a lot of asset on our book
the other thing that we should talk a bit about is credit risk to the fed in all of this   i think the import thing to recogn here is that the credit risk to the fed is quit low becaus the feder reserv is protect by two thing   one  it is protect by the haircut   the fed   s risk is a credit risk not a mark to market risk   two  the fed is also protect by the tarp money   the way this will work is that  to the extent that peopl put secur to us  we take those secur and we place them in a disposit spv  special purpos vehicl  that   s capit by tarp money   we   ve been do a lot of work recent about how riski these asset are and what the risk of loss is to the fed   it turn out that it   s veri hard to generat scenario in which the fed has ani meaning risk of loss
i have no problem with that   what i   m think about is  if we do defin a new regim  how we conduct polici   how are we tie ourselv down now relat to what we might want to do in the futur in move these asset on and off our balanc sheet   i think that the more flexibl we have in move them out  the more flexibl we have in ani new regim we put forward  and to me that   s import
governor kohn  did you have a comment
a comment and a question   one comment  to follow up on your comment  mr  chairman  to presid     i think there   s pretti good evid that there are liquid strain in the market  beyond just credit strain  imping on the price of these secur   one piec of evid i would cite is the differ between on the run and the off the run treasuri secur rate  which have gap out by    or    basi point even from   well  i   m not even sure where they are relat to        but i think they   re at record level   the unwilling of peopl   by    peopl    i mean market maker   to take posit and to do trade   their caution   is affect the price of all kind of secur well beyond the credit risk  and obvious there   s no differ in the credit risk in on the run and off the run treasuri secur
cash bond versus deriv  for exampl
right   the point that bill made ye day was that the equival thing are sell at veri differ rate and no one is do the arbitrag   second  i like the model that bill just describ in which the feder reserv suppli liquid but the privat sector plus the treasuri take the credit risk   i think that put us in the right place and put the taxpay in the right place   so i think it   s a good idea to get this thing work and look for other opportun to use it with the agreement of the treasuri   we can   t do it by ourselv  my question are that i thought we had some feedback along two line i   d like to hear your comment on   one is that aaa wasn   t enough  that when we start this we thought do just aaa tranch would restart the market   so comment on that   the other question is about the nonleverag purchas of this paper   we   re not realli cater to them  and will it be success soon
okay   on the aaa   it is realli for specif class   i think we   ve heard that somehow the aaa would not be suffici most from the auto loan area   it   s hard to judg how credibl that is  given that the aaa is the big bulk of the capit structur   so if you   re get good financ for most of the capit structur  it   s hard to believ that you can   t pay peopl at the bottom of the capit structur a high enough rate to induc them to do that   so i think i   m a littl skeptic that this is true   i think that this program will be success even if we confin it to just aaa
even of those who are say that today they   re have troubl not onli place the aaa but also place the other tranch  a number say that  if you could start price the aaa tranch  that would make place the other a lot easier   basic you   d be determin how much of the spread incom from the under asset has to go to the aaa  and that tell you how much you have left to compens the lower rate
you can figur out the econom better onc you know how much you have to pay for that    percent of the capit structur
on the nonleverag
i don   t think this program address the nonleverag  but i think there   s not much nonleverag interest in this sector at this point
well  that   s the fundament problem   again  some of them were these class of investor  who are no longer around   even if they were around  i don   t think we   d want them around   the siv and secur lender et cetera   but then you have the pension fund  the insur compani  and so forth that are not in the market  and this realli  sn   t do anyth at least initi to bring them back to the market   we have scratch our head at some length tri to figur out a program that the feder reserv could develop that would entic them into decemb                  of     the market   but i think the fundament problem is that our tool is the abil to lend  and if we   re lend  there has to be a borrow   if you   re talk about pension fund or life insur compani that are not leverag investor  it   s just not clear how we can do much to help them get enthusiast again about buy these secur   in the longer run  the agenda of provid liquid to market has to be join with the reform agenda and figur out what we can do to bring back confid in structur credit product by those type of investor   there are lot of recommend out there   from the presid   s work group and the financi stabil forum   and sifma came out with a long studi about restor confid in the securit market   all of that  unfortun  is go to take a while to implement  and as with so mani other thing these day  we   re in unchart territori   nobodi know for sure  i think  whether ani of those thing  even though they make sens  will realli be suffici to bring those investor back  but as much as we tri to come up with program to address that  it seem at the moment to be beyond our power
may i add just one thing to that   it   s also not clear to me that the privat sector won   t be clever enough to take these thing and packag them into secur that have the equiti and the leverag embed in them and sell them to peopl who want to get high rate of return   it might be a pretti interest proposit
so are there ani other constraint of a legal or regulatori natur on particip in this market   is there anyth that keep ani hedg fund in the world from buy these thing
yes  we   re still work on
no  no  no  not the program   the under secur
in general   anyon could buy them  right
the issuer have to basic conform with the tarp execut comp restrict
no  no  no   even not particip in the program   there are no limit on the investor who can particip  for exampl  in the market for asset back student loan
well  there is in this program  in that we   re tri to figur out the right way of restrict it to u s  investor
excus me   the program  sn   t exist yet   right now  today  is there anyth that restrict a hedg fund in london from buy an asset back secur
i don   t think so   not that i   m awar of
the reason i ask   the point that i   m make   is that you can refer theori but  at the end of the day  it   s not just those predict   it   s the whole rang of thing about the theori   we haven   t  in this  seen mani theori put on the tabl  and the one that have been   thing like cash in the market price   just don   t seem to match up well with the fact  there   s a gigant  billion of dollar worth of investor out there who have the capabl of buy ani of this stuff   in treasuri  peopl are capabl of arbitrag that on the run and off the run thing   to explain this by appeal to some market segment seem realli weak in this environ   you know  i welcom discuss theori under which these are pareto improv program  but i haven   t seen one that   s convinc yet
i think it come back to the point that bill made earlier   if you   re a hedg fund  even libor plus     is still not a rich enough return to that hedg fund unless you can borrow against those secur and leverag it up into a higher return   and until    month ago you could have gotten the financ from deutsch bank  the swiss bank  or ani of our fine u s  bank  but it  sn   t appear at the moment that ani of them are terribl interest in lend on a secur basi even to the strongest of hedg fund   they   re simpli hide somewher
i think we   re in disequilibrium   we   re in a disequilibrium in which the dealer and bank that use to do this lend are in the process of dramat shrink their balanc sheet   goldman announc their fourth quarter today   they shrank their balanc sheet by    percent from the end of their third quarter to the end of their fourth quarter   that   s certain not ani notion of equilibrium in the marketplac  and i think that is what   s caus the stress in the secur market
are we prevent equilibr   i mean  what are we do   we   re in the middl of an adjust process  it take some  e
the way i look at it  presid    is that the deleverag process is happen at a veri rapid rate  and that speed can caus quit a bit of damag to financi condit and  therefor  to the real economi   to the extent that we interven and slow down the pace of that deleverag  we can probabl mitig the degre of damag to financi condit and to the real economi   that   s how i think about it
i look forward to see the model
we   re bridg
we   re bridg   exact
presid    i guess there are at least a coupl of theori you could have   one of them has to do with capit   if you think that certain type of intermediari have special knowledg and their abil to lend depend on their capit  then there are inform asymmetri in which clear exogen destruct of part of that capit is go to affect equilibrium outcom in the market   that   s one possibl   the other class of model has to do with liquid  where you have thick or thin market depend on    i trade if you trade    and so on and you have market in which nobodi is trade and so no one want to be the first to enter   by becom a marketmak  you can perhap generat more activ    i think there are some interest perspect out there
i   m familiar with those model   we don   t have  e to discuss them now
no  we should discuss them off line   presid
the loss of the securit market is realli import  so i think this facil is a veri import innov   my question is  how import were the conduit to this market  and how confid are we that there will be structur to bring back the securit market   or are we basic bridg to these thing go on bank balanc sheet or other type of financi intermediari   how do you see this   i guess the question is  from your perspect  what is this a bridg to
i think the conduit were more import in some asset class than other   in credit card  for exampl  the conduit were pretti import   but even there they were import in recent year   i think they were import in recent year becaus spread kept on come down and down and deter the real money investor that tradit invest in these product   they were no longer interest   yet the underwrit were abl to keep the game go at those low spread by resort to sell to conduit and secur lender and those sort of thing  decemb                  of     so over  e  if we could deal with some of the issu around confid and rate and the other thing that may be deter the real money investor from enter the market  there is a hope of bring them back and go back not to       when it was conduit and that kind of stuff  but to  say        when you had real money investor buy these secur
also how you go through the cycl and what the loss experi on these secur are go to be are huge import   if this is the worst recess in    year  that   s go to be a veri interest data point in term of what the credit loss on the secur are   if it turn out that the credit loss are low and the secur are robust  i think that will creat more demand for these secur over  e   you have to weigh that  of cours  in term of what leverag we are go to requir financi institut to carri and how leverag they can be  and where we set those two standard will determin what goe through the capit market versus what goe through depositori institut
do we have in mind a limit as to how broad we would make the credit facil avail
current we have the class of secur   we   re look at consum and small busi ab
the treasuri has basic commit     billion of tarp  and we think that   s go to fund a program of rough      billion of credit card and auto loan and so on
i ask that question becaus there are some veri import industri compani that have been financ at fair attract rate and are now go to have to refin that at far less attract rate   i think that will have everi bit as signific an impact on the decemb                  of     economi as the mortgag back secur   so unless we think through how we limit this  i think there   s a legi  case for just about anyth
well  i   m sympathet with your view that broader is better than narrow becaus of all the boundari issu that one creat   i think we all are sympathet with that
for exampl  would you consid aaa industri grade credit
i think we would consid it   the real issu is the treasuri   s willing to use tarp money   we can   t do ani of this without the treasuri   s commit  so we   re somewhat constrain in our abil to broaden it in the dimens that we might want to broaden it
we   ve heard from practic everyon that   s not within the class of consum ab and sba loan   we have heard from the commerci real estat peopl and from the auto dealer about their floor plan loan  we have heard from the bank that would like to get the motorcycl and leas   but also corpor loan   the clo  collater loan oblig  market also is shut down   so there is no question   again  we   re in a hard place becaus  if we weren   t constrain in part by the tarp capit and our concern about our balanc sheet  we would mayb be abl to have a much broader program in which we didn   t have to make these kind of decis  but given that there   s onli     billion of tarp capit and we   re will at this point to go onli to      billion  you can   t realli say we   ll take all these differ asset class
which make my point   we realli have to focus on fix the intermediari process in the unit state   there   s no limit to this   the refinanc come due are huge
that   s agre and understood   again  the limit includ the tarp capit  our own willing with respect to the balanc sheet  and so on   there realli are limit to what this can accomplish   presid
but in some sens  just to follow up on this point  the limit are what is realli import here becaus  as long as we don   t defin some limit and we just say limit by tarp capit  well  that  sn   t realli answer the question   as long as the market act as if we or someon els is go to step in and rescu them from ani more lend arrang they happen to be face  the incent for the intermediari system to repair itself or to gradual adjust are go to be limit   i   m worri about the lack of definit about what constitut a legi  market or instrument or firm that we wouldn   t save
that   s a good point  and i think one thing that is a problem now is the transit between administr   we   ll soon have a new treasuri secretari and a new administr   i think it   s veri import   i   ve discuss this with     and other   that as soon as possibl we lay out a broad strategi   what are the compon of our strategi   what are we go to do go forward
and what are the limit to it
well  implicit  what are the limit to it   how are we go to approach the bank issu   what are we go to do about fail firm   how are we go to tri to address the securit market   i think the more clariti we can provid   i fulli agre with the critiqu that lurch is veri bad  and we need to provid an overview   there is a lot of sympathi from the new treasuri to do that  and we just have to overcom the fact that we   re in a transit at the moment   but i take that point   it   s a veri good point
by the way  mr  chairman  i want to thank you   i thought your exchang of letter with senat dodd  i guess it was  over the automobil issu was well done
i don   t think you read it  though    laughter
excus me  i read about it
other question for bill
i just want to rais two thing that worri me   one is that  when these program are small  you subsid x percent of the credit market   the other   minus x percent  the effect on their rate of return  their borrow cost  probabl is small   but when x get near   i don   t know where it is now      or     then our subsid is rais borrow cost for everyon who  sn   t get money
it   s not clear   the commerci paper market might be a counter exampl to that
there are some model in which that is the case   it   s not obvious how we rule them out   the second thing is   i don   t know how you evalu this   you must be think whether this mean that in everi moder size recess henceforth we   ll view the feder reserv   s best polici as extend
it   s not a moder recess  and it   s not a normal financi downturn
right   everi recess of the size we   ve now seen   of in the last    year  so everi recess of that size
you have to have a deep recess and a financi crisi  that   s pretti unusu   twice a centuri  or onc a centuri so far
i   ll give you an exampl   the vix has never been this elev this long sinc the great depress
so you   re say that you   re not concern about set up expect for the next recess
certain i   m concern   i   m veri concern   but i   m also concern about get through this recess   so those are the tradeoff
other question about the program   if not  let me just tell you that i   m go to be do a call with the press at      in the special librari   ani fomc member who has noth els to do and would like to join is welcom   michell has given your public affair peopl the phone number so that they can listen in  and we   ll see how that goe   the next meet is tuesday wednesday  januari         the meet is adjourn   thank you  end of meet decemb                  of
