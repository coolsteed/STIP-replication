good afternoon  everybodi   i have a welcom for sandi   pianalto   sinc she will not offici be a reserv bank presid for a number of day  we will put your welcom in escrow  and you may withdraw it at the appropri  e
as you all know  this is the organiz meet for the year   accord  i will turn the proceed over to governor
thank you veri much   as all of you know  mayb with the except of sandi  the reason i have the floor now is to organ the elect of a chairman and a vice chairman of this committe to serv until our first meet of        so  let me open the floor for nomin for the posit of chairman and vice chairman of the fomc   don kohn
governor    as the speaker of the hous will say tonight  i have the great privileg and high honor of nomin alan  span to be chairman and   j    to be vice chairman of this committe
all right  those sound like two credibl nomine    laughter   are there ani other nomin   assum not  could i have a vote   all in favor say    aye     all   aye
sound as if it   s unanim   congratul yet again to you both
the next item on the agenda  if i can find it  should be the vote for our staff offic   do you have the list to read
yes  mr  chairman                                        reinhart normand bernard michell smith gari gillum   mat thoma baxter    son     secretari and economist deputi secretari  assist secretari     general counsel  deputi general counsel   economist     associ economist  from the board             from the reserv bank propos by presid    christin cum robert eisenbei propos by presid guynn marvin goodfriend propos by presid broaddus propos by presid     hunter   judd  propos by presid parri thoma connor   howard     charl struckmey
without object  so be it   would somebodi like to      move the select of the feder reserv bank of new york to execut transact for the system open market account
i   ll move the select of the feder reserv bank of new york
second    laughter
conflict of interest
mayb for the record somebodi els should second the motion  sever   i   ll second
i appreci the revis   approv without object   i would assum and hope that there is no object to the incumb manag of the system open market account  dino kos  continu in that posit   without object   thank you veri much  mr  kos  would you quick review your memorandum on the author for domest open market oper  the author for foreign currenc oper  the foreign currenc direct  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper
thank you  mr  chairman   as this was the organiz meet i thought i would propos a coupl of housekeep item for the domest author and the    guidelin    for oper in feder agenc issu  which go along with the author   i would just say a few word on each  i am propos that the committe approv the author for domest open market oper with one amend   the amend has to do with the minimum lend fee for our secur lend program   when the committe first approv this minimum lend fee  it was set at   percent   that was a reason number given that interest rate were then far higher  with interest rate where they are today  there is the risk that if the general collater rate goe below   percent or if the committe at some point should choos to lower interest rate to   percent or less  that would then effect shut down the secur lend facil   if there were some kind of disrupt or otherwis a need for us to lend secur  it would not make econom sens for anybodi to borrow at a negat interest rate   so the propos that i am make is for the committe to provid that the manag would have discret to set the rate depend on the circumst   have said that  i must tell you that i have no intent of actual chang the rate any  soon if the committe should approv the amend   but  again  this amend would give the manag discret to act if need be   the object would stay the same   that is  the program would remain a secondari sourc for borrow secur and a rather temporari sourc   i   d be happi to answer ani question on this propos
question   if not  would somebodi like to move it
move approv  mr  chairman
this is the domest author  right
it   s realli a necessari technic correct
ani object   given no object  it is approv
thank you   the second item has to do with the guidelin for the conduct of system oper in feder agenc issu   in august       the committe suspend four paragraph of these guidelin   prior to that action  the guidelin had not been amend sinc        in that year  agenc issu were a larg and actual grow portion of the system open market account   by       agenc were   percent of soma hold   sinc then  that number has been come down  first becaus we stop buy agenc and then becaus sinc the mid     s we have allow them to roll off at matur   but as we expand the collater that we take at the desk  a coupl of the provis in the guidelin got in the way   inadvert  i think    of our accept ginni mae secur as collater   so we had the odd case in which we were abl to take mortgag back secur guarante by govern sponsor enterpris but not by ginni mae  in       the committe took sever step to deal with potenti liquid strain in money and financ market in the period around the centuri date chang   one such step was to broaden the rang of accept collater for repo   the way the committe did that was to suspend temporarili   until april            paragraph   to   of the guidelin   everi year sinc then the committe has extend the suspens of those paragraph  sinc mortgag back secur have becom an almost routin part of system open market oper  rather than my come to you everi year and ask for anoth annual suspens i am propos that the committe repeal those four paragraph   given that agenc in the outright portion of the portfolio are de minimi now and actual will be at zero by the end of the year  this should have no materi effect   but it is a cleanup of the exist guidelin for the desk
this may sound a littl silli  but if we elimin paragraph   through    what are paragraph   and   do for you
well  you ask a good question   in fact  the propos brought to the committe in      was to repeal the entir set of guidelin   as i understand it  there was a view in the committe that the first two paragraph provid a sens of how the committe felt about feder agenc issu   retain those two paragraph didn   t constrain the desk at all   so  certain if the entir set of guidelin were repeal  that would be fine from my perspect  but it   s up to the committe whether it want to retain some sens of how it view agenc in this context
well  just as a matter of housekeep  i would suggest that when you review the author next  e   not this  e but next year   you might see if you could add a sentenc or two to the author that convey the sens of those two paragraph   if that could be put in the author  then we wouldn   t need the guidelin ani more   that   s just a suggest
further question on this issu   if not  would somebodi like to move approv
move approv of elimin paragraph   though   of the guidelin
is there a second
discuss   all in favor  sever   aye
oppos   approv without object
final  the third item is a propos to renew without amend the foreign currenc author  the foreign currenc direct  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper
i   m not go to make anoth speech about intervent  mr  chairman  but i guess i will respect do my tri annual    no    vote on the foreign currenc instrument   if anyth  i think we have obtain increas credibl in this committe  and i am even more strong against our take intervent action now than in the past   so  i thought i   d mention that
i   d mere like to state that we   ve had virtual no intervent   in fact i don   t recal ani   in the recent past   you may rememb that the issu had to do with the secretari of the treasuri and his willing to accept our general view as to how intervent work and it impact on market   that view has general been accept  appar for polit reason it cannot be accept fulli as an unequivoc direct becaus the state depart and other would like to hold it slight in abey   but as a practic matter i think the treasuri is do rather well in this area  and i trust that the incom secretari of the treasuri will hold veri much the same view   my suspicion is that he    would somebodi like to move approv
is there a second  sever   second
all in favor say    aye     sever   aye
you all receiv a memorandum on the program for secur of fomc inform     anybodi have ani question relev to that   if not  would somebodi like to move the revis
is there a second
without object   thank you veri much   we have a staff memorandum propos fomc rule chang that redefin a meet quorum  rescind the outdat emerg interim committe  and author the appoint of an interim manag in an emerg   these do not seem particular controversi   i wonder if anybodi had ani question or issu they   d like to rais or if we can go immedi to a motion   would somebodi like to make a motion then
without object   now we are back to the usual formal structur of our meet   i ask your approv of the minut for the meet of decemb
approv without object   we now go to an interest issu on which we   ve gotten a signific amount of brief materi   we will hear from messr  sack  tetlow  croushor  and rudebusch   mr  sack  would you start us off
yes   i am go to refer to the chart that were distribut   they don   t have a cover on them  but the word    smooth of the feder fund rate    are at the top of the first chart   for some  e  economist have note that monetari polici rate in major industri countri tend to chang onli gradual  a case in point is the intend feder fund rate  plot in the top panel of exhibit    as can be seen  the stanc of polici is typic adjust in sequenc of relat small step in the same direct   over the sampl shown  nine out of ten of the polici action move in the same direct as the previous chang   moreov  near all of the polici move in the sampl were    basi point or less   the smooth of the feder fund rate can be captur more formal by es  simpl monetari polici rule that measur the systemat respons of the polici instrument to key macroeconom variabl   an exampl is shown in the bottom left panel   in this equat  as in   taylor   s origin specif  the quarter averag level of the feder fund rate is assum to respond to the current output gap and the inflat rate over the previous year   howev  in this version we also allow the previous quarter   s feder fund rate to enter the equat   es  this rule use real  e data from      through       we find that the coeffici on the lag polici rate is strong signific and not far below uniti   a find that is common in the research literatur  this coeffici caus predict movement in the feder fund rate to be more inerti than otherwis
do you have an r ≤ on that   this is one case in which the lag depend variabl has polici implic
right  so the r ≤ is veri high   it   s        reflect that the lag depend variabl soak up a lot of the explanatori power     the materi use by messr  sack  tetlow  croushor  and rudebusch are append to this transcript  appendix
that mean that histor our decis have been almost right but not quit    laughter
one can also express the r ≤ in term of the model   s abil to predict interest rate chang instead of the level  and there it fall off a good degre   down to        so part of this  as you note  is that the level of the fund rate is veri predict
but we don   t like to be predict
that mean our valu ad is         laughter
of cours  simpl rule such as this one provid onli a rough descript of actual polici decis  and it would not be surpris if the paramet of these rule would chang over  e   one possibl incid of this is hint at by the eas of       highlight in the bottom right panel  which was more rapid than would have been expect under the polici rule es  through        this episod bring into sharper focus the question of the appropri speed of adjust for monetari polici  which is the topic of this brief   more specif  we investig whether gradual movement in the feder fund rate are desir in term of achiev the macroeconom object of the feder reserv   maximum sustain employ and price stabil   as summar in the top panel of exhibit    we consid the monetari polici rule that would be op  assum that the fomc desir to limit squar deviat of inflat from a target level and of the unemploy rate from it equilibrium level over all futur period   inflat and unemploy deviat are penal equal  and the target for core pce inflat is taken to be     percent   note that policymak do not have a direct prefer for smooth in the feder fund rate  the exercis also assum that frb us is the correct character of the economi   we can comput the polici that maxim the assum object of the fomc given that model  assum that the polici is requir to have the same form as the es  rule from the prior exhibit   as shown in the middl left panel  the coeffici of the calcul polici rule  which we will refer to as the    op     rule  differ consider from those of the es  rule   in particular  the op  rule is much more respons to current econom condit  as indic by the larger coeffici on inflat and the output gap  and is much less inerti  as indic by the smaller coeffici on the lag feder fund rate   we will focus on both of these characterist  sinc each of them would increas the volatil of the feder fund rate relat to the es  polici rule   the more aggress natur of the op  polici rule can be seen by look at it prescript for the path of the feder fund rate go forward  assum that the economi will be subject to the sequenc of shock impli by the  book project   as shown by the dot line in the middl right panel  the op  rule call for an immedi eas of polici to zero percent in order to boost output toward potenti more quick and then a substanti tighten over the second half of this year to unwind the accommod stanc of polici   by contrast  the path of the feder fund rate under the es  polici rule  the solid line  is much more stabl  the panel also show the policymak perfect foresight path that appear in the bluebook  the dash line label ppf    this path is comput from an exercis that is similar to the one just describ  but with two import differ   first  policymak are endow with more inform  includ knowledg of the sequenc of shock that will be hit the economi in the futur   second  policymak are assum to have a prefer for a smooth path of the feder fund rate   this latter assumpt import influenc the shape of the ppf path   if the smooth prefer were remov  the ppf polici would push the feder fund rate immedi to zero   thus  the ppf exercis also suggest that monetari polici should be much more aggress in the absenc of a prefer for smooth   at first glanc  it might seem surpris that the op  polici call for movement in the fund rate that are so much more aggress and volatil than those observ   as describ in the lower panel  these characterist of the op  rule hing on three key assumpt under this exercis   first  we assum that the privat sector continu to form it expect as if the fomc were follow it histor polici rule  even when the true polici differ consider   this assumpt impli that larg polici move have sizabl effect on the yield curv and on real activ  becaus privat agent do not expect those action to be quick revers   second  we assum that the fomc know the structur of the economi with certainti and in particular face no uncertainti about the impact of it polici action  no matter how drastic they are   third  we assum that the fomc is abl to observ the current state of the economi perfect  that is  there is no measur error in the macroeconom data or in policymak    es  of potenti output and other unobserv variabl   under these circumst  there is noth to prevent the central bank from push veri hard on the economi to achiev it object  henc the op  monetari polici respond aggress to macroeconom variabl and is quick to revers cours   but clear these three assumpt do not hold in practic  in the next three exhibit  we investig the implic of relax each assumpt in turn
as just note  the find that the feder fund rate should be veri aggress under the op  polici depend crucial on the manner in which privat agent form their expect  the subject of exhibit     the previous exercis assum that those expect are form under the belief that the fomc is follow it histor polici rule  even if that rule is chang go forward   in practic  privat agent are like to take into account chang in the way polici is implement   consid what happen when the privat sector understand the polici rule that the central bank is actual use   as summar in the top panel  if policymak are follow an inerti polici rule  privat agent will expect the initi respons of the feder fund rate to a macroeconom shock to be follow by addit polici chang in the same direct   moreov  those action will be expect to unwind onli gradual as the shock dissip   expect of this persist respons of polici will be incorpor into current asset price and econom decis  thus bring forward the effect of those futur polici action   as a result  an inerti polici respons can have an immedi and sizabl impact on econom variabl  even with relat small movement in the feder fund rate in each period   by contrast  the larg but transitori movement in the feder fund rate that were found to be op  in the previous exhibit will be less effect  becaus privat agent will recogn the chang in the polici rule and look through the near term swing in the interest rate   to illustr the import of this consider  we conduct an experi in which the public form it expect as a weight averag of forward  and backward look term   as the middl panel note  the degre of forward look behavior is govern by a singl paramet  ÔÜ   when ÔÜ equal zero  the model correspond to the version of frb us use in exhibit    in which expect are form use a    backward look    vector autoregress  var  model   when ÔÜ equal uniti  expect are ration   mean that household and firm fulli understand the structur of the model and the polici rule in form their expect   with this set up  we can calcul the op  polici rule for differ degre of forward look behavior   as shown in the bottom left panel  the op  coeffici on the lag feder fund rate move higher as the paramet ÔÜ increas   that is  the op  monetari polici rule becom more inerti when the public is forward look  sinc expect of futur polici action lead to larger and more persist movement in bond rate and other asset price that effect counterbal the persist effect of macroeconom disturb   note  howev  that the histor es  of the coeffici on the lag feder fund rate        is reach onli when expect are form in an almost complet forward look manner   the bottom right panel show the complet op  polici rule for three choic of the degre of forward look behavior   as just note  in the case in which ÔÜ equal uniti  the coeffici on the lag polici rate is quit high   even higher than that from the es  rule   nevertheless  the coeffici on the output gap and inflat are about three  e larger than their es  valu   thus  the op  rule still call for much more volatil movement in the feder fund rate than are observ   anoth possibl sourc of gradual in polici set is paramet uncertainti  the topic of exhibit     in the analysi so far  policymak have been assum to know the exact structur of the economi  uncertainti has enter onli through addit error term   to see the effect of this assumpt  consid the situat in the top left panel  which show the relationship between the output gap  plot on the horizont axi   and the real interest rate  r  relat to it equilibrium level  r   plot on the vertic axi    the solid line repres policymak    best es  of the level of the output gap that would be realiz at ani given set of the real interest rate   but becaus of an addit error term  the realiz outcom could lie abov or below the central es   as indic by the shade region   as note in the top right panel  the amount of uncertainti is not affect by the polici decis  for this reason  it turn out that addit uncertainti has no effect on the op  polici set   that is  policymak should ignor the uncertainti and set polici base on their best es  of the like outcom for macroeconom variabl   howev  this framework neglect the obvious fact that policymak face consider uncertainti about the valu of key paramet in their model of the economi   to see the implic of this type of uncertainti  suppos policymak are unsur of the valu of the polici multipli  as shown in the middl left panel  the policymak    best es  of the relationship again is repres by the solid line  but the actual slope of the relationship could be higher or lower   in those circumst  policymak face more uncertainti about the outcom for the output gap the further the real interest rate deviat from it equilibrium level  as indic by the shade region   as we note in the middl right panel  this exampl highlight the key implic of paramet uncertainti   that uncertainti about futur econom condit will be import affect by current monetari polici decis   a factor that policymak should take into account in formul those decis  under the object assum  policymak will tend to shade their polici action toward choic that reduc uncertainti about futur level of unemploy and inflat   of cours  the middl left panel present just one specif exampl of paramet uncertainti   mani other paramet are also unknown  in which case the varianc minim polici will not be to hold the real interest rate at it equilibrium level   in general  the effect of paramet uncertainti depend crucial on which paramet are unknown and on the varianc and covari of those paramet   unfortun  the complex of frb us make it difficult to incorpor paramet uncertainti direct into simul of that model   but we can quantifi the effect of paramet uncertainti use the simpler var model util to character expect in frb us   as summar in the bottom left panel  the var captur the dynam of key macroeconom variabl  includ inflat and the output gap   in addit  the var provid a conveni measur of paramet uncertainti   name  the varianc covari matrix of the es  coeffici  we can use this measur to assess the effect of paramet uncertainti on the op  monetari polici rule   the result are shown in the bottom right panel in two step   we first comput the op  polici rule that ignor paramet uncertainti by assum that the es  coeffici from the var are known with certainti   as shown in the first line of the tabl  the op  polici under those assumpt is much more aggress than the es  polici rule  as reflect in the larger coeffici on the output gap and inflat and the smaller coeffici on the lag polici rate   these find are qualit similar to those found earlier use the frb us model   howev  when we allow policymak to recogn that the coeffici of the var are uncertain  they choos a polici with smaller coeffici on inflat and the output gap and a larger coeffici on the lag interest rate   paramet uncertainti therefor move the op  rule in the direct of the es  rule  but it seem to fall well short of explain the observ degre of smooth in the feder fund rate
exhibit   address the issu that the macroeconom variabl use to formul real  e monetari polici decis are some  poor measur   there are two potenti import sourc of measur error   the first is that initi releas of key macroeconom data are imprecis and subject to revis   to quantifi the magnitud of such revis  we use a data set maintain by the feder reserv bank of philadelphia that record the valu of major macroeconom  e seri as they were avail to policymak at specif date in the past   the top left panel illustr this type of uncertainti by show the distribut of revis to the quarter growth rate of real output over the quarter follow the initi data releas for the period from      to        clear  revis can be substanti  as shown in the first line in the top right panel  the averag absolut size of this revis is about  Ö  percentag point of output   moreov  as indic in the remain line  subsequ revis can also be larg  in part reflect rebas and other methodolog chang   the revis to other nipa variabl show broad similar pattern   as note in the middl left panel  the second sourc of measur error aris becaus mani of the variabl that have promin role in our econom model are not direct observ and must instead be es    these variabl includ potenti output  expect inflat  and the equilibrium real interest rate  inevit  es  of these variabl are subject to signific error that can be high persist  given the substanti lag involv in detect import structur chang in the economi   these two sourc of measur error generat consider uncertainti about mani of the variabl that are integr to monetari polici decis   some of the strongest polici implic like come from error in the measur of the output gap  the dot line in the middl right panel show the staff   s real  e assess of the output gap sinc        that is  the es  of the contemporan output gap made at the  e shown   those es  differ consider from the staff   s current assess of the output gap for that period  the solid line   as indic in the inset  the real  e error impli by the differ between these two es  have a standard deviat of    percentag point of output and a high degre of serial correl   as summar in the bottom left panel  mismeasur of the output gap could  in principl  have no effect on polici  this would be the case if the real  e es  of the output gap were uncorrel with subsequ revis to that es   which might occur if the revis were base on inform not avail at the  e of the origin es    in practic  howev  that condit has not been met  and larg initi es  have often been revis to be smaller   under such circumst  the op  polici should attenu it respons to the real  e output gap measur  in order to reduc movement in the interest rate in respons to the nois in that measur   to quantifi the effect of measur error on monetari polici  we return to the frb us exercis from exhibit    onli now assum that the real  e es  of the output gap avail to the fomc contain a random error that has the same properti as those observ from      to        as the bottom right panel indic  measur error lead to some attenu of the polici respons to the measur output gap  the middl column    howev  that coeffici remain well abov it es  valu   moreov  the other coeffici of the polici rule  includ that on the lag polici rate  are larg unaffect   of cours  mismeasur of variabl other than the output gap might also have import polici implic that are not captur by this exercis  inde  some recent research suggest that incorpor uncertainti about the equilibrium real interest rate might result in further attenu and some addit inertia for the op  polici rule   the top panel of exhibit   summar our find  a simpl analysi of op  polici   one that use the backward look version of frb us and assum that uncertainti enter onli through addit shock   indic that monetari polici should move more forc in respons to chang in macroeconom variabl and be less inerti than observ on averag sinc the mid     s   we have investig the sensit of that conclus to three factor   forward look behavior  paramet uncertainti  and measur error   these factor move the op  polici in the direct of the es  polici rule  but none of the factor alon seem to fulli explain the observ smooth of the feder fund rate   an import caveat to this find is that we consid each of the factor separ  owe to the analyt difficulti involv in combin them   these factor like interact in way that could affect the desir degre of interest rate smooth   even with the extens consid  our analysi sure fail to captur import aspect of the policymak environ   for exampl  as note in the bottom left panel  policymak face consider uncertainti about the structur of the model itself   all model are approxim and therefor ignor specif variabl that could at  e becom relev for polici decis   also  the model we have use for this brief are essenti linear  wherea the economi may under some condit demonstr larg  discret respons to monetari polici or other event  policymak    concern about uncertainti may be exacerb by the fact that some of the op  polici rule consid call for larg swing in the feder fund rate that are well outsid of histor norm   the problem involv with signific nonlinear  for exampl  might be reflect in a concern by the fomc about financi fragil   such a concern could generat a smoother path for the feder fund rate if larg polici chang were view as have advers effect on the function of financi market  transcript of fomc meet show that member of the committe have at  e argu for smaller interest rate chang base on concern about financi fragil   the smooth of the feder fund rate could also result from various institut aspect of the policymak process  as summar in the bottom right panel   for exampl  the fact that polici decis are made by a committe  and thus requir build a consensus  could generat some inertia in realiz polici action  altern  the fomc might seek to avoid revers in the direct of the polici instrument   such an approach would presum involv sacrif some macroeconom perform  but it might be perceiv to have other benefit  such as allow committe member to more easili explain their polici choic to the public   judg from simul of the frb us model  revers would occur much more often under the op  polici rule than under the es  polici rule   overal  while no model can encompass all the issu that pertain to interest rate smooth  the analysi abov at least provid some benchmark against which to gaug the appropri pace of monetari polici adjust    becaus the observ polici is much smoother than would be prescrib by these benchmark  it is of interest to determin what aspect of our model or of our assum prefer may be misspecifi
were you plan to move to question and comment now
you can ask a question whenev you want to  mr  chairman   but our intent was to take question at the end of the present
i don   t know if     s present is a formal part of the preced one or whether there   s a discontinu
they are two separ present  but they are on the same topic
well  the reason i ask is that some of the issu that may come up may be address in your remark
yes  that is certain the case   that is whi we thought we   d run them all togeth  mr  chairman
my present is entitl    monetari polici inertia     and i will be refer to a handout that was distribut   base on monetari polici rule es  from quarter data  mani economist hold the view that the fed adjust monetari polici at a veri sluggish pace  specif  that it distribut desir chang in the fund rate over sever quarter   a behavior that is often term    monetari polici inertia      i will argu  instead  that there is essenti no polici inertia at a quarter frequenc and that  in fact  the fund rate typic is adjust fair prompt to econom develop   within a singl quarter anyway   in larg part  my argument is base on evid of a veri limit abil of financi market  for exampl  eurodollar futur or fed fund futur  to forecast the next few quarter chang in the fund rate   such evid is inform about polici inertia becaus ani partial polici adjust obvious mean that there is some remain portion of the polici action that is postpon to the futur and is thus predict  therefor  the absenc of fund rate predict impli the absenc of signific partial adjust by the fed   befor i flesh out this argument  howev  let me start on page   of the handout and delin two type of monetari polici inertia   these two type of inertia are often confus in the literatur  with discuss of one type often mistaken appli to the other  howev  the two type of polici inertia oper at veri differ horizon   first  there is veri short term polici inertia or interest rate smooth that i think   exist  but i won   t be discuss it in detail today   this short term or week to week partial adjust of the fund rate involv  for exampl  cut the fund rate by two    basi point move in fair quick success  rather than reduc the fund rate just onc by    basi point   this type of gradual or interest rate smooth was more preval in the past  when intermeet move were more frequent  though it still goe on to some extent   perhap induc by concern of financi market fragil   in ani case  this short term polici inertia is essenti unrel to the quarter polici inertia that is relev for most macroeconom discuss   includ my own   quarter polici inertia is defin as the slow partial adjust of the feder fund rate on a quarter to quarter basi   for exampl  if the fed knew it want to increas the fund rate by   percentag point  it actual would rais the rate onli about    or    basi point per quarter for the next few quarter   it is this type of inertia that i find suspect   the appar evid support quarter polici inertia is summar on the second page of my handout   this evid is base on es  of monetari polici rule or reaction function   that is  es  equat that attempt to model fed behavior   these es  equat usual take a standard partial adjust form  where the current fund rate is set as a weight averag of last quarter   s actual fund rate and the current quarter   s desir rate   this partial adjust form is display as the first equat on page     the paramet ÔÅ is the weight on last quarter   s fund rate  and   ÔÅ is the weight on the current desir level    a high ÔÅ mean that the fund rate will be adjust veri slowli to it desir level   base on quarter data  es  of ÔÅ are typic around      which put a   weight on the lag rate and a   weight on the desir rate   thus  these empir rule impli a veri slow speed of adjust of the polici rate   specif  the fed would chang the fund rate onli    percent each quarter toward it desir level  this sluggish adjust of the fund rate over sever quarter is wide interpret as evid of    interest rate smooth    or    monetari polici inertia      for exampl  befor each fomc meet  the financi indic packet that is distribut contain two es  monetari polici rule   one with and one without quarter polici inertia   both rule set the desir fund rate accord to the taylor rule  which is display as the second equat   in the taylor rule  the desir level of the fund rate is base on current read for the output gap and inflat rate  the Ó± and Ó≤ paramet calibr the polici respons to these determin   the fund rate recommend from these two rule are shown in the chart at the bottom of page     the solid line show the actual path of the fund rate as a quarter averag   the dash line show the es  rule with no inertia   so ÔÅ =     the dot line show the rule with inertia   where ÔÅ is es  by the board staff to be       the taylor rule without inertia  the dash line  fit the actual fund rate fair well  but there are some larg persist deviat   notabl deviat includ      and       when the actual rate was held below the rule        when the rate was push abov the rule  and      and       when again the fund rate fell below the rule   the natur of these deviat is a key element in understand the evid for polici inertia   the taylor rule with inertia  the dot line  larg elimin these deviat and match the histor path of the fund rate much more close  that is  the lag fund rate in this es  equat is statist signific  although this type of econometr evid appear convinc  it is valid onli if the equat is specifi correct   if the desir fund rate also depend on persist factor other than the current output and inflat in the taylor rule  then such a misspecif could result in a spurious find of partial adjust  accord  base onli on these type of polici rule es   it is veri difficult to distinguish between whether the fed   s adjust is sluggish or whether the fed general follow the taylor rule with no polici inertia but some  deviat from the rule for sever quarter at a  e in respons to other factor   i will discuss the natur of these persist deviat in a minut  but first   on page     i want to provid some evid against polici inertia from a differ sourc   this evid is base on a key implic of polici inertia   name  that the presenc of inertia should impli predict inform in financi market about the futur path of the fund rate   intuit  if the fund rate typic is adjust    percent toward it desir target in a given quarter  there   s a remain    percent of the adjust that should be expect to occur in futur quarter   in a wide varieti of set  such delay polici adjust ensur forecast futur variat in the fund rate   assum that financi market understand the inerti natur of polici  they should anticip the futur partial adjust of the fund rate  in this case  a regress of actual chang in the fund rate on predict chang should yield a good explanatori fit and a fair high r ≤   in fact  research have found the opposit   they have es  interest rate forecast regress and  use financi market expect  have found littl predict inform beyond a few month   for exampl  eurodollar futur have essenti no abil to predict the quarter chang in the fund rate three quarter ahead   the r ≤ of such a regress is zero   this lack of predict abil is well illustr by the most recent episod of eas   the chart at the bottom of the page give the actual fund rate target and various expect fund rate path as of the middl of each quarter base on fed fund futur   under quarter polici inertia  the long sequenc of target chang in the same direct in      would be view as a set of gradual partial adjust to a low desir rate  howev  although the fund rate gradual fell in       market particip actual anticip few of these declin at a six to nine month horizon  as they would have if polici inertia were in place   instead  market assum at each point in  e that the fed had adjust the fund rate down to just about where it want the fund rate to remain base on current inform avail   under this interpret  the long sequenc of declin is the result of a seri of fair prompt respons to new inform that turn progress more pessimist   that is  the presenc of quarter partial adjust or polici inertia is contradict by the lack of the forecast of chang in the fund rate   turn to page    i will reconcil the evid for and against quarter polici inertia   as i said  the persist deviat of the actual rate from the taylor rule without inertia are key to understand what is go on   under polici inertia  these persist deviat are explain as sluggish respons to output and inflat  but that interpret is inconsist with the lack of fund rate predict   an altern explan is that the taylor rule is an incomplet descript of fed policymak and that the fed respond to other persist variabl besid current output and inflat   under this interpret  the fed   not exhibit quarter polici inertia  but it respond prompt to a varieti of develop that unfold over  e   what would caus such persist deviat from the taylor rule   well  in   taylor   s origin analysi  he note that occasion deviat from his rule were appropri respons to special circumst   two such special circumst are note at the bottom of page     the deviat in      and      can be interpret as the fed   s respons to a disrupt in the flow of credit  in which the fund rate was kept lower than might be expect given the macroeconom context becaus of sever financi headwind   the         episod is better describ as a persist    credit crunch    deviat from the taylor rule than as a sluggish partial adjust to a known desir rate   in term of the taylor rule  the disrupt of credit suppli can be treat as a temporari fall in the equilibrium real rate  to which the fed respond by lower the fund rate  relat to read on output and inflat    similar  in      and       a worldwid financi crisi follow the russian default and devalu appear to play a larg role in lower rate   again relat to what the taylor rule would have recommend   expect also can play an import role in temper the polici respons to current read on output and inflat   inde  some have suggest that expect of futur inflat   and  in particular  inflat scare in the bond market   are an import consider for polici   final  on page    i highlight two question that are in some sens two side of the same coin   the first question is  how should we think about analyz or model recent fed behavior   the second question is  to what extent should actual fed behavior conform to our model of op  monetari polici   let me start with the first question   in model the fed   s decisionmak process  i argu that the taylor rule is an incomplet descript of fed behavior   howev  ad partial adjust to the polici rule is not a solut  instead  in my opinion  partial adjust add anoth layer of misspecif that substitut for a clearer understand of the polici process   of cours  more research is requir to character the full set of influenc and determin of polici beyond those contain in the taylor rule   a close relat question focus on model the under motiv of polici   more specif  what kind of loss function should repres fed behavior  current  the policymak    perfect foresight    path in the bluebook use a loss function that assum the fed would be equal displeas with ani of the follow      an unemploy rate   percentag point abov the natur rate      an inflat rate   percentag point abov target  or     a     basi point decreas in the quarter averag fund rate   these equal weight place an implaus high penalti on fund rate variabl   howev  without a substanti fund rate volatil penalti  the construct op  polici path   not match the recent histor path of the fund rate  and this is true across a varieti of model   in my opinion  the high fund rate volatil penalti may be anoth misspecif that is compens for some unknown flaw in our calcul of op  polici   in essenc  if polici over the past two decad has been close to op   then an import element is miss from the current specif use by economist to construct op  monetari polici   an altern possibl is that our econom model   without interest rate smooth in the loss function   are basic correct in find that under an op  polici the fed should be more aggress in react to econom news than it has been   this suggest a second question   should the fed deviat from it histor behavior and becom more aggress in chang the fund rate   the analysi abov suggest that the fed has not been sluggish in react to econom develop   it has like set the fund rate equal to it desir rate in each quarter  howev  question remain about whether the desir rate should react more forc to econom news   inde  research typic find that the paramet of an op  taylor rule   that is  the Ó± and Ó≤ shown on page     are much larger than the es  paramet of a histor taylor rule   thus our model  even after tri to take into account various type of uncertainti  recommend much more vigor polici respons   this rais the question  has monetari polici been too  id in it respons to econom develop   i person remain less than convinc that our model captur all the import factor influenc polici
it   s a veri interest set of paper  gentlemen   as a practition of sort  sinc what is suppos be focus on are how the equat fit  let me see if i can come at it from the other direct   there is a stipul that we should be look at the data set as they exist at the  e decis were made   we should also be look at the model that exist at the  e of the decis   but let   s take the structur as it is today   if we fit a bunch of independ variabl into that veri complex  veri sophist es  model and we do not use appropri add factor  we will get nonsens result  what that impli is that the intern structur of the model   it simul capabl   is subject to the same problem that are associ with the fact that we need to use add factor to get the model to a point where it can actual function   so what we do   conscious or otherwis   is to rais continu the question of varianc of the coeffici in the model and uncertainti with respect to the natur of the model   as a consequ  we tack to the wind  if i may put it that way  toward where we think the model   s overal structur and our add factor to the model   which are essenti a set of sub model   are take us   if we do that  the result   as you point out      is a tendenc not to engag in sharp chang in the fund rate   instead of do  say  one move of     basi point  we   ll do    and then anoth      the reason is that we do not know  and cannot know  the degre of financi fragil in the system   and the reason we can   t know is that the presumpt that financi fragil is a stabl function  capabl of be evalu through histori  is clear not sustain  the under structur of the economi with which we are deal and to which we are endeavor to fit out model is in a continu state of chang   the technolog  the demograph  and the comput that are involv generat a system in which ideal we would have not fix coeffici in our model but instead es  coeffici  which would then becom variabl in a set of other dynam chang   but we don   t know what that is   all we do know is that  to abstract from realiti  we need a structur that can essenti simul the forc that chang that structur  which is except difficult to construct   i   ve been build model for fifti year  they tell you someth  and you learn someth from them   but everi  e you think you   ve got it  the structur chang   obvious it must chang unless we have a stabl system that would enabl us to fit all of our coeffici on the basi of the presumpt that the structur is unchang through the es  period   unless we can do that  i   m not sure what we have  so as a practic matter  everi  e we sit down and look at the forecast there is alway the question of whether the model has chang signific sinc the last  book  and that is someth we will not know for two year   rememb our problem with project m    all of a sudden  after realli quit good fit  the equat no longer work   in fact  i spent a good deal of  e model p   which seem to be a veri nice fix on the structur of m  and it project just befor it collaps and ceas to be of ani use whatev   those are consider that induc the actual decisionmak to hedg all the  e  you rais the loss function issu   the loss function is not a simpl function that involv balanc   percent of inflat and   percent of unemploy   in fact  it   s a whole seri of dynam function   in a sens we are alway ask the question in term of two altern polici   what are the consequ if we choos a rather than b and a is wrong  in mani instanc when a and b are veri close  there is no loss of ani great moment if we make a mistak   but with the presumpt of a veri sharp chang in polici  the probabl that we would be make a horrend error is much higher becaus some unknown chang in the financi structur may have creat a degre of fragil that we have not yet been abl to infer  therefor  the decisionmak is quit reluct to make a sharp chang in polici without test the real world   so what this committe would like do if we thought a     basi point move were the necessari chang is that we would move the fund rate         or mayb    basi point and watch what happen   if the system shook a littl and then stabil  we   d tack on the other    or    basi point   we   d take that next step on the ground that all our simul indic that the  e frame need to judg a fragil shock is much shorter than the  e frame in which the monetari polici take effect   all of that basic say that we endeavor to construct our model  presum  in a manner that op  our knowledg  recogn that our model continu get out of date and have to be revis   we do that larg not by re es  the model but basic by add factor as we go along  there is  howev  a veri signific bias problem in policymak in this context  which is that  in all of these model  polici should realli be base on risk neutral evalu   but in fact  we   re all human be  and we are risk avers   psycholog that   s how we behav  and to tri to revers that behavior is except difficult   i suspect that  if we could distinguish between risk neutral and risk avers  we probabl would find that we are much closer to risk avers   i can give you exampl in my own person experi   i use to trade copper  gold  silver  and other commod on the commod exchang ring   i would sit there with full confid that the price of a particular commod was go to go up and that  therefor  as the price went down i should be doubl up on my posit   what did i do   i sold at the end of the day  larg becaus i want to sleep that night    laughter   that may seem like an idiosyncrat event   it isn   t   that   s the way we behav   it strike me that if we find way to move away from risk avers and tri to be strict risk neutral  we will get a far more op  polici outcom   i   m not sure we can do that  but we ought to tri  let me then ask a question   what happen to all of this analysi if you use the pre      period   what do you find  and what do you conclud on the basi of what you find
in term of polici rule es   the view in the literatur veri often is that there was a structur break in the     s   so polici rule in the     s are consid
but there is an econom structur break in the     s in that regard
the statist general indic a break some  e in the     s in term of the polici rule es    there appear to be a differ behavior in the     s than in the     s if you regress the fund rate on the output gap and inflat   for exampl  the coeffici on inflat   that is  the respons to inflat   don   t seem as larg
that rais an interest question   let   s say we go back to the     s and     s and fit our fix coeffici model into that period   the implic is that we   re say that the econom forc move today are the same one in principl that were move back then   whi should polici be ani differ   i don   t know whi it would be unless there   s a learn curv in there or someth
i think the assumpt is that there is a learn curv   although veri often the other equat in the model appear stabl  at least to a first approxim  the interest rate equat   the equat that summar monetari polici or fed behavior   appear less stabl over  e   i believ the convent view is that there was a learn curv and that polici behavior did chang
there   s a veri larg learn curv at the fed on the construct of various model if we go back histor   it   s interest becaus the fed may be a uniqu institut in that it has a suffici histori and constanc to enabl one to see how the model actual have chang   in contrast  privat sector model do not have a suffici histori becaus the firm sponsor them are not that stabl   my impress is that there has been an extraordinari  veri major learn curv in model construct go back into the     s and move forward   obvious  in the     s and     s the secular stagflat that the economi exhibit was not replic by ani of the macro model that we set up in the earli year
mr  chairman  you may recal the paper that christin and   romer present at the most recent jackson hole confer  in which they character the process as one of learn  forget  and then relearn   the thing that is most unstabl about the taylor rule  as   mention  is the inflat target   it   s veri hard to explain the set of interest rate in the     s and today if we use es  from the     s or the first part of the     s becaus the background inflat rate was just so much higher in those earlier year   a distinct that   s also import to make is whether one is es  the rule on the data as we know it now or the real  e data   that can make a differ   it   s a factor in how stark the differ are among decad long es  of the taylor rule  for instanc
in term of the econom model  two thing about the     s come to mind   one is the emerg of the natur rate hypothesi   that there is not a long run tradeoff between output and inflat   also  the sacrific ratio was consid at the  e to be veri much higher than we imagin it is now
i   ve monopol the floor for long enough   let me see the list of other who wish to comment or ask question   governor
well  this is a puzzl issu becaus both side had veri good paper and  of cours  you   re argu posit that are the exact opposit   i   d like to focus on the episod of year      becaus i think the question is realli join there   the board staff say there is a lot of inertia  and   say there is not   i believ that the board staff would argu that the sequenc of small step prove inertia and   would argu that the unpredict  as measur by market expect  prove there is not inertia   i think the chairman in what he just said was confess to some inertia   i  myself  feel that in the first year i was here  up through       we probabl did have a lot of inertia  it was hard to get rate chang by veri much   but in      we chang them quit dramat in a pretti short period of  e even though we did it in relat small step   so i find the overal question of whether or not there is inertia quit puzzl   but     i might ask you a question   to prove that there wasn   t inertia  you   ve chosen a  e when there might not have been   if you had use  e when the fund rate was more stabl  then i think your test would have indic much more predict and  therefor  possibl inertia   isn   t that so   could you be accus of choos an episod to maxim your case
in term of this pictur  i actual didn   t look around that much at other period   this one seem to work  so i stuck with it   but in term of the under analysi  even though this episod demonstr the point  it   not provid the strongest test  a lot of peopl have look for this type of interest rate predict by run regress of actual chang in short term interest rate on forecast chang over longer period   this find of limit predict is true  realli  over much of the postwar period   the particular regress that i use were from       the start of the eurodollar market in readili access form  to        so that   s the period on which my analysi focus  at ani rate  other peopl have run these kind of regress a lot  and it   s remark how financi market often know what the fed is go to do a month or two in advanc   in some episod         for exampl   there was even a bit more predict   nevertheless  i think this recent episod is actual fair typic in that  in the middl of this eas cycl  the market thought they might get the next    basi point move   but in fact  move out beyond six month  they actual have littl predict abil   that   s becaus  if the fund rate is be set in term of futur movement in output and inflat and other factor  those factor are hard to forecast  and the market find them hard to forecast as well   but there   s no pent up polici inertia on a quarter to quarter basi that give them a lot of predict abil
may i also tri to clarifi that   the es  polici rule from our analysi would actual be consist with your impress of the      episod   that episod did look as if the polici move were much more rapid than would have been predict by the es  polici rule   it   s hard to assess becaus there are onli a few data point in a quarter polici rule  but if you let the rule choos a differ coeffici on the lag fund rate for that episod  it will put it pretti close to zero   so that episod  in the context of this rule  actual was a veri rapid polici eas relat to the averag pace of polici adjust seen from      to
you can see that in my handout in the chart at the bottom of page     there is a taylor rule without inertia   that is  there is no lag fund rate in it   and a taylor rule with inertia   dure       those two rule both did fair well
it  sn   t matter that much   the differ in the rule come in       when for the rule without inertia a persist deviat emerg   i would argu that there   s someth other than strict taylor rule determin act dure this episod  perhap some reaction to a collaps of the tech bubbl in stock price or to geopolit risk   someth that   s hold the actual fund rate below what a simpl taylor rule would say
governor    befor you leav the topic with the sens that the distinct between the peopl sit on the two side of the tabl is that stark    has done some work es  polici rule in which he allow a serial correl error in addit to the lag depend variabl   i would ask him to comment on what happen then
in a recent research paper that i wrote with two colleagu  we show that it is possibl to es  polici rule direct allow for both factor   so we don   t necessarili have to turn to the term structur evid to separ them   what our paper and sever other paper have found is that clear     s point is right   there are variabl omit from the rule that have serial correl  which give some impress of gradual   but that   s not the whole stori   in fact  when we appli these method to our polici rule and allow for serial correl error  that decreas the coeffici on the lag feder fund rate from      to        so it reduc the degre of inertia in these rule  but there   s still a signific amount of gradual
you can reduc the degre of inertia by attribut some of that explanatori power to some other error out there that happen to have serial correl  right
so part of the problem is that what appear to be inertia actual is not   we   ve just respond consist to someth that   s the same for a period of  e
well  perhap   i   d point to the part of exhibit   and   where we use the frb us model   now  that is a larg model with lot of persist in it  a larg number of lag state and lag error are at work there   let   s say you ask what the op  parameter of this simpl polici rule would be   you ask it to pick up the veri thing that i believ   is describ   what it tell you is that  unless there is a high degre forward look expect  the op  polici  sn   t want that lag   it  sn   t want that lag to proxi for the same kind of thing that   argu empir it is proxi for     that mean   is wrong   not necessarili   it could mean that the model is wrong   but it isn   t clear that what   is refer to is not be adequ captur in what we   re describ in exhibit   and    the same thing is true  i might add  about the term structur evid   for this term structur evid to explain what   want it to explain  he has to assum ration expect   that   s a presumpt in his analysi   but as you saw in exhibit    if there are ration expect  the op  strategi call for a lot of persist in the fed fund rate   so one can interpret     s evid as suggest that ration expect are not there  in which case they shouldn   t have produc inertia in the first place   there again  it  sn   t mean that   is wrong  but it   mean that there is friction between these two view  and it can   t be settl at this tabl
ration expect in term of financi market  not necessarili the rest of the economi
i think we would agre on the general point of our brief   we   re bicker about what the coeffici is on the lag feder fund rate in the es  polici rule  but these issu don   t affect our calcul of the op  rule and don   t affect the main conclus of our brief   what we find is that these op  rule result in veri aggress  veri volatil movement in the feder fund rate   more volatil than we see in the data regardless of what the exact rule is   recal that we said there are two aspect in which polici is too smooth   the coeffici on output and inflat appear to be smaller than under the op  rule  and the coeffici on the lag fund rate tend to be bigger   even leav asid that second part  as   allud to in his last exhibit  these type of exercis that we perform would still recommend larger respons coeffici and more aggress movement in the feder fund rate
this is also true  if i might add just one last point  in the    policymak perfect foresight    simul   without the usual penalti on interest rate volatil   rememb a policymak in that case is take everyth into account  includ the kind of thing that   was refer to such as the tech bubbl and current and futur geopolit risk   it  too  predict veri volatil  veri aggress monetari polici as the op  thing to do   so in short  this outcom has noth to do with the parsimoni of a simpl rule and has everyth to do with the rest of the structur
you refer to term structur evid   this is differ from the fed fund evid that   was refer to or the same
when i said term structur  i meant the evid that   present
i ask becaus i   m veri interest in this basic point that the fed should be more predict in order to use the short term rate to influenc long term rate and whether that is an import issu   in particular  your evid is veri interest      i was wonder if there had been evid on whether or not the respons of long term interest rate to movement in the fed fund rate was consist with the predict of the type that you propos or the type that use more partial adjust   that would seem to be a separ test  i was wonder if you had done anyth more direct on this hypothesi
well  the expect that are most inform are just a few quarter ahead   in ten year expect  say  polici inertia  sn   t play as big a role  those expect aren   t abl to clarifi whether there is inertia or not   so it is term structur evid  but i   m just look at the veri short end   one year or less of the term structur matur  but it is true that there is a link   in what is often call op  monetari polici inertia  it has been demonstr in other present that  as you have more forward look expect  the monetari author is abl to stabil the economi  not necessarili by take action today but by promis to take action in the futur   financi market build that in  and those expect futur action are abl to affect the economi today   those action reflect inertia  again  those inerti movement are assum in op  monetari polici   i don   t consid that someth we should be take too serious   i don   t think we have the empir evid of monetari polici inertia  and i don   t think op  monetari polici inertia is veri convinc
the other point  governor bernank  is that in the cottag industri of es  event studi regress   which might be anoth place we could look to see how far a given monetari polici surpris get transmit through the term structur of interest rate   we get the same sort of result we get in the  e seri test of term structur expect   that is  the predict effect of polici on interest rate die off pretti quick   in other word  it   s the front end of the forward curv that is usual influenc by a polici surpris  and at the longer end  the forward rate go down
one might argu that     s interpret of the taylor rule is correct   that there is no inertia in the polici rule and that there should be more in order to get more effect on long term rate   i think that   s an open question
it might be use to point out as well that  while polici action three  four  or five quarter ahead are hard to predict  it   s not that they don   t get built into the term structur  the board staff produc an expect path of the feder fund rate base on our read of the futur market  and it common has polici action built in at those horizon   in fact  the current forecast is a good exampl   polici is expect to be on hold until the fourth quarter of      and then  accord to our path  about     basi point of tighten is built in for subsequ year   so it   s not that futur action don   t get price in at all but that they   re not veri predict
that   s differ   that   s the interest rate respond endogen to the expect evolut of the economi
well  that   s true  that could be the case as well
let me carri on from this convers and turn it just a littl   if we compar the op  rule and the es  rule  the op  rule is much more aggress   it probabl involv a lot more revers  and the fund rate would look a lot less smooth if we drew a chart of it   let   s say we use the output from the model that have all the privat sector expect roll into them   expect reflect knowledg of the rule that the central bank is follow   if one were to plot a one year  two year  or five year rate  i suspect that there wouldn   t be much daylight between the rate under the es  rule and the op  rule  that   s my guess becaus even the amount of persist we   re talk about with the es  rule indic readili enough that there   s not much differ in term of a longer term rate   so if we think about polici be transmit through interest rate  it   s not go to make much differ   in the way the economi work in term of growth  employ  and other real variabl   which rule is use   let me just leav that express as an assert for the moment  now  if that   s the case  it seem to me that a critic dimens of design the rule precis in the environ of uncertainti that we face is to promot a good ration expect equilibrium where the privat sector truli understand what we   re do   that   s a dimens that you didn   t realli explor or discuss  but that   s a critic part of this whole subject becaus we   re tri to produc this ration expect equilibrium where the market come to expect the right thing from the central bank   one of the problem with a veri aggress rule  which tend to result in a lot of revers  is that mani peopl are go to find our polici rather confus  they will have difficulti tri to figur out what the central bank is do   from the point of view of promot an understand in the privat sector regard what the polici realli is  i think there   s a big benefit to have a certain amount of smooth in the fund rate  that   s becaus   this is my guess now   it will be much easier for the privat sector to understand what our polici strategi is   that was not address in this analysi  but it seem to me to be a critic part of the problem of tri to design a polici that we should follow
i think of revers as be perhap a bit shorter run   again  an import point regard op  monetari polici the way economist usual construct it is that it   s at a quarter frequenc  we use quarter averag rate   so  it   s not as if at one meet the rate is move up    basi point and at the next meet it goe down    basi point   the revers are not reflect in an up and down pattern meet by meet   we   re talk about quarter averag rate   therefor  from the point of view of econom analysi  as long as the fed follow a systemat rule quarter by quarter   howev it hit that quarter averag   at the broad level of the way macroeconom econom model are construct  that is suffici   in term of revers  this perhap goe back to the chairman   s point about implement polici chang in small step  given that the fed has to worri about financi fragil and test the system
let me answer your question in a slight differ way than   did  i interpret your question as say suppos privat sector agent don   t understand the rule or  even more general  the model   in that case you might ask if there is a role that the fed can play in the conduct of monetari polici that will assist privat sector agent in learn that rule over a shorter period of  e or get to the right equilibrium   as you know  jim bullard at the feder reserv bank of st  loui work on this   there is a small and grow literatur on the subject of learnabl  and that literatur   say that some inertia in polici is benefici in help privat sector agent learn the rule and come to the ration expect equilibrium  i   m sympathet to that view myself  but i don   t know how much weight to put on it becaus i don   t think it has been test in a broad enough set of model to know whether that view is univers correct   at this point  all the experi that have been conduct have been done on extrem simpl model that have no inher persist other than in the polici rule  they are model that jump instantan in respons to shock at all point in  e   i have a suspicion that in a model that has intrins lag   so that shock  regardless of the polici  take some  e to play out   it might not be as import to have that persist in the rule   but i can   t realli say that i know the answer
i think there   s inevit a great deal of learn and evolut involv here in term of further the complet or sophist  whatev you want to call it  of the market    understand of what we   re do   the environ is veri differ in that respect from what it was thirti five year ago  let   s say   so part of the problem in tri to model this is that the world   chang and evolv over  e  and  e and learn go onli in one direct   at least we hope they go onli in one direct   i don   t know where to go with that   laughter
i want to ask about this financi fragil point a bit more  too   you mention that in transcript of fomc meet some committe member have cite concern about financi fragil as a reason for smaller interest rate chang than they might otherwis have want   i just wonder whether there is ani evid on this   has ani research been done   or do you have ani suspicion about what the relationship is of these up and down rate movement to financi fragil
actual  i think there   s surpris littl research relat to that explan compar with the huge amount of literatur on paramet uncertainti and model uncertainti   as far as i know  financi fragil has more or less slip by
all right     all you have to do is to take a poll of the fomc member   that   s your databas
right  and i   m get the impress that financi fragil is import   laughter
not import  it   s determin   if we think the market is fragil and it   s not  that  sn   t matter
it get back to the risk avers point
we do know a few thing  though   first  market actual have becom better at anticip our polici action sinc the earli     s and especi sinc        second  presum market have becom better at trade and alloc risk as well   these develop in the economi bear on this issu   but in term of research indic what financi fragil   to the op  rule  there hasn   t been veri much
may i make a veri brief comment on this point  although i   m jump in out of turn   the way in which dealer manag their posit is go to depend import on what kind of polici chang they think are conceiv   if they live in a world where the rate chang by    basi point most of the  e  with move of    basi point on occas  that   s a veri differ world from one where the chang could be much larger  perhap     or     basi point at a shot   the transit from one world to the other is go to be an aw problem and may involv some catastroph along the way   but the dealer will learn to live with a differ environ   it   s just that the transit could be extrem difficult
anoth point is that  while the more aggress rule would creat volatil in the short term interest rate  it   s not realli clear what they would do to the volatil of price of longer live asset such as long term bond or stock   to the extent that these rule are better at stabil the macroeconomi  they could actual reduc the volatil of those asset price   in other word  such rule would clear make the volatil of the term structur more negat slope   so in term of the fragil aspect  there are a lot of subtl point like that to think about
rememb  if we   re move the interest rate quick  the loss function becom veri crucial  wherea if we   re move increment  it fall out so we don   t realli care about it   that can be a veri crucial determin on how we move   in other word  we start with a degre of uncertainti that is veri high  it is much higher than it is for those who take the data and put them into a model and do project   most model are deal with a control environ in which the number of variabl is well short of a thousand   in the real world there are a million  and we don   t know which one are import   so it realli matter   lot of technic thing that we do would seem to be wrong in a sort of op um sens   yet we do those thing becaus we don   t trust the model to be captur what is go on in the real world   therefor the base of inform on which we act fall away  and risk avers becom a veri predomin factor in the committe   s judgment of which way to move   i don   t know whether we need a psychiatr examin of the committe member  but i bet it would produc an interest databas    laughter
see if there are ani volunt
i just want to stress again the differ between short term polici inertia and quarter polici inertia   a lot of the concern about financi market fragil would refer just to short term polici inertia and wouldn   t necessarili show up in our quarter averag loss function   veri often in the past if you were go to chang the direct of polici  you would start off with a    basi point move   even then   in       for exampl   we saw larg repercuss with the orang counti situat   a lot of peopl had built up posit  appar on the assumpt that monetari polici would never chang  and those posit were hard to unwind   so just a small move in the fund rate seem to produc larg repercuss  a    basi point move for that initi move would have been even more disastr  i think
in fact  if you read the transcript of that meet you will find that there was a veri substanti debat within the committe on exact that theme
right   but again  if you want to get to a total chang of     basi point from the quarter averag of the first quarter to the quarter averag of the second quarter  that could be done over a sequenc of four meet   with limit concern about financi fragil   financi fragil is someth that oper on a week to week basi  market react appropri given enough  e   so i think that distinct has to be made
mr  chairman  i   d like to ask two question about the first paper   you look at these three factor in isol  and then you indic in a caveat that the factor might interact   it seem to me that  inde  they might and that could actual chang one   s conclus  i can understand  if you   re work with the frb us model  that with a model that size it would be veri difficult to incorpor the three effect simultan   isn   t it possibl to work with a smaller model that would enabl you to look at those effect and how they interact and determin whether or not that lead to somewhat differ conclus
there has been some research that did that  and i think it show that when you add sever of these factor togeth you get a lot closer to the es  rule than the op  rule   that   s pretti convinc
okay   there   s anoth point i   d like to ask about   first of all  we had an interest meet in june in which paper on inflat model were present   the discuss reveal some differ around the tabl in view about which model is relev  in one case we had a paper base on a phillip curv  and anoth was base on a random walk  if the polici particip have differ model of the economi  would that perhap lead one to the conclus that we should be less aggress in term of our approach to polici
there is a literatur on robust polici design in which there are a number of differ way to model this   the one that you seem to be point to is a rival model methodolog where we put differ model up and see what we get if we take the op  rule from one model and put it into some other model   most of the literatur suggest that polici should protect against the worst possibl case in the set of model that we   re will to consid  the usual prescript that come out is that polici is more activ than it would be under the polici for your base case model   but it   s go to depend on what model are in your set   it   s certain possibl to have case in which it   s op  to stay in a narrow rang   it   s difficult to come up with a definit answer  but that   s where the bulk of the literatur seem to be point at the moment
it seem a littl counterintuit
well  let me give you one particular exampl   suppos you had two model that differ in the degre of persist in inflat   your bank   s random walk model is one of those exampl   if you get a shock to the output gap in that kind of model  it produc a cycl of inflat that last for an extend period of  e   suppos in the other model  if you shock it  inflat die out quick   if you design op  polici for the model where inflat die out quick  that model is go to say don   t worri about inflat   just respond to output  and everyth will be fine   the other model is go to say  no  inflat is someth that you have to attack on a quarter to quarter basi   everi  e there   s a shock to that phillip curv model  inflat is go to take off on you unless you react   so if you   re tri to protect against the worst case in those two model  you   re go to respond aggress
that   s interest   by the way  that   s presid  n   s random walk
it depend  i think  on the structur of uncertainti   this is the argument that milton friedman made   his point was that not know the model   not be sure of the result   led him to argu against fine tune or  in this case  the aggress polici respons
thank you  mr  chairman   this discuss has gone on awhil  so let me make just a few point   one is that i   d remind   sack that peopl sat around this tabl in octob      and made the same argument he just made   that a polici that induc volatil in short term rate would not get pass through to long term rate becaus it would stabil the economi   and what we found was that the short term volatil did feed through to long term rate over the next three year in part becaus expect weren   t veri well anchor and see the rate move around in an unpredict way actual did feed through to long term rate  there was a paper on this in the staff studi of the new oper procedur  i guess i come out between the two posit in your present to a certain extent   as i   ve observ the committe over  e  i think there are element of gradual in it policymak but not as much as seem to show up in the data   there are a number of occas   like       as you   ve point out   when the committe thought it want to go some distanc but didn   t want to get there realli fast becaus it was worri about financi fragil or other thing   actual  despit the chart  i think there was a bit of that in earli      when  onc the committe start to eas  a number of member thought the committe probabl need to move the fund rate down a coupl of percentag point but it took three or four month to get there   on the other hand  my observ is that most of the  e when we leav this room we think the rate is pretti close to where we believ it need to be   not veri far away   and we   re not look ahead to long run of further eas or tighten   so in that case i agre with    i think an import issu is the serial correl of forecast error that   talk about  we learn slowli over  e about the shock and the way the economi is respond to them  those answer reveal themselv to us after the economi is shock   we learn over  e how big the shock is  and then we react as we get that inform  with respect to the strength of our respons to output gap and inflat gap  i think the committe hasn   t been as gradual or as damp in it respons as the equat say it has   in my view there are a coupl of point indic of bias there   one is that the committe has been forward look  so we   re realli look at forecast and not at exist output gap   we can often bring inform to bear that say that a particular shock will like go away and we don   t need to react so strong to it   so i think the wrong stuff is on the right hand side of these taylor rule  the committe is do much more than look at the current level of those two gap   the second point is that these es  are made on the assumpt of a constant inflat target  in this case from      through the present   i don   t want to get into a discuss of whether it should or should not have been constant   but i do believ that  from      at least into the second part of the     s  the committe sure did not have a constant inflat target   a number of the former member of this committe talk about an opportunist approach to reduc inflat   inflat was higher than it need to be over the long run  but there wasn   t ani extraordinari effort to reduc it   the model want us to be stronger in reduc inflat becaus they had a lower inflat target than the committe and the committe didn   t react to the model   s target but to it own   i think that bias the result to find that the committe didn   t act as aggress as the model thought it should  when in fact it act fair aggress   and aggress enough to get some pretti darn good outcom for the economi over the past twenti year  have said that  i think there is a valuabl lesson embed here  and it goe to the discuss you were have about polici mistak   it   s better general for polici to act too strong than too weak to develop situat   serious polici error have been made when polici  sn   t react aggress enough to a develop situat   exampl are the feder reserv in the     s or the bank of japan in the     s   that is the sort of polici error that allow expect to get out in front   it allow a spiral to develop that becom veri  veri hard to revers   if we react too aggress  that also can be a polici mistak   but tighten too much becaus we   re afraid of inflat or eas too much becaus we   re concern about deflat or recess is much more easili revers without cumul expect problem get built in   so to me the lesson for the committe from these op  rule is that we are probabl better off be a littl too aggress than be not aggress enough in term of the possibl consequ for the economi over  e
you know  that   s the issu of risk avers right there  what prevent us from actual do what you   re suggest is a fear that is asymmetr   it   s veri tough to get around that  but we   re tri
we can do the psychiatr examin  but i hope they   re not subject to foia    laughter
not onli have we tri  we   ve succeed veri well
with that thought thought  let   s break for ten minut and come back   we have a number of peopl who want to speak on these subject   coffe break
shall we continu   governor
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i   d like to pick up about where bill pool was and focus on the bottom of exhibit   in the paper that the board staff put out   what that suggest to me is that  if we think the market have becom much more complet and therefor somewhat more forward look  then we   d do veri well by work with them or hold onto a more inerti approach here   i would argu as a hypothesi that we are perhap on the curv   inde  while it   s hard to say that market are somewher between     and   in a forward look ration expect sens  i think it is certain clear that they have gotten a lot better in that regard over the past twenti year   in that world  the general approach of transpar and gradual or inertia may well be the best polici in some sens becaus that way we   re work with market and not  if you will  surpris market by make larg jump in interest rate   that is exact what bill pool was say   but i would like to ask the staff whether that is a reason interpret of exhibit     can one say that  becaus market have chang suffici  we may actual be closer to op  than some of the earlier specif might have suggest
i think we   re creep up that curv on the bottom left
well  give us anoth red point    laughter
it   s hard to say
all right   so at least it is a credibl theori or a theori that one could put forward that this approach is inde the right one becaus the market have becom a lot better  we   ve becom more transpar  and they understand what we   re do   so  in some sens we should valid their expect
governor    the coeffici infer from our behavior are much lower than the one that were found to be op  in the earlier exercis
well  on inflat and output
right  and that   s where i was go to go with don   s point   or mayb it was the chairman   s point   well  let me say a coupl of thing   one is that i think we may have been take advantag of chang perspect about what level of inflat is accept   second  i think perhap we have been take some risk becaus of financi fragil or extern circumst   we just releas the      transcript  which clear indic that the committe   both befor ned and i join and afterward   was take into consider some of the risk with respect to the asian crise and so forth  even though the economi appear to be grow fa  than one would have like   so i think it   s possibl   not to pat ourselv on the back exact but to squar this circl   that we take into consider both the earlier concern about financi fragil and the fact that most of the market are function better  that lead to a second point  a comment i have for     i think you   re obvious right to talk about the market    abil to anticip but not on a six to nine month horizon   this may be just a differ way of look at it  but i would have assum that anoth way to view not necessarili inertia but predict is whether or not on the day of   or the week befor   the fomc meet the market pretti much have it right   my recollect is that by and larg they do   we   ve rare left this room with the knowledg that we   ve surpris the market dramat   onc in a while we   ve had to do that   but i suspect that  if in your chart you use the expect fund rate path a week or two befor the meet instead of the expect fund rate path in the middl of each quarter  you   d probabl find that the predict would be higher  would that be the case
yes  although if you look at those number  i think they would actual strengthen my case   that   s becaus with quarter polici inertia after you made a move  to the extent that it was not complet anticip and there was some polici surpris  it would have implic about chang in futur rate at a six to nine month or six to twelv month horizon   the yield curv would not be move parallel to the exist curv  but it slope would be chang to some extent   in fact  that  sn   t appear to be the case
that  sn   t appear to occur   okay
again  those inerti movement don   t appear to be there becaus they   re not show up after the fomc chang the target
okay  good enough   thank you   those are my two point
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i had just a coupl of comment   start with a point that i think   made  for me there   s a differ here between inertia and  id   as far as inertia is concern  i find     s stori pretti convinc   so that   s not what interest me particular   on the other hand  both paper seem to at least allow for the possibl that  relat to some sort of op  rule  the committe has been too  id   to the best of my knowledg  by the way  most of the reaction function literatur go back to the     s and mayb even befor seem to come to the conclus that the fed has been over  id   my intuit is to be rather suspici of that conclus for reason that other peopl have alreadi mention   perhap the most import one to my mind is that  while the taylor rule is a use approxim  i think it   s a misspecif in that it omit a lot of import variabl   after all  our action are condit not onli on thing such as how we think the financi market might react but also on forecast and all sort of other variabl that are not go to be pick up with a taylor rule   have said that  i would admit that i would feel better if we had some empir work that brought those other variabl into play and demonstr that we got reason result   as far as i know we don   t have that   so  that   s where i am on these issu
first let me congratul   and   for bring to the tabl what has been an interest issu and a worthwhil discuss   i take two thing away from this   the first is that the english languag is a funni thing   these titl are valu laden  and we accept them at  e too easili  i think   i   m taken by the phrase    op  rule      that is  it   s op  assum that everyon is backward look and not op  as one might think about in a perfect model sens     op  rule    i like better   it is a slight spin on the other phrase becaus it actual say we op  the rule base upon a model that isn   t necessarili op  in the format of expect   the same is true for    polici perfect foresight     which we usual shorten into the    perfect foresight    equat   it isn   t perfect foresight   it   s a policymak   s perfect foresight when the other econom agent are not use perfect foresight  and therefor it is by construct not perfect   it   s not perfect ration and not even most ration  now the reason i say that is not to play game with either frb us or the english languag itself but to recogn that we tend to get ourselv into a game here   we   re tri to defend ourselv against someth call an op  rule   it seem that we should be close to it and therefor we should shed the inertia until we   re    there      in fact     there    may be someth that is an artifact of the titl we gave it  and therefor we have to be a littl cautious about get    there      are we subject to inertia and gradual or to  id   i like that becaus it realli come to the point of anoth valu phrase in that we wouldn   t want to be  id   we might want to be gradual  and we might even want to subject ourselv to some inertia  but we wouldn   t want to be  id    laughter   the reason i rais it that way is that the realiti is that we   re deal in a world in which we seem to observ that we act slowli   but the rational for act slowli was actual put on the tabl   we   re not sure about where we are becaus of data adjust  we   re not sure exact of the potenc of our action becaus of the coeffici uncertainti  inde  we   re a littl concern about the market    reaction becaus of some of the fragil issu   in such a world  it   s not surpris that we would act slowli   if in fact the world is as we think we see it  then we may hold steadi or make a further move  if it is not  we will revers an action   as we move closer  if the world back off and the rational for an action is an artifact of the data  we will not have to go as far backward  so i think in fact our polici behavior was more symptomat of an environ of uncertainti than we give ourselv credit for   in my view  our actual behavior look more like a ration respons to the uncertain world in the dimens i just laid out   so rather than tri to chase the op  rule  i suppos my reaction is that we   re probabl do a better job than the op  rule suggest   the data from the market seem to support that notion  as   report  those would be my comment
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought this was a veri interest topic  and i thank all the author for their paper   i enjoy read them   i realli don   t see the two paper as in opposit so much as differ approach to essenti the same issu  and i think the result are both interest and import   but to me it   s import to tri to draw insight from the result that the fomc can actual use in conduct polici and mayb even tri to relat them to current polici   let me take just a quick shot at that  and i want to focus on a particular type of interest rate polici inertia   first  i should say that i agre veri much with toni and other who point out that there   s a semant issu here    id is bad  cautious is good   it all depend on how you look at it  i want to talk about one particular kind of inertia that i think we see to a fair consider extent in actual policymak   i would describ it with a phrase that a coupl of my richmond colleagu  includ marvin goodfriend here  came up with sever year ago   they character actual fund rate target chang as    high persist and seldom quick revers      i think that phrase is use by a lot of peopl  and it seem consist with the chart we   ve look at today  as we see it  this kind of inerti behavior has both advantag and disadvantag   there has been some allus to that alreadi   we can see the advantag by recogn that chang in the fund rate target basic affect the economi through their abil to affect longer term interest rate movement   to carri those along   as has alreadi been observ here   i think everyon know that  but just to review it   longer term interest rate are link to expect futur fund rate accord to the expect theori of the term structur   with this in mind  have a reput for not readili revers chang in the fund rate target impli that a given target chang is more apt to carri expect futur fund rate with it and therefor carri longer term interest rate with it as well   for exampl  if we were eas polici to s ul the economi  this reput for inertia would tend to make a reduct in the fund rate more s ul than it otherwis would be   it would be more like to move long term interest rate down  too  and to have a signific impact  which i think is import to consid   especi in the current situat  when we   re near the zero bound   we may need that extra thrust in a number of differ situat   in ani case  that   s the advantag of have a reput for this kind of inertia  but there   s also a cost   or at least it   s not a freebi   becaus this enhanc effect of chang in the fund rate target work onli as long as we maintain our reput for not revers cours quick  even if develop in the economi on occas make it high desir to do so   there isn   t a lot of attent given to that in the discuss  but i can certain think of some situat where that is the case   so in short  garner the benefit of inerti behavior can conflict with the need at  e to act preemptiv   now  on one level that is not exact late break news  but in my view it   s appropri to think about it along the line i   ve describ  let me quick tri to illustr this with one particular exampl  and that   s our reaction to the russian default in the fall of        one way to interpret that event and subsequ event is as follow   we reduc the fund rate  as we all recal  by    basi point in three step in       becaus the market believ that our target chang were high persist and seldom quick revers   certain that was the attitud then   the    basi point chang carri longer term rate with it   we then revers those three eas in       but we did so fair gradual   the first chang was in juli  there was anoth one in august and anoth in novemb   now  if you go back and look at the histori  the economi was realli rather strong in earli       and a case could have been made to revers cours much sooner   we didn   t do that  and that left our reput for inerti polici intact   i think one could argu that have that reput was help when we cut rate sharpli in      to fight the recess becaus then  as earlier  the cut were seen as last rather than temporari   but in retrospect one can ask whether or not      might have been one of those  e when we should have revers cours more prompt to be more preemptiv against the boom  even if it undermin our reput for inerti polici   i   m not take a posit   i don   t know the answer as to which choic would have been best   i   m use that case as an illustr of the kind of tradeoff we can confront relat to this issu of inertia  i find this sort of question veri relev to the situat today  so let me close with a brief comment on that   we current face the possibl of a potenti sizabl negat  mayb geopolit induc  shock at a  e when the nomin fund rate is even nearer to zero than it was in        of cours  the real fund rate is alreadi negat   i can envis a number of situat not too far down the road that would requir us to think about these tradeoff that i just tri to illustr with that         exampl   suppos we get a negat shock soon  and we reduc the nomin fund rate even closer to zero  but the economi then improv unexpect and quick   we then would have to weigh the tradeoff between the need to preempt that upsid risk  on the one hand  and the harm it might do to our reput for inerti polici  on the other   a reput that could well be help in other situat when the economi may weaken unexpect  in ani event  i   m simpli throw that out as an exampl of the type of issu that this research and the present suggest to me are import for current polici discuss   i would just ask    bob  or     or anyon els on the staff   if they might want to comment on that
my opinion would be that in the current situat  or even in          what is of interest is that inertia is not oper at these quarter frequenc   these are situat   and one of them would be the repercuss from the russian default   in which the committe see some serial correl influenc that may persist for sever quarter and the committe is respond to that prompt   similar  in the current situat there are influenc not well summar by the taylor rule determin that the committe is respond to on a quarter to quarter basi   there is no feel that we have to get somewher but we   re go to take our  e to get there   again  that   s a synopsi of my general impress of the committe   s behavior
i   ll take the other side   if polici is inerti  what we highlight in exhibit   are the benefit of inertia when market and agent are forward look   you provid some veri nice exampl of exact what happen in these model   in these model  policymak by assumpt are commit to the op  rule  which has inertia   that give them the benefit of bring forward effect of anticip  drawn out polici respons   as you said  for exampl  in the fall of       expect were that those eas would not be quick revers   now  that   impli that there will be other situat in which policymak might want to do someth differ  but they   ve commit themselv to this gradual rule     woodford has done a lot of the research on this theori  and he talk quit a bit about the fact that policymak often find themselv confirm expect of polici action that were built in in advanc   it   s import to confirm those expect in order to get this channel oper and to get market bring forward the effect of polici action   i think you gave some good exampl of what is go on in exhibit
if we break this pattern  though  and move bold in some situat  what is the cost associ with the loss of credibl for inertia  if i can use that phrase   it seem to me that is the kind of thing we have to be inform about if we ever have to make these choic go forward
that   s a difficult question becaus it depend on how peopl learn  a mechan that is not formal in the model itself   if peopl have complet their learn and know your rule and you do someth quit differ from your rule    that caus them to reinterpret what you   re do and conclud that you must not be use the rule they thought they knew   that   s when confus result  and they can   t predict the fund rate nineti day ahead  for exampl   there is not veri much literatur on this  most becaus there   s no agre upon theori about how peopl learn   what i think is true  and this is just a feel on my part  is that if the event the fed is respond to are extraordinari   outsid the normal random shock that occur from period to period   the privat sector is quit happi to give you the benefit of the doubt
peopl will cut us a littl slack
yes   but if you   re respond idiosyncrat to normal shock so that it  sn   t seem as if you   re act in a systemat way  that will undermin peopl   s belief that you   re follow a commit rule  or rule like behavior  that anchor their expect  that is the key here   one thing we didn   t show you in the materi we present is that  if you get to the point governor   refer to   where you   ve move up the curv in exhibit   and are near the top of it so that peopl are more ration   the perform of the economi is much better than if they   re not ration   that   s the first point   the second is that peopl are also veri forgiv of mistak   if you do behav differ than the polici rule would call for   and peopl don   t bail on you and say they don   t know what you   re do now   the polici loss from do someth other than the op  is veri small   if peopl are ration  they are will to give you that benefit
let me make just one point  presid broaddus  which goe back to how this convers start a while ago   the chairman ask   what the r ≤ was in this exhibit on chang  and the answer was       there is plenti of unexplain variat   it   s go to take a while befor market particip decid that the rule has chang just becaus there are a coupl of run in which a polici action is unexpect   in part it also depend on how policymak explain what they do in the manner that governor   and presid pool talk about   if it can be describ as a chang in r  credibl link to event  then it   s not obvious that a chang in the direct of polici is a polici revers in the under sens
i feel more comfort
thank you  mr  chairman   most of the peopl that i know in financi market understand as much about these model as i do  which isn   t veri much   have the enorm benefit  unlik all previous speaker  of not have a phd in econom   or perhap in english literatur  in the case of presid santomero   i think the rule that we need to appli is the rule of what i would call prudent central bank   if we look back on the conduct of the committe  go back at least to      or to       when i got here  i believ that we   ve pass that test quit well   if we reexamin what we   ve done togeth   with the possibl except of the case presid broaddus mention  although i would not agre with his conclus on the  e of our tighten in        even with the brillianc of hindsight  i believ that we have been prudent central banker   what do i mean by that   what   that tell us about how the committe behav  i   ve bore you mani  e by say that in my view the most import thing in public life is to distinguish between what we do know and what we do not know   when we reach a point as we did in februari      or as we did on januari          when it was  e for a signific shift in monetari polici   tighten in the case of      and eas in the latter case   what did we know on those occas   actual  i should note that i think the seed of the januari      action go back to the decemb      meet of this committe at a  e when the market were essenti close for the year   there was an under feel go through the room at the decemb meet that we were go to keep monetari polici on hold but that there was a strong likelihood that we   d be chat soon in a telephon confer call  we did that the veri first day the market was open in        i rememb that we knew on both of those occas that a signific chang in monetari polici was requir   tighten in the first case  eas in the second case   but what didn   t we know   we didn   t know what the total size of the need monetari polici correct move would turn out to be   i certain didn   t know that  and i think even our distinguish chairman didn   t know that at the  e   it was veri clear with the    basi point move in februari      or the    basi point move on januari          that our work wasn   t finish   there was more to do  in such situat  we get into the combin of not know how far we   re go to go or necessarili how quick   but we start deal with the financi market through which our polici oper  and we observ the reaction in those financi market   then we tri to judg the like effect on the real economi of that reaction   if the financi market are work with us  then the pace of our monetari polici move can be acceler   we can be bolder  but we are be bolder while be wise and prudent at the same  e  which in my view is high necessari   so i think a prudent central banker is not a  id central banker or a risk avers central banker but rather one who say the follow   this is where i think i want to go  how fast and how far i   m not quit sure  so i   m go to deal with the real world in which we live and do it as effect as possibl  at the end of most of those lengthi cycl  which usual last about a year  we realiz    as we   ve said frequent in this committe   that either the last two move or the last move is go to turn out to have been unnecessari   that was the reason behind our explain the    basi point move that we made most recent as an action taken against a soft spot in the economi   we made it veri clear that it was an insur polici against downsid risk   whi did we do that   becaus when we revers that move   when we cancel the insur polici   it will be veri easi for financi market particip and the public more general to understand  i think the model build is extrem use  and this kind of discuss is veri import and veri enlighten for us   but in my view the likelihood   as you suggest  mr  chairman   of our ever get the model so exact right that we can base anyth on it other than a sens of polici direct is veri low   if we decid  well  let   s be bold  then somehow the market will figur it out over  e  that is a risk that i don   t think a prudent central banker will take   eventu the market may figur it out  but in the mean   if we scare the hell out of everybodi and tank the economi   lose the confid of the american peopl  never mind market particip   that would be imprud   a central bank should not engag in imprud behavior   it   s wonder to feel bold  but i think it   s even more import to be prudent   thank you
how   it feel to be bold and wrong    laughter
that   s whi you   re prudent   also known as risk avers   but prudent sound so much better
i have one brief comment on that  which is how i would come out on this issu   if the choic were whether the fed should chang it behavior to match the model or whether we should chang the model to have op  monetari polici match histor fed behavior  i   d probabl go for the latter   but it   s not clear to a lot of research exact how to incorpor this model uncertainti and what need to
well  as the chairman said  there   s a good deal of psycholog involv   therefor  we   re deal with all the social scienc  howev mathemat we tri to make them  at the same  e   what is the reaction of financi market  that   s larg psycholog   what is the reaction of the real peopl   it   s almost pure psycholog    i don   t know of ani model that perfect link psycholog and econom  mayb some day we   ll have such model   i don   t know that they exist yet
for exampl  the policymak perfect foresight path in the bluebook is perhap interest  but the psycholog has to be taken as miss from that
after ponder this  i   m go to talk more about policymak than the paper or model  and i   m go to say what bill just said in a somewhat differ way   we  of cours  want to be prudent  respons  stabl  and all those thing   it has been assum that we get prudenc  stabil  credibl  and so forth on the basi of the chang we make to the target fund rate   but the more i think about it  the more i think that probabl  sn   t captur it  to go back to someth   said  what is import is to clarifi to market what we care about   we care about stabl price and maximum employ   there will be  e when we have to move fair quick  such as in       to establish our commit to those object   i don   t think we should be captiv to a feel that  if we move in a seri of small step but a larg distanc over a fair short period  it will somehow make us less credibl  understand  or transpar   as long as we are clear on what we care about  then i think that will give us a littl freedom to make big chang if we have to make them or not to make big chang if we don   t have to   so i tend to think that the stabil and credibl depend on a consist of object  not on our behavior in term of how much we chang
there   s a lot more communic with the market than just the intend fed fund rate itself   one of the thing that i find strike is that this committe and  of cours  particular the chairman have realli been remark clear and coher about a whole varieti of thing on which it   s possibl to be clear and coher   he enjoy talk about obfusc  but that   s not in fact what the market most of the  e take away from what he say   i believ that   s an import point   it   s one thing that separ the success here  i think  from the problem that some other central bank have had becaus the predict that we   re talk about is not there for some of those other central bank   there is some literatur on that  let me mention someth that i find interest   roger talk about the fact that the fed fund futur market the day befor a meet most of the  e has it right   one of the thing that bob rasch and i have done is to go back and tri to figur out how that happen   if one look at ani particular fed fund contract at the begin of it trade   let   s say when it start to becom activ three or four month in advanc   that forecast that far in advanc is often not veri accur   what happen if you follow this day by day is that you see that the inform come into the market move that rate in a veri sensibl way most of the  e   so let   s say the fed fund predict start out too high and then it converg to where we actual go  it   s a consequ of new data such as a weak report on industri product or employ and a whole raft of other thing   it turn out that about    percent of the larg fed fund futur chang are a consequ of inform of that type and about    percent are a consequ of statement or tes oni   primarili from the chairman or occasion from other member of the committe   so a coher pictur of how the polici process work is obtain not just from the respons function that economist build into their model and work with in their equat  it   s also a consequ of the way the committe   and again i emphas particular the chairman   has articul what it is that we are do
mr  chairman  it   s late and some of my intend comment would repeat what other have said  so i   ll be fair brief   one point i would note is along the line of vice chairman     s comment on model human behavior   we have two model here  and most of us probabl can agre with some dimens of each model depend on the circumst   as i look at the model and at the circumst  i find that my thought go to the chairman   s earlier point and don kohn   s   when we are confid enough about what we should do  we act more bold   when we are less confid  we act either more cautious becaus we don   t know or we take that one step too mani becaus we don   t know   what these model are tri to do is to pick up that behavior   sinc that involv the human behavior of a small group  we   re go to get some rather contradictori and conflict outcom   that   s exact what we   ve got here  i think  and it has been interest   i   m not interest in sign up for the psycholog test  though    laughter
let me make a coupl of differ comment   also becaus of the  e  i am not go to repeat some of the comment other have made   one of the thing i found interest in read these paper was     s chart on page    which look at the differ rule and the actual fed fund rate   what strike me is that the largest varianc among the differ fed fund rate realli occur most when either there is a turn or there is nois in the data   i was in the privat sector when mani of these event were occur  and i will tell you how i read the situat   and this pick up from what bill pool just said   when the fomc has a great track record of be persist   when we know that we   re tri to get out of a recessionari period or we   re realli fight inflat  or whatev our direct is   the market expect us to persever   so we keep along those path through both communic of the rate chang and other public comment that we make   but just as our view some  differ around the fring in get to a consensus on when turn happen  the view on the street differ as well   to the extent that that   s nois  i think that   s a differ issu than the persist of a polici cours through the cycl  the other comment that i have relat to react and overreact   the market tend to overact   i was chairman of an earli asset liabil manag committe  alco   and in that group we call the fed fund rate the administ rate becaus we saw it as alway lag behind whatev els was go in the market   with the advent of deriv and other hedg instrument  the one thing that most bank alco manag did not do was to hedg anyth to the fed fund rate   that   s becaus it correl was so low compar with that of free move rate like libor or treasuri yield or other market index that move more quick   in the period we   re talk about   for exampl  in        some of us can rememb that tradit hedg actual revers on us  and instead of be negat correl  they were posit correl   the fact that the fed was there signal that it knew someth unusu was happen that caus the movement help in my view to damp the overreact of the marketplac   so anoth element of our not want to overreact and to revers ourselv is that i fear it would build on the market   s own tendenc to overreact and revers on itself   so i think it   s import for us to be persist  to signal when unusu event are happen  and to communic that well   to me those are the lesson that we can take away from these paper
thank you veri much   ani further comment to close this discuss    if not  we have a report from dino
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the packag of chart that is be circul   the first graph show three month cash deposit rate in the unit state and the euro area and three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward for both the dollar and the euro   the cash rate were stabl in the intermeet period  but forward rate declin  particular for the euro   the three month forward dollar rate trade through cash rate  part in respons to data that becam avail as the intermeet period progress   disappoint outlook from sever major corpor and risk avers driven by geopolit risk were cite by market particip as reason that short term rate were like to stay low longer than had previous been expect   some were even build in further reduct to come   in the euro area  reduc expect for growth  chang sen ent about the prospect for structur reform in some major economi  and a stronger euro that might curb export were cite as reason that interest rate might declin there   for near two

financ of the deficit   henc  short term interest rate differenti have becom more of a topic of convers in market   at the longer end  as shown in the bottom panel of page    ten year yield on german and u s  govern bond recent have shown a rate advantag for the german bond   although that spread has near converg as of today  german yield have had an advantag over u s  yield sinc may        in general  an under theme in currenc market recent has been the reduct of expect return on dollar asset   turn to page    in the past two month the dollar has shown a steadi declin against most major currenc  with the declin of the dollar against the euro most pronounc   the euro has gain about    cent versus the dollar in the last two month and is now trade at it strongest level sinc octob        but the dollar has also been fall against the swiss franc  the australian dollar  the new zealand dollar  the pound  l  the norwegian kroner  the canadian dollar  the yen  and almost everi other currenc except the mexican peso   geopolit concern in one form or anoth have been cite as the reason   but if investor have concern about iraq  it   s not clear whi european currenc would be immedi attract   and if the concern is north korea  it   s not clear whi the yen would have a spark   fall    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     stock price in the unit state are some  mention  but european stock have fallen even more   one variat on the geopolit factor that may have a bit more attract in term of concern is the extent of general uncertainti   that explan suggest that uncertainti among businessmen and investor has led both group to stay on the sidelin until the air clear with respect to these geopolit risk   given the loss that investor in general have had in riskier asset in the last few year  that yearn to    stay home    is understand even without the uncertainti generat by event risk   but if japanes  european  and other investor stay home and the u s  current account deficit still need financ  the result is that pressur build on the exchang rate   and perhap even on asset price   a second aspect of develop in the last few week involv uncertainti about today   s tes oni by the incom treasuri secretari   some market particip had specul that he might take a differ approach toward the dollar polici   final  anoth under theme in the market was that some influenti central bank were realloc reserv from dollar to euro   the yen also appreci versus the dollar despit the continu stream of bad news out of tokyo  although the rise in the yen was less pronounc than that of other major currenc   in part  the caus of the yen   s appreci may also be relat to asset realloc  this  e by japanes institut from yen and dollar asset into euro asset   but anoth factor may have been the intervent by the bank of japan   sinc mid januari  the japanes monetari author has interven veri  veri quiet in market   in total  they have

comment have taken that as a sign that the currenc is perhap get close to some sort of equilibrium  other have point out that the dollar move in long multiyear cycl and is prone to overshoot on the upsid and also the downsid   turn to page   and move to domest market  there have been some sign of a reviv in risk appetit and of easier financ condit   but these sign are tentat and perhap not all that convinc in the end   the top left panel show that the invest grade corpor bond spread has narrow sharpli in the past three month   issuanc has also shown some sign of pick up   the top right

maintain for the  e be   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper  and i would be happi to take ani question
question for dino
just one  dino  on your dollar chart on page     you said that some peopl think the dollar is in equilibrium now becaus it is back at it histor level   has anybodi look at the current account deficit to inform those judgment
well  the peopl cite that view are perhap not take the analysi as far as you   re suggest   i think it   s probabl more mechan   look at the dollar   s high and low and figur that  sinc it   s somewher in between  it might be approach someth of an equilibrium   but  again  mani peopl tend to look at these exchang rate movement as have veri long cycl  they tend to think that we may have more to go on the dollar
further question   cathi
i was interest in your comment on risk avers and the various way that you see it in the market   in the last coupl of statement after our meet  we   ve refer to geopolit uncertainti   but with the weak appar in the incom econom data  there also has to be a degre of uncertainti that simpli reflect peopl wonder what is go on in the economi   do you have ani sens of the breakdown between those two type of uncertainti with regard to how market peopl are see them
that   s a veri good point  presid     i think that is reflect in the concern about some of the corpor report that have been come out and about the weak in the product and employ data   it   s veri hard to put percentag on that  but that type of uncertainti about the under strength of the economi is certain part of it   much of the market commentari has been that there are a lot of uncertainti involv big event that could go one way or the other way in the next few week and month  and market particip are have a hard  e price for those risk becaus there are quit a number of them
yes   it seem to me that if all the uncertainti center on a discret geopolit event   a go no go decis such as we go to war or we don   t go to war   that has one implic for how to look at the second half of the year   as in the  book  one could look at various scenario that make some big assumpt about the short of a war or whatev   if the uncertainti hedg around under fundament   grow out of the view that this is a veri differ kind of recess than that around which our model and peopl   s memori are built becaus this    recoveri    compar with previous one is so slow   then that say someth differ about the role of uncertainti   that is a differ stori in term of when the uncertainti might get resolv and the implic for the second half of the year
i don   t want to comment on the forecast or what the market might or might not be expect with precis   i think mani have an assumpt that the second half will be strong   so that   s one of the factor for which there might be
they are think a littl more of a discret event or that kind of thing   someth that is resolv fa  rather than slower
well  the way that i would put it is that the forecast for the third and fourth quarter are reli upon a lot of posit thing happen in the next few week on the geopolit front and also on the assumpt that the data will get better   now  if thing do not turn out that way  then quit a bit of risk might lie ahead in sever market   that   s the way i would think of it
presid    one thing that make the kind of decomposit you   re suggest especi difficult to do is that  if geopolit risk actual have affect busi decis on hire and product  then some of what appear to be a respons to weak employ and product data is indirect a respons to the fallout from the geopolit risk
may i slide a comment in here   in talk with peopl in the new york  london  and pari financi center  it   s veri  veri hard to determin to what extent they are say that the uncertainti is geopolit when it   s realli a cover stori for uncertainti about econom issu   it   s absolut imposs to distinguish between the two  my own view is that peopl think it   s rather fashion to say you   re worri about geopolit risk   it   s such an eloqu word   when the real fact is that they   re worri veri much about econom develop   the point is that  if all the concern are geopolit and we do someth in iraq and it   s over veri success  one might think  wow  the economi could take off   if on the other hand it   s a cover stori for concern about the economi  the reaction to a success war effort might not be anywher near as posit   i don   t know how to distinguish this mix of uncertainti and risk avers
that   s the real dilemma we   re look at for the next month and a half
i want to ask a question about your page     when i see a chart like this that show spread of corpor yield versus treasuri for a short period  the question that come to my mind is  what should one consid the norm   if one had a much longer histor chart  i don   t know what it would show   is a spread somewher in the rang of     to     basi point about right   i   m look at the u s  domest rate   or is that way off   can you give us a littl sens of how this fit in the broad histor scheme of thing   that would pick up a littl on the earlier discuss about risk avers   that spread has come down some  but has it come down a great deal by histor standard or is it still elev by histor standard
well  if we go back to the         period  spread were extrem tight   if anyth  they were probabl too tight and were not factor in as much risk as peopl were undertak   so in that sens i   ve intent left that out   but if we exclud that period  at least base on the sens i get from peopl in the market     normal    would be someth south of these number but not as low as the    basi point seen in that earlier period on some bond that were border on junk    so the area we would be think of is someth higher than that but lower than what they are today   certain for the high yield bond the spread are about     basi point now  and i believ they bottom out at about the mid    s  which was extrem low  so a spread in the    s or the    s is intuit what peopl in the market feel might be a bit more    normal     if you will
as you know  governor    and as dino note  these spread move around a good deal   we   re struck by the fact that they   ve come down of late  but they   ve come down from an unusu high peak   the high yield spread bottom out  as dino said  in the neighborhood of     basi point at a  e when we think risk avers was unusu low and investor were too will to take on risk   at the end of        subsequ they rose about     basi point and in recent month have come off a coupl hundr basi point  as you see here
anoth way of look at this is that these spread now are rough where they were in januari       when the committe first start eas and when there was a lot of risk avers  especi in the high yield market   they are also close to the level of octob      right after the terrorist attack   so they   re back to level that most peopl in the market would not view as necessarili reflect a healthi state of affair
in fact  if you want an even more evoc comparison than that  the last  e the spread were there befor then was in
i have a question on page   also  on the bottom chart show a declin in u s  corpor debt issuanc   do those figur also includ oblig involv fund rais by corpor through securit  or is that just straight corpor debt
i believ it is straight corpor debt   i would have to check on that  but i don   t believ it would includ ford ab  for exampl
well  that   s what i was wonder   back to your risk avers   to the extent that corpor debt has gotten veri expens to issu  some compani are substitut commerci mortgag back secur  collater debt oblig  and those type of thing in lieu of straight corpor debt
yes  some clear have   that was especi true in the fall  when a lot of corpor could not issu straight debt  and they went that rout becaus it was still avail to them
we ought to amplifi the chart to show that
yes  i think that   s right   if it includ securit  those data  which are includ in the sourc and use of fund  would have to show a huge sale of secur   they don   t show that  which suggest that it is a differ set of data
the other form of substitut that firm use at that  e  governor bie  was to run down liquid asset   in the flow of fund account we see a big declin in liquid asset
right   that was anoth question i had   to the extent that corpor cash flow have gotten a littl better  i wonder whether that has had an effect too
certain there was a run down in commerci paper be    term out     there was also some paydown of commerci paper financ by run down cash balanc  some of that was go on as well
ani further question   if not  let   s adjourn until
mr  chairman  i move approv of the domest oper   sorri  i almost forgot
oh yes   without object they are approv   let   s adjourn then until      a m  tomorrow   meet recess  januari               of     januari            morn session
good morn  everyon   we   ll begin today   s session with the chart show present
befor we start the chart show itself  i want to give you an updat on the data releas ye day on order  shipment  and inventori   these are on the separ sheet insert in the chart show packag   as shown on line    new order for nondefens capit good rose     percent last month   about in line with our expect   in addit  the novemb number was revis up reflect  in part  a whop revis to aircraft order   the shipment number  line   through     were weaker than expect and  all els be equal  would shave     percentag point off fourth quarter gdp and put us on a slight lower trajectori go into the first quarter   howev  inventori at manufactur of durabl good  line     are report to have soar at an annual rate of near     billion last month  with almost all of the accumul in the aircraft industri  line       given what we know from boe about their product and deliveri last month  we   re puzzl by the size of this number   nevertheless  take the figur at face valu  it would add about     percentag point to fourth quarter gdp   let me turn now to the chart show   in put togeth the  book  two of the question we ask ourselv were     what the heck happen to the economi in the fourth quarter     and    how do we get from an economi that appear to be dead in the water late last year to one that   s grow at a     percent rate in the second half of this year      mani of you may well have ask yourselv the same question   so  what happen in the latter part of        two differ factor seem to have been at work   first was the return of the product of motor vehicl to a more sustain pace in the fourth quarter  the red dot in the top left panel  from the elev third quarter rate   we es  that the drop in assembl deduct about   percentag point from fourth quarter gdp growth   but as shown by the open dot  we expect this sector to be essenti neutral for gdp growth in the first quarter   as shown in the top right panel  the other factor help to explain the paus of gdp growth dure the fourth quarter was a resumpt of inventori liquid outsid the motor vehicl sector follow the modest accumul in the preced quarter   the remain panel of this exhibit trace out the main element of the product  demand  and inventori stori in the second half of last year   the high frequenc data in these panel and the anecdot report in the beig book and from our busi contact highlight a featur of last year   s econom perform that is obscur by the arithmet of quarter averag   name  the abrupt halt in the growth of non auto factori output that occur in middl of last year  the middl left panel    the retrench doubtless was relat in part  as one contact put it  to a    the materi use by mr     mr  struckmey  and ms   son are append to this transcript  appendix        complet loss of busi confid in the wake of the corpor govern scandal      despit some retrench of product  final sale exclud motor vehicl continu to expand   as shown in the middl right panel  consum spend  line    and hous activ  line   and    were both well maintain through the end of the year  although busi spend  line    remain sluggish  the shortfal of product from demand outsid the auto sector had as it tautolog counterpart a reduct in inventori  especi for consum good and busi equip   as we note in the  book  becaus final sale have continu to increas  we are not view last quarter   s liquid as signal a major problem with unwant stock that could cumul into even deeper product cut   the day    suppli of inventori  illustr in the bottom left panel    not suggest ani serious imbal  nor do the report from purchas manag on their custom    inventori  the bottom right panel    in gdp term  we expect non auto inventori to be a neutral factor in the current quarter after subtract a percentag point from growth last quarter   your next exhibit begin to lay out our answer to the second question i rais initi     how do we get from here to there      in the first half of       when gdp is project to rise at a    percent rate  the answer is essenti the mirror imag of the one for the fourth quarter of this year   an absenc of drag from motor vehicl and inventori coupl with continu gain in final demand   inde  we alreadi may be see the start of this outcom   factori product exclud motor vehicl tick up in decemb  and most report from purchas manag have been upbeat of late   in our project  activ step up sharpli after midyear and remain well abov the growth rate of potenti through the end of the forecast period   with output increas fa  than potenti  the unemploy rate begin to fall later this year  even so  enough slack remain in the economi to result in a further deceler in consum price   the acceler of gdp after midyear reflect sever factor  some of which are highlight in the middl panel   as shown in the first bullet  we assum that the cloud of uncertainti and pessim hang over the busi sector will begin to lift as we go through the year   in addit  strong gain in structur product boost real incom and spend   as regard monetari polici  the s ulus associ with past eas  as well as an assum accommod polici in the project period  provid signific forward momentum   final  we expect new dose of fiscal s ulus to be inject into the economi in mid      and the begin of next year   the fiscal packag we   ve assum involv bring forward in  e sever tax cut that current are schedul to be phase in between      and        specif  an increas in the child tax credit  an expans of the    percent tax bracket  margin rate reduct  and marriag penalti relief   we have not includ the administr

spend and tax   the red line show the amount of fiscal s ulus in the pipelin under current tax law   the shade area illustr the extra s ulus that result from our assumpt that futur tax cut will be acceler   the panel on the bottom right use simul of the frb us model to es  the direct and indirect effect of our fiscal assumpt on the growth rate of gdp as well as the effect of ad in the dividend exclus propos   the solid gray portion of the bar indic our es  of what gdp growth would be if the congress made no chang to current tax law   this correspond to the    polit gridlock    scenario shown in the  book   as you can see  even in the absenc of anoth shot of fiscal s ulus  we would still expect the economi to grow smart in      and        the red shade area highlight the effect of our assum acceler of futur tax cut  while the yellow portion add in an es  of the effect of adopt the dividend exclus propos   as discuss in the memo sent to the committe last friday  there are a number of veri thorni issu relat to the econom effect of cut the tax on dividend that are not settl in the econom literatur   accord  the simul result have a veri wide confid band   much of the s ulus from monetari and fiscal polici manifest itself in the household sector  the subject of your next exhibit   consum spend  the blue bar in the top left panel  was well maintain last year  spur in part by low interest rate and the tax cut relat jump in real dispos incom  the yellow bar   look forward  we expect that the strong gain in structur product and the tax cut assum to come on line this year and next will support dpi growth through the project period   in addit  we assum that there will be no further deterior in net worth relat to incom over the project period  as shown in the panel to the right   the middl left tabl provid a pars of these effect on the growth rate of real pce   a step up in the growth of structur product boost the contribut from potenti gdp  line     this is augment by the s ul influenc of the tax cut  line    and some wane of the negat wealth effect  line      one risk to the outlook for consum spend that has been rais by some analyst is the possibl that household are overextend and are unusu vulner to unanticip disrupt to incom   as shown in the insert in the middl right panel  household debt growth is project to step down from the rapid pace in       reflect a moder in the pace of mortgag borrow  the yellow bar    nonetheless  the growth of household debt continu to exceed the rise in nomin incom  continu the upward trend in the overal debt   incom ratio  line   in the bottom left tabl    howev  we don   t see this increas in debt burden as like to impos serious restraint on consum spend   in part this is becaus the rise in debt burden is heavili concentr at the upper decil of the incom distribut   household with incom abov          in       accord to the survey of consum financ   as shown on line    the staff es  that between      and      the debt   incom ratio for the lower    percent rose   point  compar with the    point increas for the top decil  line      thus the bulk of the rise in debt ratio has been concentr among household with the mean to servic these oblig  moreov  as shown in the bottom right panel  low interest rate have help keep requir consum payment broad defin   that is  mortgag debt servic as well as requir household payment for properti tax  home insur  tenant rent  motor vehicl leas and consum credit   below previous peak   your next exhibit focus on the busi sector   as shown in the top left panel  we expect real invest in high tech equip and softwar to acceler over the project period  with an increas of more than    percent dure        about in line with the gain observ dure the last half of the     s   the recoveri in spend for other equip  exclud transport  shown in the top right panel  is more drawn out  but we think that eventu it  too  will begin post robust gain  boost in part by the partial expens provis enact last spring   more general  the pickup for both high tech and other equip reflect our assum lift of busi gloom as well as the direct and indirect effect of monetari and fiscal polici   in light of the dismal perform of the equip sector in recent year  you would be justifi in be somewhat skeptic that such a strong recoveri will occur ani  e soon   even with the favor cost of capit and tax incent   the middl two panel will  i hope  go some way toward persuad you of the reason of our forecast   the chart translat the level of real gross invest into the growth rate of the net capit stock use the same depreci rate that the bea use in construct the nation account   you can see that  even though gross invest is rise rapid  project capit stock growth is rather conserv by histor standard   not onli do we think that the invest forecast in reason  we also think that  in the current financi environ  it is achiev   as shown in the bottom left panel  firm have taken advantag of low interest rate to restructur their balanc sheet away from short term debt  lighten their current repay oblig   moreov  as was discuss ye day  corpor bond spread have come in recent  the bottom right panel   and bank financ  not shown  appear to be readili avail for creditworthi firm   as i said near the begin of my remark  a key element in help the economi get from here to there is the strong growth of structur product that we continu to assum  which sandi will now discuss
one of the defin characterist of the economi over the past two year has been the lack of ani net employ gain despit a recoveri in econom activ   as shown in the top left panel of chart    nonfarm payrol in the fourth quarter of last year  the t   observ  were lower than at the  e of the appar busi cycl trough in the fourth quarter of        inde  payrol have follow pretti close the pattern of           the so call jobless recoveri   as shown in the top right panel  the obvious flip side of this record is that labor product has been quit strong in the current episod  with output per hour rise an es     percent over the four quarter of last year   these develop have onc again led us to rais our es  of structur multifactor product growth   as shown in the middl left panel  we now es  that structur mfp increas     percent last year   in our view  a good part of this acceler reflect corpor action to restructur oper and elimin ineffici   such action boost the level of structur mfp and henc had onli a transitori influenc on the growth rate  we anticip some further gain of this sort in        but we also have inch up our es  of the perman compon of structur mfp growth to     percent   technolog has continu to improv in recent year  aid by rise real expenditur on research and develop  shown in the middl right panel    although the growth of real r d spend is down from the pace earli in the decad  lag effect of past increas arguabl should still be boost structur mfp growth   as you can see in the tabl at the bottom  these adjust  togeth with a few refin to our project of capit deepen  rais the growth rate of structur product to    percent in      and      and to almost     percent in       these revis carri through to our forecast of potenti output growth as well   chart   present the implic of these assumpt for the expect perform of the labor market   as we have note befor  we believ that the gain in labor product over the past year have stretch work forc beyond level that are sustain in the long run and that hire will pick up as the prospect for sale and profit improv   although we expect nonfarm payrol to be about flat over the next few month  hire averag about         per month in the first half of this year          per month in the second half  and about         per month in       as a result  actual labor product grow    percent  on averag  over the next two year   about    percentag point below it structur pace   we expect this near term weak in the labor market to result in a rise in unemploy  and we are forecast the unemploy rate to peak at     percent in the first half of this year  the unemploy rate then is project to drop back to     percent by the end of the project period as econom activ acceler   as indic in the middl left panel  this project close follow the predict of the staff model of     s law when allow is made for the teuc program  which we es  rais the unemploy rate by     percentag point   of cours  we could be wrong about our structur product assumpt  and in the  book we explor two altern structur product scenario   it is possibl that the gain in product last year were entir cyclic and that there has been no recent acceler in structur product growth  the blue line in the middl right panel    as shown in the tabl  if this    slower    mfp hypothesi were correct  real gdp growth would run below the baselin forecast  and the inflat rate would turn out higher   altern  if all of the acceler in structur mfp last year repres a perman chang in mfp growth  the red line   we would be underst the long run potenti growth rate of the economi   under the assumpt of    fa     mfp growth  real gdp growth expand at a fa  pace than in the baselin forecast  and inflat is lower   our compens project is the subject of chart     although our main measur of hour compens have paint somewhat differ pictur of compens growth in recent year   main reflect the movement of stock option realiz that are includ onli in p c compens per hour   we expect both measur to trend downward over the forecast period   this downtrend is most evid in the wage and salari compon of the employ cost index  the middl left panel  where the combin of fall inflat expect  the bottom left panel  and slack in labor market   as measur by the unemploy gap shown at the bottom right   continu to temper worker    wage demand   in contrast  we expect the rise cost of employ provid benefit  shown in the middl right panel  to offset some of the deceler in wage   rise contribut for health insur premium and a step up in employ payment to defin benefit pension plan   as the result of the declin in the stock market in the past two year   are the princip reason for the acceler   similar  as shown in chart    consum price inflat is project to slow in      and        the pce chain price index  shown in the top left panel  is forecast to rise at a    percent pace over the next two year  down about    percentag point from the pace last year   after peak in the current quarter  crude oil price are expect to declin over the project period  result in fall price for consum energi product  the blue bar in the right panel    in contrast  food price  the red bar  are expect to rise moder in the next two year   core pce inflat  the red line in the middl panel  is forecast to move lower over the next two year   as you can see in the two bottom panel  a continu wide margin of slack in product market put downward pressur on price  and this is onli partial offset by the expect updrift in non oil import price   chart   review the analysi that was sent to the committe last novemb on the macroeconom consequ of a potenti war with iraq   as you will recal  we went to great length to emphas that what we don   t know about the econom effect of such a conflict far exceed the littl that we do know   our analysi was and is intend to serv as a framework for think about this issu  and it should definit not be constru as a forecast of the conduct of the war or it quantit effect   we examin two potenti militari scenario   a success one month conflict that entail an increment budgetari cost of     billion and a success six month war that bore a     billion increment price tag   in our analysi  we did not make ani special allow for exogen confid effect  swing in risk premium  or the consequ of retaliatori terrorist attack   clear  such respons could be the key element in the macroeconom respons to a war with iraq  but lack a convinc mean of quantifi such event  we decid not to includ them   the frb us model was use to simul four war and oil price combin under the assumpt that monetari polici follow a taylor rule   in the    quick victori    scenario  the war last one month  no oil product is lost  and as shown by the red line in the middl panel  oil price drop    per barrel below baselin immedi after the conflict    oil price continu to fall gradual over  e as addit oil product come on line  eventu reach a level of     per barrel by        as you can see in the bottom panel  such a scenario give a boost to econom growth in the near term and reduc the inflat rate   in the    six month war    scenario  iraqi oil export ceas  and oil price rise     per barrel abov baselin  shown as the black line in the middl panel  in the first half of this year  price then drop back below the baselin path when the war is success conclud   there are two offset effect on real gdp growth this year   the increas in defens spend tend to push up output  while higher oil price have a depress effect  thereaft  the s ul consequ of lower oil price domin   in the third scenario  a six month war caus a shutdown of oil product in iraq and kuwait and induc sever radic state to impos a temporari oil embargo   with the more signific loss of suppli  oil price rise     per barrel abov baselin in the first half of this year  the blue line in the middl panel  befor drop back later in       under these assumpt  real gdp declin   percentag point below the baselin path this year  and inflat rise sharpli   lower oil price and interest rate eventu push real gdp growth abov baselin in      and        in the final scenario  a six month war is accompani by the loss of   million barrel per day from the world oil market for a period of three year  rais oil price     per barrel abov baselin  the   line in the middl panel    rise non opec product eventu caus oil price to fall but onli to a long run price of     per barrel
are these in real term
no  these are nomin term   in this scenario  real gdp fall this year and next  wherea inflat is higher in both year   real gdp regain some of the shortfal relat to baselin in       larg in respons to easier monetari polici   these model simul suggest two tentat conclus about the macroeconom consequ of a potenti war with iraq   first  to the extent that ani war is short  success  and result in a last increas in world oil product  the direct econom consequ are  on net  posit for the unit state   second  if the war produc advers geopolit develop that result in a persist reduct in the suppli of oil sold on world market  the direct econom consequ are negat      son will now continu with our present

occur across countri   for       the consequ for foreign output growth rang from neglig to about minus   percentag point   in       as in the unit state  the assumpt that the oil price fall below baselin by mid      result in a boost to output growth  and our model call for growth abov baselin for these foreign economi   the panel to the right give detail for the  book scenario of a     rise in the price of oil that last four quarter and that includ an addit shock to confid   in this case  the oil price rise is a bit less than assum for the limit embargo  but it last twice as long  as a consequ  the oil produc countri of mexico and canada experi this as a posit shock to output in        for the other countri  the ad confid factor signific increas the contractionari effect of the higher oil price   with oil price back to baselin in      and the effect of the shock to confid wane  output growth rebound to vari degre in most of these countri   larri will now complet our present
the final chart present your forecast for        you have revis down your project for the growth of real gdp and rais your forecast of the unemploy rate   your project for pce price this year has been lower a touch   that conclud our prepar remark  mr  chairman   we   d be happi to take ani question
i don   t have ani difficulti with the under u s   forecast   i am bedazzl by the canadian forecast   it use to be a forecast proxi by the u s  outlook  it clear isn   t today   the project for the two countri are diverg consider  it   s scarc a manufactur industri commod type of issu   the strength appear to be in domest demand  not export   so it   s not the currenc   what is it
you know  i   ve ask everi canadian economist i   ve run into over the past nine month whi canada is do so well when other countri are not   part it may be a fortuit mix in what their economi produc   canada is not as heavili high tech orient as we are  nortel notwithstand  and it did not experi the excess of the high tech bubbl to the extent that we did   so the capit overhang in that sector as a proport of their total gdp structur
is the wealth effect signific less   i ask becaus toronto   s stock price look about like our
they do  but nortel itself is a huge share of the toronto stock index  off the top of my head i can   t answer specif how larg the canadian wealth effect are  we do have es  of that   i didn   t bring them with me so i can   t tell you  but i can certain find out   anoth issu is the exchang rate   the canadian dollar  all thing consid  has been somewhat weak on a fair consist basi
shouldn   t that be show up in export demand
it should be show up in export  but it could also show up to some degre in the willing of domest produc to invest   it   s not that export haven   t been reason strong   it   s just that canada has been import as well  so the net export effect is not all that much   but export have been do their share   to some extent the perform of the auto industri is a factor   the auto industri has been a big part of the strength in the unit state  and canada share in that strength in a veri direct way   canada also has been experienc a phenomenon in the hous sector that is similar to our   that sector is veri strong  and it is support consumpt demand
has the corpor govern problem in canada mirror what has happen here  or is it signific less
i don   t know of ani specif canadian firm that have been make headlin wherea i could name some european firm  for exampl   that lead me to conclud  mere on the face of it  that it may be a bit less in canada
the reason i rais the issu is not just for the sake of entertain or interest regard what is go on in canada but becaus i think their econom perform is tell us someth   it would be veri interest to figur it out   let me give you a hypothesi   the american economi was move up reason quick until the worldcom news hit   i   m not say that that was the caus of the slowdown in our economi  i   m talk about the  e frame
the effect of the corpor govern scandal have diffus sinc then   there are some   wrightson  for one  among the wall street analyst   who claim that that was the turn point or a veri signific impact point  and inde the data are not inconsist with that   the diverg in canada emerg from that  e on   now  it   s hard conceiv that corpor govern uncertainti are of an order of magnitud that one can explain the extent of the second half weak in the unit state and  even more import  the differenti between econom growth in canada and the unit state   my interest in canada  asid from be a good neighbor  is that i think it   s tell us someth about the unit state  but i don   t know what it is
well  i might mention anoth issu that we are constant look into  i can   t claim it as a fact  but i still maintain it as a hypothesi   canada was alway a place where we were look for an acceler in product growth compar to the u s  acceler becaus of their link to us and their similar to us   it didn   t happen in the           period  it is possibl that some of the strength in canada in      and      is due a bit to the fact that their product improv is happen a littl behind our in real  e  so that it   s support their economi now   but i don   t have actual fact to back up that hypothesi
am i correct that their product growth in      was not greater than our
it was not  in part becaus their employ growth has been so strong  if one had a crystal ball and could discern the chang in structur product from the adjust compon and so forth  one could draw some conclus   we on the staff remain equal interest in and to some degre puzzl by the canadian perform   we will look into these specif issu and everyth els we can think of to tri to learn more about what is go on in canada
second  in the product analysi for the unit state we alway use to factor out capit composit  for exampl   we   ve ceas do that in the last year or two   is there ani particular reason whi
the capit composit
in other word  there was a shift toward higher valuat capit stock as differenti from the constant dollar valu
i believ that   s in there
it   s in there through the way we calcul the capit servic part of the capit deepen
i understand that   what i   m say is that you use to split it out either as a separ categori or a memo item   you tend not to do that anymor
well  i think that was mani year ago  and that   s becaus we use capit stock growth rather than capit servic and we would then make the adjust for chang in composit   but when we shift over to use capit servic  which incorpor that effect  we no longer show that separ
but you still do show the constant dollar capit stock from which one can in fact infer the differenti   what is it that you forecast   do you have it by chanc
i   m not sure i have it with me
don   t worri about it now
yes  we may have to send someth to you on that later
when you get it  just send it on   i think i have it somewher  but i can   t find it   i notic in the last sever week that the implicit cpi forecast  which is on the treasuri inflat adjust secur  jump signific   is that a technic
we   ve found over the last coupl of year that inflat compens infer from the index debt is veri sensit to oil price   a littl oversensit   so we can explain part of that by the run up in oil price
thank you   presid broaddus
i have two question  mr  chairman   one quick detail question   on the middl left panel of chart    what is the differ between the trend and the transitori compon of structur product
the trend compon was the part that we thought would persist  the transitori part reflect the level effect that we saw go on   so if a busi restructur   make some one  e effici gain that we think are go to last in term of the level of it product   we call that the transitori effect   we saw that type of restructur effect a lot last year as oppos to an ongo introduct of new technolog that would revolution the way busi oper   as we saw in the late     s   so we were tri to distinguish one effect from the other
thank   the second question i have is for    it has to do with the dollar   i   ve been on the call for the last month  and one day we had a brief discuss about the unusu natur of the current situat   in the past  in  e of great uncertainti and geopolit risk the dollar often has been consid a safe haven   money from around the world flow into dollar asset   that   s not happen this  e  in fact  the opposit seem to be happen   at one level the reason is obvious   the unit state is now a terrorist target  so we are not near as safe a haven  just in a physic sens  as we were   mayb some other thing are go on   we specul a bit in richmond that perhap there   s a concern on the part of some intern money manag that  if we get into a crisi  the unit state might freez some account   there is that risk   in ani event  it seem to me that there   s some possibl that the dollar could declin even more substanti than you   re now project   so i would ask what sort of adjust that would induc in the u s  economi   i know that   s a broad question     but if you could specul on that a littl  it would help me
well  the staff member who deal with the domest side of the economi might be better abl to answer that question   as a preliminari comment on your question  i would have to say that we   ve thought about this a fair amount  and we realli don   t have ani answer   but one of the thing that we think help the thought process is the realiz that  to the extent peopl are less interest in take on cross border exposur  it has an impact on the current account deficit   that is how that long term structur problem in the unit state interact with the geopolit situat   the euro area and the rest of the world   japan  in particular   are run a surplus vis  vis the unit state   so  let   s say investor in those area wish to take on fewer new cross border commit   given that their countri are run a current account surplus   and convers we are the deficit countri   that set up a need for asset price and exchang rate to chang in a way that will induc those investor to take on enough foreign commit to enabl the balanc of payment to balanc   to the extent that u s  investor seek to keep their fund at home  that help a bit  i think the box on chart    in the chart show illustr this point   buri in column   of that chart are both fix incom and equiti transact   foreign investor are still will to purchas claim on the unit state   they   re invest a substanti amount in the unit state   most in fix incom asset  not so much in equiti   the figur was      billion last year  base on not quit complet data   the problem is that our current account deficit is bigger than that   so a      billion inflow from investor seek to take on asset in the unit state just isn   t suffici to do the job ani longer   there   s a willing among foreign to acquir dollar asset  but a slight smaller willing than earlier   u s  investor are help by not wish  in a gross flow sens  to put asset oversea   but the rest of the world relat to us is in imbal   that would be the case even if we pull the flow of dollar invest oversea back to zero   of cours  we can make that number posit by not sell our claim in the rest of the world  so zero is not a bound in ani sens   nevertheless  the order of magnitud is such that it was a fair import factor  if you will  in financ our current account deficit last year  could it becom a whole lot higher   absolut   there is no real benchmark for how big these number might becom in the various categori if the dollar were to fall sharpli  we can look back at the episod from      to      and ask ourselv  how bad was that   the unit state did rather well  actual   the capac of the u s  economi to absorb relat price chang and to make the shift necessari is remark  i think   the u s  economi can probabl adjust to a sharpli declin dollar just fine   it would help the export sector and manufactur and other who need the help right now and  in some respect  might be just what the doctor order   my concern is that the rest of the world might not be as abl to make the counterpart adjust   so when they get what is in essenc a deflationari shock come from the exchang rate  they probabl are not go to adjust polici as quick as we would to maintain total demand as we did in      to        nor are their economi inher as abl to adjust to a chang in the mix of manufactur versus servic or the export sector versus the domest sector   so global demand may not be invari to a chang in exchang rate that shift demand from product abroad to product in the unit state   therefor  for the global economi  a sharpli fall dollar may have more advers consequ than it will have for the u s  economi
that   s a veri import issu that you   ve just point out   would you have somebodi write a short memorandum encompass the thesi and the evid support it   in other word  there   s a differenti here in term of the flexibl of adjust in the unit state and the rest of the world   it would be use to get a sens of whether that differenti has been chang in ani signific way
we will look into it and do what we can
your decomposit of multifactor product into perman and temporari compon is  i guess  larg statist   i want to push you a bit more as to whether you had direct evid on the perman of mfp growth and on technolog dynam in the u s  economi more general   you do have that graph on r d spend  but what inform do you have  for exampl  on the stock of r d invest  patent  and the diffus of innov across industri or from survey on type of innov   i note the negat impact of ventur capit dri up and those sort of factor   i   m concern about this for a coupl of reason   one is the relat issu of the extent to which innov is capit embodi   to the extent that we want to have an invest led recoveri  we   ll want to see a lot of these innov be translat into new invest   so that   s an import question  anoth issu   besid  of cours  the basic issu of the sustain of product growth   involv one of the lead altern hypothes to the geopolit risk hypothesi  which is what i call the real busi cycl theori   that theori say that perhap the technolog hype of the new economi was overst and we might have a less excit period now in term of technolog opportun  which might lead to a slower growth phase in the near futur   these are veri import issu   again  my question is  to what extent do we have more direct evid on the technolog develop of the economi
we don   t have a ton of direct evid   basic that r d graph was an attempt to get at the idea that technolog has continu to advanc in recent year but perhap not as rapid as the rate of advanc in the late      s   if one dig a littl deeper into the statist  it is appar that the growth in r d over the last coupl of year has been financ main by the feder govern   not by privat compani   by way of comparison  in      and      those number for privat compani were in the   percent growth rate rang  so as we   ve watch these develop and judgment done the pars here  the reason we   ve gravit more toward the transitori as oppos to a major ratchet up in the longer term growth rate was the fact that those trend don   t look quit as favor as befor   in addit  if we throw in the embodi hypothesi  clear the lack of an invest boom compar to what we had in the late     s should be take someth off structur product growth   that  sn   t necessarili reduc the level  but it  sn   t produc the ad impetus that it was provid   so our attempt here has been to be cautious in say how much is perman   the     percent multifactor product growth is still quit strong   it   s just not as strong as what we saw last year   in part we think there were a lot of adjust go on   some relat to the aftermath of septemb    that were uniqu to      and other that are more like to be one  e or occasion event than to be repeat consist over our forecast period   that   s the thought process that we   ve gone through
could i make a two hand intervent here   i   m rather surpris  sandi  that in respons to governor bernank   s import question you didn   t talk a littl about develop in the world of semiconductor   if one listen to folk in that industri  they cite a number of  i think  reason credibl but yet to be proven stori about their abil to build larger and larger semiconductor and to etch more capabl into these semiconductor   they go on to talk about nanotechnolog and other thing   these stori are not dramat differ from the kind of stori they were start to tell in      and      that prove to be true   so while i think the question is a quit legi  one and  as you say  veri import  there are some indic out there about the basic build block of this it boom that suggest that there still is some room
there are obvious case like that in biotechnolog also   what strike us is that today these tend to be more evolutionari in the structur of technolog than revolutionari the way they were perhap in the     s  when a whole new industri and way of do busi came into be
that   s fair  but there are still some in the industri   and this will be my last comment   who would argu that there   s still further to go
i   m not say that there isn   t further to go   that will happen  but over our forecast period  given the other condit assumpt  this is what we view as the most like scenario
do you do ani kind of sector breakdown of your mfp project
thank you  mr  chairman   let me shift to the intern arena   i think two veri import event occur ye day that affect which of the like iraq scenario will play out   one was obvious the state of the union speech by the presid   the other  which may be equal import  was that presid putin of russia gave a clear signal that the russian are shift their view   if they do shift  the european power that have been give us a bad  e in the unit nation will be face with becom irrelev  which usual get their attent   therefor  i think it is veri like that we will have the one month success war scenario sooner rather than later   as laid out  and i have no disput with that  i think that is veri good news econom   in my view what this committe will be think about next year  the year after  and five year from now is what the longer term effect of that will be on the islam arab world   you will recal that in the sixteenth centuri  laughter     speaker      we   re get on a bit from that period
the west  after be subservi to a predomin and power islam world  began to modern   the islam world had a choic of either compet or of retreat into religion and an unwilling to modern   that has continu ever sinc   iraq is the seat of civil as we know it  never mind islam civil   it is the great intellectu leader of arab and islam thought   a success war in iraq  if it were to bring about a chang in iraq that look anyth like a modern regim  would have a great shock effect of the rest of the arab islam world   what we don   t know  first of all  is whether the chang would just involv saddam be replac by a more benevol general  in which case there would be veri littl effect
the saudi   s abdullah last week start to rais the question of arab reform
inde   that   s exact where i   m go   if there is a success modern regim and there is reform  that would be wonder   the question is  will the reform be benign   will it take place over an order period of  e  therefor allow that part of the world to modern and becom a seat of stabil and of growth for the world  or will we see regim that simpli are not capabl of chang and thus will be toppl  in which case we could have year after year in this committe a question of what is go to happen in the oil produc area   i think we have to rememb that  that   s not go to affect us for the rest of this year or mayb next year  but it will be a challeng to the committe over  e  let me shift to anoth area  follow up on the exchang rate discuss   one of the thing that the dollar   s strength depend on   against the background of a huge  and in my view unsupport over  e  current account deficit   is whether the peopl of the world have confid in world leadership  which is not complet but veri larg american leadership  for whatev reason  our leadership is not provid a veri clear view of the way we would like to see the world economi function   some  when that happen  peopl do some veri unfortun thing  so  my question is to    and it relat to what is go on in south america at the moment   the intern monetari fund has decid   their staff was push by the member nation to do someth that the staff think is unwis  and i agre with them   to reward argentina for a violat of the most basic rule of law  which is that one is suppos to pay one   s debt   argentina has been reward by a rollov of it oblig so it can pretend to be current with the imf and other intern institut   at the same  e  across the river plata  the uruguayan have been tri veri hard to do the right thing   not quit make it but certain put forth a veri good effort   but the imf has decid that uruguay may not be abl to pay it debt in a coupl of year  so whi not have uruguay declar default now   i might just add that the econometr model use by the fund in this analysi have condit that probabl would make the unit state look potenti bankrupt   put those two case togeth   one countri   everyth wrong and is reward by the imf say we   ll roll over your debt   the other poor littl countri tri to do everyth right   and like the rest of us isn   t perfect   and the imf decid that it will not allow them to pay their debt but  in effect  requir them to default  let   s move slight north into lula da silva   s brazil   when the intern communiti is say to one nation that it   s okay if you don   t pay your debt   and to anoth that if you tri like the devil to pay your debt and aren   t quit perfect  you should default   whi should brazil jump through hoop and pay it debt   they can figur that out   my question is this   is anybodi in this capit at the intern monetari fund or anywher els realiz what i   m convinc is a signal to all the emerg market countri that the rule have chang
you   ve paint the pictur in it extrem form  shall we say  for the sake of the discuss
it sound factual to me    laughter
the sad part is that it   s exagger but factual
yes   let me put one addit fact on the tabl and then tri to give some kind of answer   brazil   s biggest debt problem are the debt that the brazilian owe to other brazilian   so the consequ for wall street or the industri countri of default by brazil vis  vis uruguay differ   default by brazil  sn   t realli translat into a direct answer as to how within brazil to reconcil the pressur for meaning chang in incom distribut  in opportun  in govern polici  and a host of other region and structur kind of problem   given the oblig of one brazilian to anoth that exist on paper now  how can that whole situat be work out and not break down into other problem   the situat could lead to violenc  unilater default on some piec of debt  or behavior on the part of the govern that throw into question the stabil of other facet of the social structur   that realli is a much bigger problem than what brazil owe the rest of the world  and that   s the problem i think they   re realli grappl with  set asid brazil  howev  there is this issu of whi other countri   ecuador  to pick a countri almost at random   won   t somehow think the rule have chang   i don   t minim this problem that you have pose  but i guess i would use slight differ word to describ what was done for argentina   argentina was not go to pay it debt on januari     januari     decemb     or ani other date one could name   in no meaning sens was argentina go to pay the imf or anybodi els   so the question for the imf was  how do we recogn that fact and tri to get ourselv in a posit where what happen subsequ in      will have the best chanc of be construct   right or wrong  the g   govern felt it was more like that the new govern in argentina could be work with to fo  construct develop with respect to the countri   s long term problem if the fiction were maintain for a littl while longer that argentina was not in default to the imf    it was not entir the unit state push this view  although this countri was certain on that side  but it was the italian  the spanish  and other   so that was done   on the surfac of it  i wouldn   t realli disagre with that   i don   t know that forc the crisi into januari  given that we still haven   t seen the sort out in the polit parti in argentina as to who is go to run in the elect for presid   and we certain haven   t had the elect   would have made for a better outcom  but as you mention  there are spillov effect in term of how it was done  and in some respect those have creat veri real problem  it is certain true  and it is symptomat of whi argentina is where it is today  that the pictur paint in the argentin press was that it had look the imf in the eye and the imf had blink   as far as i know  the argentin politician drew that conclus  too   so until somebodi is prepar to hit those peopl over the head with a b  and tell them that this isn   t the way the world work  this is go to continu   if you have ani b  handi   laughter  i invit you to do it becaus that   s whi   a year and a half into the crisi   the argentin still haven   t figur out who   s go to pay even a piec of the bill  wherea at this point in  e the asian are busi grow again   the problem is larg within argentina  it   s a polit problem  and peopl are still danc around it   the unit state is obvious in a veri difficult situat becaus it   s hard to do the b  throw without look like a heavi to somebodi  particular to the peopl hit on the head with a b    the chanc of it somehow all come out favor don   t look good
we can have an amend to the sarban oxley bill to the effect that the account is to appli to the imf as well as everybodi els
well  it   s a tough situat
just as a footnot  i think     s answer is what one would have to say  it   s the right answer   in these countri when you forbear  you appeas the worst of their politician  and you discourag the one   they may be somewher   who are sensibl enough to do the right thing   so the like next presid of argentina probabl is go to be weaker as a result of this action than he or she would have been if the action had been tougher   that   s i think the ul  tragedi
you know  an actual default chang noth   a good part of the issu involv the intern polit of the imf and the need to replenish capit in the event of loss  which get to the taxpay of the g    and that is not an insignific element in their decis   i am correct that the staff at the imf was not enthusiast about this decis
the staff at the imf want a real program   if it was go to be call a program  they want it to have teeth   inde  the manag director had been told origin  when he first took offic  that the imf was go to have smaller program and that it was go to be more realist and firmer in conduct these type of negoti   then he is confront with the situat in turkey and after that argentina  and it   s veri clear that consist is not exact at a high point
thank you   circl back from those lofti question  i have a relat mundan one on the risk to your forecast and the outlook   it has to do with the consum  who has been veri import to our economi   s abil to maintain itself through this difficult  e   if one look on chart   at what i   ll call the debt burden ratio of consum payment  it is near at a record high   with interest rate at a record low   look ahead  if in fact our economi begin to pick up  the expect is for interest rate to increas  and there will be a migrat into a heavier debt burden   depend on other circumst  of cours  includ incom growth and so forth   sinc the consum   s role has been so import and sinc it will be a factor go forward  how do you assess the downsid risk there  given that debt burden  which as you note in your open remark peopl are concern about
well  the simplest answer is that empir we   ve never actual been abl to find a relationship between debt burden and consum spend at the aggreg level  we attempt to look at some of these data at a more disaggreg level  and the bottom left panel is one way of tri to do that   as i point out earlier  the debt burden level are far higher for the upper incom consum  much of the action has occur in the upper decil  where we think there   s a larg cushion to protect against incom disrupt  we also look at the survey of consum financ to see  for exampl  if there had been ani chang between the      survey and the      survey in the data on the household that are late make their payment   at the aggreg level we didn   t see ani real chang in payment problem   we did see an increas  howev   and this perhap goe to your question   in difficulti in make payment for the lower incom  low wealth  younger household   i think the categori was those under the age of     which to me is quit young  so  there are clear household for which this is a problem  but we don   t have the sens that it is go to be a widespread problem   as i said  empir we don   t see evid   in the aggreg anyway   that debt burden matter for pce   it may well be that it     we just can   t find a relationship
obvious  from a broader perspect  one can say that there are some downsid risk associ with the consum sector   we are expect a veri weak labor market over the first part of the year   there are alreadi some sign of concern in the household sector  and those concern could be compound by a continu rise in the unemploy rate and lack of ani percept growth in payrol employ   on top of that is the fact that we think household are still in the process of adjust to the hit that their balanc sheet has taken  on our forecast of a relat benign stock market go forward  we see some stabil of wealth to incom  so we   re expect the effect of that hit to wane   but it still would have to constitut a downsid risk  apropo of our discuss ye day regard model uncertainti in polici  it   s clear that if we get into a situat where the economi is begin to improv and interest rate are rise  some of the amelior effect of low interest rate on consum debt burden will begin to wane   but that might just mean that we   ll need less of an increas in interest rate to produc the kind of restraint ul  desir and not necessarili that it would trigger a contract in the household sector   that suggest that you may be confront with not know exact how big a reaction you will get in term of aggreg demand from the rise in interest rate that ul  may be necessari   that will be a question you   ll have to face in determin your polici respons
thank you  mr  chairman   after these veri larg issu i have a rather mundan one   i   ve been struck in recent week and month by the movement in commod price  and i note particular the chart on commod price on page    in part   of the  book   it look as if the commod price increas realli took hold perhap a littl befor the exchang rate start to move   to what extent are these dollar increas in commod price outrun what can be explain by the exchang rate per se   that is  is a worldwid increas in commod price  as measur in euro and other currenc  take place  and what are the implic  if ani  if that observ is correct
well  it   s certain true that commod price are up a bit in some categori   i don   t have them correct in an sdr basket or the like  although i could do that at some point just to see what it show   but we would suggest that the increas are occur select in certain categori where for the most part we think we can explain it on the basi of special factor   we don   t see it as a lead indic of a global recoveri or someth of that sort   in a few of the agricultur commod   cotton and some other that are probabl spell out in the  book  but i don   t have them memor   suppli side disappoint or crop failur or the like have caus price to go up   those categori   in contrast to the metal  say   are the one in which we   ve seen price rise   that suggest to us that this chart reflect more or less a weight averag of a number of market specif  idiosyncrat develop
steel scrap is a major one   it spot price have risen dramat   in the metal compon of the general commerc index
presid pool  we also think that it   s probabl an indic that the veri modest improv we believ is occur in industri product is in fact happen  in some sens  i think it reflect more than just the dollar effect   our sens is that it   s also signal that the soft we saw in industri product earlier in the fall has probabl abat some and that these price have becom relat firm   they are reason well correl with industri activ
i have some mundan issu as well   first  i guess i   m struck by how much stronger the second half of this year and      are in the  book forecast than in the major of other forecast  such as that of dri   particular for      the staff   s number are way out there   second  each of the factor in chart   that larri went through   the forc shape the outlook   seem to me to have a fair amount of downsid risk   it   s hard for me to see the upsid risk on ani of them   we were talk earlier about consum spend   i think hous wealth is even more of a factor in peopl   s spend   if wealth is a factor in spend   than equiti market   now  given the sale data that have come out in the last coupl of day  mayb these chart need to be redon  but i   ve seen some work that suggest that the valu of hous wealth may be level off   that rais the question of whether the boost to spend we   ve seen from refinanc  at least the part that stem from increas in hous wealth  will continu   that   s one element of concern i have  anoth issu is the s ulus associ with past chang to monetari polici   how much is still there  and how much will be there  particular as we get to        as for expansionari fiscal polici  the fiscal impetus that the staff show in the chart in the bottom left hand panel is stronger in      than is project for       even with the tax cut   moreov  i thought the attitud in the  book with regard to the agoni that state and local govern are go through was quit dismiss   yes  they still have some reserv that they can spend  but they are all go to have to cut back expenditur sharpli unless this economi pick up the way you say it   s go to pick up and their revenu realli start to grow   i   m just wonder how these four factor are weight in your assess of the outlook and where you see some upsid risk on them
i   ll start  and other can join in   first  let me make a brief comment on our forecast versus those of mani outsid   it   s hard to know exact  but i think one of the main differ between our forecast and mani of the outsid forecast   especi when we   re talk about        is our product assumpt   we clear have a stronger assumpt and that feed through in a varieti of way
let me go through a coupl of the other issu you rais and tri to address some of them   the main question you ask was  in effect  where are the upsid risk in this forecast   if i were to go through the upsid risk  an import one would be capit spend   the point of chart   on capit spend was to show that it would actual by itself be consid fair conserv in term of what we have the growth of capit stock do   there is a lot of potenti there on the upsid if busi realli were to becom convinc that a strong recoveri was in place and they felt comfort about the outlook go forward   the rate of return on invest seem to be high  certain that   s consist with our product forecast be veri high   they   re relat  but my point is that it  sn   t requir just that product assumpt to get the possibl of a strong upsid on capit spend if this pessim lift
compar with other forecast of p e  the staff forecast alreadi has a strong number
grant   but you   re ask for the upsid risk  and i   m just say that i think there is some upsid risk there
so you think it could be even stronger
it certain could be stronger  and that would be an import risk i would point to   is there a possibl that we   ve been low ball product growth   perhap  i wouldn   t put a lot of weight on that one   as for the s ulus associ with past chang in monetari polici  we still have some s ulus in train   i forget the exact number  but i think it   s in the rang of someth like    percentag point increment go forward for a while befor it final   out   as you know  our fiscal polici assumpt is just that   an assumpt   i don   t know what more to say about that in term of upsid or downsid risk  now  let me briefli comment on the state and local govern situat  if i may   that clear is a possibl sourc of restraint in the forecast  and we have built fiscal restraint into this forecast from the state and local sector   we   ve built it in both by lower the growth of state and local govern spend to the level we were see in the     s   the last  e they went through difficulti   and by make adjust on the tax side as well in their revenu stream   so we   ve actual put in a dose of fiscal restraint from that sector  recogn exact the problem that you   ve highlight   i think dave   has some comment that he want to make as well
actual  on the fiscal polici side  i see the risk as more to the upsid than the downsid   we   ve built in less s ulus than the democrat have propos and less than the administr has propos   if our forecast is correct  we will have an economi in which the unemploy rate is go to be rise   in that circumst  i believ there   s a consider possibl that we could get a signific further dose of fiscal s ulus   so i think there are upsid risk associ with that  on the structur product issu  i would just mention   as exot as this might look   that our statist filter model actual would want to put in even more growth than we did  base on the cours of product over the past year   now  those model were fool in the earli     s when the growth of product pick up  a develop they interpret as a bigger step up in structur product than in fact turn out to be the case   inde  much of that step up prove to be cyclic   so we feel quit comfort that we have discount that evid   but i think there are risk on both side of that  i   d say one other thing  too  which is that look at the forecast and the risk associ with it simpli in term of the gdp growth rate is not the onli way to look at it   we revis up both the suppli side and the demand side in this forecast   in fact  this is a project in which the gdp gap is larger than befor   there is more slack implicit in the economi over the next two year than we had in the forecast last  e  we show a higher unemploy rate and a larger gdp gap   so it would be wrong to think about this as just a stori of strength   one could look at it the other way around and say that this is a stori of some addit slack  in part becaus we think there will be product gain in the short run that will lead to this higher unemploy rate   so in that regard there are risk on both side of this  again  as i think we tri to make clear in the  book  we recogn that in this outlook there   s a lot of tension between the near term weak that we can actual measur and the strength that we   re show in the second half of the year   that pickup requir a lot of thing to happen in the same direct in the second half of this year   dissip of the pessim  a big dose of fiscal s ulus  and a reduct in the wealth effect that we think current are exert a drag on the economi   it would be hard for us to know whether all those thing would be concentr in the begin of the second half  around midyear  or whether some would occur later   some could be acceler and other stretch out to produc a forecast that may have as much growth over the next two year on net  but it may be distribut differ   either signific delay or pull forward   there   s not a lot of evid to go on  in part becaus we   re so unsur about the lift of the uncertainti and gloom   we   re talk here about when and to what extent a residu   that is  what we don   t know about in the invest area over the last coupl of year   goe away   we face consider risk there in both  e and magnitud
we just don   t have a lot of scienc that we can bring to bear here
okay  ani further question   if not  who would like to start our roundtabl   presid parri
thank you  mr  chairman   the twelfth district economi continu to expand in recent week but at a veri modest pace   consum turn in a disappoint perform dure the holiday  and earli number for januari suggest that they remain hesit and price conscious   one retail consult character the current environ as a    race to the bottom     with consum will to hold out until they get good at cost   retail have respond   offer near continu sale  rebat  financ incent  and price guarante   district busi also are look for bargain  especi in real estat and it support servic   one commerci landlord said he field daili call from tenant threaten to move if their leas rate are not lower   a contract manag at sun microsystem report increas pressur to lower price for long term servic contract and one  e technic support  now  let me say a few word about the state budget crise   the genesi of these crise  not onli in the west but elsewher as well  appear to be over op ist revenu expect and  to a lesser extent  cost overrun   revenu are run well below expect  with especi larg shortfal in state depend on capit gain revenu   on the cost side  medicaid seem to be the main culprit due to rapid increas in prescript drug price and provid fee   although a recent survey of state governor found that twenti four believ their fiscal crisi is the worst in the nation  it appear that thing are especi bad in the twelfth district    laughter   district state account for approxim    percent of gross state product  but they account for about one half of the es  total state budget shortfal in the unit state   of cours  california   s gap is the largest       billion or     billion depend on whom you talk to   and that   s for both this and the next fiscal year  while these budget shortfal pose signific challeng for state lawmak  their econom impact is less clear   for one thing  es  budget shortfal repres the differ between desir spend and current revenu   they do not repres budget deficit  therefor  they typic overst the tax increas and cut in spend that are requir to balanc the budget   for exampl  california has a project shortfal  at least as project by the governor  of     billion   but it actual face a deficit of     billion   for anoth  state usual spread the pain of budget deficit over sever year  temper the immedi impact on state spend and employ growth   that be said  there are real cost to such larg budget shortfal   california   s bond rate was downgrad in part becaus of the announc of a     billion budget shortfal   with the recent downgrad  rate agenc now score california   s current fiscal crisi as equival to that face dure the state   s sever recess in the earli     s   moreov  the state face sever cash flow problem  so it probabl will need to take on more debt to meet current payment oblig   on the brighter side  export and import breath a sigh of relief last week on word that a new west coast port contract had been sign  turn to the nation economi  obvious recent data have been mix  with employ and industri activ on the weak side and consum spend do fair well  on balanc  though  the data have been somewhat disappoint   our forecast for this year look a lot like the one in the  book   we   ve revis down our es  of real gdp growth in the fourth and current quarter about   percentag point  to    percent and     percent respect   assum a constant fund rate this year  the most like scenario for the third and fourth quarter is that real gdp growth will rise abov the potenti rate by    to   percent  depend on what happen with fiscal polici   the excess capac in the economi bring consum inflat down at a gradual pace  and inflat in the core pce price index fall to about    percent in       i have some concern about this outlook   first  of cours  the long anticip pickup in growth has yet to materi   this pickup seem to depend import on an acceler in busi fix invest occur befor consum spend falter   the longer the growth has to depend on the auto and hous sector  the riskier the situat becom especi in the context of geopolit uncertainti   second  even the project expans is modest at best  and it still would leav the economi with excess capac through the end of next year   this bring me to my third concern   our forecast also would leav us with an inflat rate next year that   s below   percent after take out the es  bias   in my view  that inflat rate is slight on the low side  to see how these concern play out in the longer run forecast  we ran a number of perfect foresight simul as in the bluebook   we use a coupl of differ model  includ frb us  and some altern assumpt about fomc polici prefer  includ differ assumpt about interest rate smooth and also the degre of respons to the output gap   in all case where we assum a target for measur core pce inflat of     percent  the op  polici involv signific near term fund rate decreas   these simul nice captur the implic of our current situat   we have excess capac  prospect for onli a modest increas in real gdp growth  and a fair low inflat rate   ad ani downsid risk for econom activ to this pictur would onli strengthen the argument that perhap a further eas of polici might be appropri befor too much more  e pass   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   our district economi has been fair sluggish overal sinc the last meet  and i have a sens that there probabl has been some deterior in both household and busi confid   the cold weather may be part of it   it was colder in myrtl beach the other day than in anchorag  if i   m not mistaken    laughter   i think concern about iraq is restrain household and busi spend in our region as elsewher in the countri   consum spend in our district seem to have follow what i understand to be the same pattern that has been report for other part of the countri   general weak holiday sale but a reviv of automobil sale in decemb as some of the incent program were reintroduc   we have a director in charlott who run a huge car dealership in north  ina   he said that decemb was a spectacular month   he   s a pretti sharp guy  and he specul   i guess base on convers he   s had with some of his custom   that peopl are defer or even forgo purchas of other major item in order to take advantag of the car deal befor they go away again  labor market  in keep with what i   ve alreadi said  appear to have soften further in our area   we hear more report of layoff   unemploy rate are rise in all of our district state   the major of the layoff are at factori  and general manufactur remain rather weak in our region   in such an environ  not surpris  the inform we have on busi invest suggest that it   s still quit soft   we have heard a few report of increas spend on comput for upgrad and that sort of thing  but noth much beyond that   the onli vigor and bright spot in the district is hous  on the nation economi  mayb in some contrast to bob parri  i think the staff has made a good case   both in the  book and also in respons to cathi   s question a minut ago   for it project   the  book forecast as a point forecast is as plausibl as ani i can think of   it basic say that the recoveri will gradual  or mayb a bit more than gradual  strengthen over the project period   as i see it  the two princip under fundament that support the forecast are the same two main factor that have been support the recoveri  such as it is  up to this point   an accommod monetari polici and strong product growth  we have eas monetari polici substanti over the last two year as a whole  includ the most recent move in novemb   i think  as the  book say  there   s a good chanc that we haven   t seen the full impact of that yet  with respect to product growth  as has alreadi been suggest here today  obvious there   s no guarante that the elev structur product growth of recent year will continu this year and next year   on the other hand  i don   t see ani strong compel or obvious reason to think that it won   t continu   i believ there   s a good chanc that it will continu for reason that you mention  mr  chairman  in your speech on product to the aei in octob of last year   if it    that would support continu strong growth of dispos household incom and spend and presum at some point would s ul  or at least help to s ul  busi invest   anoth sourc of support is the fiscal s ulus   i wouldn   t give as much weight to that as i think the staff    but certain it   s in the right direct  nevertheless  i consid the  book   s point forecast plausibl   i also think that the confid interv around it is symmetr but exceed wide  main becaus of iraq  we   ve had some discuss of this alreadi   it   s rare  at least in my memori  that the near term econom outlook has been so heavili depend on the prospect and  e of one conting event   if we invad in the next few week and the war is short  success  and decis  both busi invest and the overal recoveri could strengthen quick and mark   i enjoy veri much the part of the chart show that dealt with that   also  we could get the same result if somehow this impass is resolv without an invas  there is still some small possibl of that  though it  sn   t seem veri like now   but in either of those situat i think our current polici stanc would be much too accommod  howev  if we do invad and the war trigger some other crisi like anoth terrorist attack somewher  then confid could be erod further  busi could continu to restrain invest  and the recoveri then would becom even more vulner to some of the downsid risk that have been mention here today   in such a situat  we might need to eas further  and we might need to do so aggress   or preemptiv if i may use that word   even take account of some of the tradeoff and tough choic we   d have to make  as we discuss ye day   in ani case  given the unusu degre of uncertainti in the outlook and the wide rang of possibl  the key point for polici   particular against the background of our discuss ye day and with all due respect to prudenc   is that we may have to adjust polici substanti and prompt in one direct or the other in the month ahead   in my view we need to be prepar for that possibl
mr  chairman  my comment are go to sound fair familiar   the situat hasn   t chang much sinc the last  e we met   the district economi has been and continu to be sluggish   there aren   t a lot of sign of improv sinc our last meet  manufactur activ  from what we   ve observ in the region  actual weaken somewhat in decemb  disappoint us given the growth that we had seen in octob and novemb  product and new order both move back below year ago level after firm in octob  consum spend has been sluggish sinc the last meet  and in most area holiday retail sale were flat compar with a year ago despit some heavi discount   i had a convers with an owner of major shop mall in the midwest   in kansa citi  denver  and elsewher   and i found his comment about the post christma season interest   he said that he thought sale were pretti robust in the first week of januari   but sinc then  in the last two week  they   ve drop off dramat   retail activ is just dead  and he hasn   t been abl to figur out whi   it is a concern becaus that pattern is not uniqu to one citi   it has occur throughout the midwest  though denver in particular has been veri hard hit in term of a slowdown  our commerci real estat sector is depress  with a number of vacanc as well as a lot of space that is be leas but not use   we have some real issu there   hous activ  as elsewher  continu to be the bright spot in the district except in colorado  where a slowdown has develop even though price haven   t adjust yet to that slowdown   i don   t know whether that   s come  but i suspect it is   energi activ in the district actual has been flat despit the oil price increas  and that   s becaus no one know exact where that price is go to go   mani feel it could easili plummet  and if it    no one want to be in the posit of have made that kind of capit invest   so activ in that sector has remain relat slow   wage and price pressur are larg subdu  there   s noth uniqu on that front  on the nation scene  i realli can   t quibbl with the  book  given the level of uncertainti   as we   ve note  the fact is that monetari polici is s ul  and fiscal polici is like to be   anoth posit is that financi market condit  given the econom situat we are wit  are relat strong compar with what they   ve been in the past   so the market are in a posit to fo  strengthen econom activ   i  too  see the issu as the fact that the risk on both the upsid and downsid are bound to be so much larger than usual  we could have a veri good takeoff or a real slowdown   that is the situat we   re face with  whether the outcom is to the upsid or the downsid  i think perhap the new phrase for polici that may come from all of this is    prudent bold      but for the  e be we   re look at possibl on both side  and i think we   re in a posit to wait and see   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ remain sluggish in our southea n region through decemb and earli januari this year   mani of our regular contact in those sector that are still see littl or no rebound are say     what recoveri     someon i talk with recent dust off an old southern countri boy express when he said that he just hope the econom situat  sn   t deterior into a hog wallow   i   ll translat that into citi boy languag dure the break  but i think you get the idea  our region bright spot and soft spot reflect the nation pictur in most respect   our contact at the corpor headquart of up in atlanta was help in piec togeth the pictur of christma holiday sale   as we all know and have talk about at various  e  there have been signific chang in where peopl shop   the tradit mall retail are lose market share to discount and the internet   up   s chief financi offic told us that their internet relat deliveri were up some    percent from year ago level   despit those big gain  and i guess they were on a small base  everyth we know suggest that holiday sale in our region were about flat compar with a year ago  with late in the season spend help to save the day   the pattern of later shop sure has multipl explan  but we would suggest that it may be addit evid of the broader pattern of uncertainti and postpon commit that we   re see elsewher in the economi  job growth in our region has been stubborn absent   in our district  the manufactur sector  which is still a bit larger as a proport of total employ than is the case nation  the extent of job loss and the signific of those loss are veri differ between durabl and nondur manufactur   durabl good manufactur employ declin by a somewhat smaller percentag than for the nation  main becaus our district   s durabl good firm are less concentr in industri and electron equip   in contrast  though  nondur good manufactur employ fare somewhat wors than in the nation  much of the employ loss there were from plant close rather than reduc hour and shift   so the job recoveri in that sector   not look veri promis  not surpris  the other major problem we   re see   and other have alreadi highlight it   is the condit of state and local financ   deficit and budget problem abound becaus ramp up spend dure the late     s was not curtail quick enough as condit deterior   it   s our sens that the hurt at the state and local level  and consequ implic for econom drag  may be even greater than portray in the  book   although our state may be small and bob parri   s explan may be what is most import  at least in our six state the veri real tax increas and spend reduct look to be quit signific  there are the continu bright spot   residenti construct remain healthi and strong  with no earli sign of slowdown   current mortgag rate should sustain the high level of activ  although the potenti for a further pickup in that activ is question in my view  commerci construct is anoth stori   with the current high vacanc rate  at the present rental rate it   s hard to see a meaning bounceback any  this year   our tourism industri continu to see a slow  steadi recoveri  although tourism is still not back to the level in       busi travel and convent busi have not recov at a commensur rate   so our region pictur is veri mix   as i   ve said befor  our region is not get the special earli recoveri bounc that has often led the nation at this point in past cycl  at the nation level i keep look for the expect sign that help is on the way   that those sector that have yet to get some traction are begin to come back   i   ve been tri to practic my own advic of be patient   all thing consid  i do share the broad view that the economi will continu to improv and that the recoveri will becom more broad base as we move through      and beyond   at the same  e  my staff and i are a bit less convinc than the  book author that we   ll see such strong a recoveri as earli as later this year  while we do see some pickup beyond the earli part of the year  there may be some good reason   alreadi point out by other   to be somewhat cautious about expect a quick and larg bounc   fourth quarter profit number are just come in and so far seem to be show modest improv compar with year ago level and are up signific in some sector  howev  i   m less certain about the assum strength of product growth and the further growth in hous activ and busi invest in the near term that is embed in the  book forecast for the second half of the year  the initi level out in labor market last year is begin to seem extend   lot of busi peopl i talk with still seem to be veri  veri focus on further cost reduct  with more job cut and delay hire a big part of that focus   while certain there must now be consider pent up demand for addit staff to reliev some of the    do more with less    mode that busi have been in  it may be awhil longer befor the unemploy rate move down and the economi get a posit kick from sustain employ growth  despit the polit pressur to do someth on the fiscal side   and despit dave     s assert that the fiscal assumpt embed in the staff forecast are quit modest   it   s not clear to me that the fiscal s ulus we   ll get will be target and  e to affect the near term slack in the economi   in fact  i   m actual a littl encourag that there seem to be some debat about the longer term negat consequ of certain specif fiscal action  final  as has been note repeat  how the war worri will play out is still not complet clear   at least for awhil longer  that overhang and the relat short term run up in oil price are not help and are mask what might otherwis be develop in the real economi  for all those reason  we see growth in      as more modest than in the staff forecast  with less of a sharp pickup toward the end of the year   still  with monetari s ulus alreadi in place and at least some addit fiscal s ulus probabl come  with more and more imbal and excess have been work off  and with the prospect that geopolit drag will eventu becom less worrisom  we think we   re on a reason path at the moment  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district general appear to have remain soft in decemb and januari   our contact    expect for      are mix  although perhap a littl better than a month ago   so let me start with the good news  the automobil industri end anoth veri strong sale year with a flurri of activ in decemb   while light vehicl sale appar slow in januari  our contact at each of the big three have told us that the declin has been in line with their expect  reflect the expir of incent and sale pull ahead into decemb   the major issu for      is the contract negoti with the uaw    key issu of content are like to be capac reduct and health care cost  in the chicago purchas manag    report for januari  which won   t be releas to the public until friday  the overal index move up from      to     which is abov the consensus es  of      order and product in particular increas   the employ compon  howev  still remain veri weak   in heavi equip industri  some of our contact are expect a pickup in product in the near term   they believ that final user will want new equip soon   at a minimum for replac purpos   and they know their distributor    inventori are veri lean   we   ve also heard from produc of machin tool and heavi truck that they are receiv more request for price quot   still  apart from the new chicago pmi that i mention  we   ve seen few tangibl sign of a broad base sustain recoveri in our manufactur sector  in term of the not so good news  most retail were disappoint with holiday sale  and it appear that littl has chang so far this year   retail remain cautious about order and continu to be aggress in discount merchandis   in addit  both of the major temporari help firm headquart in our district    and manpow  were less op ist than a month ago   one  who last month saw a few sign of strengthen labor demand in manufactur  is now character his busi as    inch forward      the other  who last month was alreadi pessimist  think the recoveri actual has stall   neither thought they were close to see the robust growth their industri experienc follow the         recess   with regard to the overal employ pictur  manpow   s nation index of hire intent for the second quarter will be somewhat lower than for the first quarter   that index figur is preliminari at this point and won   t be releas for quit some  e   not until februari     turn to the nation outlook  as we all know  the news sinc our last meet has been mix   we   ve been in a slow period  and it   s alway difficult to be upbeat when we   re receiv negat employ report and the like   nevertheless  as i just note  the anecdot from most of our manufactur contact   while still not rosi   are not as full of doom and gloom as they were last fall   i hope that this is a sign that busi are work through some of the uncertainti they face over the past year and that this process will soon show through as increas in payrol or solid gain in invest   such a turnaround by the busi sector is import becaus the recent labor market weak certain increas one   s concern about the abil of the household sector to continu lead the expans  which we discuss earlier  as was note  further declin in employ can make household more cautious about spend   to be sure  the ongo strength in motor vehicl sale and hous activ indic that  at least for now  household feel confid enough about job secur to take on commit associ with the big ticket purchas   but i wonder how long this confid and spend will be maintain if job growth  sn   t resum soon   still  like the  book  i see the retrench of the household sector as more of a risk to the forecast than a factor to build into our baselin assumpt   import  the expans continu to be support by the thing we   ve talk about   our accommod monetari polici and product gain  which provid the underpin for profit and real incom   and  of cours  although the legisl debat has a long way to go  i think it is like that we will get a boost to aggreg demand from fiscal polici  take all these factor into consider  our forecast for      is that real gdp growth will be in the rang of   to     percent  somewhat lower than in the  book  and that inflat will edg down
thank you  mr  chairman   not a lot has chang in the new england region   labor market remain relat weak with continu job loss most in massachusett   such loss continu to be most sever in manufactur  with other industri show margin gain and loss   unemploy did trend down slight in novemb  and it remain well below the nation level   this recent chang  howev  appar was due to a declin in the size of the labor forc  which we and other analyst presum was a result of discourag about job prospect  residenti real estat market continu to hold up surpris well  with      seen as like to have been the strongest year for singl famili home sale in record massachusett state histori   commerci real estat remain moribund  howev  with the boston market particular affect   region consum confid fell sharpli in decemb   both current and futur expect were affect   and is now below the level reach in the aftermath of septemb      busi confid rose a bit  howev  and may be one indic of a glimmer of a hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel   local manufactur report littl chang in demand over the past few month   nonetheless  they seem more confid about the potenti for futur growth  and some believ that they might be abl to beat current expect  similar  a lead indic index for the region point to posit growth over the next six month   not larg but enough to suggest that we might be approach a turn point  meet of the bank   s academ advisori council and a group of invest manag that i see regular echo similar downbeat messag about the current state of the economi and the market   both group emphas the mani uncertainti both of a geopolit natur and about the natur of this slow recoveri   the academ saw a need to eas polici  even with the fiscal s ulus propos by the administr  to deal with what they saw as a widen output gap in the context of declin inflat   the invest manag saw similar weak and market uneas  with dim prospect for profit growth in       but they thought that further monetari eas would do noth to increas busi invest or decreas uncertainti  in fact  they felt it might increas uncertainti  as i look at the nation scene  i find myself a bit torn between the perspect of these two group   at the last meet i believ that uncertainti was eas a bit  that credit and equiti market condit had becom more hospit  and that the begin of some op  about busi spend might be in the work   the incom data  howev  have definit been on the soft side in my view  with equiti market hit low point  job loss mount  and busi spend appar flat   onli the consum with his seem insati demand for hous and car seem to be keep up his end of the bargain  though confid read and the slide in equiti market suggest some concern about futur soft in consum spend as well  our near term forecast is not unlik the  book   s   almost no growth in q  and a pickup to modest rate of growth in the first half of this year   but then we differ  in part becaus the assum path of fiscal polici in the  book is more s ul  take into account as it   the like effect of the administr   s propos   even when that is ad back in  howev  we don   t get quit the bounceback evid in the  book forecast of the second half of      and certain not as much as in        this reflect  we think  the degre to which reduc uncertainti seem to affect the  book forecast   this reduct occur in the first half of this year and it posit effect are felt in the second half   clear  uncertainti is a major factor in the econom outlook   what will caus that uncertainti to subsid  howev  is difficult to determin   will the go no go decis about war make busi more confid about the futur   or will the economi   s current soft patch have to show real sign of firm to achiev that end   or  as dave   suggest ye day  are these two sourc of uncertainti so intertwin that it   s hard to tell one from the other   i wish i could answer that question  as i think it is critic to assess the risk in the  book forecast   as you   ve probabl infer from my question earlier  i do see the risk most on the downsid   i don   t see a wide error band on the upsid  that take me to the quandari pose by the differ perspect of my academ council on one hand and the invest group on the other   the academ were urg pro activ further eas  use logic not unlik that which we discuss ye day in the interest rate smooth present   obvious their concern focus primarili on the slowdown and the need to shore up the economi to face the possibl of other shock   the invest group saw the uncertainti larg in the context of the war and thought monetari polici realli wouldn   t be a use tool and that eas might even be counterproduct   when i look at the  book forecast   even if one take it at face valu as the most like outcom   it still project  as presid parri remark  consider slack in the form of unemploy by year end      and drop inflat   that might suggest that further eas would be the right direct for polici  to address more clear the risk that are there   but i find myself attract to the advantag of inertia  at least for now   thing are uneasi  an unknown amount of fiscal s ulus is in the work  and market don   t expect the fed to move   perhap we need to be one of the more certain aspect of the situat at this veri uncertain  e
thank you  mr  chairman   the economi remain suspend between ongo weak in the here and now and prospect for futur strength  and we   ve seen a bit more evid support each of these side over the intermeet period   there   s a long list of factor point to a strengthen trend for econom growth over the intermedi to longer run  and a number of these have becom more compel over the intermeet period   real interest rate for busi have declin further   substanti for below invest grade busi   part reflect reduc percept of risk on the part of lender   these reduc percept were fed by the continu absenc of new revel of corpor wrongdo and some sens that the credit problem accumul dure the boom period are begin to top out   fiscal polici is pois to be more expansionari than previous anticip and perhap even more so than in the staff forecast if the unemploy rate edg higher as seem like  es  of under product growth have been revis up   rapid increas in product should support busi and household incom   the household respons to low interest rate and continu growth in incom has been even greater than expect  support ongo strength in hous and consum durabl spend   the result upward revis to privat final sale in the fourth quarter leav a more convinc upward trend in final demand from the first to the second halv of        this should eventu underpin a pickup in invest   the favor fundament of acceler sale  high cash flow  and a low cost of capit should lead to much stronger invest demand over  e   stock of inventori and capit have been reduc consider relat to the putat level of final sale at the economi   s potenti  and capit is wear out rapid   replac cycl have alreadi been stretch out  and unless they are further extend  replac should begin to show through to spend   this is a trend we can alreadi see in comput   credit market seem pretti well convinc that stronger growth is come   not onli have we seen a declin in risk spread  but also the yield curv remain unusu steepli upward slope  as steep as in the past when recess were about to be over  but these posit factor have yet to show through convinc in the data  import  busi invest continu to disappoint  not yet show sign of a sustain upturn  and larg as a consequ  the economi remain weak   undoubt war jitter and other geopolit risk are play a key role in this  but we can   t be sure how big a role   as sever peopl remark ye day     geopolit risk    is an all purpos label we   re put on forecast error and equat residu    laughter  my sens is that the risk to the intermedi term to longer term outlook are skew toward even greater acceler in output  but these risk are balanc by a skew toward econom underperform in the near term that could have import consequ for the economi   most promin among the longer term upsid risk  busi spend could snap back sharpli   even more sharpli than in the staff forecast   as intern uncertainti abat  as financi market    skittish continu to wane with fewer problem of govern and credit  and as the ongo rise in final sale bol  confid about the futur   in the current environ  as i alreadi note  consider more fiscal s ulus is a distinct possibl and that s ulus might well take effect just as the economi was recov in ani event  in term of the downsid risk to the near term  i think genuin geopolit risk could continu to damp demand to a consider degre   either becaus the iraq situat take longer to resolv or becaus situat aris that creat new uncertainti in the manner of the korean and venezuelan develop of recent month   or we could find that factor other than geopolit risk are realli restrain demand   this busi invest led cycl is a new experi for most of us   recent the chairman and a visit economist engag in a dialogu about the recess of      as a compar episod   laughter  but that was a littl befor my  e    protract near term weak for whatev reason  despit forecast of strong futur growth  could present a difficult challeng for the committe at a futur meet  inflat is alreadi low and pois to declin further  perhap by more than the staff has project  given the much steeper declin that we   ve seen in recent year in price index other than core pce   that by itself is probabl not a problem   it shouldn   t feed back much on demand provid that inflat expect don   t ratchet down substanti  which would rais the real fund rate and lower asset price   in the    low nairu    simul in the  book  the expans continu as project   but it   leav the economi more expos to downward shock in the sens that  with inflat expect like to be at least a littl lower  the zero bound is a greater constraint on our abil to reduc real interest rate   if that situat threaten  we may need to recal the lesson i was draw ye day afternoon   that mistak of over aggress polici are more easili revers than those of a polici that get behind the curv  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m an avid reader of the    news clip     and i had seen report about sever of your talk mention light at the end of the tunnel  the economi be well posit for recoveri  and that sort of thing   i was go to add some moder downbeat comment today   now that i have actual heard mani of your report  i   m afraid that  instead of be a crotcheti outlier  i   m go to be a lem    laughter   let me proceed anyway  the first point to note is that the near term econom weak   persist   there are still plenti of posit sign   mani of them just cite by don   but the general properti of the forecast exercis seem to be that the near term data that can be seen pretti well remain weak while it take the longer term  not so clear visibl  for the forecast to becom more posit  the  book  for exampl  made posit chang in the out quarter  but these are base part on more aggress and exogen assumpt about fiscal polici  part on the link between higher product and spend demand and  i suppos  part on the belief that busi cycl can   t last forev   they can   t  but perhap we should still pay attent to the data we can see rather clear and worri more about persist weak  the financi press seem confid that the caus of all econom weak now is the possibl of and uncertainti surround potenti militari action against iraq   of cours  it may be  but we don   t observ this uncertainti direct   what we observ is that invest is slow to turn around  the stock market is weak  the dollar is fall  oil price are high  consum confid is fall  and deficit are rise   we tend to look for a unifi explan that could explain all of these negat event  and iraq certain could do that   but perhap iraq  sn   t explain all the sourc of weak  and perhap the geopolit uncertainti are now generat further indirect sourc of weak   the key question  as we ask ye day  is whether everyth will turn around onc the geopolit uncertainti are resolv   i  for one  am not so sure that they will  on iraq itself there is littl that a mere economist can contribut to know how to deal with these uncertainti   but there may be someth a footbal coach can contribut   the coach at the univers of michigan  bo schembechl  never pass much   when ask whi  he said that when you pass three thing can happen  and two of them are bad    laughter   if i could adapt schembechl   s comment to the issu of geopolit uncertainti  one of the possibl outcom is the potenti for further delay   especi in the last few day  it   not appear that event are speed up   there are still sever forc that could lead to delay   it will be a month or so befor we have enough troop in the middl east   there will be continu uncertainti about whether weapon inspector can find the miss weapon  or whether iraq is or is not in materi breach  there   s uncertainti  too  about whether the like outcom improv if more alli are brought into the coalit and what it might take to bring these alli into the coalit  anoth possibl outcom is that the war is prosecut but   not turn out well   there  sn   t seem to be much doubt that the unit state would prevail in a conflict with iraq  but prevail in a war such as this could entail mani difficult after effect   there could be serious damag to the oil field or other unimagin type of ugli   the ul  cost  ramif  and econom uncertainti of ani war  no matter how success  could be quit serious and could be veri much in doubt for a long period of  e  none of this say that the op ist talk is wrong  and none of this argu that the economi is not well posit for recoveri   as for polici  there   s probabl veri littl we could do now at this  e of maximum uncertainti  and it is not cost to wait a bit for the situat to clarifi   but forgiv me if i don   t join the op ist crowd

thank you  mr  chairman   let me begin with a quick rundown of what has been happen in term of the read on the district economi   all in all the report remain mix  but i would say that on balanc they may be a bit better   a coupl of sector aren   t better   one is agricultur  where the combin of unfavor weather condit and lower price for some commod probabl has worsen the situat  so attitud among mani produc are quit negat at this point   anoth sector that isn   t better is tourism  again  weather seem to be the princip problem there  especi the lack of snow  move beyond those two sector  for the most part commerci construct is soft  but retail space in the twin citi is quit tight  so there is a substanti amount of new retail construct under way   labor market condit appear to have stabil  the chang in employ and unemploy in recent month have been trivial   and the manufactur sector appear to be improv   the improv is small  but we   ve had better anecdot report and better read out of that sector for the last sever month now   consum spend  as most peopl have comment  is mix  depend on the region and depend on the retail   as the retail space addit in minneapoli suggest  some peopl are op ist in that arena   of cours  op  certain pertain to virtual all measur of hous activ   singl famili construct  multifamili construct  and sale across the board without regard to price level   final  let me say a word about credit qualiti   the banker i   ve spoken with certain seem comfort with the credit qualiti of household but less so with that of busi today  as far as the nation situat is concern  i wrote down number veri similar to those in the  book   i don   t know if this will make anybodi feel better or not  but i went and look back at last januari   s  book to see what the board staff had forecast for       and they got it just about exact right   it   s realli remark   so i hope that between the staff and myself we   re right again  at least as far as      is concern   i do believ that there are some fundament reason that the  book forecast is not a bad one   these reason aren   t meant to be addit becaus the phenomena are interrel   one is the fundament resili and flexibl of the u s  economi  a point that somebodi touch on a littl earlier   i don   t think we want to lose sight of that   i would add that monetari polici is  of cours  accommod  we are anticip further fiscal s ulus  and some of that will lead to sustain growth in dispos incom   final  there   s the favor product outlook   if i ask myself where i might be miss someth that would jeopard that forecast  one area is the state and local govern budget situat  for which the consequ may turn out to be more sever than i expect   anoth is the labor market   i   m not sure that labor is as stretch as some peopl seem to think and that employ will pick up rapid ani  e soon   so that weak may be extend   anoth possibl is that we may be a littl op ist about product   but in the end  i think this is one of those situat in which all of that is probabl dwarf by how the geopolit develop play out  and i don   t have ani special expertis there

the second district economi has been mix but general weaker sinc the last report   the labor market has soften notic   hous activ has retreat  but manufactur condit have improv a bit   retail report that holiday season sale were general sluggish  mark by veri steep discount but decent unit sale   consum confid fell to a cyclic low in decemb   while unemploy rate in the district were mix in decemb  privat sector employ retreat sharpli  main reflect reduct in retail holiday staf  sale of both singl famili home and apart slow notic in the latter part of the year  but sell price remain well ahead of a year earlier   in part what i think is go on is that peopl are unwil to accept real price and therefor are slow to sell   that will have to chang   new home construct also retreat in octob and novemb but remain at a fair high level   offic market in downstat new york were relat stabl in the fourth quarter but offic vacanc rate in new jersey and connecticut continu to escal   manufactur and purchas manag report mix but general improv condit in the last few week  the state and local govern in the area are consid way to close sizabl budget gap project for the upcom fiscal year  and they are do it at this stage with vari degre of realism   i mention at the last meet the possibl of a veri crippl transit strike   that fortun did not take place   banker are report increas loan demand from commerci borrow as well as tighter lend standard on that segment of their busi   they also note a widespread retreat in consum delinqu rate  on the nation pictur and the intern pictur  i am by natur an op ist  and therefor i am veri inclin to think that the  book forecast  with which we larg agre  is a quit reason one and is like to take place   but we do have an enorm amount of uncertainti   so the question is  what   the prudent central banker do in an atmospher of enorm uncertainti   it seem to me that one should think veri hard  do noth  and stay extrem alert   now  if fortun is kind and the larg degre of uncertainti is dissip  i share the view that when we begin a polici move it is like that bold will be appropri   more along the model of januari          than the      exampl   but that is a decis that we will make appropri at that  e   thank you
the economi in the eleventh district has continu it lacklust expans   if we use employ as our measur  texa is have a jobless recoveri in which output grow while employ slow   as best we can tell  given the lag in region data  incom and output have been grow   assum our product growth mirror the rest of the nation   overal  the district economi probabl is grow  but there   s not a lot of forward momentum   busi and household are in a hunker down mode   whether it   s driven primarili by the impend war and other bad news is a matter of conjectur   nonetheless  the mood is quiet and cautious   those two word also summar the tone at the decemb and januari meet of the dalla fed   s board of director  like the rest of the nation  singl famili home construct and sale are do well  but the market may be get satur  and sale of new home are expect to slow this year   one real estat analyst in the dalla area  where new home sale are predict to declin   percent in       comment that while this might sound dismal it would still be the third best year in histori   all other categori of construct have been declin  and that is expect to continu throughout this year   one segment that has stop slide is the oil and gas sector   in spite of high energi price  that sector had been shed job for over a year   that seem to have end   while oil compani do not expect today   s price to last  drill budget have loosen a bit   natur gas price are expect to remain abov the averag of the last few year  and activ in that sector is gain some momentum   one of my director has note the slowdown in the build of new electr generat facil over the last coupl of year and anticip some shortag of gas as the demand for electr expand in respons to a resumpt of higher econom growth   defens contract is anoth segment of growth in the dalla district   s economi   the dalla   fort worth area will benefit from the defens depart   s decis to continu product of sever aircraft and from poland   s choic to purchas the f    instead of one of it european competitor  look at the nation pictur  it seem to me that the reduct in the staff   s es  of fourth quarter gdp reflect a catch up of the forecast to the last sever beig book   one has to worri that  like a bicycl  the economi has to maintain some speed to stay upright and we   re rapid lose that speed   have said that  i must confess that our project for      show no discern differ from the staff forecast   but my sens of uncertainti and lack of convict about our project are as great as they   ve ever been   the risk as i see it   and this is reinforc by the natur and tone of the question i   ve receiv from peopl throughout the district   is primarili on the downsid   i   m not alon in this   that   s the view out there  and i think it call into question the continu credibl of our neutral bias
thank you  mr  chairman   unlik ned    who use a footbal metaphor  i   m go to use a boat metaphor   i think the economi is like a high power speedboat move forward  howev  we don   t know how far forward the throttl is   there   s a rope over the  n   this is the war anchor   but we don   t know how big that anchor is and to what extent it is hold the boat back   the boat   s speed will chang when and if the war anchor is lift   we don   t know exact how this is go to play out  but it   s possibl to imagin the rope be sever and the speedboat shoot ahead   howev  what we observ in the data is the forward speed of the boat   we don   t know to what extent that speed is be held down by that anchor   it might be a realli littl anchor   or how much of the speed is due to the fundament of the econom situat   i do think that  at some point  we   re go to find ourselv scrambl in an environ that could be veri differ from the current one  i think the staff did a spectacular job  by the way  in describ the outlook and present a veri thought provok and cogent exposit of the consider and the risk  nonetheless   if i could switch the analog here a bit   if you   re ski on a mountain that may experi an avalanch  you may think you   re safe  and in fact you may be safe   but when that mountain start to rumbl and that avalanch come down  you   re go to have to stop and take stock and tri to figur out where you are   we don   t know how the market are go to respond if and when the bomb start to fall   i can think of a wide rang of possibl there   what seem to me to be most clear is that the situat is extrem fluid and we realli don   t know how all this is go to play out   so while i think the staff did a great job of look at the fundament  we actual don   t know how the situat is go to unfold   what will be critic for us is to form a sound polici respons which  of cours  may be not to do anyth until we have some resolut or a greater amount of inform on the situat  from peopl i talk with i hear phrase like    flat loan demand    or descript of the situat as    spotti    or    mix     those are the type of comment one hear over and over again  i think that   s the tone of the report around the tabl today  it   s what all of us are hear   i talk to my wal mart contact ye day  and he said that some veri peculiar featur have emerg in the retail busi   one is that consum behavior is tilt toward chicken away from steak   by that he mean that there   s a widespread phenomenon of peopl buy more good at lower valu price point   we see this also in the report we get from fedex and up  there   s a substitut of ground for express servic  for exampl  as peopl look veri hard for way to econom   i think it   s a veri general phenomenon  but strang enough  at the same  e that wal mart note this movement toward chicken and away from steak   a behavior that is true across almost all line of their busi   consum electron  which are view as involv high discretionari type of purchas  are also strong   my wal mart contact say that his firm just  sn   t understand what   s go on there   i was amaz when he told me that wal mart has computer everi singl one of it sale ticket for the last nine year   it   s a mind boggl databas   they analyz the data to tri to understand what they can about consum behavior  for exampl  in term of the mix of good peopl buy   he say this recent pattern is a my i  they don   t have an explan for it  i   ve been press my contact on their capit expenditur plan   wal mart take a long view   they have a busi strategi with a fair long  e horizon  and they   re not chang that strategi one iota in term of the invest they make in new store and warehous facil and so forth   i ask my contact at fedex particular whether they are expect to move ahead some of their capit expenditur to beat the expir of the incent in   what is it   septemb or so of        he said that their plan expenditur are essenti flat this year over last year though there are a lot of expenditur they would realli like to make   he   s on the edg of spring for      million to      million of outlay  primarili in the technolog area   in particular  they   re studi the prospect for bring some outlay forward into      that would otherwis have come in        i think that   s someth we would want to continu to follow close to tri to understand what these number mean as we go through come quarter

thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll begin my remark with a report from la paz  mexico  where jerri jordan is take possess of his new sailboat   he sent me an e mail a few day ago say that he had found a dollar store there   sort of    laughter   it is call    uno precio     and everyth in the store is price at    peso   so at just over    peso to the dollar  he note that it   s a bit more expens than the dollar store he found in canada   but the mexican who are pack this place still find it a great bargain   jerri   s final comment to me was    price stabil reign       i note in read the transcript of the decemb meet that mani of you comment that you   re go to miss jerri   s anecdot and vignett   so i   ll do my best to bring interest but  more import  entertain anecdot from the fourth district  econom condit in our district have been move sideway for the past six month  and this intermeet period was no differ   manufactur in the district continu to express their disappoint about the current state of econom affair more vocal than just about ani other group   automobil manufactur are do a bit better than most  but even in that sector there are differ depend on which plant and what model one is look at   home sale and new home construct continu strong  as mani other have mention about their district   one director who last week attend a nation convent for homebuild indic that there was a great deal of op  in that group   her compani is a supplier to homebuild and they as well as other supplier are see strong order   so  that area of the economi continu to be op ist   auto sale in our district have continu to be brisk  although they are back off a bit from the record level of last year   consum spend is flat to down over the past two month compar with a year ago  we made a point of ask our advisori council member about the poor state of capit spend   specif  we ask them how the geopolit situat might be affect their capit spend plan   although the sampl is not realli repres of anyth  what we heard was interest   they told us that they don   t put a great deal of weight on the view that terrorist activ or the pend war with iraq is hold back a lot of capit spend  busi are spend   but they   re spend on higher health care cost  increas insur premium  and the higher cost of maintain their old plant and equip   so if this view has ani merit  the eas of geopolit tension may not lead to the immedi surg in capit spend that some analyst are predict  regard the nation outlook  my view is consist with the  book  the economi   appear capabl of continu growth   howev  use larri     s term from this morn  i am    somewhat skeptic    about the  e of the snapback in busi fix invest  which mani forecast believ is necessari to propel the economi by the summer back to the higher growth trend   given the report figur on excess capac in the economi  it may be that capit servic can expand without a substanti snapback in invest expenditur  at least in the short run   my guess is that it depend on whether the excess capac repres past invest that are simpli not like to becom product in the short run   those that were high specul in the high tech industri   or whether the excess capac repres a more tradit weak in demand   at least some of the individu i have spoken with in the fourth district suggest that it is the weak in demand   they have the capac to meet increas demand but seem to be say that they   re not go to be in a hurri to invest in new capit equip when busi pick up again   i know that would break from the histor pattern we   ve seen  so mayb this attitud will prove to be just pessim and not realiti  i believ that we   re see in our region the same phenomena mani of you have mention in the labor market   firm are look at way to produc more with their exist workforc   i agre with sandi   s comment this morn that the relat tepid employ growth we   re see is mirror the pattern of the         recoveri more close than other postwar recoveri   if that pattern continu  we may face a second year of veri littl employ growth while gdp again is grow   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   one of the thing i   ve observ in various committe i   ve been on and in other decisionmak situat is the difficulti of know what you know and know what you don   t know   this meet strike me as one of those case where understand that differ is key   just to review what we know  it is primarili what has happen in the recent past and  as mani of you alreadi describ  the data have been quit mix   what we don   t know is whether or not that recent past is a precursor to a further slow go forward or inde  as is consist with the  book forecast  a precursor to some growth   it strike me that the risk of renew slow is not suffici at this stage to warrant ani action by the committe today   to put it anoth way  although the dichotomi between the recent past and the forecast for the futur is quit palpabl  at this  e i would place some reason odd on someth along the line of the baselin forecast as be general correct  there are a number of reason for that judgment   one is that monetari polici continu to be  i think  reason accommod   i believ fiscal s ulus is in the pipelin or soon will be   inventori   sale ratio are quit low   we see some anecdot evid to suggest that demand for replac invest is eman from various busi and may actual show through   that   s the fundament sens of what we know from the recent past   what we don   t know is what the futur is go to look like   but in that regard i   d say that the staff forecast is not unreason   obvious  the other thing we don   t know is the impact of the geopolit uncertainti   i think the effort the staff has made in the work put forward by sandi struckmey is veri use and quit instruct   but we realli are confront a great deal of uncertainti there  so  given the configur of monetari and fiscal polici  financi condit that have chang  lead and lag indic  and other issu  the key question is what we should do today   ned   quot a footbal coach  i   m go to quot the cartoon charact  dilbert  who say that    percent of the  e do noth is the right respons   i will leav it at that
i   d like to add two point to the discuss   one is base on have talk with a number of banker   in this case  repres of some of the largest lender of the thrift industri   who reaffirm what we have learn from other sourc about the residenti mortgag market   their figur on applic and close track the mortgag banker associ data  which is to say that they  too  are strong   i   d also mention a coupl of variat on the asset qualiti issu   the lender tend to support what we   ve heard around the room that the asset qualiti of the consum portfolio is strong   but my contact were quick to say that they have adjust their lend standard   one said that they have rais the minimum fico score for borrow about   percent  which i think is signific  the other note that they have develop a more sophist intern score model   it   s fico base   and they attribut a great deal of the current strong qualiti of their portfolio to have chang their standard   that can be done veri quick on the consum side  on the residenti mortgag side  the largest lender that i talk to indic that in veri recent month they have seen a notic uptick in their nonperform first mortgag residenti real estat loan   they attribut that to the long lag between a downturn in the economi and the effect on home mortgag loan   peopl will sacrific a great deal befor they let their individu resid go into foreclosur or becom a loan that is in a nonaccru status  one of the lender also maintain a segment of his loan portfolio in commerci real estat base loan  and those typic are to franchis   he said that the perform of that portion of the portfolio is strong  with the notabl except of conveni store   he attribut that to the impact of the increas in oil price both on the cost side   they   re not abl to pass on their increas cost   and on the demand side becaus there is some downturn in demand   so  that was the notabl except to high credit qualiti across the board  move to the broad subject of fiscal polici  as you probabl notic  this week the congress had to pass anoth continu resolut  either the third or fourth such resolut  we still don   t quit have a budget   the senat produc an omnibus budget bill  but it will take probabl until the end of next year befor it is reconcil with the hous   as for the tax bill  two pressur are threaten the tax bill as it stand now   the first  and perhap the most obvious  is the concern about the dividend exclus   that is get a lot of attent  and much of it is focus on the anecdot exampl of the effect on the richest peopl in the countri   but the other pressur  which i think will be veri persist and will have a real impact on the debat  come from the status of the state economi   a number of you have talk about the budget difficulti face by state govern   i think there are as mani as twenti new governor who current are meet with state legislatur and are deal with veri serious budget issu  from the feder govern side  among the issu that they   re deal with are the mandat but unfund cost relat to homeland secur   if a dividend exclus is ad to that  for state that use feder govern taxabl incom as the basi for the calcul of state incom  that mean a reduct in incom that is taxabl   but the dividend exclus  if enact  will becom law after the state legislatur will have met for the most part   it may well take a special session of the state legislatur to address the issu   so the two effect on the state are both negat at perhap the most critic  e in their fiscal situat in mani  mani year   the anticip  therefor  is that the pressur on the congress from the state will build  how will this play out   i think in one of three way   one  we could get a bill veri similar to what we have now if it is perceiv that it is inde s ul to the extent that we   ve describ it   anoth is that we could get a scale down version of the bill that includ onli the most obvious s ul featur   that   s not imposs   you may rememb that a year ago the congress did in fact adopt the top two prioriti identifi by our own economist as the two prioriti they   d like to see enact  and they were inde pass in a singl bill   the other possibl is that the congress could move away from the s ulus issu and simpli pass some bill will becom the goal  in which case we might see a combin of some reduct in the dividend exclus and direct grant to the state   in term of the econom impact of a bill like that  i think all bet are off   we   ve seen that kind of thing recent  that essenti is what happen with the ag bill last year  as you may recal   the bipartisan goal ul  becam produc a bill  the econom consequ notwithstand   for those reason i would say that the segment of the forecast that presum an econom s ulus packag is not certain  and i think it bear watch veri close
thank you  mr  chairman   i continu to believ that structur the u s  economi is reason healthi  both financi and in real term   so whi is the economi struggl   a few stori have circul   in my view  the various analys we   ve been hear compar the unit state economi to the post bubbl japanes economi are overwrought to say the least   there   s littl evid of import remain capit overhang except in a few sector   moreov  as i   ve said befor  i don   t think it   s meaning to talk about a general capit overhang   to my mind    general capit overhang    is just anoth name for insuffici aggreg demand or low general capit util   in ani case  the main post bubbl problem in japan were financi  and there is certain no compar set of problem here   as my earlier question suggest  anoth possibl explan for the slow recoveri is that there   s a lull in the technolog opportun for growth  a real busi cycl   this also seem somewhat implaus to me  but we   ll have to wait and see   if that is the case  then there   s not much that monetari polici can do about it  at this junctur the lead hypothesi must still be the geopolit uncertainti and it damp effect on hire and invest decis   i feel some d©j vu here   my phd thesi twenti five year ago consid the problem of a firm contempl an irrevers physic invest in the face of uncertainti   as it happen  the exampl i use in my paper was uncertainti about the long term price of oil   i show in my dissert that the firm   s op  hurdl rate for invest not onli increas with the degre of uncertainti  as might be expect  but also was higher the nearer the expect resolut of the uncertainti   intuit  uncertainti that is expect to be resolv relat soon is a strong incent to delay commit  current the geopolit situat is not onli one of high uncertainti but also one in which the uncertainti may be resolv at least partial in a matter of week or a few month  the damp forc of uncertainti on the economi are therefor current at their maximum level   a reason like scenario  one that we all hope for  is that the geopolit situat will be speedili and favor resolv and that a signific econom recoveri will therefor follow   frank  therefor  i don   t think there is much we can do about this now   we   re just go to have to wait and see what happen  there is  of cours  also the possibl that the economi will continu to move sideway into the spring either becaus the geopolit uncertainti drag on or becaus the new invest and hire that we   re expect now simpli are not forthcom  perhap becaus of continu busi pessim   given the ongo slack in util of labor and capit and our project that core pce inflat may slip to   percent or lower  i would hope that in such a circumst we would be prepar to eas aggress earlier rather than later on the ground that the risk of inact at that point would be greater than the risk of action   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet there has been veri littl chang in econom activ in the third district   the recoveri continu at a slow pace   while the fourth quarter end on a weak note  this wasn   t a surpris   data suggest that consum in the region pull back on spend on nondur  and that stori is consist with the point that were made by presid broaddus   most of our retail contact  includ two nation chain and one larg region depart store chain  report that holiday sale general did not meet expect   the one except was auto sale  which show a strong pickup at the end of decemb  fuel by incent  manufactur activ in the district paus from august to octob but has shown some improv sinc then   our busi outlook survey   s general activ index has been posit in the last three month  and the index for new order has increas steadili sinc august   still  sign of a pickup in busi invest are most in term of expect   in the manufactur sector  low capac util is restrain capit expenditur   accord to a special question in our januari survey  which seem to have been develop expressli for our new presid  almost half of our respond indic that they were oper at below    percent of capac   we ask our respond how much of an increas in product would be necessari for them to increas capit expenditur  near three fourth indic that they would need an increas in product of at least    percent befor they would respond by increas plant and equip spend  labor market in the district  particular in manufactur  remain weak  manufactur job are still declin on a month basi  although the pace of loss has abat somewhat   accord to anoth special survey question  it will take less output growth for firm to begin hire worker again than to start invest in plant and equip   this suggest that respond are begin to be stretch in term of product gain expect from the current workforc   still     percent of the respond said they would not add employe unless output in their firm increas more than    percent  and they didn   t expect to be hire in ani sizabl number until later this year   nonmanufactur firm in the district are more op ist  near two third of the respond to our south jersey survey  which includ retail  servic sector firm  and manufactur  plan to increas employ this year  and half of those plan to do so in the first quarter  continu weak is have a detriment effect on state budget  as near everyon has mention   so far in fiscal year       revenu are fall   to   percent below project in each of our three state   pennsylvania and new jersey have alreadi exhaust the surplus they accumul over the decad of the     s and will be less abl to mitig the negat effect of econom weak go forward   i   d summar by say that the situat is littl chang from last year   the fourth quarter was weak but was expect to be weak   the recoveri continu at a languid pace  my view of the nation economi is similar   the recoveri continu at a sluggish pace  there are few tangibl sign of an immin pickup in invest spend  capac util remain at a low level  and factori order remain weak onc month to month swing are smooth out   employ and manufactur are also weak   on the posit side  the hous market remain healthi  and consum spend has held up  the philadelphia staff forecast is similar to the  book forecast in that they both expect the econom recoveri to gain momentum in       with fa  growth in the second half than in the first   they also both acknowledg that there are signific risk to the forecast  especi regard the  e and durat of a war in iraq   our work suggest somewhat weaker growth over the next two year  part becaus our forecast incorpor a smaller impact from the fiscal s ulus and part becaus of differ assumpt about rate movement in        both forecast expect growth in consum spend to continu at a moder pace  buoy by reason under growth of real incom and the expect tax cut  we are less op ist about busi fix invest than the  book   philadelphia   s analysi suggest that low capac util will have a stronger drag on busi fix invest this year  this view is support by the busi outlook survey result i just discuss   while the  book see doubl digit growth in busi invest by the end of the year  we don   t see it pick up such strength until the second quarter of next year   the board staff is also more op ist about residenti invest   we believ the singl famili hous sector will remain strong but won   t be the driver of growth becaus we expect refinanc and cashout to slow  in both forecast  busi don   t begin to add to their payrol until later this year   again  the  book is somewhat more op ist than our staff   this  e i hope that the board staff is correct and we are not  i think it   s import to restat what other have said   there are signific risk   this  e the risk are on the upsid and the downsid   the largest downsid risk is geopolit  and i   ll spend no more  e on that   but there are also upsid risk   the most obvious is dissip of the geopolit uncertainti  as has alreadi been mention   in addit  there may be signific more s ulus in the tax packag   frank  i   m not convinc of that for some of the reason that governor olson indic   that is in fact a veri uncertain event   on balanc  i see littl reason to chang our polici stanc at this meet   i do have some concern  though  that when the fourth quarter gdp number are releas and activ is shown to be relat weak  the public reaction may not be all that favor   perhap we should be prepar to address this in our statement or at least be cogniz of it when those number come out   thank you
the factor under the momentum in the economi continu to be split  as we   ve been say around the tabl   household continu to show op   and busi continu to find way not to expand   consum bought car for christma and hous start reach sixteen year high   mortgag refinanc suppli addit cash flow for spend and to help pay down consum debt  which declin for the first  e in year   core consum price inflat is run well below   percent  and peopl are shop for bargain   while job are declin  person incom continu to grow at a modest pace   yet busi activ continu to show sign of weak   industri product has fallen in four of the last five month  employ and product hour work are below august level  and inventori have fallen in the last coupl of month after expand in the summer and earli fall   there are also long term structur problem that are becom more promin given the slow expans that we   re go though   name that sever key industri in this economi are struggl with excess capac   as we look at compani    announc of restructur plan  we know that the weak in these sector is go to continu for quit a long  e into the futur  the concern about immin war and the unknown repercuss  such as terror  are affect financi market  and those concern provid anoth excus for busi not to expand   on the other side  as other have mention  we know there are potenti tax reduct  but even if the congress act  that probabl won   t happen for sever month  and the impact won   t be felt until late in the year   the staff forecast is for veri modest expans in final sale even with the expect s ulus from tax reform   that leav the output gap veri wide   we know when the economi is soft that it   s more vulner to outsid shock   becaus of that i think we need to be more vigil in the come week regard what the uncertainti about war could do to the economi so that we will be abl and will to respond appropri as event transpir
mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that are be hand out   one of the more difficult aspect of put togeth the materi support your polici discuss was reconcil the diverg movement of key financi asset price over the intermeet period   the first exhibit review those tension  not becaus i   m fish for sympathi but becaus it bear on today   s deliber   the financi develop i am most confid in explain are plot in the top portion of the exhibit   as evidenc by the most recent path of the expect feder fund rate infer from futur quot  the black line   market particip do not expect a polici chang to be announc this afternoon   mix econom data  a pall cast by gloomi corpor earn guidanc  and concern about a conflict with iraq led investor to push back the anticip start of polici firm until year end   survey suggest that  as note in the middl row in the tabl at the right  market particip are most of the view that you will assess the risk to your goal as still balanc   the sens that polici will be on hold for longer than previous expect pull treasuri yield lower  with most of the declin  as shown in the middl left panel  attribut to lower forward rate at the front end of the yield curv   in addit to a downward revis to the near term outlook associ    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     with worri about global tension  treasuri yield may have benefit from flight to qualiti demand  in that other indic of skittish  such as gold and oil price  rose as well  the middl portion of the chart    such relat shift might help to explain whi major equiti index  at the far right  shed   to   percent over the intermeet period  with those loss mount in recent day   the chief puzzl is that corpor bond risk spread have narrow consider  particular for the riskiest credit  the black line in the bottom left panel    even so  as presid   note ye day  a longer perspect show that spread remain on the high side of the experi of the past dozen year   moreov  to an import extent composit effect matter  shown in the inset by the fact that exclud the telecom and energi sector spread have narrow by far less   this increas in the relat price of riski debt instrument  even as investor otherwis move to safeti and liquid  may be evid that an unusu and overdon pessim about default and recoveri rate on corpor debt  inflam by revel of corpor wrongdo  is in the process of unwind   associ improv in the liquid of the market where those secur trade have probabl also whet investor    risk appetit   with market more recept to corpor debt  firm should be abl to fund new capit project   when they shake their reluct to spend   that hesit appear to be due to elev worri about the world situat  but implicit in the configur of market price must be the averag expect that these tension will abat start some  soon   if not  it is hard to understand whi futur market quot have oil price move lower and the committe begin to tighten  albeit not by much  by year end   this is one of the observ made in the box in the bluebook on geopolit tension and monetari polici   name  your outlook  to the extent that it anticip some revers nearer to normalci in interest rate spread  oil price  and busi hire and spend decis  implicit must incorpor at a least a partial unwind of global tension   moreov  you   ve adjust polici alreadi to offset at least some of the restraint impos on spend by those tension in the interim   by lower the feder fund rate to    percent   i   d like to repeat two more observ from the bluebook but recast them in light of ye day   s discuss   for one  restraint on spend  as household and busi view defer purchas as a more attract option at a  e of elev volatil  would seem to be an advers addit shock to aggreg demand   all of our model effort thus far advis that you should take your best guess as to the net restrain effect on aggreg demand of such influenc and tri to offset them   for anoth  though  some aspect of geopolit tension would seem   by make investor more skittish and potenti complic market dynam   to make the consequ for financi price of your action more unpredict   if so  this multipli uncertainti would suggest that you should scale back the size of ani desir action in light of the wide rang of potenti outcom   committe member might be less op ist than is implicit in market about the  e and the extent to which restraint on spend associ with geopolit tension will lift   that would provid a reason to doubt the staff project that the economi will transit from about unchang real gdp last quarter to growth abov that of potenti by the second half of this year   such a posit might inclin you to eas polici at this meet   to be sure  it would come as a complet surpris to market particip  but that veri surpris would impli a more forc transmiss of that polici impetus to the financi market   the case for eas   not sole reli on doubt the staff forecast   the policymak perfect foresight simul   shown on your next page  which duplic chart   from the bluebook   take the staff assess of the economi complet on board  includ both the structur of the frb us model and project of the forc imping on the economi in the extend  book baselin   as presid parri alreadi note  the simul suggest that there is some scope to work down unus resourc a bit fa  in the near term by eas polici  with virtual no risk to the attain of what you may view to be a reason inflat goal   inde  even a long run target for core pce inflat of   percent would allow some scope for modest addit polici s ulus accord to the simul   you might find that argument particular persuas if you saw inflat of   percent at the low end of the rang that you   d consid a work definit of price stabil   as the committe devot a consider portion of ye day discuss polici gradual  it is worth note some of the limit involv in this op  plan exercis  beyond the obvious one that frb us is onli a rough approxim of realiti   in particular  in this simul the reaction of econom agent to your polici action is es  from histori   that is  the exercis use the version of the model with expect follow a vector autoregress   while the fund rate is assum to be as smooth as observ in the past  it is also vari more aggress in respons to perceiv resourc slack than observ in the past   this systemat differ between the way that investor mechan anticip how you will conduct polici and how you actual do it may give a fals impress of the extent to which polici eas influenc the economi   a point presid santomero rais ye day   the bottom line is that  among other problem with this exercis  you might not get as tidi a financi market respons as in the figur   speak outsid the model  this rais the issu of how market particip will react should they read the action and the accompani word as an implicit acknowledg on your part that econom prospect are darker than previous thought   even given a strong desir to make more inroad in reduc resourc slack  you might not think it is within your abil to do much about the unemploy rate edg up to    percent in the near term  given the lag in monetari polici and the uncertainti attend to how market would react   inde  the staff has revis up consider it project of econom growth in the second half of      and all of       the window in which your action today would most be felt   moreov  the committe might believ suffici monetari s ulus is in the pipelin to push growth even beyond that pace as the forc current impair busi confid abat and addit fiscal s ulus kick in  you might be influenc in that judgment by the fact   as shown in your next exhibit  which repeat chart   from the bluebook   that the real feder fund rate has run consider below it equilibrium valu over the past year   the outlook in the  book and in the central tendenc of your own project retain the contrast that has mark the previous few meet   decid subpar econom perform is seen as give way to a robust expans in just a few quarter   this suggest two way of assess the balanc of risk surround your current polici set   first  are you satisfi with the tempor dimens of the econom outcom that your polici is project to help fo    that is    your distast of the slow perform in the near term about balanc your concern that the expans may pick up too much steam later this year and next   this is the balanc that governor kohn was weigh in his remark   second  within the period of  e when you think the bulk of ani action today would be felt    the risk of some further slippag in inflat   perhap into an undesir region   about match the chanc of growth run signific fa  than that of potenti output   as i   ve note  market particip most believ that you will assess the risk to your dual object to be about balanc  probabl becaus they believ you are answer the second question and balanc potenti outcom at some point in the forese futur   for most forecast  econom perform at that later date look a littl more robust than seen previous  which would support retain the assess that the risk are balanc   the minor of particip who are call for a switch back to risk unbalanc toward econom weak probabl think that you   re answer the first question and compar econom perform in the near term with that in the longer term   they see the    soft spot    as a littl softer and the rebound to abov trend growth as a bit further remov in  e   if the path were grade sole by the measur of resourc slack  you might judg that they had a case  even though the staff has revis up it project of the futur growth of aggreg demand  slack persist at a higher level for a while becaus aggreg suppli also has been revis up   inclin you against chang the risk assess  howev  would be a concern that the announc of that shift would impair confid and make the outcom you fear a littl more like
question for     if not  let me see if i can review what has been said around this tabl  i think there is a general consensus that the evolut of geopolit risk  the rise in oil price  and the increas probabl and nearer  e frame of a war in iraq have essenti mask what the under structur of the economi is do   we know a number of fact  notabl that the busi communiti has been hold down it expenditur to a veri substanti extent   that is  capit appropri are at level that seem to reflect onli those perceiv as necessari to carri on essenti activ   most interest is the behavior of inventori  limit inventori stock has general been the case across the board  and inde the consensus of purchas manag as express in their recent report is that inventori are get to level that are subnorm  we often see contract in inventori when they general are view as excess irrespect of their level   this is one of those rare case in which inventori are perceiv to be veri low but are be held down to a consider extent  all this rais the interest issu as to what will happen if and presum when the geopolit risk are remov  will we be look at a bounceback as this particular risk is remov  or will we be shock to find that the sluggish is still there   i don   t know ani way to judg analyt the relat probabl of those two potenti outcom   we can guess   we may say that histori suggest such and such  but we realli can   t assess with confid the probabl of the two event  in a way it probabl  sn   t matter insofar as monetari polici is concern   the reason it  sn   t matter is that  unless i misread the militari tea leav  we   re go to get a resolut of this iraqi issu reason quick   if we look at the pattern of the logist move of our militari forc  it   s evid they   re all focus on a near term militari campaign   in this regard one can look at the movement of our aircraft carrier  the relat delay deploy of personnel  which can be acceler as need  and the recent begun movement of heavi equip  which requir a relat protract period to be transport from the unit state and other u s militari equip depot around the world   all are indic of our posit for a substanti u s militari presenc in the persian gulf area  this is a veri larg and a veri expens oper  the militari cannot realist undertak these prepar and then sit tight  especi with summer begin to emerg on the desert   there is also the fear that the potenti for chemic and biolog warfar is by no mean neglig   it would be a rather sad event if this    smoke gun    were to materi in the midst of battl   the difficulti that the un inspector are have and inde our own intellig is have is that iraq has         squar mile of territori  the size of california  and the iraqi have had four year in which to buri or otherwis hide such materi   the most recent hypothesi is that they have put all of these materi on truck that can be move around indistinguish so that the inspector cannot find them  over the past ten year it   s pretti evid that the iraqi militari has not been abl to regain the statur it had befor the gulf war  wherea the technolog that the unit state militari has obtain over the past decad is close to awesom   we are go to find that both the relat number and the capabl of the so call smart bomb that were use in the persian gulf war have been dramat increas so that the vast proport will now be guid missil with accuraci far greater than those avail in the gulf war   so what we can envisag is a fair quick resolut of the militari phase of this confront  with a probabl of somewher between  say     and       the problem is that the     to     residu is realli scari   the reason that market are behav as they are is that  if a residu with a veri small probabl has a veri larg outcom associ with it  the discount risk is a veri major issu  it   s not that the iraqi militari has somehow been strengthen and can give us fair signific opposit in battl   they can   t   the problem basic is that the iraqi have relat high tech chemic and biolog warfar capabl  and they are like to spring it on us  perhap even in advanc of our attack  the one big uncertainti here is that they may forc us to move a lot fa  than we are plan  larg becaus we cannot anticip what saddam might do under these condit  even if the initi situat is wholli in our court  it   s not like   in contrast to what happen dure the gulf war   that the air war by itself will turn the probabl around  there is no question that we will prevail in the air war   we can do huge damag   the question is whether chemic and biolog agent will be use in this war   we probabl will not know that until after the ground war begin and is well under way   so the impact on our economi may well differ from that relat to the gulf war   when the probabl of success becam veri evid short after the air war began  with the result that risk premium in financi market came down sharpli from their high and the price of oil plummet   everyth effect was in place for a strengthen economi  with consum confid pop   as i recal  some    point in the confer board number   it was quit an extraordinari swing   that is not like to happen with an air war under present circumst or at least not anywher near the extent to which it happen in the past unless it becom acut evid that our militari superior has been great underes    but until we have contain saddam and his oper on the ground in a manner that elimin the risk of chemic or other type of mass destruct warfar  we are not apt to get ani signific reduct of the uncertainti  then there is the risk of secondari reaction in the form of potenti upris in the middl east or just further concern about terrorist action in the unit state   accord  i would not anticip a jump in confid   it will take a while  though perhap not a great deal of  e  for us to know whether there is a coil spring under this economi readi to take off onc the geopolit risk have been contain or whether in fact there is no spring at all   in my judgment we should have enough in the way of an answer to that question by the  e of our next meet on march      there are a lot of thing that can go differ   saddam could go off to a south sea island with some of his loot  but even that might not be the ideal solut becaus we   re not quit sure what   s left of the baath parti   there could also be concern about reduc suppli of oil  the bottom line to all of this is that the militari uncertainti is so overwhelm with respect to the question of potenti monetari polici action that the less we do  even in how we phrase our post meet statement  the better off we are   the problem  as the vice chair of the board said  is that we do not know what will happen  and like him i think that it   s import for us to hedg our judgment at this stage   those of you who are argu for potenti aggress action are in a way say that someth is current suppress a vigor econom expans or that the hope for such an expans will turn out to be fals when the war is over  it is conceiv that we may want to take more than just a modest increment monetari polici action in the near term futur  but it   s not clear in which direct  and that   creat some degre of inhibit  i would propos that we stay where we are and retain a balanc risk statement  strang  the one problem none of us has realli discuss  which is not irrelev and is not relat to the possibl war  is the venezuelan oil problem   our countri   not have enough crude oil capac   if we lose access to both iraqi and venezuelan oil  we will almost sure have to tap into the strateg petroleum reserv   it   s not that crude oil inventori are inadequ worldwid  but they are veri bad distribut  the huge oil distribut structur that move oil from venezuela through curaßao and through the caribbean into the unit state has essenti been shut down   venezuelan product has come back a littl from a low point of         to         barrel a day to well abov one million barrel  but that is still substanti below normal output  and it is not clear how long the recent level of product is go to last  moreov  that could creat a shortag becaus  even if there   s a militari action in iraq that is veri effect and short  there is a probabl of damag to the iraqi oil field  the result loss of product could be veri readili handl if venezuela were fulli product  howev  even if the venezuelan crisi get resolv fair quick  the shutdown have been quit damag  and it   s go to take a while to get that product system back to full oper  by march    we should have an answer to the major question of whether the economi is buoyant or not   i   m not sure that the venezuelan crisi will be complet resolv by then  and i   m not sure what the state of product of iraqi crude will be becaus some disrupt is inevit go to occur in the event of an invas   we may well have an inordin high oil price  which would be a restrict forc  even though the forward market might be somewhat benign   so we will not have an altogeth clear pictur by march     but it is veri like that the major question confront us will be resolv at that point   so my recommend is essenti that we stay with a    percent feder fund rate and leav the risk balanc as they are   vice chair
mr  chairman  i think in an atmospher of enorm uncertainti it   s the easiest call in the world to agre with your recommend  which i support fulli
i also support your recommend

i support it
i support it as well
anybodi left   well  let me put it the other way around   if we were to call a vote  would anybodi object   okay  let   s go with it
the draft languag is in the bluebook   the page is not number  but i guess if it were  it would be page         the feder open market seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent      for the balanc of risk sentenc for the press releas     against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are balanc with respect to prospect for both goal in the forese futur
call the roll

the press statement that we scribbl out is perhap slight more op ist than was the tone of the committe   s discuss  but it fit pretti well the forecast that the individu bank presid and board member have submit   i think what we   re confront with is what we were discuss ye day   there is a sens of risk avers here   that is  if we have a risk neutral evalu in this type of environ  we tend to be more concern about the downsid   anyway  take a look at the draft of the press statement   i think we   ve got it as close as we can get   my prefer would have been to issu no statement  but we can   t retreat from our practic
not issu a statement would attract a lot of attent
a lot more attent than the statement would
as a bear  let me say that this middl paragraph is vagu enough that it   s fine
ani question   if not  we will go with it   i forgot to mention earlier that for those of you who   d like to chang your forecast  pleas give the revis forecast to dave   by the close of busi this friday   the meet is adjourn   we will reconven on march     if not befor  end of meet
