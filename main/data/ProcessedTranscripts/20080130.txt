thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the handout that you should have in front of you   over the past month  term fund pressur for bank have general subsid   but the bigger stori remain the continu pressur on bank balanc sheet  the tighten of credit avail  and the impact of this tighten on the outlook for econom activ   the travail of the monolin financi guarantor   some of which have alreadi been downgrad by one or more of the rate agenc   have exacerb the worri about the potenti for further bank writedown and have creat risk that some financi instrument that reli on monolin guarante might no longer be viabl   at this junctur  whether the major monolin guarantor will receiv the new capit need to keep or restor their aaa rate remain uncertain   i   ll start today by note that u s  and global equiti and fix incom market have behav in a way consist with a darker econom outlook   as shown in exhibit    the major u s  index have fallen sharpli sinc the decemb    fomc meet   these declin in the stock market have been most match abroad  as shown in exhibit     at the same  e  corpor credit spread have risen in tandem with the equiti market    declin   as shown in exhibit    high yield corpor bond spread are up more than     basi point sinc the decemb fomc meet  pull the interest rate on high yield debt signific higher   invest grade spread have also widen   but for invest grade debt  the declin in treasuri yield has been larger than the rise in spread  lower somewhat the absolut level of yield   global credit default swap spread have also increas sharpli  as shown in    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     januari                of     exhibit     market price risk has increas   this is most visibl in the rise of most market measur of impli volatil   for exampl  the vix  which measur impli volatil on the s p     index  recent climb back to the peak level reach in august  exhibit    and the move index  which measur volatil in the treasuri coupon market  has climb to it highest level sinc        the problem of the financi guarantor have been an import part of the stori  in recent year  the major financi guarantor have diversifi into insur structur financ product  includ collater debt oblig  cdos   current  their exposur to all structur financ product is about      billion  exhibit   show the distribut of exposur across three bucket   u s  public financ  u s  ab and structur financ  and the total non u s  exposur for the six major monolin guarantor   becaus the structur financ guarante have typic been issu against the highest rate tranch at the veri top of the capit structur  until recent the rate agenc did not think that these guarante would result in meaning loss   howev  as the hous outlook has continu to deterior and the rate agenc have increas their loss es  on subprim and other type of residenti mortgag loan product  the risk of signific loss has increas sharpli   this is particular the case with respect to these firm    collater debt oblig exposur   a portion of their total structur financ exposur   as i discuss in an earlier brief  given the high nonlinear payoff built into these product  modest chang in the loss assumpt on the under collater can lead to a sharp rise in expect loss on super senior aaa rate collater debt oblig   unfortun  the cdo exposur of sever of these financi guarantor are quit larg relat to their claim pay resourc   as shown in exhibit    statutori capit for even the biggest firm is less than    billion  the total capit for the entir group is slight more than     billion  and total claim pay resourc for this group from all sourc is about     billion   exhibit   compar these claim pay resourc with the subset of cdo exposur that contain some subprim mortgag relat collater   for four of the six major guarantor  these cdo exposur repres more than     percent of their total claim pay resourc   these exposur and the uncertainti about how these exposur will actual translat into loss are the proxim caus for the collaps in the financi guarantor share price and the widen in their credit default swap spread   this is whi new sourc of capit have been either prohibit expens or dilut or both to exist sharehold   as i note in last week   s brief  credit rate downgrad of the financi guarantor would like lead to signific mark to market loss for those financi institut that had purchas protect   for exampl  in it fourth quarter earn releas  merril lynch wrote down by      billion it valuat relat to it hedg with the financi guarantor       billion of this reflect writedown relat to super senior ab cdo exposur   unfortun  there is not much transpar as to the counterparti exposur of the guarantor on a firm by firm  asset class by asset class  or secur by secur basi   howev  major broker dealer have consider non ab cdo exposur to the financi guarantor   for exampl  they are thought to januari                of     have hedg an even larger amount of the super senior tranch of synthet corpor cdos with the financi guarantor   this suggest the potenti for signific addit mark to market loss for commerci and invest bank counterparti should the financi guarantor credit rate get further downgrad   in addit  such downgrad would increas market anxieti about counterparti risk becaus there would be consider uncertainti about the magnitud and incid of the prospect loss such downgrad might trigger   financi institut are also expos to the monolin guarantor via the wrap these guarantor have issu on certain money market secur  includ auction rate secur  tender option bond  and variabl rate demand note  the amount of these secur outstand is signific   the total market size for these three type of secur is es  to be about      billion   the major risk here is that the loss of the aaa rate guarante from the financi guarantor could undercut the demand for these secur   in the case of tender option bond and variabl rate demand note  this could trigger the liquid backstop provid by major commerci bank and dealer  lead to further demand on their balanc sheet   in the case of the auction rate secur market  the dealer would be face with a difficult hobson   s choic   they could either allow the auction to fail or take the secur onto their book to prevent a fail auction   in the case of a fail auction  the investor receiv a higher interest rate but has to wait until the next auction to tri to redeem the secur   if fail auction were to persist  as would be like  then the secur would essenti becom long term rather than short term oblig  fail auction would undoubt distress client that had purchas the secur on the assumpt that they would be liquid and could be redeem easili   fail auction would also like lead to broader distress in the associ municip and student loan secur market   we have alreadi experienc a number of fail auction for auction rate secur   moreov  the recent downgrad of ambac and fsa have led to signific market differenti among tender option bond and some upward pressur on municip bond wrap by weaker monolin financi guarantor   if the monolin guarantor are unabl to find addit equiti or other form of support  these pressur are like to intensifi in come week   the travail of the financi guarantor have ad to the pressur on major commerci and invest bank   as shown in exhibit   and     commerci and invest bank equiti price and credit default swap spread have general continu to widen   the cumul writedown report for a select group of larg bank has now reach      billion over the past two quarter  exhibit      coupl with balanc sheet growth and other factor  such as acquisit  these writedown have put signific downward pressur on bank capit ratio   for exampl  although all of the top five u s  commerci bank can still be character as    well capit     there has been signific eros of their capit ratio over the past two quarter  exhibit       this balanc sheet pressur help to explain whi commerci bank counterparti continu to complain about their access to credit  the tighten in lend standard  and the wider spread for asset such as jumbo januari                of     residenti mortgag  commerci mortgag  and leverag loan that can no longer be readili securit and distribut into the capit market   shift now to what market particip expect from us from this meet  monetari polici expect continu to shift in the direct of more cut that are deliv more quick   as shown in exhibit     the feder fund rate futur market current impli that market particip now expect addit rate cut total about     basi point by midyear   further out  as shown in exhibit     the eurodollar futur curv indic that about anoth    basi point is anticip dure the second half of the year   but these expect are volatil and have been shift consider day to day   the primari dealer survey tell a similar stori   the modal forecast of the primari dealer show a feder fund rate trough slight below     percent  exhibit       compar with the previous dealer    survey conduct for the decemb fomc meet  exhibit      the trough has move down about    basi point   as of last friday  seventeen of the twenti primari dealer expect a    basi point rate cut at this meet   this sen ent appear to be general share by market particip   as shown in exhibit     as of last friday  option on feder fund rate futur impli a rate cut at today   s meet  with the highest probabl on a    basi point rate cut to   percent   howev  it is import to recogn that the probabl shown in exhibit    put a zero weight on the notion of anoth intermeet cut in februari   so they should not be taken liter as to the outcom at today   s meet   the distribut of yield on eurodollar futur     day ahead suggest that there has been a regim shift sinc the decemb fomc meet   as shown in exhibit     not onli have expect shift down sharpli  but the skew has revers direct   the mode of the distribut is at      percent  and the skew of the distribut around that mode is toward less extrem rate outcom   this could be view as market particip now price in consider risk of a sever recess but maintain some hope that a milder downturn might occur or that a recess could possibl be avert altogeth   as shown in exhibit     the intermeet rate cut was accompani by a rise in inflat compens at the five year to ten year  e horizon   howev  it is unclear that this repres a genuin deterior in inflat expect for sever reason   first  the rise occur  in part  becaus breakeven inflat at the five year horizon has fallen as nomin five year treasuri yield have drop sharpli   it is this declin that has lift the five year  five year forward measur   i would agre with the memo by board staff that was distribut to the fomc ye day on this issu   the rise in five year  five year forward inflat compens like reflect a greater liquid premium for nomin treasuri   the rise in interest rate volatil is also a factor   accord to tip trader  the rise in five year  five year forward inflat reflect technic factor such as a temporari increas in the demand for shorter date treasuri  month end index extens flow  and a greater liquid premium for nomin  on the run treasuri   the general rise in interest rate volatil is probabl also a factor   second  the rise in five year  five year forward expect has not been accompani by a broad set of other signal consist with deterior long term inflat expect   for januari                of     exampl  the four  to five year forward breakeven inflat measur show a much smaller rise  the dollar has been relat stabl  and es  of bond term risk premium remain low   on the other side  gold price have increas sharpli in the past week   third  in our primari dealer    survey  there was veri littl chang in long term inflat expect   final  it is worth note that follow the    basi point rate cut in septemb  which was more aggress than expect  the five year  five year forward rate also rose  but the rise prove temporari   i would also like to briefli discuss the state of play in bank term fund market   some good news   as shown in exhibit     the spread between the one month libor and the one month oi rate and the three month libor and the three month oi rate have fallen sharpli sinc year end   howev  over the past week  there has been consider volatil in these spread   this could be due to a varieti of factor   includ a temporari increas in the demand by societ© g©n©rale for term fund and the sharp shift in expect about the near term feder fund rate path   current  these spread are close to the narrowest we have seen sinc the market turmoil began last august   although the passag of year end was the predomin factor behind the declin in term fund spread  the term auction facil  taf  also appear to have been help   exhibit    show the result for the first three u s  auction   complet the exhibit  the result for the fourth auction  which was conduct ye day  were minimum bid rate       percent  stop out rate       percent  proposit        billion  bid to cover ratio        and number of bidder       in general  the pattern is one of declin bid to cover ratio and a declin spread between the stop out rate and the overnight index swap rate   the result for the ecb and swiss nation bank auction show a similar pattern   at the latest auction  the ecb had       billion of bid  a bid to cover ratio of       and their number of bidder fell to    from    at the previous auction   the board of governor has said that on februari   it will announc plan for the taf in februari  the staff has recommend to the chairman that the auction continu on a biweek basi  that the size be maintain at     billion per auction  and that the minimum bid size be cut to    million from     million to make it easier for smaller institut to particip   final  there was no foreign currenc intervent activ dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the decemb    fomc meet   of cours  as alway  i am happi to take ani question
thank you  bill   are there question   presid pool
bill  could you talk about the role of foreign bank organ   what fraction rough are they respons for
we have been veri cautious about talk about the role of the foreign bank  but they   re definit a signific factor   the best way to look at it is just to look at the new york district  which is take an overwhelm share of not all but most of these auction  and most of that is foreign   regard the particip in term of number of bidder  the split is more even between domest and foreign  in term of the actual takedown of dollar  it   skew a bit to the foreign side  but it has been variabl   it is not the same in each auction
if i may make a comment about that   i think everyon is awar of my view that the taf   not chang the margin condit   it   s entir an inframargin oper  what it   is to save bank the spread between what their cost of fund otherwis would be and what they get at the taf   so it increas bank earn by that amount   it seem to me that there is potenti some reput risk to the feder reserv in the long run if a signific share of the benefit is go to foreign bank organ   i guess one question that i would pose is  if we think that this inform would be terribl sensit to releas  shouldn   t we be care about whether we continu if the foreign bank organ are take a veri larg fraction
yes  i have a coupl of question   i want to start with the issu about foreign bank  though   whi are we sensit about talk about foreign bank   i mean  is this a public stanc  or is this in the committe   the inform about the ident of the win bidder was sent to everi reserv bank
i don   t think we   re particular sensit  but i think other central bank would be veri sensit
well  these are confidenti proceed   this is a consequenti polici matter
mr  chairman  if i could   i think  presid    just one point is that the detail inform on the bidder was sent onli to those reserv bank presid and board member who specif ask for it  so it was not distribut unilater
just the win bidder
yes   well  the spreadsheet of bidder
i thought that everi bank  all the discount offic  receiv the ident of the win bidder  and the other inform about all the bid went onli to those who request it
that is correct  yes   the second point i would make is that i do not think there is particular sensit about foreign bank but instead sensit about take ani chanc of identifi who the bidder are at all becaus of the great concern about avoid stigma from the taf
i want to ask a coupl of question about the term auction facil   first  i   d like to hear more from you about what your understand is of the effect the term auction facil had on the fund market   the first question under that would be  to your knowledg  were these complet  il or just partial  il   anoth question would be  for the recipi  were these addit fund that they wouldn   t have otherwis borrow  or did they displac some other borrow   the next question would be  this crowd out someth  and if it didn   t chang materi the total amount of reserv in the system  some lend ought to be shift from the recipi to someon els   so what do we know about other spillov effect in the market   the focus of our attent probabl for data reason was the libor market  but there was also discuss in decemb of the term fed fund market   what do we know about the januari                 of     behavior of that sinc then   i   d be interest in your sens of whether bidder were riskier than nonbidd and whether riskier institut bid more than nonriski institut   we   ve done a bit of empir analysi   it   s preliminari   but i   d be interest in your folk    sens of that   about the foreign institut  i   m interest in learn about what the advantag was of our lend dollar balanc via this mechan to foreign bank versus the altern of have them borrow dollar balanc from their central bank  perhap fund by a swap or out of the foreign central bank   s own dollar balanc   final   and this is sort of the most import question   how should we evalu whether this has been a success or not   to what sort of object evid should we look to decid whether we achiev our object   relat to that  can a case be made for end this facil soon in light of the fact that the libor   oi spread is now half of what it was in septemb  when we decid that it had come down enough to shelv the plan
those are a lot of question    laughter   okay  i   ll take the easi one first  the taf is complet  il   for everi dollar that goe into the taf we drain reserv  and we   ve been do that main by redeem matur treasuri bill   regard whether these are addit fund to those entiti  it is hard to know what they would have done if the taf facil hadn   t been avail   this may have fund some asset on their balanc sheet that they otherwis would have decid not to fund   i think it is veri difficult to know what that counterfactu is   it is hard to believ that in the system as a whole it led to a lot of addit fund   i would be surpris by that  especi given that we did  il reserv and didn   t allow expans of the balanc sheet   in term of the issu of crowd out  the way i think about the taf is chang the composit of our balanc sheet and chang the composit of the bank system   s balanc sheet   it   s not crowd out   we are basic suppli treasuri secur by redeem bill  and then the treasuri issu more bill that the market want  and we januari                 of     are essenti absorb collater from the marketplac that   s hard for them to financ elsewher  so it is a chang in the composit of the balanc sheet   that   s how i would think of the way it work  in term of how we should evalu the success  we don   t know how much was the year end   we don   t know how much was monetari polici eas   but market particip view the taf as veri posit   i think that  if we were to discontinu it abrupt  they would be unhappi  there   s no evid to suggest that the taf has caus ani great harm   it look as though the benefit  to my mind  are like to signific exceed the cost even though we can   t measur those benefit veri accur   regard the foreign institut issu   the choic between dollar balanc from us versus dollar balanc from foreign central bank   i think it was a littl more complic than that becaus  if i rememb how we got to the foreign exchang swap  they were essenti more or less condit on our do the taf   they were will to do the swap if they could get the auction in tandem with our term auction facil   so my judgment would be that we probabl didn   t realli have a choic of get the dollar to those foreign bank through the ecb if we hadn   t done the term auction facil
if i could just follow up
did i miss ani
well  on the last point  that   s a matter of the ecb   s willing to lend to those institut   you   re say that they would be will to lend themselv to those institut onli if we did this   it   s not about the econom of their borrow from their central bank versus borrow from us   noth about the market function
i wouldn   t say it   s about their willing to lend to their institut   it   s their sens of what their respons is in term of provid dollar liquid to their institut  januari                 of     to the extent that they could just passiv take the dollar and funnel them through this auction process in which their auction was veri passiv   their auction was essenti a noncompetit auction that was base off our   they were will to do that   they were less will to do someth in which they were take respons for the problem and say that they were go to get the dollar and suppli them to those bank
do market particip view foreign bank organ as broad riskier than compar size institut base in the unit state
well  it   s difficult to say   if you look at credit default swap  that would say not   but as presid   and i were talk befor the meet  those credit default swap may also contain differ appetit to recapit bank when they get in troubl in the unit state versus abroad   so the one thing that we can probabl say with confid for the period is that there   s more anxieti that thing are hidden in certain foreign bank that are probabl not as like to be hidden in u s  bank   there   s better disclosur in the unit state on a fa  and more real  e basi   the market sens is that there isn   t realli the same kind of quarter disclosur process abroad that happen for u s  institut
may i add one factual comment to that
dure the height of the disloc in decemb  the fed fund rate overnight was regular trade substanti higher earli in the morn   this happen also in august for a while   either earli in the u s  trade session or befor that   our understand from market particip was that the reason for those higher rate in the morn was excess demand from european base institut to borrow in the fund market  and when the u s  institut becam more activ later in the day  the fund rate would then go back down to the target
thank   go back to the libor   oi spread   that was what motiv this   it has fallen a lot   the bid to cover ratio is fall   if we tri to lend     billion three more  e  we could get to a point at which we satiat the market in term fund
well  first of all  continu that     billion is not suppli ani addit dollar  so we   re just go to be roll over matur auction
yes  but the bid to cover ratio keep fall
right   but  second  i would caution you that this last auction was right befor an fomc meet and that may have diminish the appetit   we don   t know with certainti  but our supposit is that the demand would have been higher if the auction had been a week later  if that   s how the schedul had fallen   third  februari might be fine  but march is a quarter end   last  the fact is that  while the term fund pressur seem to be better  a lot of other thing seem to be wors  and clear the pressur on bank balanc sheet has not diminish at all  if anyth  it has grown more intens   so to remov this prematur would be a risk  especi when market particip view this as help and it give them a sens of confid that the fed is there
the question that presid   ask cover one of the question i want to ask   but as we go down in term of the number of bidder as we proceed  is the portion that is foreign increas  relat speak   do we know
i don   t rememb ani strong sens of that
it   s decreas
what has happen  as the auction has proceed  is that peopl have bid more tight around where they think it   s go to come  except for a few institut who just say  januari                 of        i want the money     and they bid at veri high rate becaus it   s a singl price auction   you usual see some behavior like that
mr  chairman
foreign bank were     billion out of     billion at the first auction      billion out of     billion at the second auction  and a declin fraction thereaft  presid
thank you  presid
bill  in your remark  you devot quit a bit of  e to the deterior situat in the monolin  the implic be that the risk they may have affect the whole system   in the normal cours  do we have direct contact with them to get ani insight beyond what we get through analyst and rate agenc   i think you said that they are not terribl transpar in term of asset class and individu secur as to what they realli hold   have we had ani direct dialogu just to inform ourselv as to what the real situat is
i haven   t had much contact with them   i don   t know if   has
mr  chairman
we have not been in touch with them direct to get a sens about their risk profil and so forth   we have had extens convers with the new york state insur commission  who is the lead supervisor of mani of them  but not all of them   it turn out that offic also has veri littl inform  particular on the stuff that is on the lead edg of concern  which is to whom they sold credit protect and on what   but it is in the process januari                 of     of tri to remedi that  and we have been give them a littl help in tri to figur out what they need to ask for
anoth thing that is not veri well known is what their asset consist of  we have rate bucket  but we don   t know what those rate actual appli to   we don   t know who they have reinsur with   some peopl think that they   re reinsur each other to an extent or they have reinsur with subsidiari that they own so that the insur is not at arm   s length  so there   s quit a bit of cloudi about what their true condit is
we have better inform on the protect that bank purchas from the monolin   by monolin and by under asset   and it is import  of cours  to have that
yes   i would just note with the taf experi  go back just for a minut  that the boston financi communiti has been overwhelm support   i don   t know whether you have gotten the same sens when you talk to the financi communiti in new york  but whether peopl were bid or not  they actual thought that it was quit a fruit exercis   in term of the credit default swap  just look at some of the institut that were involv  it seem as if the u s  institut  if you look at individu organ  may have had much higher credit default swap rate than mani of the foreign institut   as you note  mani of the foreign institut were substanti lower than at least a coupl of the u s  one that were involv  and we obvious thought the u s  one were sound  or we wouldn   t have been will to have them particip   we should look at the libor rate  but i think we should also look at the treasuri secur market becaus you don   t have to do as much in open market oper if you   re do some of it in the taf  and we   ve had the interest rate on treasuri secur quit low  januari                 of     so i   m wonder whether  when we think about the analysi  we look not onli at thing like libor but also at the function of the treasuri market  and whether that was actual help out by this process   i don   t know if you   ve done ani work on that  but it would be of interest to know if that had help with the better function of the treasuri market
well  i think the presumpt is veri much that it went in the right direct in term of the treasuri market becaus basic the treasuri has auction off larger week one month  three month  and six month bill to replac those that we were redeem   so the float public suppli of bill went up
veri quick  we should not be surpris that bank like the taf   it increas the bank   s profit becaus of the differ between the fund cost   the issu is whether the taf improv the way the market are function  not whether it   s feed profit into the bank and whether they happen to like it
mr  chairman
i think it   s clear in bill   s present that there   s a veri strong case that the taf  the associ measur by other central bank  and  as import  the commit and the signal that we would continu the taf longer than was necessari have been veri import to the improv of market function and veri import to the improv and confid in liquid and market go forward   it is veri hard to know how import it has been to that  but i think it has absolut been veri import  and i think it is veri import for us to continu it until we can comfort say it is no longer necessari in this context   i think we are far from the point that we can claim that   it was    basi point in octob  presid    and januari                 of     there are a lot of reason that we should be expect to be live with a long period of fragil in market go forward   we all debat the merit of this go forward   there   s a set of good  principl object to this kind of stuff  and i didn   t expect that those object would chang on the basi of the experi with this thing  and i don   t think we   ve learn anyth new about the merit of those object  except that there   s a veri good basi of evid for suggest it has been import to the improv in confid and market function   one of our job is   and i think we   ve been pretti success in do it   tri to give some confid to peopl that we as the central bank have provid a qualiti of liquid insur more power than we can through our classic instrument   i think it has been veri success in this context   to take it back prematur would be damag to the improv we   ve achiev

give me one second   on balanc  the news we have receiv sinc the decemb  book has been disappoint   the top panel of your first exhibit sort some of the main indic into two categori   those that were surpris weak and those that came in to the upsid of our expect   as you can see  the list to the left is long   privat payrol fell in decemb  and the unemploy rate jump to   percent   manufactur output has declin sinc the summer   singl famili hous start  new permit  and home sale have fallen further   new order and shipment of capit good were disappoint  although a littl less so after today   s releas of decemb data   busi sen ent deterior  join alreadi unusu low read on consum confid   final  stock price have tumbl  and credit condit have tighten   not all the news was bad  nonresidenti construct activ has continu to be surpris robust  and defens spend look to have been higher last quarter than we anticip  moreov  retail sale in novemb came in stronger than we predict  and the figur for septemb and octob were revis up   overal  we read the incom    the materi use by mr  reifschneid  ms  liang  and mr  sheet are append to this transcript  appendix     januari                 of     data as impli an increas risk of recess   the middl left panel provid some evid for this assess   as was discuss at ye day   s board brief  base on the signal provid by    nonfinanci indic  the black line   the es  probabl of be in recess now or over the next six month stood at    percent in decemb  up from    percent in june   a similar exercis carri out use    financi indic  the red line  yield an even bigger jump in the es  likelihood of recess  from    percent at midyear to    percent this month   as you know  we are not forecast a recess   while the model es  of the probabl of recess have move up  they are not uniform in their assess that a recess is at hand   anoth argument against forecast recess is that  with the notabl except of hous  we see few sign of a signific inventori overhang   in addit  the recent weak in the labor market and spend indic is still limit  for exampl  initi claim have drift down in recent week rather than surg as they typic do in a major downturn   final  a good deal of monetari and fiscal s ulus is now in process that should help support real activ   that said  it was a close call for us   even without a recess  our assess of the under strength of aggreg demand has revis down mark sinc the summer   this is illustr in the bottom panel by the recent declin in the  book consist es  of short run r   the valu of the real fund rate that would close the output gap in    quarter   by our es   short run r  has fallen more than   percentag point sinc the middl of last year and    percentag point sinc decemb   a jump in the equiti premium account for most of the downward revis sinc the last  book  although a further deterior in the outlook for residenti invest is also a factor   your next exhibit summar the current forecast   so  how did we respond to all this bad news   as shown in the panel at the top  we boost real gdp growth a littl from      through        in      and       howev  this fa  growth is not demand driven but instead reflect upward revis to the suppli side of our forecast that i will discuss in a moment   for       the upward revis to real gdp in the fourth quarter   note in the panel to the right   reflect the stronger data on nonresidenti construct  defens spend  and retail sale that i just mention  howev  becaus the incom data point to a weaker trajectori for real activ in the near term  we have trim our forecast of gdp growth for the first half of       and we have mark down final sale growth  not shown  quit a bit   beyond the middl of the year  we project real output to expand at a rate close to it potenti  under these condit  we project greater labor market slack than in decemb  with the unemploy rate   shown in the middl left panel   now expect to edg up to    percent by next year   and as shown in the bottom two panel  we continu to expect both core and total pce price to deceler notic by       although inflat this year is like to run a littl higher than we previous project   your next exhibit provid an overview of some of the key factor influenc the outlook   as shown in the upper left panel  we condit our forecast on an addit    basi point cut in the fund rate at this meet and then held it flat at januari                 of       percent   we made this revis in respons to the weaker under level of demand in this project but with an eye to keep inflat on a long run path to    percent   the midpoint of the rang of      inflat project that you provid in octob   anoth key element in the outlook is our assumpt that concern over financi stabil and a possibl recess will begin to abat onc the economi get through a rough patch in the first half of this year   as nelli will discuss in more detail  this assumpt impli that risk premium on bond and corpor equiti should drift down over  e   as a result  we project that equiti price  shown to the right  will stage a partial recoveri over the second half of      and in        these and other financi market develop  coupl with an improv in busi and consum sen ent  should help to support consumpt and invest over  e   as regard fiscal polici  odd now seem high for the passag of a fiscal s ulus packag  although the detail are still up in the air   as a placehold  we built a      billion packag into the baselin  with two compon       billion in tax rebat that household will receiv in the third quarter and a    percent one year bonus depreci allow that should cost the treasuri about     billion in       our judgment is that the rebat compon will provid a signific  albeit temporari  boost to the level of consum spend dure the second half of this year and in earli       the period over which we expect most household to spend their check   in contrast  we think that bonus depreci will have onli a small effect on equip and softwar outlay   as indic by the blue bar in the panel to the right  these assumpt impli a larg fiscal driven contribut from pce and e s to real gdp growth in the second half of this year  follow by a similar size negat contribut in the first half of        as a result  the long run contribut to real gdp growth from these two factor is essenti zero   we have assum that inventori and import in the short run will offset a substanti fraction of the swing in domest demand  therebi mute the overal effect of the fiscal packag on real gdp growth  the   bar    as i note earlier  we also have reassess our suppli side assumpt   shown in the bottom left panel   specif  we have rais our es  of potenti output growth from      to      about   percentag point per year  part in respons to the solid gain in output per hour record last year   these revis es  have two import implic   first  the upward revis to potenti output translat rough one for one into fa  growth in actual output dure the project period becaus of it implic for perman incom and henc consumpt and invest   second  the revis to potenti output in histori impli that the output gap   shown to the right   current is lower than we previous thought  and we expect it to remain lower   your next exhibit provid some detail on the real side outlook   as shown in the top left panel  we have onc again revis down the project for new home sale in light of weak incom data  includ those receiv after we put the  book to bed   howev  we continu to expect that sale will reach bottom in the first half of januari                 of     this year and then begin to edg up as mortgag credit avail improv   this stabil in demand should allow singl famili hous start  shown to the right  to level out at about         unit by midyear  well below our decemb project  thereaft  we anticip a slow pickup in start   as shown in the middl left panel  builder still have a long way to go to bring the backlog of unsold home down to a more comfort level  and this overhang should restrain construct activ into next year   we have also revis down the near term outlook for real busi fix invest   the middl right panel   in respons to slow sale  tighter credit condit  and some deterior of busi sen ent  but we now expect a greater cyclic rebound start in the second half of this year as overal condit start to improv   the bottom left panel show our project for consumpt  the blue bar  togeth with the profil for spend exclud the effect of fiscal s ulus  the   bar   absent the s ulus packag  we would expect consum spend to increas onli   percent this year but then to pick up around    percent in      as confid recov and credit condit eas   howev  the tax rebat will like obscur this cyclic pattern by induc saw tooth swing in spend  with actual growth realign with longer run fundament onli in the second half of next year  as shown to the right  some of these fundament are less favor than befor  we es  that wealth effect will hold down pce spend growth by    percentag point this year and almost   percentag point in        your next exhibit review the inflat outlook   as indic by the blue line in the upper left panel  month read on core pce inflat have move up sinc the summer   we are inclin to take onli a small signal from this movement  much as we did earli last year when price increas were unusu subdu   in part  this is becaus a portion of the recent pickup was attribut to the errat nonmarket compon and quarter to quarter fluctuat in this categori tend to fade away quick   in addit  while market base price also came in higher than expect  we are interpret some of that surpris as a revers of some earlier low read in particular categori   that said  we also think that a portion repres somewhat more persist inflat pressur come into        we project both core and total pce inflat to moder over  e becaus of sever factor   to begin with  futur price for crude oil impli the sharp deceler in energi price shown to the right   we also expect food price  the middl left panel  to deceler into       part as result of the increas product of beef and poultri that is now under way  in addit  the impetus to inflat from core import price  the middl right panel  should diminish over  e  although by less than project in decemb becaus we now anticip a fa  rate of dollar depreci   these develop  coupl with the addit econom slack built into this project  should help to keep inflat expect anchor  allow actual inflat to fall below   percent in the longer run   inde  survey measur of long run inflat expect  the blue and red line of the bottom left panel  remain stabl   tip inflat compens  the black line  jump follow the intermeet fed fund rate cut  as bill point out   but as was discuss in the memo by jonathan wright and jennif roush that was circul to the committe  we are inclin to attribut most of this increas to chang in inflat risk and liquid premium  not to a rise in inflat expect januari                 of     per se   put all this togeth  we project core inflat   the first column of the panel to the right   to remain at     percent this year but then to drop down to     percent next year  the same as in decemb   similar  we continu to expect that headlin inflat will slow to    percent this year and slide to    percent in      as energi price moder   i will now turn the floor over to nelli

with the shade area denot the rang across year   softer hous price like play an import role in default on      and      loan becaus borrow had littl home equiti to tap when they lost their job or

to higher payment  about         each quarter this year  if these mortgag are not prepaid or rate are not reduc   while mani borrow still have  e to refin or sell befor the first rate reset  lower hous price and tighter credit condit are like to damp this activ   as note in the middl left panel  to project default on subprim arm  we use a loan level model that joint es  prepay and default  the model consid loan and borrow characterist at origin  subsequ msa  or state level hous price and employ fluctuat  interest rate  and    vintag    effect   as shown to the right  with data for the first

of subprim arm will default over the next two year   an import sourc of uncertainti around our project is how borrow will behav if fall hous price push their loan to valu ratio abov     percent   as shown in the first line of the bottom left panel  we es  that    percent of januari                 of     subprim borrow had a combin loan to valu ratio of more than     percent in the third quarter of last year   if we assum that nation hous price fall about   percent over the forecast period  as in the  book  an es     percent of subprim mortgag would have combin ltvs abov     percent   a similar calcul for prime and near prime mortgag  shown in the second line  indic that a not inconsequenti share     percent  of these would also be upsid down by the end of        while prime borrow like have other financi asset upon which to draw in the case of job loss or sick  such high ltvs pose an upsid risk to our baselin project of default   anoth sourc of uncertainti   this one on the

extern perform  januari                 of     from      to       u s  growth was on averag just   percentag point below that of our trade partner   in recent year  u s  growth has slow relat to foreign growth  and this gap has widen substanti  reach     percentag point on averag in      and        this has  consequ  restrain import relat to export   our forecast call for this gap to narrow onli slight through the forecast period   but this project depend crucial on the resili of growth abroad   an issu that is examin in your next exhibit   recent data have confirm our expect that foreign activ slow mark in the fourth quarter   as shown in the top left panel of exhibit     econom sen ent in the euro area fell in decemb for the seventh consecut month  and the ecb   s survey of bank lend point to further tighten of credit standard for both household and firm   in addit  euro area retail sale volum and industri product  not shown  have move down in recent month   in the unit kingdom  the preliminari read on fourth quarter gdp growth was surpris strong  but other indic seem to point to some soft go forward   as shown on the right  the bank of england   s new survey of credit condit indic a further declin in the avail of credit to corpor dure the fourth quarter  and the level of new mortgag lend has plung   other indic  includ consum confid  have also slid of late   the japanes economi may be weaken as well  as shown in the middl left panel  the decemb tankan survey show a further retreat in busi confid  includ a soften of sen ent among both larg manufactur and larg nonmanufactur   hous start have declin dramat late  as the construct sector adjust to new  tighter build standard   we also see sign that labor market condit may be weaken   as shown in the bottom panel  our assess is that total foreign gdp growth slow to about    percent dure the fourth quarter  distinct down from the   to     percent pace record through      and the first three quarter of        notabl  the fourth quarter slowdown was broad base   we es  that growth in mexico  line    declin sharpli  in line with a contract in u s  manufactur output   chines gdp data  which were report after the  book went to press  indic that growth in the fourth quarter remain below it doubl digit pace in the first half of the year  with export post a contract   the middl right panel summar what we see as the key sourc of this near term slow   first  a number of countri have experienc headwind from the ongo financi turmoil  this is particular the case for the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada   in addit  sharp recent declin in equiti market have occur in a much broader set of countri   the soften of u s  growth is a second factor weigh on activ abroad  especi for countri like canada and mexico and mani in emerg asia that have sizabl trade linkag with the unit state  third  through      and       mani of the foreign economi enjoy except rapid cyclic expans  so some eventu moder in the pace of growth seem inevit  and we have been project a deceler for some  e   return to the bottom panel  we see these factor as continu to weigh on foreign activ through the first half of the year   thereaft  growth should gradual strengthen  to januari                 of       percent in the second half and to     percent in       as financi turmoil subsid and as the u s  economi rebound   nevertheless  we expect that growth will remain well below the headi pace record over the past two year   as shown in the top left panel of exhibit     our foreign outlook is also support by project eas of monetari polici abroad   given mount evid of econom weak and continu financi stress  we see the ecb and the bank of canada cut polici rate    basi point by the middl of the year  and the bank of england eas    basi point   given the persist inflat risk  this is admit an aggress call   but we see the case for monetari action as compel and believ that these central bank will be persuad  notwithstand their recent hawkish rhetor   the futur market also appear to be price in some eas  albeit at a more gradual pace than we envis   final  we now expect the boj to remain on hold until the end of        to be sure  there are a number of risk surround our forecast  most of which are on the downsid   first  the prevail financi headwind or the slow of u s  growth may be larger or more protract than we current project   second  we do not yet have a good sens of the extent to which mani foreign financi institut have been affect by the recent turmoil  and the releas of year end financi statement over the next six week or so could bring some bad news   a third risk is that over op ist expect of decoupl may lead to polici mistak   specif  to the extent that foreign author are convinc that they have decoupl from the unit state   or that they are immun from spillov due to the financi turmoil   they may be too slow to eas polici to address weaken demand   polici abroad may also be restrain by too narrow a focus on the recent rise in inflat  a topic to which i will return momentarili  final  hous market in some countri may be vulner   as shown in the bottom left panel  mani countri have experienc run up in hous price in recent year that are similar to or even exceed those record in the unit state  and hous price are now deceler sharpli in a number of these countri   further weaken of hous price pose the risk of advers wealth effect   notabl  of the major economi shown in the right panel  onli the unit state has yet seen a mark downward swing in the contribut from residenti invest to gdp growth   your final intern exhibit discuss our project for foreign inflat   as shown in the top panel of exhibit     averag foreign inflat jump up to an annual rate of     percent in the fourth quarter  with mark increas in both the advanc foreign economi  line    and the emerg market  line      the sourc of this rise in inflat   includ rapid increas in the price of food and oil   have been well document   go forward  we see averag foreign inflat move back down to an annual rate of     percent in the second half of this year and continu at that pace in        despit the run up in realiz inflat rate  read on long term inflat expect have remain well anchor   as shown in the middl left panel  breakeven inflat rate for the advanc foreign economi have continu to hover around     percent on averag  and long term inflat forecast have stay near   percent   for the emerg market  averag long term inflat forecast  shown on januari                 of     the middl right  have remain between   and     percent in recent year   the bottom panel show four quarter percent chang for the price of oil  food  and metal   given the mark slow of global activ  the stage seem set for some deceler in commod price  inde  metal price are alreadi on a downward trajectori   thus  in line with quot from futur market  we see the pace of increas in oil price and food price as declin signific over the next few quarter   nevertheless  we have been wrong on this score befor and freeli acknowledg that there are upsid risk to this project     madigan will now continu

i will be refer to the separ packag label    materi for fomc brief on econom project      tabl   show the central tendenc and rang of your current forecast for             and        central tendenc and rang of the project made by the committe last octob are shown in ital   as for condit assumpt  most of you see the appropri near term path of the feder fund rate as at or below that assum in the  book   eight policymak explicit assum somewhat more near term eas than in the  book   howev  sever of you assum that polici would need to begin firm no later than        mani of you also project that the fund rate would exceed the level forecast in the  book by the end of the forecast period   as shown in the first row  first column  of tabl    the central tendenc of your forecast of real growth for      has been mark down about    percentag point sinc last octob   most of you remark that a rang of factor had prompt you to lower your growth expect for the current year  includ the continu turmoil in financi market and the result tighten of credit condit  the persist deterior in the hous market  incom data suggest slower consumpt expenditur and busi invest growth  and higher oil price   a few of you suggest that stronger export demand as well as fiscal s ulus would provid some offset to weak in privat domest demand  particular begin later this year  your half year project  not shown  suggest that you all think that  more like than not  the economi will skirt recess   on averag  you see real gdp grow at an annual rate of about   percentag point over the first half befor pick up to a     percent pace in the second half   as shown in the second row  in view of the weak growth forecast for this year  most of you revis up your expect for the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter about     percentag point  to around    percent   most of you project slight brisker growth this year than the  book     perhap part reflect the assumpt that a number of you made that there would be more near term monetari eas than the staff assum   as shown in the third and fourth set of row  with incom inflat data a bit higher than previous expect and despit project weaker real activ  the central tendenc of your project for total and core pce inflat this year have increas about     percentag point   that upward revis is a bit larger than the     percentag point upward revis to the  book inflat forecast but leav the level of your project close to those in the  book   most of you see total and core    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     januari                 of     inflat this year at a littl abov   percent   but as shown in the bottom section  the upper limit of the rang of your overal inflat project for this year has move up to     percent   your forecast for total pce inflat this year remain a bit higher than for core inflat  reflect the expect of higher energi  food  and in some case  import price inflat   look ahead to next year  your forecast indic that you expect econom growth to pick up as the drag from the hous sector dissip and credit condit improv   the midpoint of the central tendenc of your forecast for real gdp growth is     percent   your growth forecast for next year are most abov the staff   s forecast of     percent  perhap again becaus a number of you assum more aggress polici eas in the near term and perhap becaus at least some of you appear to see potenti output growth as a bit brisker than the staff     with most of you evid see growth a bit abov trend next year  the unemploy rate begin to edg lower  but the central tendenc of your unemploy project still remain distinct abov that in octob   although you are general op ist about improv condit next year  your view have becom consider more dispers   as shown in the lower section  the width of the rang of the growth project for      has near doubl  as has the width of the rang of the unemploy project   the third and fourth set of row in the upper panel indic that most of you see overal and core inflat as move below   percent next year   some of you said that those declin reflect less pressur from energi price and  with the unemploy rate abov the nairu  the emerg of some slack in the labor market   it is worth note  howev  that despit the eas of pressur on resourc dure      and       the central tendenc of your inflat project for next year are essenti unchang from octob   this develop presum reflect your percept of some deterior in the near term inflat output tradeoff  perhap prompt in part by the public of surpris high inflat data for the fourth quarter of      and an expect that those effect will linger in        turn to       the interpret of your longer term project is a bit less straightforward than it was in octob   it was note dure the trial run phase that a  e may come when the economi is seen as unlik to be in a steadi state by the third year of the project   to some extent  that  e seem to have alreadi arriv  in particular  a comparison of the central tendenc for unemploy in      from your januari and octob project suggest that you now see a bit of slack persist that year   the central tendenc and rang of your total and core inflat project for      have chang just a bit from those in octob  but those chang might be view by outsid analyst as signific   in particular  the central tendenc for total inflat in      has inch up     percentag point  and the lower limit of the central tendenc for core inflat has increas the same amount   absent guidanc to the contrari  some analyst might now conclud that your    comfort zone    has edg up to    to   percent from     to   percent   to counter this impress  presum the publish    summari of econom project    should suggest that  becaus a bit of econom slack is expect to persist at the end of       inflat januari                 of     could continu to edg lower beyond the project period   this discuss  howev  rais not onli a present point but also a substant one  and that is  whi should your inflat project for      have revis up at all   true  the inflat output tradeoff appear to have deterior a littl recent  but as dave reifschneid note  some of that deterior is like to be temporari   also  higher inflat than otherwis might in principl be a consequ of take out some insur now against especi weak econom outcom   but given the signific negat shock to aggreg demand embed in your modal forecast and the associ upward revis to slack across all three year of your project  as well as the absenc of ani upward revis to your inflat project for       even the small upward revis to your inflat project in      seem somewhat surpris   turn to the uncertainti in the outlook  the upper panel of exhibit   show that even more of you than in octob judg that uncertainti regard prospect for econom activ is higher than it histor level   even with the signific reduct in the target fund rate alreadi in place and  for mani of you  an assumpt of more eas to come  the lower panel illustr that most of you still see the risk to growth as tilt to the downsid   as reason  you again cite tighter credit condit for household and busi eman from further disrupt in financi market as well as the persist deterior hous outlook   as shown in the upper panel of exhibit    more of you than in octob see the uncertainti around your total inflat forecast as close to that of the past two decad  while a smaller minor view uncertainti as greater than in the past   as shown in the lower panel  fewer of you now see the inflat risk as predomin to the upsid  on balanc  as in octob  downsid risk to growth were more frequent cite than upsid risk to inflat  which seem broad consist with each of the altern polici statement that were in bluebook tabl     thank you
thank you   that   s quit a bit of inform to digest     anyon have question for our colleagu   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a coupl of question that are somewhat differ   on the labor front  i   m curious if you could offer some thought on how deterior in the labor market might be come about   whether or not it would be from the hire front or the job destruct front   as the research literatur has evolv over a long  e  i think it has move a bit away from job destruct play the key role and more toward reduct in hire   i wonder how this inform the way you look at the data   ani insight you have into that would be quit help   then i wonder if you could just talk a bit more about the interest memo that was januari                 of     distribut on inflat compens and the implic for expect   as i read it  it seem to indic that inflat expect  if anyth  were come down from the five year forward but that inflat compens was higher   so   that mean that the varianc of inflat is higher   are peopl talk about the possibl of disinfl dure this period   i would expect it to come with that type of compens   your thought on that would be great
do you want me to take that last question  or do you want to
well  i could start if you would like
i think the point we are tri to make in that memo regard inflat compens were that  first of all  it   s veri difficult to make these judgment about what is go on with inflat expect  inflat risk premium  and so on  but our best read of the evid was that probabl inflat expect have not move up signific recent   we base that on a varieti of indic   i won   t go through all of them now  but to me the most compel evid to support that point is that inflat compens over the next five year has actual come down over the intermeet period  and it is a littl hard to ration whi inflat expect would have risen so far out  wherea in the near term they seem  if anyth  to be declin   of cours  various factor can affect inflat compens  includ relat liquid and inflat risk premium  and we certain don   t want to exagger our abil to decompos these chang into these various factor   it is possibl that inflat risk premium  in particular  have move up  and some evid   suggest that
i neglect to say how interest that memo was   the analysi is realli veri good   i look forward to see more of it
the onli thing i would add to     s statement is that i think uncertainti about inflat in the long run could be move up notic without realli bring into play disinfl or someth like that   in other word  you could be more worri about go down to     or    than you were befor   i don   t know   it could be more just as it was in the forecast
may i have a two hander on this
when you think about what   s go on  it is plausibl that it is both up and down   that   s the key point here   becaus if you also look at the project  there is a lot more uncertainti about what   s go on in the real side of the economi   that could mean that inflat could drift down and longer run inflat expect could drift down if  in fact  there   s some uncertainti about what the object of this committe are   on the other hand  we actual did take a veri sharp interest rate cut  and that could indic that the committe might toler somewhat higher inflat   so even though the action that was relat to the big jump in inflat compens was a cut in interest rate  i think there is a plausibl argument that it could be symmetr in term of increas uncertainti on both side
that   s what i was focus on   the mean preserv natur of that
i think it is consist with your view  but i just want to clarifi
on job destruct versus a slower pace of new job creation  it   s hard to answer that one   some of those pattern have chang over  e  and in monitor labor market develop  we   re tri to keep track of those two element and that sort of thing  whether that would materi chang the way we would look at  say  just what payrol employ growth was do  it would still be one of our main read come in   as to exact how that work januari                 of     out behind it  i   m not sure it would make too much of a differ   i don   t know whether dave might want to add someth to that
obvious  we would be monitor those develop   we are monitor the gross flow in the labor market  and i think to a larg extent the slow that we have seen thus far in employ growth has come more from a slower pace of hire than it has from an increas in layoff   more recent  in the jolt data as of novemb  there has been a signific increas in layoff and discharg  and there has been some further slow in hire  if we were to truli move into a recess  you would still see a lot of layoff  and there would be a fair amount of job destruct  so the cyclic aspect would still like show through pretti strong
i guess i was think that  if you talk to peopl  you hear more about the job destruct aspect  but you don   t hear quit the same inform about hire  except you might hear more nervous   that   s all
hire plan have come off a bit in most of the survey that we follow  but just a bit   not a lot yet
presid    did you have an interject
yes   my staff is suspici that the employ number have actual been weaker than the data have shown   they have been focus on the birth death model and the payrol survey is base upon assumpt relat to the birth of construct firm  which logic would not be creat job in this environ   do you have a take on that issu
well  if bill wascher  who is our expert in this area  want to say someth  i would certain let him go ahead and say someth
sure   the birth death model basic assum that the cyclic properti of birth and death are the same as for continu establish   the bls has onli about five year of experi with the birth death model  so i think it is pretti difficult to judg whether they need to make ani addit adjust in birth and death  other than the same pattern that occur in term of net employ chang in continu firm   but without much to go on  they don   t take a veri strong stand on whether they do a veri good job of pick up the turn point becaus they don   t have ani histori on which to base their analysi   so i think there are reason to suspect that that is possibl the case  but i don   t think there is ani strong evid that it is  and it is import to note that they do assum some cyclic in birth and death in their procedur
thank you  mr  chairman      i want to ask you about the project  well  it is more than an exercis now   the project that we are offer are for real   what is the messag that come out of the project   that is  if i am talk to the press or to other and they say     what do i make of all of this      my question to you is  what do you make of all of this   what is the messag for the implic for polici or the implic for anyth  you know  the data don   t realli speak for themselv   we are throw out a lot of stuff here to the market  and what is the market suppos to make of it
well  that is a hard question  actual   you know  obvious in some sens the number at some level do speak for themselv
okay   what are they tell us    laughter
i think they say that the committe is expect relat slow growth in the period immedi ahead but that the economi avoid a recess   there is some januari                 of     recoveri over the subsequ year   it is not extraordinarili brisk   it is a fair gradual recoveri in term of growth   the unemploy rate move up a littl  as you would expect with a period of growth below trend  but   not get extraordinarili high  and inflat  after come under some upward pressur of late  gradual edg back down to level below   percent   i am not sure that i am say anyth terribl enlighten here   of cours  one point that i should emphas is that the full summari of econom project  we hope  give more textur than i was just abl to give to the committe   s view about the modal outcom and to the committe   s concern about the risk to both growth and inflat
the reason i rais the question is that it seem to me veri import that we have some interpret as to what we make of all this and what we want the market to make of all this   in particular  let   s say the observ that the project or the risk are weight to the downsid   you might get some peopl say     well  if we get some employ report or other that in fact come in weaker than anticip  that mean that the committe is on the edg of pull the trigger to respond to it      that might be a possibl messag that peopl would take from this   if that is not the messag that we want to convey  then we had better be veri care how we talk about these
presid pool  i would just point out that when these are releas it will be simultan with my tes oni to the congress  and so i will have opportun to put some context on it at that  e
i guess my question is direct as much to the chairman as it is to    which you will answer in the tes oni
i will answer in the tes oni    laughter   presid
first  i  too  want to thank you all for the paper on forward inflat compens   i agre with the conclus that it is difficult   especi in  e of strain trade condit  i think that is the conclus   whether you interpret the outcom the way it was interpret in the paper or the way i do it more cynic  i think that is the key under point   i thought that was a veri valuabl  use paper  and i want to thank you  governor    for commiss it  my question is to nathan on your inflat project   read through the  book   even though the section on the intern side is veri thin   with the except of china  where i think we can sell a lot of    whip inflat now    button  and of argentina  where the number are rig  but even in those countri  what i took home was that everybodi was surpris on the upsid in everi countri rang from the advanc countri  as we call them  to turkey   then  if you look at the exhibit    that you just present to us  those number are confirm in the fourth quarter  and then there is a sharp falloff proceed from there   you gave us a good analysi of the risk to the foreign outlook in growth  and then you conclud your comment on inflat by say that we have been wrong befor  that there is some upsid risk  so my question is  what are the risk on the inflat side   could you elabor on them  just as you elabor on the risk to growth in the foreign outlook
we are happi to hear that there is demand for a bigger intern section    laughter   you had better be care what you wish for
but i am veri serious about this   sudden there is a falloff   would you give us a sens of the risk   it can   t be all one side
right   just a word of background   the rational for the falloff is the expect declin in these commod price and the expect slow of global demand   now  januari                 of     think about the risk  i am reason convinc that global demand is go to slow  which i believ will translat into reduc demand for mani of these commod that have driven up inflat   howev  that say someth onli about the demand side of these commod market   there is also a lot go on on the suppli side   at the last fomc meet  we talk about ethanol and the fact that mani of these emerg market countri are wealthier  that they want to eat better than they use to  that the relat price of energi has risen  and that it take a lot of energi to rais these crop   so there are suppli factor as well as demand factor at work in drive up these commod price   it is veri hard for us to forecast the suppli side of these market   it is driven by thing like weather and geopolit develop and so on and so forth   on the commod  my sens is that demand is go to shift in to some extent   as long as the suppli  sn   t shift in as well  we should be abl to see a declin  or at least a slower rate of increas  in these price   a veri import point here is that  in order to get less of an impetus come from commod price and inflat in these countri  we don   t necessarili need oil price to come down in level term   we just need them to stop go up at such rapid rate   if we get slower rate of price increas  that will be disinflationari relat to where we have been  that is how i would character the risk around this forecast  main on the suppli side of these commod market
thank you  mr  chairman   nelli  i have two question for you   one is on exhibit    where you forecast in the middl right panel the rate of increas in default on subprim arm   if you compar that with your reset rate es  and your hous price assumpt or the hous price assumpt in the market  i wonder whether that januari                 of     look a littl op ist   can you just say a littl more about whi  under the baselin scenario  given what has happen to hous price alreadi and what is ahead  you wouldn   t think that would be substanti greater
we have revis this forecast up quit a bit sinc the first  e we look at this mayb in june or august  in part becaus of lower hous price and tighter credit condit   the model requir as input default and prepay  and the prepay rate have been fair slow but not zero   the      vintag  as it approach it first reset  has been that    to    percent are abl to prepay   they are abl to find someth   so we don   t want to assum that none of them will be abl to   the model would approach both of those  so that is the posit side   the downsid is that our forecast  with the nation hous price assumpt of rough minus   over the forecast period    impli hous price declin on the order of minus    percent a year or more in california  florida  and some other place   that   leav the loan to valu ratio  as i mention  pretti high for mani borrow   we have never had this kind of episod  so we have to make a judgment about the point at which subprim borrow walk away from their hous   the current assumpt is that at about     percent we just say you are out  but it has to be almost an assumpt that  if by then you hadn   t default  we would push you out   so there is an upsid   on the other hand  say    percent of the outstand stock will default over two year sound like a big project as well   so we tri to balanc  there are risk on both side  for sure
thank you   my second question is about your project credit loss  and i apolog if you said this in your introduct   are these loss across all holder of that credit risk
yes   we have not distinguish between who is hold the secur   bank or investor   so mortgag would includ the    percent or so that are commerci bank  and it would also includ those held by investor in the primari form
we  be the fed  know a fair amount about what bank hold   do you have a crude es  of what share of this bank hold  or what share of this would end up be eaten by bank
in mortgag     percent is actual probabl a pretti good es
for all the credit
they have that much of the busi sector and that much of the mortgag  so that pretti much cover it
i am just tri to get at how you interpret this   so    percent of the addit      billion relat to normal or relat to bank capit cushion now  is what   is it a lot or not so much
one issu here is whether you want to do it relat to current capit cushion   bank can rais capit   if they anticip that they will need to rais capit  they can cut dividend further   i haven   t done that sort of exercis   one way to think about this is that the averag long run rate is about    basi point on debt  in the  book baselin it run to about   percent  and in the altern  it get close to about     percent of debt   so  it is not outsid the realm of histori   it is on the high side
we have had some bad point in histori   i am not tri to forc you to give a predict  but were you reassur by this or troubl by it  fundament  in term of the capac of the financi system to absorb it
no  i understand   i think the third altern get beyond what most are expect at this point
yes  i would agre with that
in that sens  it   repres a risk that you are go to get dynam feedback between loss and household spend and lend   it is a high risk   so i wouldn   t say    comfort      i think we were say that this is beyond probabl what our model could respond to in our typic way or it would be anoth dynam feedback loop of some sort that we don   t typic adjust for
presid     oh  i am sorri   a two hander
just a quick followup  this  sn   t includ loss from secur   it is onli the loan  right
the loan could be packag in secur   this is debt   it includ all debt   now  whether it is repackag into an mbs  it would be there   it wouldn   t be if it got in a cdo or someth
just in corpor bond  for exampl
yes   it includ corpor bond
okay   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i have three question   let me go to   first   this is more of a comment   in your descript of the forecast  you refer sever  e to the notion that there might be slack in the economi in      base on these number   i guess my reaction to that  while i was kind of skeptic  i am not sure exact how you infer that from what was report   certain  that seem to be true in the  book forecast  but trend growth januari                 of     seem to be as good as or better than it was in the last project   in       inflat   true   is a littl higher   the unemploy rate may be a     or     percentag point higher   but unless you infer someth about what peopl thought the nairu might be  i don   t know how you would necessarili infer that the reason inflat went up in these forecast was that there was slack in the economi in these project   so i just want to caution about the languag we use in how we describ what we see here without necessarili infer someth about whether  in ani individu person   s forecast  there may or may not have been slack   in mine  there wasn   t in       but i don   t see that necessarili follow from what these number look like   that was my onli observ here
mayb i can respond to that   it is veri inferenti  and it is base part on the two tenth    differ from the octob exercis when it was actual clear   i think clearer at that  e   from particip    forecast that mani particip character their nairu as be in the vicin of    percent   unfortun  the writeup this  e were not all that explicit on this point  but it is the comparison with octob that i was lean on fair heavili
i have two other question that i would like to pose   one is the chang in the  book   s assumpt about the increas in potenti gdp   in particular  i am curious becaus what it essenti    it seem  is to build in a signific amount of slack or output gap in      and      that didn   t exist in the last  book   i am infer that part of the reason the more aggress eas in the polici assumpt   not have ani effect on inflat to speak of is that it is offset by the increas gap that you have built in   so i would like a littl more explan about the justif for build in a greater gap or a higher potenti   but i am also curious to know  if you hadn   t done that  what your forecast for growth and inflat januari                 of     would look like in  let   s say       and        could you give some guess  of how that might have affect it
in term of the rational for increas potenti go back over histori  some of that  as i think i mention  was just that actual product perform has been better than the last  e we review this in the summer  and we are take that on board   that is part of the motiv   anoth part of the motiv is what we perceiv is a somewhat grow tension between the way we saw labor market slack develop and the way we were look at slack in term of the product side through the output gap   we had arriv at a point this round where those tension had increas over  e  and this revis mitig some of that tension  so those two thing are in better align with each other   we also were take the opportun  when we open up  to look at some other technic factor we use that get involv in go from  say  the nonfarm busi sector to gdp  that sort of thing  and those also push us in the direct of be a bit more op ist on growth go back   so we did view it  if you look at it in term of product market  as that there was more slack now than we had previous been think and that there was also more slack in the labor market   but that was from the actual data that came in   go forward  we have more slack   we have more slack just in the labor market becaus we have revis up the unemploy rate   with that  and take on board these assumpt of potenti output  we have more slack on the output side  now  one question would be  to address your second question  how would thing have chang if we hadn   t taken that on board   well  go forward  we would have written down a lower gdp forecast becaus what we are realli say here is that it is not that household and firm have chang their percept  this is just us  the poor econometrician  tri to infer what is out there in the real world   so the poor econometrician have infer that potenti januari                 of     output is grow stronger   we have to look at it and say     well  so the prospect go forward for perman incom  corpor earn  and that sort of thing  will be stronger  and that impli basic a one for one ratchet up      if we had said     well  no  potenti output growth go forward won   t be stronger     we would have revis down the gdp growth rate with it  so there wouldn   t have been ani chang in the output gap from that   that would have been shift one for one   it wouldn   t have chang our sens of what resourc util would be go forward
so are you say that your path of the gap would have been unchang
the path of the gap would have been to a first approxim unchang go forward   some of the greater resourc util now and go forward is a combin of the fact that we haven   t realli chang our view on the labor market  asid from onc we took on board the new unemploy rate data  but that we did chang on the product market   go forward  the way it evolv further on  we see the labor market gap open up a littl more and the output gap open up a littl more   that is driven primarili by our sens that the economi in an under sens is weaker   and we have made an adjust for that with the monetari polici assumpt   but it is not quit enough   we haven   t lower the fund rate as much as we would have need to do to total wipe out that fact and keep resourc util constant go forward on the product side   this is a difficult question   it was a difficult one for us  definit  go through it becaus we had mani move part
well  it   realli chang the charact of the forecast substanti  i think
if you think about the forecast as resourc util and inflat  then it has an effect on resourc util that is bigger now go forward in the product market   we also see a bigger effect in the labor market  and if that were the onli thing  it would have put more downward pressur   but not a lot   on inflat   but as i mention  we are come into this forecast with somewhat wors inflat perform late  and we think that has some persist   so that is help balanc it out
my last question is also relat to some adjust that struck me in the panel you talk about where you construct the revis es  of r    the first item on your list that you talk about was that the equiti premium had gone up  and that was a big factor  so i have a coupl of question   that was an adjust factor   now  the way i would think about the stock market declin would be primarili have a wealth effect that work it way through consumpt   that would be the normal channel   yet the  book and this discuss seem to suggest that somehow there was an addit adjust made becaus of the rise in the equiti premium   is that correct or not  or is it just the wealth effect that you are talk about   are these separ
no  it is not separ  the equiti premium is a larg reason that we had the big drop in stock valu
but is the mechan through a wealth effect on consumpt growth
most  but not total
well  what   that mean
i would say a coupl of thing   one  you can think of the cost of rais capit through equiti as have some small influenc on busi invest   that is pretti small   the big effect would be primarili on consumpt  as you mention   wealth januari                 of     effect to a smaller extent would affect hous as well   but i think of that as a wealth channel  but there is a bit of a cost of capit effect through rais fund through equiti that you might think of as well   anoth thing i would say is that the difficulti here is distinguish the equiti premium from general risk concern  risk premium in general  or increas compens for higher risk or default risk in a number of these credit spread we are talk about  those are sort of relat   it is hard to keep these thing separ in ani kind of an account   also  these thing tend to be correl with consum and busi sen ent   again  that is anoth thing that is hard to keep separ
so are these    extra channel       if you want to call them that   typic part of the forecast chang and how you evalu   that is to say  in the fall  when the stock market boom    percent  are we go to get anoth kicker upward in r  due to these same factor
it might not happen   i mean  you could have a situat in which busi sen ent would not take a hit  for exampl  simultan with the stock market tumbl  and you would not see some risk premium on bond go up   that would be veri unusu
i am just react to this veri larg chang in your es  of r  and attribut it to equiti premium  and i was just tri to figur out both
we just had a realli big drop in the stock market  and that is the biggest piec of what is go on   but we have also mark down consider our hous forecast   that is in an exogen shift in aggreg demand  the is curv   that is anoth chunk of what is go on here   we have had some increas in risk spread  not just in the equiti januari                 of     premium   despit the fact that treasuri rate have fallen  corpor bond yield have not as much  and we don   t have as much there  so there is in general a widen of risk premium
well  i am just tri to sort out how much of this is realli due to the stock market move around
a big chunk of this is due to the stock market  so i don   t know what we can do other than to take that on board in our forecast   as dave note  there are a few other  small wrinkl  and we didn   t just invent those extra wrinkl this  e around   they have alway been there   but most of this is work through the wealth effect on the consum spend side   so it is a weaker stock market and much weaker consumpt   that is the aggreg demand channel   the other piec is hous  which i don   t want to minim becaus  in fact  that is anoth nontrivi factor hold down demand and  we think  depress our es  of the equilibrium fund rate here over the intermedi term
i didn   t understand that this was just primarili the wealth effect or whether you were refer to someth differ
no  noth differ   again  the way the stock market and other element of spend oper is a littl more complic than just a consum spend channel  but it realli is wealth effect
i wonder if i could entic anybodi for a cup of coffe   laughter   whi don   t we take a fifteen minut break  and then we   ll commenc with the go round   thank you   coffe break
if it is okay with everybodi  we can start the econom go round at this point   presid pool  you are up
thank you  mr  chairman   i am not sure how i got to be first here  but i guess i was be unusu agreeabl when   ask me    laughter   the general tenor of comment that i hear from our director and peopl around the eighth feder reserv district   these are the communiti banker and smaller firm   is that thing are slow but not disastr slow   the comment that i hear from a seri of phone call to much larger nation compani are decid more pessimist  with one except that i will talk about in a moment   my contact at a larg nation truck firm say that they are in a    month recess in transport   they are cut their capac  cut the number of truck  and i think the number on their cap ex illustr the situat   for            million  for            million  and their plan for      is      million   that is down a littl more than    percent in two year  so they are realli cut back   i also call friend at up and fedex  and general thing are not a whole lot differ but a littl weaker than they have been   neither firm has ani particular issu with labor suppli   domest express busi is flat  and custom are switch to the lower price servic instead of overnight deliveri at the end of the afternoon  shift to ground servic  and that sort of thing   on intern busi  u s  outbound volum for fedex is up   percent   that would be consist with the export increas that we have seen   report are that asia is a bit slower but is still grow veri rapid   asia to the unit state is up    percent     percent to europ and latin america   the freight market is dead   that is the way my contact put it   down   percent year over year   that is consist with my truck industri contact   and pretti much the same with up   my contact with the fast food industri   the quick serv restaur  or qsr  busi   say the demand there is definit weak   they are come in rough flat  i guess  or actual down so far this year   price are up becaus of the increas in food cost   the casual dine industri is in wors shape than the fast food industri  januari                 of     my contact also follow retail in general pretti close and find that retail busi in general is weak   that is consist with a lot of the report that we have been receiv  a major except is in the it area   softwar   i have contact with a larg softwar compani  and the contact note that  as announc  microsoft had a fantast quarter   the earn were up sharpli   pc hardwar sale are grow at a rate of    to    percent expect in the first half of this year  so we see strong growth in the pc market   consum demand is stronger than busi demand   both  howev  are pretti strong   the intern busi is do better  in part becaus the industri is have some success in reduc the amount of softwar piraci   the biggest problem is find softwar engin   this particular compani is run   percent behind it hire forecast and cannot find softwar engin   posit for us old guy  some of the retire are come back to write code    laughter   thank you   that is all i have
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i broad agre with the  book forecast for econom growth this year and with the assess that the downsid risk to that forecast are consider   the sever and prolong hous downturn and financi shock have put the economi at  if not beyond  the brink of recess   my forecast incorpor fiscal s ulus of the same magnitud as the  book and monetari s ulus that is somewhat larger   i have assum a    basi point cut at this meet and an addit    basi point cut dure the first half   my forecast show growth of     percent in       like the  book  but it has a more pronounc acceler in      as the monetari and fiscal s ulus kickstart the economi  the unemploy rate edg up this year to    percent befor drop gradual next year toward the natur rate of      i am especi concern about the outlook for consum januari                 of     spend   the combin hit to equiti and hous wealth will extract a consider toll  and consum spend will be further depress by slower growth in dispos incom due to weaker employ growth   delinqu and charg off on most form of consum debt have alreadi risen  and slower job growth seem like to exacerb this trend  prompt financi institut to further tighten credit standard and term   in my forecast  such develop reverber back negat onto econom activ  like the  book  i downgrad my econom outlook substanti sinc our last in person meet   the decemb employ report was probabl the singl most shock piec of real side news prompt this revis   but know that it is unwis to put too much weight on ani singl piec of data  i have been examin the question of whether that report was more signal or nois   the drop in initi ui claim to relat low level in recent week make such an assess import   becaus the behavior of both seri may have been affect by season factor near year end  it seem worthwhil to examin a broad rang of data bear on the labor market   my conclus is that the labor market has inde been weaken sinc mid       and the extent of weaken  while relat modest thus far  is quit typic of pattern seen when the economi is tip into recess  independ evid of a weaken in the labor market come from the household survey   even when adjust for definit and measur differ from the payrol survey  the household survey show a fair smooth trend of declin employ growth dure        the drop in payrol employ in decemb help bring the establish data into closer align with the household employ data   in the payrol survey  the slowdown is concentr in construct and financ   in the household seri  higher unemploy is actual widespread across sector   the household survey also contain other sign of a januari                 of     weaken job market   a    percent increas in the unemploy rate for job loser  which account for the lion   s share of the overal increas in aggreg unemploy  an increas in the number of newli unemploy job loser  which can be thought of as a broader measur than ui claim of inflow into unemploy  and an increas of   to    percent in the es  expect complet durat of an unemploy spell  suggest a reduc pace of outflow from unemploy   the labor forc particip rate of men and women of age    to    year has also fallen notabl in recent month   labor forc particip rate for this group have been edg down sinc the last recess  but the declin acceler in       and histor this group is among the first to respond to weaken labor market condit  data from the jolt survey  which we discuss in the q a round  confirm the weak reveal elsewher   the job open  or vacanc  rate is down  consist with the reduc pace of outflow from unemploy  as reflect in continu ui claim and unemploy durat  and layoff and discharg are up sharpli   other data cite in the  book  part    such as net hire plan for manpow  and nfib and survey measur of job avail and unemploy expect further corrobor a slowdown   with the aggreg unemploy rate now up onli     percentag point off it low  i would describ the deterior in the labor market thus far as modest  but it is noteworthi that an increas in unemploy of this magnitud  in the space of    month  has occur onli twice sinc      outsid of recess  while my modal scenario contain a near term slowdown rather than a contract  it is actual pretti rosi compar with what i fear might happen   my contact have turn decid negat in the past six to eight week  and further financi turmoil may still ensu   on consum spend  two larg retail report veri subdu expect go forward januari                 of     follow the weak holiday season  which involv a lot of discount   on hire and capit spend  my contact have emphas restraint in their plan due to fear that the economi will continu to slow   a serious issu is whether the tighten of credit standard that is under way will deepen into a full blown credit crunch   the new senior loan offic opinion survey show a notic tighten in lend standard  and this is confirm by my contact   for exampl  senior offic of a larg bank in my district recent describ a varieti of new step they are take to protect against credit loss   they are tighten underwrit practic across the entir consum lend and small busi loan portfolio   a recent strategi has involv classifi msas accord to whether their real estat market are stabl  soft  distress  or sever distress  use both histor and prospect view of properti valu   base on these design  the compani has reduc permiss combin loan to valu ratio in their home equiti portfolio  and go forward they intend to appli them across the entir consum portfolio   on the posit side  though  they note that lower interest rate have spur a surg in applic for mortgag refinanc  and a recent analysi show that the reduct in the prime rate is have a signific impact on arm reset expect  shift a larg number from increas to reduct at reset   in fact  an analysi conduct befor our most recent rate cut that assum a   percent prime rate in februari        and it is now at       es  that two third of the subprim arm portfolio would now experi a decreas in their month payment at reset   this is a sharp contrast from an analysi in june      with a prime rate of   percent  now let me turn briefli to inflat and inflat expect   i project that inflat will declin over the forecast period to around    percent  and i see the risk around that forecast as balanc   admit  though  the recent data on inflat have been worrisom  and they rais januari                 of     the issu of whether or not we can afford to cut rate as much as need to fight a recess without serious risk a persist higher rate of inflat and inflat expect   i tend to think this risk is manag  larg becaus of the credibl we have built   it appear to me that this credibl has reduc the respons of inflat to all the factor thought to influenc it  includ energi price  the exchang rate  and busi cycl condit   thus i consid it less like that rise energi price are go to push up core inflat veri much or that the pass through that   occur will easili get built into inflat expect   so i view inflat as less persist now than it onc was  tend to revert fair quick to the public   s view of our inflat object   i do hope that our long run inflat forecast will help peopl identifi what that object is   but even if inflat expect turn out to be less well anchor than i think  i still see the inflat risk go forward as rough balanc   with less well anchor inflat expect  there is greater risk that higher energi and import price will pass through into core inflat and inflat expect   by the same token  there is also a greater likelihood that inflat will declin should a recess occur   we look at the behavior of core and total inflat in the first three year follow recess from      to the last one in       and inflat declin in most of these episod   the except is       when core inflat remain essenti unchang   which seem consist with my view that inflat has becom less respons to the busi cycl over the past decad or so as we have acquir more credibl
thank you   presid
excus me   could i ask
presid    i think you answer this  but could you say a bit more about your monetari polici assumpt in your forecast   how did you get to an addit
we assum    at this meet
we assum an addit     which would be held in place through      q   and then a gradual rise
i mean the    whi     not the    what      sorri
the    whi
yes   whi that much rather than
a larger amount   i wouldn   t attach too much signific to the precis figur   it   s somewhat more
thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district economi has shown addit sign of soft in recent week   accord to our survey  manufactur activ drift lower in the past few month  although we also heard report of stronger oversea demand for u s  good   revenu growth in the district   s servic firm also weaken in januari  and our index for that sector dip into negat territori for onli the second  e in the past four year   our retail index  which in decemb had blip up to neutral after three negat month  dive again in januari   our retail respond say that the holiday sale season finish up weaker than expect and that big ticket categori continu to slump  especi furnitur and applianc   busi spend seem to have soften as well in recent week  as an januari                 of     increas number of firm report that they were delay capit spend project such as it upgrad  at our decemb meet  i report on a former director who head a firm that own a larg portfolio of retail properti and said that he describ the sector as in the best shape he had ever seen in his life   well  he is sing a differ tune   although his portfolio is in good shape so far  he is hear a lot about cancel project as a result of financi constraint from lender or equiti interest  and he say that the environ that he is oper in is complet differ from what it was when he talk to me sixti day ago   we are hear veri similar comment from a wide rang of contact in commerci real estat and communiti banker  residenti real estat market in the district remain general weak   home sale and construct remain dormant in mani market   sever realtor report see more prospect buyer  but they seem interest onli in kick the tire  in part becaus of difficulti in sell their current home  turn to price  concern about rise input cost were more widespread among our contact in recent week   our survey measur of manufactur raw materi price was up sharpli in januari at     percent  the second highest read in the fourteen year histori of the survey   the price paid measur in manufactur was a touch lower but still in an elev rang   expect price trend in manufactur were off sharpli  howev  perhap reflect the soften in demand that mani respond said they expect   in the servic sector  both current and futur price trend pick up outsid of retail   labor market condit in the fifth district have deterior in the last month   in a notic shift from previous survey  numer contact told us they had begun to trim payrol   the job cut were concentr in machineri and build materi manufactur  financi servic firm  and general contractor  januari                 of     in some region  howev   northern virginia  for exampl   some labor market remain tight  and we continu to hear of difficulti find high skill worker  i spent a bit more  e than usual on our region pictur becaus right now i am place a bit more weight than usual on our district report and what i read in the beig book   one can be skeptic about the increment valu of anecdot report in typic  e  but at  e like these  i believ they can and do provid a more  e read on what is go on   these region report have shade my outlook to the downsid relat to the pictur paint by the nation data  which is itself a somewhat discourag pictur   home construct has continu to declin  and the fall in permit last month suggest that further declin are in store   consum spend appear to have slow somewhat at the end of last year and seem to be carri less momentum into this quarter  as the  book like to put it   the decemb employ report certain was weak and has ad consider to fear of a recess   the  book forecast just skirt the border of an outright recess   my own project is fair similar but a bit weaker in the first half and with the weak stretch out a bit longer this year   i am inclin to see the bottom in hous as occur later than in the  book  which has hous start flatten out relat soon  and i am a bit less hope about busi invest  particular structur   i agre with the  book that the main effect of a s ulus packag will be to shift consumpt growth from       to late       but that the effect are uncertain   i think the risk are on the side of a smaller boost to spend  though   but there is a chanc that mani rule of thumb consum will find that their rule is tell them to pay down debt   in sum  i expect veri weak growth in the first half of this year with onli gradual recoveri to trend   while i think weak growth is the most like scenario  similar to presid    i do think that a recess is a januari                 of     quit distinct possibl this year   if that happen  i think it will be due to a more sizabl pullback in nonresidenti construct than we are expect right now  turn to inflat  it is hard to put a good face on the recent number   the  book describ the recent upsid surpris as transitori and expect inflat to diminish this year  inde  we have been get some relief on retail gasolin price in recent week   but i don   t think our problem with inflat are transitori  and i don   t want to lose sight of them in the midst of the current weak   if you look back over the past four year  the overal pce price index has averag    percent   on a    month basi  the index has been below   percent onli four month in that span   now  one could interpret this as a regim of   percent inflat with a seri of miss that happen to be virtual all on the plus side   altern  you could view this as a regim in which inflat fluctuat around a mean of    percent   market measur of inflat expect seem more consist with the former right now   but the longer that inflat averag well abov   percent  the more risk we run of see expect rise to match actual inflat rather than the other way around   anoth way to see this is that the fragil we need to focus on now is our credibl   i mention all of this becaus it is whi  in my econom project this round  i wrote down a relat sluggish recoveri after the first half of this year   i am skeptic that we have seen noth but posit inflat miss around a   percent trend for four year becaus of chanc alon  and i am not op ist about inflat come down in a sustain way on it own   as a result  i believ that  in order to keep expect from drift up and to bring inflat down  we will need to rais rate later this year  even if that mean a longer and slower recoveri   thank you  mr  chairman

extraordinarili low delinqu and default rate and thus is well within histor norm  so it has not great alarm our bank communiti   thus far  our district bank appar have larg escap the credit problem plagu the larger money center bank and invest bank   while there has been some tighten in credit condit and standard around the district  most non real estat relat firm i spoke with are not find it difficult to obtain credit for ani reason project they want to do  and so they have not identifi larg with the credit crunch scenario  despit the soft in the activ  firm in our district report higher price in their input and output   as presid   said  inflat seem to be aliv and well   the current price paid and price receiv index in our busi outlook survey acceler sharpli in januari and are at veri high level  almost record level  of the past twenti year   firm also expect price to rise over the next six month   these forward look price index  too  are at veri elev level relat to their twenti year histori   i am hear from busi contact and from one of my director  for exampl  that they are plan to implement price increas to pass along cost they are experienc   thus  even though they are pessimist about growth in the futur  they are not pessimist about price increas   this add to my skeptic about argument that link inflat too close with resourc util  the nation near term econom outlook is also deterior  as we have been hear  and i have revis down my growth forecast for      compar with my octob submiss   it is hard to find much posit news in the data releas sinc our last meet  and the board staff has summar that quit eloqu  and so i won   t repeat them   nevertheless  in general  my forecast is probabl slight less pessimist than the board   s forecast   howev  i must add that  at the same  e that growth has slow  inflat has trend up   both the core cpi and the januari                 of     core pce acceler in the second half of        compar with the first half   the core cpi advanc at a     percent rate in the second half of        compar with a     percent rate in the first half  and the core pce was up at a     percent rate in the second half compar with     in the first half  as we know  the pce price index get revis   recent research by dean croushor  one of our visit scholar  has shown that between      and      the averag revis from initi releas until the august releas the follow year was posit on averag for both the core pce and the total pce   this suggest that inflat is like to be even higher in the second half of       than the current es  indic   i am also concern that  over the past    year period  core and headlin inflat for both the pce and the cpi have diverg on averag about    basi point   headlin rate have exceed core rate in   of the last    year for the cpi and   out of the last    year for the pce   while i would like to believ that these two rate should be converg on averag  i am concern that core rate may not be as indic of under trend inflat as we might have thought   this line of think also lead me to question es  of ex post real fund rate calcul by the staff and present in the bluebook  which are base on subtract core pce from the nomin fund rate   i am not convinc that the core pce is the right measur of inflat in this context   even if you thought it was  then the report real rate are like to be overst for recent quarter given the appar systemat bias in the preliminari es  of the pce that i have note befor   moreov  some measur of inflat expect are not encourag   in particular  the michigan survey one year ahead measur and five year ahead measur are up   we have alreadi discuss a bit the acceler in some of the tip measur   i will return to that in a minut   the livingston survey januari                 of     particip have also rais their forecast for cpi inflat in      from     percent to   percent  my forecast overal is similar to the  book   s  and i expect a weak first half and a return toward trend growth later this year and into       and inflat at the     to   percent rang  but the polici assumpt that i make to achiev the forecast outcom for the intermedi term are differ from the  book   s   the ongo hous correct and poor credit market condit are a signific drag in the near term on the economi  and i expect growth in the first half of the year to be quit weak  probabl around   percent   as condit in the hous and financi market begin to stabil  i expect econom growth to improv in the second half of the year and move back toward trend  which i es  to be about    percent  about    basi point higher than the  book  i think  in       the slowdown in real activ suggest a lower equilibrium real rate   how much lower is difficult to measur with ani precis   ten year tip have fallen about     basi point sinc the begin of septemb   in such an environ  op  polici call for the fomc to allow the fund rate to fall as well   and we have  the fund rate is down     basi point sinc septemb   or more if we cut today   but we also must remain commit to deliv on our goal of price stabil in this environ of rise price   to my mind  that mean we must continu to communic that commit to the market and to act in a manner that is consist with that commit   i want to stress that while mani of us  myself includ  have argu that inflat expect remain well anchor  we cannot wait to act until we see contrari evid to such a claim becaus by then it will be too late and we will have alreadi lost some credibl   i also might add that the staff memo on inflat compens  which i thought was veri good  suggest that one reason for the increas in forward inflat januari                 of     compens might be a greater inflat risk premium rather than a rise in expect inflat  that may  in fact  be true  and i think the memo was veri well done   but if that is the case  if the rise is in the inflat risk premium  then i think it might be worth ask ourselv if the increas in inflat uncertainti might be an earli warn sign of our wane credibl  this perspect lead me to a differ polici assumpt from the  book   s   in particular  onc the real economi is stabil  the fomc must act aggress to take back the signific eas it has put in place in order to ensur that inflat is stabil in       employ is a lag indic  so we will like have to act befor employ growth return to trend  should output growth pick up in the second half of the year as forecast   thus  i expect we will need to begin rais rate by the fourth quarter of this year and perhap aggress so   in contrast  the  book assum a flat fund rate at   percent throughout the forecast period   despit the real fund rate remain below   percent   and well after the economi has return to trend growth   inflat expect remain anchor in the  book   in my view  this seem somewhat implaus or  at best  a veri riski bet   it appear that the  book achiev this result through an output gap   relat to the question i was ask earlier this afternoon   i think all of us understand the veri real concern that mani research have with our abil to accur es  the level of potenti gdp   furthermor  in the recent research on inflat dynam that we have discuss   and presid   was refer to this   inflat becom less persist and appear to be less relat to other macroeconom variabl as well   we do not know whether these chang are an outcom of a more aggress and credibl stanc of monetari polici against inflat or are due to some fundament chang in the world economi   if the lower persist is due to enhanc polici januari                 of     credibl  then it is incumb upon this committe to maintain that credibl   otherwis  we cannot expect inflat persist to remain low  thus  if the economi perform as forecast on the growth side  with a return toward trend growth in the second half  i would be veri uncomfort leav a real fund rate below   percent   the bluebook scenario involv risk manag indic that the inflat outcom is poor when there is a gradual revers of polici   better outcom are achiev under a prompt revers strategi   given that forecast  i believ we must begin think now about what our exit strategi from this insur we have put in place is go to be   how we communic our monetari polici strategi will also be crucial import becaus of the effect such communic will have on expect   we need to better understand in our own mind  i think  what our reaction function look like so that we can be more systemat and articul in our implement of polici   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   let me talk a bit about the region   the tenth district is general move forward at a fair steadi pace  but there are some mix data  the obvious wide varianc are in real estat   hous is weak   not as weak as some part of the countri but still weak   also  it is interest that commerci real estat in each of our major citi right now continu to do well   i recent talk with sever develop   they are all do well but are veri concern  and they are begin to cut back on their plan and move away from them   so you can see the worri carri forward in term of what action they are take   in the agricultur area and in the energi area  real estat is a differ stori   it is boom   land valu have gone up in the ag part   non irrig land  someth like    percent over the past year   if you are near an ethanol plant  it has gone up    to    percent   it is also interest that the ag credit system is help to fund that   their increas in lend was about    percent this past year   that is up from about   percent the year befor  so they are provid that   they are also now involv in lend to these ethanol plant in a veri signific way  help to carri that boom forward   that give me some paus in term of what is go on in some of the rural area   relat to that  the energi and leas valu are also acceler at a fair high rate   i found it reminisc and somewhat disturb in talk to a coupl of individu when they note that the land valu have about doubl over the past two or three year in some area  and they said that i should relax becaus on current ag price they should have tripl    laughter   where have i seen that befor  on the other side  actual  manufactur in our region has held steadi   we have a lot of aircraft manufactur  which is realli strong  and some other smaller manufactur provid support in both ag and energi  and they seem to be do well   technolog is also do well in the region  especi in the mountain area   the colorado and denver area   engin firm januari                 of     are still veri strong   the strong demand for engin and the unfil posit continu   they are suppli that servic across the globe and see continu demand there   so it is mix  but overal probabl our region is do better than averag relat to the rest of the nation  on the nation level  my project suggest that we are go to grow below our potenti growth rate   i am not as pessimist as the  book   i also have inflat come down  but that is on the assumpt that we are abl to revers our monetari polici at a fair quick pace as we move through this year and into        i will leav it there   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me talk about the econom outlook   my initi comment are organ kind of along the line of dave reifschneid   s exhibit     there are certain still some posit thing go on   growth in export  and i think that is like to continu  strength in the agricultur sector and in natur resourc in general  outsid of lumber and wood product  state and local construct spend   there seem to be a lot of school  hospit  sport stadium  et cetera  be built now  and the labor market may be a bit better than the decemb household and payrol survey depict  given the low level of initi claim  but i think those consider are realli overwhelm by sever factor on the negat side  and let me summar those quick   first is the breadth of the negat news on the nation economi that we have receiv recent   the vast bulk of the news has been negat   it  sn   t suggest to me that there is a lot of posit momentum or latent strength left in the economi   the second factor i would cite   and this is not new   is the persist of a larg volum of unsold  unoccupi hous  with implic for activ in that sector  for price  for wealth  and for foreclosur   of cours  as somebodi alreadi note  mani recess turn out to be inventori recess   if we have one  this will be an inventori recess  too  and januari                 of     the inventori in question is hous   third  mayb even more import  are the financi condit themselv   promin but not exclus  the impair capit posit of larg bank and like prospect for grow credit qualiti problem in auto loan  in credit card  in commerci real estat  and perhap in other area as well   ad up those consider  i think what we confront resembl the aftermath of the         recess  when so call headwind restrain growth in real gdp  and my forecast anticip someth similar go forward  someth like the persist weak scenario in the latest  book   so i expect subpar growth both this year and next year befor better growth resum in        i further expect lot of inertia in both core and overal measur of inflat this year and next befor some diminut below   percent in        thank you
thank you   presid
first  mr  chairman  i want to say a good word about presid pool   i have sat next to him sinc i got here   i would give him hyperbol prais if he hadn   t hand me the it oversight committe  otherwis  i think he is a wonder human be    laughter  much of what i was go to say has been said   i think presid    presid    and other have summar what i would have said about my own district   we continu to grow  but at a deceler pace  and our current forecast is for employ growth of   percent for our district for        that is relat healthi  and i realli am not go to take more  e on that subject  i am delight to hear all this anecdot evid   we were talk  governor   and i  about woodi allen earlier   if i rememb correct  he had a wonder quip   that he cheat on his metaphys exam by look into anoth boy   s soul    laughter   basic  what we are do at this  e of transit is almost cheat on the data by look at the januari                 of     anecdot evid   my broader ceo sound indic pretti much the same as what we are see in our district and what other have mention   ship  rail  express deliveri  manufactur  and other activ are much slower   retail sale are soft   as presid pool and other point out  trucker are suffer   receiv are be stretch out  delinqu are rise   i could bore you with specif compani by compani  as i am tempt to do  but i will not unless you wish me to   the point is that  while there are tale of woe  none of the    ceo to whom i talk  outsid of hous  see the economi trend into negat territori   they see slower growth   some of them see much slower growth   none of them at this junctur   the cover of newsweek notwithstand  a great contra indic  which by the way show    the road to recess    on the issu that is about to come out   see us go into recess  i will just give you two indic there   if you look at ma card and dig into their data  their decemb retail sale ex auto  ex gas  were up   percent and in januari to date were up   percent   presid pool mention up  and presid   has the incom ceo of up on his board   year over year to januari  they are up   percent   so it is anem   it is not negat   the expect is not to be negat   my ceo sound indic pretti much what we have forecast as a group   much slower growth  not necessarili a recess  where the differ come  mr  chairman  is on the inflat front   other have spoken eloqu about inflat   i just want to make a coupl of comment here   it is uncanni in the chart that we show in exhibit    for exampl  that we have food pce price and energi pce price peak almost as we speak   that may be true in the spot market   that is not the way it work in realiti   at t has         truck   southwest airlin has i don   t know how mani airplan   they contract and hedg out forward their energi cost  and the kick in of ani turndown   not occur immedi but rather is stretch out over a  e period   i would ask januari                 of     our staff  as we go forward  to tri to get a better feel for that   we are certain struggl with that in dalla   as far as food price are concern  which again i remind you are twice the weight of energi price in the headlin pce and the cpi  i heard some veri disturb news  frito lay  for exampl  which when we last met i report was go to increas price   percent  has inch them up anoth   percent  to   percent  and that is their plan for the year   this is the first  e in memori  accord to my contact  that groceri price are rise fa  than restaur food   yet it is not simpli food where we are see this kind of pressur  and i want to come back to the lag effect that occur   this morn the ceo of burlington northern told me that the so call rail adjust factor  which captur fuel  labor  suppli  and other cost from the previous quarter and is contractu input into contract for the come quarter  rose at the highest rate in histori      percent   that mean that even if you are ship lumber  even if you are ship whatev goe into hous  by contract   of cours  that can be negoti  i am sure   for the come quarter the price rise from the shipper  the railer  will be    percent   final  go back to food and other item bought by consum   when you drill down deep into wal mart  which has     million custom  and you talk about the specif of their sale  their expans is not come from unit sale  it is come from price inflat   a senior offici there tell me that they are budget a   to   percent increas for nonfood item for          to   percent for food item   it is the first  e in his fifteen year histori at the compani that they are go to use their price leadership strategi on the plus side of the inflat ledger   so i do worri about inflat expect  mr  chairman   i will summar with the statement that was in today   s new york  e by the ceo of tyson food  who said     becaus of the unanticip high corn and soybean meal cost  we have no choic but to rais price januari                 of     substanti      that is my major concern besid the addit weak we are see in the economi   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   my assess of the nation economi is that we are in the midst of a period of veri weak growth and that there is a signific chanc of a serious downturn   the three month averag of our chicago fed nation activ index in decemb was minus        histor  by my calcul  such a valu has been associ with a recess about    percent of the  e   now  in the board brief ye day and again today  i notic that thoma laubach   s es  is    percent base on the same data  and that is certain larg enough for concern  report from my busi contact seem broad consist with this slow but posit growth scenario   the most posit news i receiv was from firm whose intern busi were strong   as one would expect  the most dire report were from those in residenti construct and relat industri   while i was surpris to hear from the ceo of a nation specialti retail chain that it busi over the past    day was the worst he has seen in    year  much of his busi is in housewar and furnitur  but he indic that mani other segment of the retail sector were also struggl   i also spoke with the ceo of general motor  his outlook was a lot like what presid   was just mention from other ceo   they are look for slow econom growth overal  and they are concern about the risk of a serious downturn   that is not what they are plan on   the industri is clear face softer demand  but his expect for      as a whole is for onli a moder declin in light motor vehicl sale  down to a pace of about     million unit   gm   s current product plan are not premis on recess level sale  but they are prepar to cut product quick if they see the januari                 of     economi turn down   he also report that  while the perform of gmac   s auto loan current was okay  the credit qualiti of prospect buyer   peopl come into showroom   has declin and that lender have tighten underwrit standard for those loan   in addit  if auto loan becam more difficult to securit  it would be a big addit problem  appar  so far they are robust  though  turn to the forecast detail  my modal outlook for      is close to that in the  book   i expect that we will eke out posit growth in the first half of        this expect larg reflect the judgment that busi have not begun to ratchet down spend plan in the nonlinear fashion that character a recess   my assess also has been influenc by some posit develop that we have seen   the most notabl one in my mind are that ui claim have move down  that major bank are have some success rais capit from a varieti of sourc  and that the order data today were better   for the second half of       i see growth increas toward potenti by year end   this assess depend import on accommod monetari polici and expansionari fiscal polici   our cumul action follow this meet should provid notic s ulus to the economi by midyear  tax rebat should also help somewhat this year   in addit  the financi system should continu to sort through it difficulti  make further headway in price discoveri and repair capit posit   so in the absenc of further negat develop  growth should improv in the second half of this year   i then see real gdp rise at a pace a bit abov potenti in       although this seem like a plausibl project  it has the feel of thread the needl  which bring to mind nimbl  and governor kohn is our expert at nimbl  so i start think about how his nimbl finger will be critic for thread this needl   the downsid risk are larg  and the recess scenario are quit possibl   ani of the factor current januari                 of     hold back growth could intensifi   for exampl  a reduct in bank lend capac could make financi condit much more restrict   this  along with increas busi pessim and caution  could caus a more pronounc cutback in invest and hire   even a moder weaker job market would add to the factor alreadi weigh on consum spend  now  unfortun  even while we are deal with concern on the growth front  the inflat pictur is difficult and quit uncertain   the inflat outlook will like be affect by more crosscurr than usual   headlin inflat has been quit high  driven larg by increas high energi  food  and commod price   although our best assess is that these pressur will come off later this year  these influenc have last longer than typic and could well continu to do so   i had calcul the same type of statist that presid   calcul  but onli sinc        headlin pce inflat has been run about     percentag point higher than core pce sinc that  e   this is a sourc of some concern and caution us against reli too heavili on core inflat measur   i don   t think that is a big issu today  but we need to be think about that in our inflat strategi   in addit  core inflat has not improv as much as i expect   as the  book discuss  the declin dure the second quarter of last year may have reflect technic quirk in the index rather than true improv in under inflat as i had hope   the weaken u s  economi is like to diminish inflat pressur somewhat in       but it is unclear how big a factor this will be or  given our project that growth improv  how long it will last   so i think that inflat risk will be rise next year   consequ  recalibr of short term interest rate will be an import element of monetari polici in        look at the write up  it seem to me as though    out of    particip had that viewpoint   differ  e   our inflat project has core pce run     percent in      and edg off to   percent by        in the context of januari                 of     what   was talk about in term of slack  we have a higher inflat path and inflat come down with a bit of slack   much of the committe   s discuss today has suggest that   percent is slight higher than most particip    benchmark   for me  the trajectori of my outlook is satisfactori as long as i see inflat prospect continu to improv as we move beyond the end of our current forecast period   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   in my view  econom condit have deterior signific sinc our decemb meet   taken as a whole  the stori that have been relay to me by my fourth district busi contact have been downbeat  and sever of the contact are concern that we may be slip into a recess   i   m hear that consum spend has declin appreci sinc the soft decemb retail sale number were report   the cfo of one of the nation   s major depart store chain told me last week that her compani   s januari sale are shape up to be the worst that they have seen in the past twenti year   she said that they had alreadi cut back some of their buy plan becaus of the weak holiday sale  but after see the number for the first three week of januari  she is concern that they have not cut back buy plan enough   in decemb i had heard some upbeat assess about the demand for capit good and export  but in januari the incom number are softer  and expect for the come year are less op ist than they were just a month ago  i   m also concern that i   m now detect the first signal of a credit crunch   banker in my district tell me that they   re find it much more difficult to issu debt and that they are safeguard their capit   i   ve heard sever motiv for this  depend on the institut  some banker are simpli prepar for further loss   some are expect to have to bring some downgrad asset back onto their balanc sheet   even those banker who have adequ capit januari                 of     say that they have becom much more disciplin about how they   re go to alloc that capit  collect  the concern that banker have express to me about capit have convinc me that credit will be less avail and more expens than it has been in quit a while   deal that banker would have done for creditworthi borrow not long ago are simpli not be done today   of cours  it   s possibl that nonbank financi compani will step in and fill the gap  but it is not clear to me that they have the capit and the risk appetit to do so  these develop have had a signific influenc on the econom project that i submit for today   s meet   like mani around the tabl  i continu to mark down my outlook for residenti and nonresidenti invest in respons to the incom data and also in respons to greater busi pessim about the econom prospect   in addit  i   ve built in a sharper and more protract slow in consum spend stem from greater deterior in the household balanc sheet and tighter credit market condit   these adjust have caus me to cut my      gdp growth project about   percentag point sinc the decemb meet  and some of that weak spill over to the out year   if credit condit deterior further than i have expect  then my project would more close resembl the persist weak altern scenario describ in the  book   but that isn   t my project for the economi   rather  my project is rough in line with the  book baselin  my inflat outlook hasn   t chang much from where it was in decemb   or octob  for that matter   like the  book  i still project inflat to moder as commod price level off and busi activ wane  but the risk to my inflat outlook have shift to be weight to the upsid   the decemb cpi report was not much improv from the troubl novemb data  and my busi contact continu to report that commod price are be pass downstream  so i have less convict in the inflat moder than i did a month ago   that said  the januari                 of     downsid risk to the economi still domin my think about the outlook today   i do believ  howev  that our polici respons to date combin with an addit rate cut tomorrow will allow the economi to regain some momentum as we move into the second half of        thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   the contour of our forecast are broad in line with the  book   growth well below potenti for the first half of this year result in addit slack in labor market with a consequ reduct in the core rate of inflat over  e  our forecast return to full employ by      onli if we reduc interest rate more than they are in the  book   thus  our baselin forecast assum that we reduc rate    basi point at this meet follow by addit eas in       which eventu result in core inflat below   percent and the unemploy rate settl at our es  of the nairu  somewhat below   percent   but even with this eas  there are signific downsid risk to this forecast  histor  increas in unemploy in excess of     percent and forecast of two or more quarter of real gdp growth below   percent have almost alway been follow by a recess   in fact  a varieti of probit model look at the probabl of recess in      indic an uncomfort high probabl of recess  in most case abov    percent  sever factor make me concern that the outlook could be wors than our baselin forecast   first  we have consist underes  weak in residenti invest   while our forecast assum a gradual declin in real estat price  it   not have a substanti feedback between rise unemploy rate caus further downward pressur on real estat price and the health of financi institut   were we to reach a tip point of higher unemploy  higher home foreclosur  increas financi duress  and fall hous price  we would like have to januari                 of     eas far more than if we were to act preemptiv to insur against this risk   second  our weak consumpt is driven by negat wealth effect induc by weak in equiti market and modest declin in real estat price   howev  the heighten discuss of a potenti recess could easili result in a larger pullback by consum   this would be consist with the behavior of rate on credit default swap of major retail  which have risen signific sinc the middl of decemb   third  bank are see increas problem with credit card debt   capit one  one of the few concentr credit card lender  has had their credit default swap rate rise from less than     basi point to more than     basi point as investor have becom increas concern about the retail sector   while liquid concern have abat  credit risk for financi institut has grown   rate on credit default swap for our largest bank have been rise sinc decemb  despit the announc of addit equiti invest   in addit  the greatest concern i hear rais by the financi communiti in boston is a risk pose by the monolin guarantor   the movement in equiti price last week as a result of high specul statement on resolv the monolin problem indic a sensit of the market to signific further deterior in the financi posit of the monolin   fourth  our model   not captur potenti credit crunch problem  although supplementari empir analysi conduct by the boston staff suggest that such problem pose addit downsid risk to our outlook   bank balanc sheet continu to expand as bank act in their tradit role of provid liquid dure econom slowdown  while the balanc sheet constraint are like to be most acut at our largest institut  further deterior in real estat market is like to crimp smaller and midsiz bank that have signific real estat exposur  given my concern that we could soon be or may alreadi be in a recess  i believ the risk around our forecast of core inflat settl below   percent are well balanc   inflat rate januari                 of     have fallen in previous recess  and i expect that histor regular to be maintain if growth is as slow as i expect   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just start by say it   s not all dark    laughter
don   t worri  be happi
i   m go to end dark  but it   s not all dark   the world still seem like to be a sourc of strength   you know  we have the implaus kind of goldilock view of the world  which is it   s go to be a littl slower  take some of the edg off inflat risk  without be so slow that it   s go to amplifi downsid risk to growth in the unit state   that may be too op ist  but the world still is look pretti good   central bank in a lot of place are start to soften their link to the dollar so that they can get more freedom to direct monetari polici to respond to inflat pressur   that   s a good thing   u s  extern imbal are adjust at a pace well ahead of expect   that   s all good  i think   as mani peopl point out  the fact that we don   t have a lot of imbal outsid of hous come into this slowdown is help   there   s a littl sign of incipi op  on the product outlook or mayb a littl less pessim that we   re in a much slower structur product growth outlook than befor   the market is build an expect for hous price that is veri  veri steep   that could be a sourc of dark or strength  but some peopl are start to call the bottom ahead  and that   s the first  e   it has been a long  e sinc we   ve seen ani sens that mayb the turn is ahead   it seem unlik  but mayb they   re right  in the financi market  i think it is true that there is some sign that the process of repair is start   we have seen veri  veri substanti adjust by the major financi institut  veri  januari                 of     veri substanti de leverag ahead as the institut adjust to this much  much greater increas in macroeconom uncertainti and downsid risk  veri  veri substanti earli equiti rais by major firm  pretti substanti improv in market function  and eas of liquid pressur  those are use  encourag thing   there is a huge amount of uncertainti about the size and the locat of remain credit loss across the system   but base on what we know  i think it   s still true that the capit posit of the major u s  institut come into this look pretti good relat to how they did in the earli     s   of cours  as mani peopl have said mani  e  there   s a fair amount of money in the world will and abl to come in when investor see price at suffici distress level   one more encourag sign  of cours  is that the  e  content  and design of the s ulus packag look as though the packag will be a modest posit   it could have been a wors balanc of late and poor design  but i think it look to be abov expect on both  e and design  and it will help a littl on the downsid and take out some of the downsid risk  have said that  though  i think it is quit dark still out there     like everyon els  we have revis down our growth forecast   we expect veri littl growth  if ani  in the first half of the year befor polici start to bring growth back up to potenti   the main risk  as has been true sinc august  is the danger self reinforc cycl  in which tighter financi condit hurt confid and rais recess probabl  caus peopl to behav on the expect that recess probabl is higher  reinforc the financi headwind  et cetera   the domin challeng to polici is still to arrest that dynam and reduc the probabl of the veri advers outcom on the growth side   of cours  we have to do that without risk too much damag to our inflat credibl and too much damag to futur incent and futur resourc alloc  like mani of you  i think the inflat outlook for the reason laid out in the  book is better than it was   it   s not terrif  but it   s better   the risk are probabl balanc around the januari                 of     inflat outlook   our inflat forecast still has core pce come down below   percent over the forecast period   there   s obvious a lot of uncertainti around that  but i realli think that you can look at inflat expect in the market as somewhat reassur on the credibl front to date  so again  i think the key question for polici is how low we should get real short term rate relat to equilibrium  and our best judgment is that we   re go to have to get them lower even with anoth    basi point tomorrow   we   re still go to need to tri to reinforc the signal that we   re go to provid an adequ degre of accommod or insur against this veri danger risk of a self reinforc cycl in which financi weak headwind reinforc the risk of a much deeper and prolong declin in econom activ
thank you   thank you  vice chairman    for a littl less gloom here  i didn   t expect the bright side from that sourc    laughter   like everyon els around the tabl  i have revis down my forecast  which look veri much like the  book   a coupl of quarter of veri slow growth befor a pickup in the second half of the year spur by monetari and fiscal s ulus   the collaps of the hous market has been at the center of the slowdown  and most recent inform was weaker than expect   there is no sign in the data anyhow that a bottom out is in sight   sale of new home have drop substanti  and that must reflect reduc avail of credit  especi for nonprim and prime nonconform loan  and perhap buyer    expect of further price declin   as a consequ  a steep drop in hous construct has made onli a small dent in inventori  and those will continu to weigh on activ and price  inde  hous price declin in the case shiller index pick up late last year   i think we just got novemb  januari                 of     it look increas as though other sector are be affect as well  slow from the earlier pace of expans and slow a littl more than expect   you can see this in broad measur of activ  as presid  n point out   industri product  purchas manag survey  and the employ report   i think it is also evid in some measur of demand   retail sale data suggest a deceler in consum spend late in the fourth quarter   order and shipment for capit equip exclud aircraft pick up in decemb  but that follow a coupl of month of flat or declin data   a slowdown in consumpt and nonhous invest probabl reflect multipli acceler effect of the drop in hous  a declin in hous wealth  and addit caution by both busi and household given the high uncertain and possibl weaken econom outlook   certain the anecdot we   ve heard around the tabl reinforc the sens of busi caution  but like other peopl  i see the soften outlook and the spread beyond the hous sector as import a function of what   s go on in the financi sector and of the potenti interact of that over  e with spend   we have seen improv in short term fund market  in spread  and in the level out of the abcp  asset back commerci paper  outstand  but investor and lender seem increas concern about the broader econom weak and spread repay problem  and they are demand much greater compens for take risk in near everi sector   to me one of the defin characterist of the period sinc  say  mid novemb is the spread out from the hous sector of lend caution to other sector in the economi   nonfinanci corpor have experienc declin in equiti price   credit spread on both invest grade and junk bond have increas   a substanti portion of bank report tighten term and standard for c i loan   commerci real estat sector lender are veri concern about credit   spread on cmbs have risen substanti  and most bank   like januari                 of        percent   tighten up on commerci real estat credit  and that has to affect spend in that sector over  e   bank tell us that they are be more cautious about extend consum credit  as presid   note   a number of larg bank note a pullback in this area and deterior in actual and expect loan perform when they announc their earn over the past few week   there have also been increas doubt about how robust foreign economi will remain  and this was evid in equiti market around the globe and in rise risk spread on emerg market debt   the staff has mark down it forecast of foreign gdp growth again this round   the total decreas in project foreign growth in      sinc last august has been around    percentag point  and this is at a  e when we are count on export to support econom activ  the extraordinari volatil in market is  i think  indic of under uncertainti  and that under uncertainti itself will discourag risk take   the uncertainti and the caution are part feed off the continu declin in hous  the still unknown extent of the loss that will need to be absorb  and the extent to which those loss are erod the capit of key institut like the monolin   the monolin issu rais question about who will bear the loss and provid anoth channel for problem spread through the credit market  through loss be felt or credit be taken back on bank balanc sheet  make them more cautious  and even more direct  into the muni market through the monolin   despit these develop  my forecast for      was revis down onli a few tenth from octob   but that is becaus of the consider eas of monetari polici undertaken and assum in my forecast   i assum    at this meet  and unlik that piker  presid    i assum anoth    over the second quarter
i   ll see you and up you    laughter
this is a bad dynam
i thought we need some insur  and i also assum some fiscal s ulus as in the  book   i still see  despit these polici respons  risk around my outlook for activ as skew to the downsid  and it   s becaus of the potenti further increas in requir compens for risk and tighten standard for extend credit and the feedback on demand  although inflat has been run higher than expect of late  and that is troubl  i expect it to eas back even with my more accommod polici   the combin we   ve seen of slower incom growth and higher inflat suggest element of a suppli shock  and that   s obvious come from the energi sector and it spillov into food   it is true  as presid   point out  that some of those increas in food and energi price are come from demand from emerg market economi  but to the extent that such demand is put upward pressur on our price and it   s not realli suck export from the unit state at ani great rate  i think that it act more like a suppli shock on the u s  economi than a demand shock   energi and other commod price should level off in an environ of slower global growth  and they   ve start to do that  they have at least show sign of level off recent   greater slack in resourc util and product market should disciplin increas in cost and price   at least some of the report about airlin suggest that they have tri to pass through fuel surcharg and have been unabl to do so  and i think that   s an encourag sign from the inflat perspect   ani eas of inflat pressur   requir that inflat expect not begin to ratchet higher   i agre with everyon els   i   m persuad that the balanc of evid is that they have not  despit the rise in five year forward inflat compens and despit the persist higher rate of increas of total headlin than of core inflat   but this is someth we will need to monitor veri care   i interview paul volcker ye day afternoon for our oral histori project   the discuss with him remind januari                 of     me again of the high cost of revers a rise in inflat onc higher inflat expect becom entrench   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i will endeavor to stay out of the grow  creep pessim caucus    laughter   you can judg for yourselv whether i   ve been success do so   let me talk briefli about two economi that are in a tug of war  and rather than refer the hous and nonhous economi  let me tri to talk about it in the context of the economi of financi servic versus the real economi   on one level  of cours  financi servic are not so larg a share of gdp that they could threaten the macroeconomi   but the transmiss mechan between credit market and the real economi  whether it be through the credit channel or other channel  while imperfect understood  is have veri negat effect on the cost and avail of credit for real busi and household  with the risk there to the downsid  financi institut  as mani of you said  are open for busi  but i would say somewhat less so than when we met in decemb   as we approach the credit line renew season  that is happen amid a period of deplet credit avail and signific tighter lend standard   in addit  financi institut as a group are  in my view  undercapit  even with the recent capit infus   final  the dynam that i would be hope to see among financi institut is clear lack  and while i think  as presid pianalto referenc  that there are new market entrant like hedg fund that are pretti keen to provid mezzanin financ  it   s a pretti slow process to match provid and user of capit   so at least for the near term forecast  i wouldn   t expect that to come much to our rescu  if the u s  financi institut were an economi all to themselv  they would probabl alreadi be in a recess   while that  sn   t necessarili equat to a recess for the broader januari                 of     economi  it sure  sn   t help   the repair process that presid   referenc among financi institut strike me as veri fragil and quit incomplet   incom statement shortfal due to fall profit  poor visibl  weaker pipelin  and the need to reduc headcount veri meaning strike me in some way as a more urgent and troublesom issu for larg financi institut than their balanc sheet weak   on the balanc sheet front  howev  i   m also concern that more impair are to come for larg financi institut and more dilut is expect for current sharehold   although the window for foreign invest is open now  i wouldn   t expect that window to stay open throughout        so even though i   d say that incom statement concern should be more press for them  these balanc sheet issu are veri real   in some way these institut have been built  or i should say rebuilt  over the past six year to prepar themselv for a low volatil  high liquid world  and what they found is the exact opposit   they are at differ level of understand the new world  and it will take them quit some  e to rebuild their busi to be profit in it  roll capit call across financi institut are continu   mani are hope to play for  e  but i think there   s a risk that  e will run away from them as new event find their way into the front page   virtual no financi institut strike me as immun to these pressur  and while we see that new problem and new acronym are emerg daili  they strike me as have the same under problem affect differ asset class   region bank have begun to fund their balanc sheet success   certain a good sign   but i suspect that they are also in the earli stage of need to rais consider more capit  as governor kohn said  there is a hope and an expect that global institut would be a sourc of strength  at least in financi servic   again  in financi servic  my sens is that non u s  financi institut  especi those in the unit kingdom and europ  are in the midst of januari                 of     play catch up to their u s  counterpart   i expect the year end report process for them  which realli begin now but will be at full speed by mid februari through earli march  will find mani of the landesbank need to be recapit   i think we   re go to find that both larg and small institut are have a hard  e get through the bank report season in europ   equiti price in europ and cds spread are alreadi give us some indic of what   s on the horizon  it   s not just about subprim in europ  contrari to some of the indic we receiv   perhap even more than u s  institut  mani european financi institut have incorrect believ that high credit rate across asset class would in and of themselv serv as protect   the overreli on credit rate that we see in the unit state strike me as even more pronounc in europ   the shock caus by these financi institut could have a dramat impact on their economi  probabl more so than the effect of u s  financi institut here in the unit state  that obvious has a consequ in term of a further shock and also a consequ on the real side in term of u s  export  let me turn to the other side of that  that is  the real economi itself  exclud financi   i think mani of you refer to the labor market data  which strike me as mix   i   m perhap a touch more op ist that we   re go to see some improv at least in the short term there  but i can   t have the convict that i   d like   the real economi is do it best to resist these financi shock   we can see that fight play out around e s spend  around busi fix invest  and around cap ex more general   you have nonfinanci with strong corpor balanc sheet  excess cash  and high profit level that are debat in corpor board about the uncertainti pose by the macroeconomi   it   s hard to say which side is go to prevail in that battl   the backdrop  as mani of you mention  has weaken  with risk premium widen across the board   real pce for januari is not show much of a snapback from a weak decemb but also  i would say  januari                 of     not much more deterior from decemb level accord to the credit card compani that i spoke to   the bottom line on the real economi   the trend in the real economi may be a bit more posit come into the first quarter from the fourth quarter than the  book project  but i would say i am a littl less op ist that the fiscal s ulus packag is as like to be as construct as the  book would have us believ  the forecast  as a result  overal depend on the abil of nonfinanci corpor to hire and invest despit this macroeconom uncertainti   i have some confid that the fortun     will be will to continu to push along this path of moder growth  but small compani  particular those that are realli the sourc of job creation  may be more negat affect while the credit channel is impair  and this is happen at a critic  e   the  book base case or the    fa  recoveri    pace depend to a degre on improv in credit intermedi or at least not anoth shock  and it   s that other shock that worri me   if deterior among credit intermediari continu  the real economi will suffer   of cours  the correl is hard to pin down  final  on the inflat front  i share the concern express by sever of you that the persist of recent inflat inform come into this period is a caus for concern   i   m less sanguin than the  book that we   re go to see the power of that inflat fade in the event that the economi soften some   the backdrop of stubborn high commod price  despit lower global demand in recent week  and a lower exchang valu of the dollar are like to put pressur on the inflat front   the data  as we have all talk about  on core and total inflat are not promis  so i would consid that also to be an upsid risk   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   well  if that   s the op ist scenario  i think we had all better pray   but i think it   s a relat balanc scenario that accur reflect the risk that are there   the  book has done a veri good job of tri to thread the needl  and i think make a close call for contract but not actual call it seem to be veri reason   the kind of insur discuss in both the  book and the bluebook and that we   ve had preliminarili here make a lot of sens   our model have never been success at assess turn point  and that is true whether they are the typic linear model  nonlinear model  probit model  markov switch model  or other thing like that   we sort of know onc we   ve switch  but it   s hard to get that transit   as mani peopl have suggest  there are an aw lot of indic that would go into those kind of model that would flash for contract be like   i think that is correct  but that make it veri difficult for us to assess what will happen   so i think   as well reflect in the project   a lot of downsid risk is there  i do share some of the op  about improv that we   ve seen in the financi market  but i had that feel in octob and novemb  and it is hard for me to realli understand exact what drove the subsequ deterior   certain there were some issu around year end  but it seem that more issu than just the year end were drive the fair signific revers of improv that occur dure octob through mid novemb and the fair sudden back up   so i   m concern that  sinc i don   t realli understand what happen there  i don   t want to take too much comfort from what has happen so far   but i also don   t want to dismiss what has happen so far becaus it   s certain conceiv that thing will move in a more linear way forward for improv  one issu that i rais both at the last fomc and in our various confer call relat to some discuss i   ve had with the major credit card compani  which in some sens have a veri januari                 of     good feel for real  e consumpt   i   ve talk with two major credit card compani  and they both had veri negat view of what had happen in the veri sharp transit consist with a switch into a contractionari state from the discuss befor the octob fomc versus befor the decemb fomc   but in the most recent discuss  basic it flatten out   it   s certain not recov  but it is not a continu downward trend  which at least in my view provid a great deal of comfort becaus i was veri concern about the nonlinear break to a veri low consumpt state  and i think there   s less evid of that   i won   t go through the specif of what they said  but basic we   re still see challeng and increas in person bankruptci  slower repay rate  more peopl slip from    day overdu to    day overdu  et cetera  et cetera   but it   s not as dramat a chang  and it   s sort of within the rang that they have been anticip given the data from decemb   also as someon mention  and i have forgotten who  these number are still at relat low level   now  the chang is in a veri bad direct and certain could move veri quick  and we   ve seen that in other recess scenario   but fortun it seem  at least from this anecdot evid  that it isn   t a signific chang to the downsid  and it   s possibl that it could just be re flatten out   my concern is still that sort of    slow burn    scenario that i   ve talk about and that nelli and other have flesh out on the pressur on bank    balanc sheet   i like nelli   s veri polit correct phrase    unplan asset expans      that   s a veri nice way of put like    oh  my good  someth is sudden on the balanc sheet that we didn   t expect      siv  asset back commerci paper  and so forth   i think peopl are still wait for the other shoe to drop  and the other shoe certain could drop   there may be thing that we haven   t fulli anticip  but we know that there are still leverag loan that they can   t get off their book  a pipelin that   s still come on   we know that mani bank are still make mortgag loan and januari                 of     cannot get those off their book   at least the jumbo one   it   s conceiv that rais the limit at freddi mac and fanni mae may help in the short run even if there may be cost in the longer run  a number of other thing could sudden come on the balanc sheet   the exampl of what happen at socgen is just anoth uncertainti that could be out there   so even at a major financi institut that was general quit well respect  someth like this could happen   a lot of finger point and a lot of uncertainti can come from that  and that   s broad reflect in the cds spread   about the point that bill   made in convers with presid   about be care to say  well  cds spread are lower in europ and that suggest there   s less risk in europ   you have to take into account the reaction function by the govern  by the regul  in term of recapit  as governor   made refer to   there are veri real challeng  but overal we have seen these cds spread go up quit a bit   so i think that concern about the negat dynam scenario that peopl talk about is real  and that   s whi it is veri import to be think about buy insur  with respect to inflat  certain some of the number have been worrisom   it is clear that inflat uncertainti is up   we can disagre as to exact what that mean either about credibl or whether it is just uncertainti or whether it   s upsid or downsid scenario  but i think it is up and that is someth we should be concern about   we should care craft our messag to take that into account becaus uncertainti can lead to unanchor of inflat expect  and that is someth that we certain don   t want to see   i don   t see evid of unanchor yet  but i do see a potenti first step in that direct  which   concern me   the simpl fact that a memo had to be written about what was go on with respect to some of these sharp movement suggest that it   s not clear   although the memo was excel  i think there are element in it that suggest we don   t fulli understand and we need to be veri care about that   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we   re all tri to be cheeri here   it remind me a littl of one of my favorit scene in a movi  which is monti python   s    life with        i rememb the scene with them there all on the cross  and they start sing    look on the bright side of life       laughter   so let me talk a bit about my view on this   my person   do that  but it is realli that i   m strap a bit to the cross   my view on the economi is that we are go to have quit a weak first part of       in which we   re go to skirt recess   this is my modal forecast   i do think that the economi will be stronger in      and       but that   s becaus i decid to be even less of a piker than governor kohn   he accus presid    but i was go to accus him becaus i did actual assum a    basi point cut at this meet and then anoth    basi point cut at the meet follow   then i hope that afterward we would be abl to revers   of cours  this is someth to discuss tomorrow  but it has to do with my view on how you deal with financi disrupt and risk manag   so i   ll talk about that tomorrow  even though i have a scenario that look okay  i do want to point out that four veri signific downsid risk realli worri me   we all talk about them   of cours  the first is hous   but i worri about a particular dynam  which is that the negat price movement that we current see could be get wors   peopl could be expect that they   re get wors  and therefor  they want to hold off from buy a hous becaus the effect cost of capit is higher  as somebodi who stupid is just go to contract on a new hous becaus i have to pleas my wife  i actual thought exact along these line and was think about pull out but then decid that my marriag was more import
it was close    laughter
by the way  if you know my wife  no it wasn   t close   the second issu is that the potenti for weaker hous price  which realli is a signific possibl  not onli could lead to lower household wealth but  more import  also could reduc the valu of collater for household and as a result mean that the relax of credit constraint that collater afford is no longer there   that could have major implic in term of household spend  so it is also a veri substanti downsid risk to pce   the third issu is that we also see that the financi disrupt has alreadi gotten wors   the good news is that there has been improv on the liquid front  and i give a lot of credit to the taf  which was superbl thought out by our staff and has been quit help   howev  credit condit have worsen   particular worrisom   and someth that hasn   t been discuss much   is that the senior loan offic opinion survey had substanti tighten   usual when you see this kind of tighten  it could indic that we could have serious negat econom consequ   again  that actual make me veri nervous   final  to get even more depress  there realli is potenti for a negat feedback loop that has not yet set in  the financi disrupt that we   re see right now could then mean a more substanti worsen of the aggreg economi  and that could make the financi market have even more strain  and you have a problem   so i realli worri about the downsid risk and think that they are veri substanti and that we should be veri concern about them in think about what the appropri polici stanc is  on the issu of inflat  i   m more sanguin   i see inflat go down to   percent by        the key here is that i think that inflat expect are ground   in fact  are ground at a level that is consist with my inflat object  around   percent on pce  which might be differ from other    view  but that   s where i am right now   in that context  given that inflat expect plus expect about futur slack in the economi are the primari driver of inflat januari                 of     dynam  i actual think that inflat will come down   it is true that the recent inflat number have been veri bad  but in think about the overal risk  i   m a bit differ from the averag person on this committe becaus i think the risk are balanc and actual somewhat to the downsid   the reason i say this is that i think that inflat expect are ground   at the same  e  there is a substanti downsid risk in the economi that could realli widen slack in the economi  and that would mean that inflat would come down  i don   t want to be too sanguin on the issu of inflat expect be ground   in fact  one thing that i think we have to monitor veri close is what   s happen in term of inflat expect  particular financi market    view of inflat expect   in a sens  i think of that as the canari in the coal mine   we are also go to want to look at expect spread to profession forecast and to household  but i think inform would come in first in term of the financi market for the reason that they put their money on the tabl and react quick   that   s one reason i think it   s veri import to look at thing like inflat compens   but we do need to look at this and do the analysi   my read of the analysi that the staff gave and my think about the issu is that there is just no evid that inflat expect have gone up   the stori is extrem hard to tell to go in that direct   howev  it is veri easi to tell a stori that inflat uncertainti has gone up a lot  and this is someth that presid   talk about and we talk about at the veri begin of a long day   in this context  that   concern me  and it realli tell me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflat expect   so i think that this is someth that we have to be concern about  but i do not think that what has happen in inflat compens is that the canari is drop dead at this stage   but we do have to monitor this veri  veri close  and again  it   s part of the risk manag strategi that i think we have to pursu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  and thank you all for succinct and veri insight comment    laughter   i   m go to tri as usual to summar what i   ve heard  but even more so than usual  no warranti is express or impli   again  tri to bring togeth some of the comment  we note that incom data sinc the last meet have been broad weaker than expect  and anecdot general suggest slower growth  in some case signific slower growth   hous demand  construct  and price have continu to weaken  and inventori of unsold home are littl chang   hous weak has implic for employ  consum spend  and credit condit  with respect to household  consumpt growth has slow  reflect fall hous and equiti price and other factor  includ general greater pessim about the labor market and econom prospect   the labor market has soften by a rang of measur  with unemploy jump in decemb   howev  worker in some occup remain in short suppli   togeth with financi indic  weaker labor and consumpt data suggest that the economi is at a risk of recess  in ani case  it is like to grow slowli for the first half of the year   the second half of the year may be better  the result of easier monetari polici  fiscal s ulus  and possibl improv in hous and credit market   howev  there are signific downsid risk to growth  includ the possibl of an advers feedback loop between the economi and credit market  report by firm are mix   invest may have slow  reflect uncertainti and slower growth in demand   commerci real estat activ may be constrain by tighter credit condit  manufactur is slow to mix  though it  energi  and some other sector continu to be strong  financi market remain stress   credit condit more general appear to be worsen  and the problem may be spread beyond hous   addit risk are pose by the problem of the monolin insur   credit loss have induc tighter lend standard  and a key question is how januari                 of     sever those may becom and how persist they may be   one offset is the abil of bank to rais capit  core inflat and headlin inflat have remain stubborn high and are a concern   one risk is the abil of some firm to pass through higher input cost   inflat compens has risen at long horizon  reflect some combin of higher inflat expect and inflat risk premium   go forward  a slow economi  anchor inflat expect  and possibl stabil food and energi price should lead to more moder core and total inflat   howev  some see upsid risk  especi the possibl that higher headlin inflat might affect inflat expect   so that   s my attempt to summar   there   s a great deal more detail and a great deal more color in the convers around the tabl  let me tri to add a few point   again  much of what i   ll say has been said   i do think that there has been a signific deterior in the outlook for econom growth and an increas in the downsid risk to growth   it was suffici sever as to prompt me to call the januari   videoconfer that we had  and i think that sinc then we have had further deterior   a number of thing have happen and are go on   veri import  perhap most import  is the continu further deterior in the prospect for the hous market   hous  of cours  feed direct into the real economi through employ  incom  and wealth  and i think there are some indic that spillov from the hous sector to the rest of the economi is increas   howev  the critic aspect of the hous outlook is the relationship to the financi system  which i   ll come back to  consum spend has slow   i think there   s littl doubt about that at this point   there are a lot of factor now that are act as headwind in the consum sector   let me just point out the basic fact that most household in the unit state have veri littl in the way of liquid financi januari                 of     asset   therefor  when they  on the one hand  are deni access to home equiti if they see tighter credit condit on card  auto  and so on  and if at the same  e they see greater uncertainti in the economi and the labor market  then their natur tendenc would be to be much more conserv in their spend   i do note that fiscal action may be of some help  particular for peopl in that kind of situat   like presid    i think the indic of a weaken labor market are broader than just the payrol report   there are a number of other thing as well   we may get a better report this week   the ui claim are a littl encourag  but i do think that the weaken economi is go to drag down the labor market to some extent   certain the financi market have deterior  reflect greater concern about recess   we see it in the equiti market but also in short term interest rate and a varieti of credit measur as well   final  just go through this list of item  we continu to see problem   credit issu  bank concern about addit loss not just in mortgag but perhap in other area as well   with the potenti implic of a further tighten of credit condit  those are some of the develop that we   ve seen sinc the last meet   on our januari   call  i talk about the regim switch model and those way of think about the busi cycl   other have talk about that today   i think mani of those model would suggest that the probabl of recess at this point is quit high  at least    percent or more   i don   t think ani of us would be happi to see a garden varieti nber recess  but if we had that  there would probabl be a few benefit  includ correct of some imbal that we   re see in the economi and perhap some reduct at the edg in the inflat pictur   but  like other  i am most concern about what has been call the advers feedback loop   the interact between a slow economi and the credit market   a phrase you might have heard  which is get great currenc among banker  is    jingl mail      jingl mail is what happen when otherwis prime januari                 of     borrow decid that the valu of their hous is worth so much less than the princip of their mortgag that they just mail their key to the bank    i wonder if that     percent is the right loan to valu number   mayb it   s less than that    even if prime mortgag hold up   and i think in some region of the countri there will be signific problem with prime mortgag   there is a lot of other potenti troubl   we   re just begin to enter the period of maximum subprim arm reset   second lien piggyback and home equiti loan are all question at this point   we haven   t begun to address the option arm issu  which is about the same size as the subprim arm categori  and of cours  we have the issu with the monolin and privat mortgag insur  outsid of mortgag  expect for credit perform are worsen in a rang of area  includ commerci real estat and corpor credit   so i think that even under the relat benign scenario that the  book forese  we   re go to see a lot of pressur in the credit market and perhap a long period of balanc sheet repair  tight credit  and a drag on the economi  again  our experi with financi drag or headwind has been that it can be quit power and decept so  and i think that   s a signific concern  now  the central issu here  though  ul  come back to the hous market   certain by this point there must be some pent up demand for hous   we   ve had obvious veri low sale for a period   hous price are soft   mortgag rate are low   afford is better   what   s keep peopl from buy hous is the fact that other peopl aren   t buy hous   if there were some sens that a bottom was form in the market or in hous price  we probabl could actual see a pretti quick snap back  an increas in hous demand  and that in turn would feed back into the credit market  i think  in a veri benefici way   so there   s the possibl that  if the hous market can get restart  we could get a relat benign outcom
i hope so
howev  there appear to be a law of natur that the turnaround in the hous market is alway six month from the present date   we simpli don   t have ani evid whatsoev that the hous market is bottom out   we have guess and es  about how far price will fall and how far demand and construct will fall   the key issu is price  and we are far from see the worst case scenario that you could imagin in price   so long as we don   t see ani stabil in the hous market or stabil in hous price  then i don   t think we can say that the downsid risk to the economi or to the credit system have been contain   until that point  i think we need to be veri  veri alert to those risk  everyon has talk about inflat  as should be the case   i am also concern   the pickup in core inflat is disappoint   there are some mitig factor  such as the role of nonmarket price  which tend not to be serial correl   we haven   t discuss owner    equival rent in this meet for the first  e in a while  but we know that it can behav in rather odd way dure period of hous slowdown   the hope is that energi and food price will moder  in fact  if oil price do rise by less than the two third increas of last year  it would obvious be help  nomin wage don   t seem to be reflect high inflat expect at this point   so i think there are some reason for op   but as mani peopl point out  there are upward pressur  includ the point that presid   made that the lag effect of the previous increas in energi  food  and other commod price have probabl not been fulli realiz in core inflat  furthermor  as we   ll talk about more tomorrow  to the extent that we decid at this meet to take out some insur against downsid risk  then implicit in that insur premium might be a greater risk of inflat six month or a year from now   so we have to take that into account as we think about polici and about our communic  as presid   and other have point out  in particular  as governor   and other have note  we need to think about a polici strategi januari                  of     that will involv not onli provid adequ insur against what i consid to be serious downsid risk but also a polici strategi that involv remov the accommod in a  e way when those risk have moder suffici  so my read of the situat is that it   s except fluid and that the financi risk  in particular   as we saw  for exampl  after the octob meet   can be veri hard to predict   there are a lot of interact between the financi market and the real economi that are potenti destabil  and so we are go to have to be proactiv in tri to stabil the situat  recogn that we have a confluenc of circumst that is extraordinarili difficult and that no polici approach will deliv the op  outcom in the short term   we   re just go to have to tri to choos a path that will give us the best that we can get  given the circumst that we   re face  all right   ani further comment or question   we will reconven tomorrow at nine o   clock   there is a recept and dinner  option  avail in the martin build   thank you   meet recess  januari                  of     januari            morn session
good morn  everybodi   let   s begin our meet by call on dave   to report on the gdp data
thank you  mr  chairman   my dictionari defin a miracl as an event so improb that it appear to defi the law of natur   along those line  we distribut a gdp report that compar our forecast with the actual number that was publish this morn  and they are exceed close    laughter   as you can see compar the  book and advanc es  column  in fact  it wasn   t just close on the top line  but it was realli quit close in term of the various compon   person consumpt and busi fix invest were veri close to our es    residenti invest was not quit so weak in the advanc releas as it was in our forecast  that might reflect either a differ es  by the bea about cost per start or someth they know about addit and alter that we don   t  in the opposit direct  feder spend   in particular  defens spend   was weaker in the advanc es  than we have incorpor in the  book es   at the bottom of the tabl are the price index   both total pce and core pce were spot on with the forecast   realli  i didn   t see anyth in this report that would alter our outlook at all go forward   i would just note  obvious  that both the advanc es  and our  book es  are base on partial data   there is still a lot left to be learn about the fourth quarter  and even more about the first quarter go forward   one other piec of inform that becam avail this morn was the adp report for privat nonfarm payrol employ   that report show an increas of           look at that report and think about our forecast of         we   d probabl up our forecast to about        for the month  follow our normal rule of thumb in respond to that   quit frank  i don   t think that particular piec of inform would alter my view about the state of the labor market go forward  as we note ye day  we have seen a fair number of other indic suggest that there has been some soften in the labor market   i think that is probabl still the best bet go forward  so i don   t think at this point we would chang too much our employ forecast
thank you   are there ani question for dave   if not     would you like to talk now
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      your polici decis today take place against an unusu complic and uncertain backdrop  over recent month  reverber from the contract in the hous sector have    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix       the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     januari                  of     spread to the subprim mortgag market  to financi market and institut more general  and now evid to the broader economi   it seem clear  base on the senior loan offic opinion survey and numer other sourc of inform  that these factor are interact  with mortgag relat writedown and concern about the econom outlook trigger a broad and substanti tighten of credit to busi and household and the tighten of credit feed back onto the hous market and the economi   at the same  e  recent inflat perform has been disappoint  the near term polici tradeoff appear to have deterior somewhat  and inflat compens has risen   meanwhil  investor have been rather skittish and  in the environ of heighten uncertainti  have sought more clariti in your communic and more assur about polici prospect than you can reason provid   the combin of all these factor has left financi market price unusu volatil   in these circumst  the committe face a difficult task in reach judgment as to the outlook and the balanc of risk  gaug the appropri polici cours  and communic your view to the public   to provid some assist in your polici deliber today  a box in the bluebook explor the possibl implic of address pronounc downsid risk to growth through monetari polici  and the chart from that box are replic in exhibit     the panel in the left hand column consid the possibl benefit of risk manag under the assumpt that a recess   develop   the recess consid in this exercis is the same as that examin in an altern scenario in part   of the  book   as you may recal  that scenario was calibr to match the typic degre of weak relat to fundament in expenditur other than those for hous in six past recess   the dot line show the result  as gaug use the frb us model  if the committe were to respond to emerg evid of an unfold recess by adjust polici in a manner similar to it past behavior  as captur by the staff   s es  outcom base polici rule   in this case  the committe lower the feder fund rate gradual to about   percent by mid       the unemploy rate peak at about     percent  and inflat eventu fall below     percent   the blue line show the result that would be predict if  instead  the committe respond more aggress   here we have arbitrarili assum that the committe lower the feder fund rate to     percent this quarter and hold the rate at that level through the second quarter   from that point forward  it follow the outcom base rule   if the recessionari condit do eventu  the  e polici s ulus moder the downturn in activ  trim about   percentag point off the peak unemploy rate  and help keep inflat from fall toward a region that some of you might find uncomfort low   although aggress polici eas would help mitig econom weak  it would also rais the risk that polici could add unduli to inflat pressur should recessionari weak not develop  a possibl explor in the right hand column  the simul under this column are carri out under the baselin  book scenario   as shown by the blue line  the cost of an aggress near term eas in the absenc of a recess could be limit if policymak were to recogn quick that the economi was not weaken to the degre fear and boost the feder januari                  of     fund rate rapid   in this simul  the committe increas the fund rate about     percentag point in six month   that is  at a pace of more than    basi point per meet   to around   percent   this prompt revers bring the fund rate   percentag point abov the baselin  provid an offset to the earlier period of excess easi polici   in this case  core inflat would run slight higher than baselin for a coupl of quarter   as shown in the bottom right hand panel by the distanc between the solid blue line and the dot black line   but would subsequ return to baselin   in contrast  as shown in the dash red line  if policymak were slow to recogn that no recess was in train and so revers polici more gradual after the first two quarter   that is  in line with your histor behavior   consider momentum could be impart to econom activ  with the unemploy rate  the middl panel  run rough   percentag point below baselin into        the cost of respond more aggress to the risk of a recess in this case could be inflat that remain     or     percentag point abov the baselin path for sever year  the bottom right hand panel   concern about such an outcom could give you some paus as you consid how much insur you wish to seek at this and come meet   your concern in this regard may also be exacerb by the fact that the inflat pictur seem to have deterior somewhat in recent month   your current project reflect some worsen of the inflat   output tradeoff  with more slack appar requir over the next three year to push inflat down toward what would appear to be your prefer outcom   also  as was discuss ye day  five year forward inflat compens increas notabl over the intermeet period  while there are reason to question whether much of that rise repres an increas in inflat expect  it might be due in part to a higher inflat risk premium  perhap signal that inflat expect are becom more loos moor and are henc more prone to drift in respons to various shock   if you were particular concern about a possibl unmoor of inflat expect  you might be inclin toward altern d  shown in the right hand column of tabl    which is includ as the next page   under this altern  you would hold the stanc of monetari polici steadi at this meet but would indic that the risk to growth remain tilt to the downsid   howev  base on the interest rate assumpt provid with your forecast submiss  the recommend of most reserv bank to reduc the discount rate by    basi point  and your comment ye day  it appear that most if not all of you see some eas today as appropri   consequ  i will dispens with a detail discuss of altern d  rather  the question for today   s meet would seem to be not whether to reduc rate but how much and what to say about the outlook for growth  inflat  and polici   under altern c  the committe would reduc rate    basi point today  the rational section of the statement would note that financi market remain under stress  cite the tighten of credit avail  and mention the deepen of the hous contract and the soften of labor market   with regard to inflat  the januari                  of     committe would note it expect that inflat should moder  but it would also cite a rang of factor that could put upward pressur on inflat   the statement would conclud by indic that the polici action  combin with action taken earlier  should help promot moder growth over  e  but it would also warn that downsid risk to growth remain   the committe might see altern c as appropri if it believ that some further eas of polici is warrant by the deterior in the econom outlook and the associ risk but feel that a moder move is prefer today  given the polici step you have taken to date  the possibl that the fiscal s ulus could still turn out to be larger than current envisag  and question about how firm inflat expect are anchor  market particip current put consider greater odd on a    basi point move today than on a    basi point action   moreov  market particip report expect you to issu a statement similar to the januari    announc  but the addit of the sentenc on inflat risk in the third paragraph would like suggest to investor that you have signific concern about inflat   the combin of a smaller than expect polici move and the statement draft for altern c would like suggest to investor that monetari polici had shift into an increment mode  shorter term interest rate would like rise somewhat  and equiti price could declin notic   should the committe see an outcom along the line of the  book forecast as most like  it might be attract to the    basi point eas of altern b  under altern b  the committe would issu an announc that close resembl the januari    statement   howev  the fourth paragraph would includ a sentenc indic that the polici action to date should help to promot moder growth over  e and to mitig downsid risk to growth   in the second sentenc of that paragraph  the word    appreci     use in the januari    statement  would be drop from the character of the risk  presum in recognit of the signific further adjust of polici under this altern   as discuss ye day  the  book consist measur of r  has declin more than    percentag point sinc the decemb meet  to about   percentag point   a    basi point move today would leav the real feder fund rate just below   percent  gaug on the same basi as our r  measur   thus  by the r  metric  polici would remain slight restrict under altern b  consist with appli modest downward pressur to inflat go forward   policymak might view such a polici stanc as appropri if they saw the downsid risk to growth as rough balanc by the upsid risk to inflat follow such a polici action   howev  given the view express in your econom project   in particular  the assess express by mani that the trajectori for the fund rate would probabl need to be a littl lower in the near term than assum in the  book   it seem more like that you would prefer the approach of altern b if you believ that further eas will like be warrant but should be implement somewhat gradual  perhap to provid  e to assess the effect of the polici eas alreadi put in place   with investor place greatest weight on a polici choic at this meet along the line of altern b  this approach would like prompt relat littl januari                  of     reaction in financi market this afternoon   given recent develop  the committe may place a larger premium than usual on avoid polici surpris   if you have lower your econom outlook even more sharpli than the staff or if you see the downsid risk as particular larg  you might not see moder as a virtu and prefer to eas polici aggress by    basi point at this meet  as in altern a   this approach would seem consist with the concern and polici assumpt express by mani of you in your forecast narrat   inde  some of you have espous a risk manag approach to polici in which the feder fund rate is lower sharpli in the near term to provid greater assur of continu econom expans and then that polici eas is revers quick onc it becom clear that risk are diminish   as suggest by the risk manag simul that i discuss earlier  this approach reli heavili on your abil to recogn prompt that the s ulus is not need and to revers field rapid   binari option on target fed fund futur suggest that  over the past few day  market particip have essenti price out the possibl that you will take such aggress action today   thus  money market rate would like declin sharpli in respons to implement of this altern  downward pressur on the foreign exchang valu of the dollar could increas  and equiti price could rise somewhat  although ani ralli could be damp by a sens among investor that you were motiv to take this action by concern about pronounc econom weak   obvious  a signific concern with a step of this magnitud today would be the possibl implic for inflat expect and inflat uncertainti   although the relat contribut of various factor to the recent increas in inflat compens can be debat  last week   s polici move seem to be well understood at the  e as a respons to incom evid of a sharpli deterior econom outlook   by contrast  the motiv for a larger than expect move today might be less clear to market particip  potenti elev the risk of loosen the inflat expect anchor   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   are there question for     governor
i would like to ask a question and possibl make a comment about the risk manag strategi   am i correct in understand that the treatment of expect is basic backward look
that is correct  governor
so even though you know i am a fan of   well  let   s put it this way  you said moder  and i am not a fan of moder in mani dimens   but there is a potenti januari                  of     cost here that is not articul  which is that if there is a veri aggress eas and it has an effect on inflat expect  then the more benign scenario that we have in term of cost may not be there   this is one of the reason that  if we think about a risk manag approach  we have to think about whether we can do it more systemat   what kind of communic would be attach to it   also  what kind of inform would we have to watch out for to make sure that we don   t unhing inflat expect   so although i think this is a terrif box and it was veri  veri use  there is a bit of a qualm here   it is also veri hard to model the issu of what would happen to expect   so i am not complain in ani way about the use of this  but we should have anoth concern  which is how we would manag inflat expect if we pursu an approach like this   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my question is relat to what governor   just ask about   the risk manag analysi was veri help  it was a veri good addit  and it captur a number of thing that we have talk about   one is sort of a quick polici revers or the potenti for that if thing go well   my question is  how do you see the path of communic like to evolv   what is it go to look like   what will it sound like if we are think about revers polici  and we get to the bottom  and then we start take it back a littl more quick than normal   a lot of  e when we have done this befor you heard the phrase that market need to be prepar for this and they have to understand it   would that somehow get in the way of the s ulus   i think this get a bit at what governor   was talk about in term of expect   in particular  do you have ani thought about how the slope of the yield curv might help inform how peopl are go to be think about this   are we go to move from someth that is potenti invert or flat to a rise yield curv that januari                  of     could inform a better outlook  and then rais rate could mayb in a parallel fashion move the yield curv up   i am just curious whether that could be help for the communic strategi
i think my respons is that it is veri difficult to say how your communic should or will evolv go forward at this point becaus of the veri substanti uncertainti in the econom outlook  which show up veri clear in the committe particip    econom forecast   presum  what you say will depend on evolv circumst   in term of the yield curv  again  i think that is difficult   that will depend on the interact of market particip    percept of incom econom inform with their sens of your own polici reaction
i   m just curious if  in the path of this simul  the yield curv behav in that fashion or not   this get at what the mechan is for the s ulus   is it to improv market liquid  market function  long rate  or an expect of short rate   if they start expect a tighten  is that go to get in the way of someth  and so we are go to view that as more difficult to move at that  e   i think everybodi is quit commit to the idea that we need to do the right type of polici revers when it is call for  but it is go to be veri difficult to identifi in the moment   so the yield curv could help
in these simul  the standard channel of monetari polici are work through thing like the yield curv  asset price  the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  household wealth  et cetera
thank you  mr  chairman      i want to compliment you and the staff for present these risk manag strategi   i think it is realli use for the januari                  of     committe to see and think about these in term of strategi rather than sort of one off polici choic  and think through a sequenc of action like this is veri  veri help   governor   ask about expect and note that they were backward look  and i want to ask about that   you guy have describ to us befor that there are firm and wage setter and then there are financi market   is there a forward look part in the financi market  or is that backward look as well
the financi market are forward look in these simul
as you know  in appli macroeconom  there is a rang of approach to handl expect  and the rest of the rang is fill out with more forward look approach   in this instanc   in the instanc of a recess   you hear and read a lot about recess   in fact  there was a stori in the paper today about busi prepar for a recess   so you get the sens that market particip might be understand that this is a special episod of econom dynam call a recess and look back to past recess and think of it in sort of a forward look way   that to me  more than in the usual circumst  heighten the valu of think through or at least explor the implic of a forward look approach to expect   i say that in particular think about these strategi becaus we get onli a few trial on recess   they are pretti rare  and so the infer a set of market particip are go to make about recess is go to be influenc by their past recess  this is go to be the last chanc to influenc their percept about how we behav in the next recess   so i am realli interest in think through our strategi for this recess from the point of view of  well  what if from now on market particip expect us to adopt the strategi that we do adopt in this   that is whi i would like to see some analysi that say     well  all right  if this is the strategi and it is understood by agent that this is our strategi  how   the januari                  of     economi behav      so we adopt a strategi  and it is one that we think we can sustain and one that we would like to choos again in the futur if it is understood  relat to that  governor   mention inflat and inflat expect  and i was a littl confus about the discuss ye day becaus i alway thought of us as want to minim the distort in the rate of return on money  and that suggest minim the raw return gap between nomin and real secur   so i am not quit sure that we don   t care near as much about the varianc in inflat or the risk premium due to inflat as we do about expect inflat   is that your understand when you guy think through op  monetari polici   i know you do scenario like that   i mean  how do the fluctuat and the varianc in inflat fit in
i don   t think they fit in in a direct way   we still have a lot of work ahead of us  despit the progress that we have made in model in recent year  to consid thing like the distribut of differ econom outcom and how skew in those distribut  both with respect to output and with respect to inflat  would interact with risk avers in monetari policymak   i don   t think our scienc has quit gotten to that stage yet  but i agre that these are worthwhil thing to studi further
one thought i had in that discuss about expect inflat  you note that the one to five year rise in inflat hadn   t been affect much  but the five to ten year rise had   if it is well understood by agent when go through someth like a recess  which come around onli everi onc in a while  mayb it is ratifi current inflat and not bring it down   you might expect that the infer would chang about how inflat behav in the next recess  which would come five to ten year from now   wouldn   t it
i see the point you are make  and that sound plausibl   you know  again  our thought was that  if investor were concern that monetari polici maker were make an inflationari mistak  it would begin to affect inflat in the near term  mean within sever year rather than seven or eight year ahead
i have just a technic question on inflat expect  you present to us at some point a variat of the model in which the polici action itself was fed into the model for inflat expect   is that part of the model at this point
no   it is not part of the baselin model that we are run off of
that is oper here veri much   it is the same mechan  but it work differ in the two case  becaus in the case where the recess actual show up  whether you take the gradualist approach or you take the risk manag approach  they see the recess  and the eas in monetari polici  sn   t surpris them veri much  although we can take our risk manag approach and respond a bit more than usual   but then  thing behav as they expect  and so not too much happen to inflat expect   in the other case  in which recess  sn   t emerg  they say     oh  this was an eas that wasn   t expect     and then it becom critic how long you hold it   if you hold it and you get rid of it onli gradual  then inflat expect start to shift up   they think the fed   s inflat goal has chang   in the case where you take it away quick  they say     okay  you took it away quick     and so not much happen to long run inflat expect
so the answer is that the fund rate is affect inflat expect in these simul
in both case   but the question is whether it is view in the context of what is happen to output and inflat  whether they say     yes  that fit with the januari                  of     histor pattern of stabil     or whether  becaus the recess didn   t emerg  this look as though it was after the fact an eas in polici that was not warrant   then the question is  do you take it away quick  or do you take it away slowli
okay   so in the case where we are do the risk manag approach  do they understand that we are more like to revers cours  or do they just mark down their whole expect path for polici
no  they don   t know that you are more like to revers cours in that case   so when you think of a communic strategi  which is not in these simul  it say     oh  we   re go to do this  but in the event that the recess  sn   t occur  we will take it away more quick than we might have base on histor averag      but it  sn   t make too much differ in the simul  becaus it is taken quick   just becaus the fund rate is down surpris low for a quarter or two  that is not long enough to have much of an effect on long run inflat expect in that simul   what it would do in the real world is differ
we are tri to model the real world
there is a    castl in the sand    qualiti in this discuss   let me make just three point on what i took from this and see if i got it right   one is  in the staff   s judgment  at   percent   in that view of the world  which is not way off from where the discuss was ye day   polici is not provid ani degre of insur or accommod against the advers outcom that may be ahead  the second thing i took away is that this framework seem like a good way of think about how you think about move lower  how you think about what mistak we   re go to make or we want to make   we are go to make a mistak  but it is good to think about what januari                  of     mistak is more cost and what mistak is easier to correct   it seem to me it tell us almost noth  frank  about when we are go to be in a posit where we are go to want to start to take it back   it also probabl tell us veri littl about how quick we are go to want to take it back   i would have thought that the most remark thing in these path is how littl differ the varianc is in the outcom a year out   i mean  they must be so far within the rang of uncertainti in this context  and for us to start think now about how to design the op  exit and communic it  not just for presid     s reason but mani other  just basic humil  it seem to me kind of prematur   i have a lot of sympathi for the fact that we will want to make sure that we are choos which error we are go to make   i have a lot of sympathi for think through how we correct for that error   but for us to assert  becaus we are worri about the implic of that  that we are go to start focus now on the design of the exit  sound to me a bit like a statement of the obvious   of cours we are go to move with alacr to take back and make sure those inflat expect stay anchor at a reason level   of cours we are   to suggest otherwis and to assert it would look kind of insecur   a lack of confid in what we are here to do  the third thing i took away from it is that it seem to say that  if you make polici in a way consist with the respons of this committe over the past decad and a half or so  you have pretti good outcom in the strategi in which you take out enough risk against the downsid error   now  life could be uncertain   mayb that is too charit to the past  but it seem to be kind of reassur in that way
i think that it is hard to general   you say there are so few recess  so the specif communic that is undertaken   for exampl  in the last episod there was actual communic that lean against the rapid revers   you know  januari                  of        consider period    and so on   so rather than tri to general from two exampl  i think it would much more have to do with how we present the outlook and communic our intent   other question for     governor
yes   i just want to make a comment about what presid   said and follow up on presid     s question   one thing that the simul  sn   t get at is the advers feedback loop   it   s just not built into the model   so the benefit of pursu a risk manag approach are not as clear as they would be if they were includ in the simul  howev  i would like to focus on presid     s issu becaus i think it realli is critic   he ask about how we might know whether or not we should revers and talk about thing like the yield curv   but one thing that is import to recogn in this scenario is that i think it is veri unusu in term of this committe   s past behavior   but i don   t know   don  you are my man who is the ancient marin here   have we ever revers this quick in past episod
by    this quick     what do you mean
what the path of the prompt revers is
i think it depend   as the chairman was say  there hasn   t realli been a typic recess   right   we have had two recess in the past twenti year  and i think in both case we stay down longer becaus of the circumst   so in          we had a zero real fund rate while the economi was grow for two year   then when we start rais  we did rais veri quick   so i think that was mix   i can rememb present to the board  as a staff member  chart in      show how interest rate alway revers with the trough of the recess  a coupl of month this way  a coupl of month that way   and that was just wrong   i mean  it was just a differ circumst becaus of the    mile an hour headwind   so it is go to be veri hard to set expect about what we are go to do that will influenc peopl januari                  of     in the futur becaus each episod is so differ   as the chairman was say  we were veri worri in         that peopl would general from      and see us revers rather quick  so we got into this verbal gymnast to tri to modifi their expect becaus we thought the rapid revers in that case would not be consist with macroeconom stabil   this is a case in which we are just go to have to judg when we get to the circumst what is necessari without know ahead of  e what the pattern is go to be
so let me turn back to presid     s question becaus there is an issu about what kind of inform might tell us that we took out insur and then it wasn   t need   i think some piec of inform that the staff has been look at are relev  particular import in this regard is that there are a lot of indic of financi stress   what is differ about this episod is that the reason we are so worri about downsid risk is the financi strain  and there are a lot of piec of inform that the staff has been produc that could be veri import in term of look at this   they have a financi   i don   t know what you call your indic  but you have someth that you have been use in your model  dave  that take up spread and volatil and
princip compon of these thing
there are a lot of financi variabl
also an issu that the chairman rais ye day was that the hous market is a big compon of our downsid risk   the market   s concern about futur declin in hous price are caus a veri sharp decreas in demand for hous   that could turn around veri quick as well   even now we should be think about these issu  and governor kohn   s use of the word    nimbl      i like    flexibl     but i think    nimbl    is probabl a better word   is januari                  of     realli i think key here   it is somewhat of a departur from normal   exact what the chairman said   this episod is differ from past episod   so we do need to start think about this  and the staff will need to think about exact these issu
presid pool  you had an interject
yes   i am older than governor kohn  so i can answer    laughter
it is not age   it is how long you have been in the system
was just about like that
like that prompt revers
oh  interest
it was veri much a sharp v
i just want to point out that the reason i ask the question about how you think about the exit strategi is that  sinc we are put a lot of discuss weight on the revers  it is go to color how you think about the next move potenti  if not today then anoth day   so i think it bring the futur into the present veri quick
if i could just continu the dialogu with governor kohn   it has been observ by some that the past two recess differ from previous post war recess in some key dimens  and some have drawn the conclus that it is the chang natur of the busi cycl after the great moder   both have been character as shallow and longer last   i take the point that one   s infer about a third instanc are go to be veri tenuous  natur   but it is also natur to look back to those episod and see what we can draw out of januari                  of     them   you mention headwind in       and we had some special stuff that kept us from rais rate with nimbl in      and        to what extent do you think that is like come out of this episod  that the type of thing that kept us from rais rate in the     s and in both of these episod are like to recur
may i answer that
well  i ask governor kohn  but if he get to respond
i will follow don
i think we are realli get into the polici discuss right now  and the issu  realli  will be the headwind  the financi market restraint   so it is reason to think that we are face at least    mile an hour headwind   i also think that it is go to take a while for the headwind to abat   it is go to take a while to rechannel these credit flow  to restart mani of the secondari market in mortgag   so my person view is that i wouldn   t be surpris to see us have to run with a real feder fund rate that is below the histor averag for some  e   but as everyon has been say  it is high uncertain and veri depend on how the financi market evolv and how the real economi respond to those market
for follow up befor presid   respond  to the extent that we place greater likelihood on that  should these simul suggest that we should take that into account in how rapid we cut now
i don   t think so   i would just point out that with the         episod  inflat after the recess   after the whole episod was over   was signific lower than in the period befor it   so if there are headwind that are bring the economi below potenti and are caus high unemploy  for exampl  there has to be a mechan   expect have to be tie to someth  and there has to be some way in which januari                  of     excess low interest rate are s ul inflat  through either commod price or wage pressur or some other mechan   if those pressur aren   t there becaus of headwind or some other factor  then unusu low interest rate will not by themselv creat inflat   vice chairman  did you have anyth els you want to add
i realli couldn   t tell  presid    what infer you were go to draw from that   but i would just reinforc the point that  if you are more worri and uncertain now about the magnitud of the headwind and the durat  i think it has to mean that you err on the side of go lower sooner   but the main point is that we just don   t know much about it  and i think it is worth a lot of humil   i mean  think how surpris we have been by so much over this period  even with all our think through three year ago about altern path for hous   so i would just vote for humil   but the basic point is that we have to err on the side of be worri about reduc the risk that you end up with    mile an hour headwind rather than    for a long period of  e
could we start our polici round   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   like the  book  my project for the real economi incorpor a sharp declin in the equilibrium real fed fund rate   given the larg risk face the real economi  i think we need to take precaut against have a restrict fed fund rate target   i think a    basi point cut in the target fed fund rate today may be larg enough to elimin that possibl  although there is plenti of uncertainti around that es   as we have been discuss   base on my analysi  comment from my busi contact  and what i have heard from all of you at this meet  i feel veri comfort support this posit today   the econom environ has been volatil and high uncertain  and i realiz that my outlook could chang appreci in the week and month ahead   i can imagin that my januari                  of     econom project will evolv in a way that support even further reduct in the fed fund rate target  at the same  e  as i said ye day  i am concern about inflat risk and that they may now be elev   i can also imagin scenario that would lead me to want to pursu a more restrict polici than would be appropri base on the downsid risk to growth alon   at some point  on the margin  inflat concern could becom my domin concern   we know that inflat expect play a crucial role in determin the inflat outlook   we have been talk about that   but  unfortun  we don   t realli know all that much about what it is go to take to unanchor inflat expect   it is hard to know for certain how far out on the ice we can skate without need to worri that the ice has becom too thin   i know that we are bring our best think to bear on this issu by develop diagnost tool such as the decomposit of inflat compens into it compon part  as we talk about ye day and this morn   i hope that we are go to come to learn that these tool are use guid to polici  but we just don   t have enough experi with them to know how much confid to place in their es   ye day governor kohn told us about his convers with paul volcker and that paul volcker told him that unfortun we do have experi of see the eros of public confid in our abil to meet our price stabil object  and we know from this experi that it make the attain of price stabil more cost   but today i support the polici direct express in altern b   my concern today are more with the downsid risk to econom growth   given what i know today  i think it is the right cours of action   i have discov dure the past coupl of week that i can be veri nimbl when it come to the januari                  of     reduct in our fed fund rate target   if inflat develop requir  i want to be just as nimbl in the other direct   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   given the discuss i have heard so far  it is appar to me that we will most like move to a   percent fed fund rate today   if we do so  i think we should be prepar to stop at this point and let the market work through the disturb that onli  e and market adjust will correct   while i would not pre commit to no further cut  i would give no hint of them either   i think that is import   the discuss we just had around this tabl is that we cannot know the futur  there are alway headwind  and we will make a mistak   therefor  we should limit ourselv to some extent   as i have express in this committe befor  i think we should narrow the rang to which we are will to move the fed fund rate   my judgment is that to move to level outsid the reason rang that  yes  i know would be debat  but a reason rang of neutral  is as like to introduc disturb into the economi as it is to moder the economi   s perform  i find an approach to polici that focus on the real equilibrium rate compel   i think it is good theori  and it is common sens and can be explain to the public   i understand that we cannot observ the equilibrium rate  but we cannot observ the nairu  potenti gdp  or most other criteria   the real rate is at least relat to the polici tool that we focus on  which is interest rate   when you systemat move below or abov the neutral rate  you systemat s ul or restrict the economi   with that in mind  and sinc monetari polici work with a lag  i would recommend that we follow a polici in which we stop move rate and let the market work onc we are notabl below or abov the long run neutral rate base upon a reason es    this is a credibl approach to polici   today  a nomin   percent fed fund januari                  of     rate would provid for an actual inflat adjust rate that is less than   percent   that is quit s ul   that will serv to support the real economi as the financi sector adjust  and it has to adjust   to s ul the economi further at our current inflat rate is to invit  or at least to increas the probabl of  higher inflat or encourag the next asset bubbl or both  and it will undermin our credibl in the long run  turn to the press statement  i have three brief comment   first  in paragraph    i would begin by put the econom rational befor the financi market refer  which would most appropri align our recent action with our concern for the downsid risk to the economi and place our concern for financi market stress in better perspect   second  i believ that a detail discuss of inflat risk may not be help at this  e  and the less said the better   therefor  i prefer the languag in paragraph   of altern b rather than ani other of the option   final  i believ we should modifi the risk assess to provid more flexibl for futur decis   most import  it should place less emphasi on the possibl of futur rate cut and better posit us to return to a neutral posit later this year and earli next   therefor  i would rewrit paragraph   along the line that presid   suggest  to summar  i suggest that we act at this meet  explain our action as i suggest  and hold at that point   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b  though i think a case can be made for altern a   the boston model indic that even after a    basi point reduct  we still need more eas to return to an economi with both full employ and inflat below   percent   take out insur against more sever downsid risk would impli even more eas than our baselin forecast   given our recent move and the addit januari                  of     eas in altern b  i am comfort wait to take more aggress action onli if incom data warrant it   howev  i will not be surpris if we find further action is inde need  what would be the argument against take an aggress tack   certain  one argument might be that elev oil and commod price and core inflat current abov   percent warrant a more restrain approach   howev  i would note that in previous recess the inflat rate has declin signific  even in the     s  in the midst of histor surg in energi and food price   whether we skirt a recess or experi a recess  i expect core inflat to trend down   a potenti second argument is that we have respond too slowli to the need for tighter polici in the past  so we should be more reluct to eas in the present   while it may be true that we rais rate too slowli at the onset of previous expans  i see no reason for this committe to behav in a manner that it believ is subop    as a committe  we seem to have consensus on the import of maintain low inflat rate  and i am confid we have the will to rais rate with the same alacr that we reduc them  should econom condit warrant such action
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc septemb  this committe has lower the feder fund rate     basi point   my es  is that the real fund rate befor ani action today is   percent or slight below that  and that is veri low by histor standard   the slowdown in growth suggest that the equilibrium real rate realli has fallen  and the committe has appropri allow the nomin fund rate to fall as well   do nomin rate need to go lower and  if so  about how much   part of this depend on what you think the equilibrium real rate of the economi is now   the bluebook indic that es  of r  vari consider by the model and the process they use to calcul them   the    percent confid interv around januari                  of     them is   percentag point   moreov  the es  of r   as we talk a bit about ye day  can be quit volatil   it troubl me that the es  of r  consist with the  book has chang by     basi point from decemb to today   i am uncomfort use an es  that is so variabl and so sensit to stock market as a guid to set polici   i also want to note that the bluebook indic that the appropri fund rate  base on a rang of taylor rule specif  is anywher from    to     basi point abov where we current are today  that includ forecast base version of the rule that reli on the weak forecast found in the  book  while i don   t want to suggest that such guidelin are definit  they do suggest that the current level of the fed fund rate is clear accommod and that we have taken out insur against downsid risk   when do we stop take out more insur   if we do cut    basi point today  which is the amount the market is expect  it would bring  to my mind  the real fund rate down to below    percent   that is base on expect of about     percent inflat  which in fact may be conserv   to my way of think  that is a veri accommod polici by ani standard   moreov  i don   t believ that enough  e has elaps for us to realiz the full effect of the cut that we have alreadi put in place   i share presid hoenig   s concern that onli the market can solv mani of the problem that we see out there  and we must give the market  e and patienc to do so   the last  e real rate were this low was in          when the real rate was in fact appar negat   but that was differ   inflat was run around   percent or less  and our concern was possibl deflat   today  we are not worri about deflat in the near term   we are worri about inflat  inflat has been move up  lower rate too aggress in today   s situat would seem to me a riski strategi  fuel inflat  possibl set up the next boom bust cycl  which i worri about  and delay the januari                  of     recognit of loss on bank   s balanc sheet but not elimin them   the main effect of the rate cut will be after the first half of the year  if the economi begin to recov   i think we need to be veri cautious not to get carri away in our insur strategi with lower rate too much   in my view  we are on the verg of overshoot  and i worri about the broad rang of consequ for our credibl and the expect of our futur action such behavior may have   that is close relat to presid     s comment about what peopl interpret that behavior to mean about what we may do in futur episod   but two thing are even more import  in my mind  about what we may do and what we do today  first  we need to be veri care about our communic and not to excess reinforc the market   s expect that further rate cut are come   in particular  i would feel much more comfort with support a moder    or    basi point cut if the statement languag today were more agnost about the balanc of risk  as i suggest in my memo befor the meet   the market interpret our say that there are downsid risk to growth as that we are plan to cut rate again   i do not think we should encourag those belief   i worri that the balanc of risk portion of our statement has come to be a code for predict the path of our feder fund rate   i think that is not a good posit for us to be in  nor should we condon it  given the  book forecast  i don   t believ that negat real rate are call for  and signal further cut clear send the messag that negat real rate are on the way  if not alreadi here   when our forecast are releas  the public will get our assess of the risk in our outlook   we don   t need to say anyth more about it in the statement   that  of cours    not preclud us from cut rate again if our forecast deterior further   but until it    i am reluct to encourag the percept that more rate cut are forthcom  januari                  of     second  as i said in the last go round  we need to be abl to better understand how we are go to unwind these cut that we have implement as insur against the macroeconom effect and financi disrupt   of cours  this was the theme of the discuss we had befor the go round   unwind those cut too slowli not onli risk our credibl on inflat but also risk set up the next boom   bust cycl   hindsight  of cours  is alway        but as we discuss in monday   s videoconfer  the fed   s be slow to rais rate back up after the deflationari scare was over in      may inde have contribut to the condit we are face today   thus  it is crucial import  to my mind  that we do have a plan for unwind the signific cut we have implement as insur against the financi turmoil   if the market turmoil subsid  i believ this committe need to have clear signal as to what we are go to look at and what has to happen befor we start to remov the accommod   i believ that the committe must undo the accommod as aggress as we put it in play   we need to determin what indic we will be look at to determin when that process should begin  when we know ourselv  we want to help the market and public understand what our process will be as well   i strong believ that we must be both credibl and commit policymak  and our communic must signal not a particular fund rate path but articul and focus on the conting natur of that path and help the public understand and appreci the systemat part of our polici and our polici decis   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the best cours of action today is to lower the fed fund rate by    basi point as in altern b   i   ve heard cogent argument that    basi point would be restrict and likewis accommod   ye day i had a chanc to look at the disabl relat display in the elev lobbi on the concours level  and i took some januari                  of     comfort in the fact that mani great peopl are or were bipolar   so whether it   s restrict or accommod  i can be convinc either way   i can live with the idea that this   not incorpor a great deal of insur against the downsid  provid that the languag  sn   t preclud further  e action as we have been use the word     e      so regard paragraph    my prefer is for languag that  first  serv to signal that the committe is fulli awar of the situat and not behind the curv  a signal that   s reassur and confid enhanc  and  second  preserv our nimbl  our flexibl  mean that it  sn   t preclud ani option to respond to develop  includ further move and intermeet action   i think the straightforward phraseolog    downsid risk to growth remain    as oppos to what was suggest in altern a  which includ    may well     is prefer becaus the altern a languag strike me as a bit too clever and risk appear out of touch   i also think that repetit of the    in a  e manner    languag from the januari    statement preserv the option to move in an intermeet action if necessari   so i think altern b languag is accept becaus it is spare  straightforward  and familiar  and it   s the least like to confus the market in the near term   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like presid    i agre with the action and the languag of altern b   as i note a few minut ago  i don   t think a real interest rate of around   percent  which is where we would be after this action  is realli all that aggress low  given what we   re face in financi market and the uncertainti that   s constrain busi and household behavior in term of spend   i guess i wouldn   t obsess so much   a load word there   about where we are exact relat to some es  of the neutral feder fund rate   as presid   point out  our band of confid around that is huge   it move around a lot januari                  of     when it   s defin in the short term  three year window that the staff has been use  but i think we just need to concentr on the forecast  where we think this path of rate would have us go  the forecast central tendenc that we look at ye day look like a pretti good set of tradeoff between get back to full employ and damp inflat   i think one messag from this longer term forecast exercis is where the committe think the taylor curv is and where we would like to end up on it in term of trade off inflat and output variabl   if i heard   correct  these result encompass not onli a fair univers assumpt of    basi point at this meet but at least ten of the case see further rate cut after that   in my case  i assum further rate cut but that they would start to be taken back in        so it seem to me  head where we   re head  and mayb even move a littl lower if circumst permit over futur meet  is perfect consist and is consist in the view of the major of the committe with some pretti reason outcom for the economi given the shock we   re face and the circumst we   re in  whatev it impli for where we are relat to some long run neutral real rate that might pertain over ten or twenti year   impli by that   and the vice chairman said this a few minut ago   is that it   s not clear that the   percent real rate has much  if ani  insur built into it relat to the kind of headwind we   re face   i agre that a   percent real rate is not sustain indefinit  but as i point out befor  we ran with a zero real rate for two year in       and         i don   t think that had ani advers effect on inflat expect at the  e   we explain whi we were do it  we explain the circumst that were forc us into that   we kept our eye on inflat expect   you might rememb that at the  e there was a lot of polit pressur that we should lower the rate even further  and we resist that pressur in part by keep our eye on inflat expect and make sure they weren   t move higher  januari                  of     so if circumst dictat  i think we could sustain  as the  book has us do  a   percent real feder fund rate for some  e without ani advers effect on inflat expect go forward   i don   t think    impli an unaccept inflat risk   i think it   s consist with the gradual reduct in inflat that we   ve outlin in our forecast   in these circumst  we need to concentr on address the econom and financi stabil issu that we   re face  that   s the bigger risk to econom welfar at this  e than the risk that inflat might go higher  and the    basi point in my mind is just catch up with the deterior in the econom outlook and the financi situat sinc the end of octob   we are just get to someth that bare take account of what has happen  with veri littl insur   now  i agre that if we got into a situat where we went lower  then these subtl tradeoff between risk manag and the inflat outlook would come into play  but i don   t realli see them in play at the level of interest rate that i   m suggest we be at at the end of this meet under the current circumst  i do agre with presid     we need to think about the circumst under which we would begin to take back the eas   in the staff forecast we don   t have to think about this for two year  if they   re right   but they may not be right  and if we go further and have insur  then i think that   s a more import issu   one point that i took from presid     s discuss was that there might be a risk in talk about take it back right now becaus it would undermin the effect of the eas you put in place   so as a committe we need to think about the circumst  it   s a veri subtl and t i issu   the chairman can perhap cover this in his tes oni  and obvious we   ve talk about it   it must be reflect in the minut   but go out front with hammer in public how we   re go to take it back is go to undermin the effect of the eas itself   so we can talk about those circumst  but i think we need to be care about overemphas the    take it back    idea  particular from the current level  januari                  of     i   m comfort with the languag of altern b   i think the first sentenc of paragraph     help to say that we think we   ve done someth consider that   s go to be help   it is a chang from the last thing we put out   remov    appreci    in term of downsid risk is also a chang  and i agre with that   but i do think there are downsid risk even after we move today  and it would be a mistak to avoid that topic   those risk are still go to be there  even after the fund rate is   percent  until the financi market begin to stabil and for more than a few week  we had a bit of a head fake in octob  right   they seem to be stabil   we said the risk were rough in balanc  and then the financi market collaps   i think we need a period of stabl financi develop so that we can gaug the effect on the economi befor we go to a balanc risk statement   right now the risk are still tilt toward the downsid on real activ  and that should be our focus   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b in the bluebook   if we cut the feder fund rate a further    basi point today  we will have done a lot in just a week and a half  but i think these action do repres an appropri respons to a substanti deterior in econom condit   as i said in my comment on the econom situat  i basic agre with the  book forecast for this year and perceiv the risk to be to the downsid   with the fiscal packag  a fund rate of   percent will like promot growth in the second half of this year that   s moder after a brush with recess in the first half   i   m comfort with this action becaus i believ our inflat object is credibl  and i do have confid that we will be abl to revers the accommod we   re put in place when it   s appropri to do so   but our discuss   highlight the import point that altern b seem to be appropri monetari polici in the context of the modal forecast   it just bring the real fund rate down to the  book es  of januari                  of     neutral  around   percent   if the economi were to go into a recess  addit eas would be need and would be appropri   also  as governor kohn and other have emphas  altern b still  sn   t seem to incorpor much of anyth for insur against recess   so  inde  there is a case for do more than b   there is a case for a  but i wouldn   t go there today   i think we can wait  and i think we can watch as develop unfold and monitor data  with respect to languag  the skew in the risk toward a downsid surpris and the possibl need for insur against that possibl  especi if we see some further deterior in financi condit   that strong inclin me toward the assess of risk sentenc in altern b with their asymmetri toward eas   we need to be absolut clear  to state clear today  that we recogn the continu exist of downsid risk and communic that we stand readi to cut further if necessari   therefor  i would definit retain the sentenc in altern b  paragraph    that state     howev  downsid risk to growth remain      howev  i could see a case  follow presid     s suggest  to substitut the word from the last sentenc of the decemb    statement to the word in the last line in altern b   that is  we could substitut the word    will act as need to fo  price stabil and sustain econom growth    for the word    will act in a  e manner as need to address those risk      this seem to me to be a small chang that would  taken togeth with the new first sentenc in paragraph    slight dial down the perceiv odd of further cut relat to the propos word in b   even without the chang that presid   suggest  though  the fact that we have ad the new first sentenc in paragraph     seem to me to chang the word of the assess of risk enough relat to our intermeet statement to communic to market that we will view futur polici move after the one today somewhat differ go forward   today   s move and the intermeet move are januari                  of     essenti catch up  to put us where we think we need to be  and move go forward will respond to the evolut that we see in the market
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support altern b  down    basi point  although as i   ll tri to argu in a moment  i don   t think it make a whole lot of differ whether it   s down    or down      i would support the   recommend on paragraph    and i would also note that the statement as it   s written recogn the credit market problem and the hous problem  but it seem as though a critic from the outsid might say it   s oblivi to the fact that inflat rose somewhat last year   so i would propos ad a sentenc at the begin of paragraph   along the follow line      although the inflat rate rose somewhat over the past year  the committe expect inflat to moder      it seem to me that we should recogn the fact that inflat rose becaus it   s parallel with the recognit of what has been go on in the credit market and in the real economi  now  let me make a coupl of fair general comment   i   m veri much of the view that the natur state of the u s  economi is full employ and output growth at potenti   that   s where the economi tend to gravit  and firm and market respond relat quick on the whole to shock   a particular good exampl was the shock of septemb      in the follow three month  the compani shed a million job out of nonfarm payrol  respond pretti quick  and slash product inventori  and in fact  it was that shock that end up creat the case for that be label a recess   without that  i don   t think it would have been label a recess  anyway  the shock last august did not lead to a sharp retrench in the real economi   put hous asid now  it aggrav the hous problem that was alreadi under way   firm and market are make mani necessari adjust   hous start are down   hous price are januari                  of     fall  which i think they have to do   bank are rais more capit   risk spread are rise from abnorm low level  and lot of other kind of adjust are occur that need to be made and are ongo   i just do not see in the data today the sort of    in your face    data suggest that the economi is in recess   it might happen  but i don   t see it right now   we may not have the luxuri of a polici that avoid recess   we don   t know that   our choic may end up be whether we accept a mild recess this year or whether we follow a polici that is so expansionari that we end up with some further increas in inflat and a deeper recess later   i have no doubt where i come down   i would rather take the risk of a mild recess now rather than the risk of an increas in inflat and a larger recess later  now  i said that i didn   t think that it made all that much differ whether we choos down    or down      a number of peopl have comment on the critic role of communic go forward to tri to stabil the situat  particular the market   s expect about the feder reserv   s monetari polici  and the burden here is go to fall primarili     percent worth  on the chairman   i think that we need heighten attent to longer run concern   so much of the market commentari seem to revolv around the possibl of a recess  recess  recess   i don   t see veri much attent to longer run concern   i think those longer run concern are import  and we need to emphas them   i think monetari polici need to be base on our best es  of what is happen   we spin out altern scenario so that we are prepar for thing that might happen  but the actual polici decis has to be base on our best guess as to what is  in fact  happen   i think that we are at risk that inflat expect might rise   we monitor them close  but onc we start to see inflat expect rise  it   s go to be difficult and cost to rein them in   it   s go to creat a big problem for us   so we can take some comfort that it hasn   t happen yet   i don   t think it has happen   but that  sn   t say that we can leav that issu januari                  of     alon   i think that the recent polici action and polici statement have not adequ balanc the near term concern over econom weak or potenti weak and the longer run inflat risk  now  this is the question   should we tri to indic to the market that it is now  e for a paus in the fund rate target chang  assum that we go down     given that we   ve now come down     sinc septemb   should we tri to give that direct   well  let me recount a bit of histori here  and some around the tabl  particular don  will rememb this and may correct what i   m say if i have the detail wrong   the fomc has realli been struggl with this question of forward guidanc sinc it first began to issu statement at the conclus of everi meet   the first  e we did it  we were use the bias or tilt languag   the veri first  e we did it  there was a reaction in the marketplac that we regard as excess and undesir   that led to the communic committe that roger   chair   i sat on that committe  and don was fulli involv with that effort  which led to the balanc of risk languag   now  my judgment is that  over  e  the forward guidanc that we   ve use in that balanc of risk languag has not been success   there   s alway a problem of put the languag in  and there   s alway a problem of take it out when you want to take it out without give impress that you realli don   t want to give   we have alway understood around this tabl that incom data can chang the situat  but the market  sn   t know when the incom data will trump the guidanc that is in the statement  henc  i think that the statement or a more formal tilt or balanc of risk languag has creat some of our communic problem   that was clear last fall  when we tri to give an indic that we thought we had done enough for the  e be and it was overtaken by incom data  and that creat a lot of problem in the market in understand where we were come from   so it seem to me that we   d be better off focus on as clear an explan as we can of whi we have taken januari                  of     the action that we have   that   s the best chanc we have of provid guidanc to the market of how we might respond under similar circumst in the futur that we can   t predict   i think we need to concentr on explain the polici respons   the committe   s task is   and again  as i emphas  i think it fall princip on the chairman   i   ll say to    restor     becaus i don   t think that that   s an unfair word to use here  a greater degre of polici predict   that cannot mean uncondit becaus we don   t know how the data and how event are go to move the world that we have to respond to   but we need to creat a better understand in the market of how the polici chang are condit on incom inform  given the polici object that we share and that are given to us by the congress   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor    basi point today   i think that a   percent fund rate may be reason posit for the economi given our forecast   that   s the  book path assumpt   that certain seem reason  and today   s data gave us no indic that reason chang that path   i  like presid    did find it remark that risk manag path were not realli that differ either way   now  sure risk abound  and it   s tough to captur that in model  and i   m all in favor of humil   i just don   t know which direct humil argu for in this case   more action or less action   anyway  those are my prefer  we have talk a good bit about the potenti of revers our polici action sooner than we often have done in the past   i just think that it   s go to be difficult in the moment   the bluebook path that i   ve been look at has this revers start when the unemploy rate is peak   i think it   s unknow that it is actual the peak   there will be a lot of uncertainti  but still  that   s the situat that we face  and so i sort of accept that   but becaus of that  i would prefer to be a littl more care about how far down we go   three percent could be the bottom of a fund rate cycl  januari                  of     it   s veri difficult to know   from here on out  i   d like to be hope for posit news but mind of further deterior that we would certain act on  in term of the statement  i guess from some discuss over the weekend  i wasn   t expect to hear much movement in that   but the suggest of presid   and presid   seem to make a lot of sens from my standpoint   so i think it would be nice if there were a littl more discuss of that  and i thought presid pool   s suggest on inflat was also help   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   our vice chairman urg humil   i strong support that   i agre with presid   that it   s not obvious that the greater one   s humil  the greater one should favor eas   i think we should be humbl about the path of inflat go forward  whether it   s like to fall on it own   i think we should be humbl about our understand of the output gap   i think we should be humbl about whether that   s even a sensibl way to think about how real and monetari phenomena interact   the phillip curv itself embodi a relationship  it is uncertain  but it embodi expect of our futur behavior   i think we should be humbl about what those expect are in the present circumst    e in the past when we   ve gotten in troubl on inflat have often been when we were oversolicit about weak econom growth  and i think we should be humbl about whether we   ve complet gotten past those inflat dynam or not   i think we should be humbl about the willing of our futur selv to revers cours  and a lot has been said about that   for some it seem to counsel greater eas now  but i think the opposit argument can be made that the extent to which we think we may be hinder or feel imped in rais rate  even if we think it   s warrant in the futur  should caus us to be more cautious about lower rate now   it alway seem in recoveri that there   s alway januari                  of     someth that look fragil  that look like to threaten econom growth   you know  one month it will be the commerci paper market and cdo writedown  and this month it   s monolin   there will be headwind   i predict we   ll be talk about headwind a fair amount in the next coupl of year   but if those are genuin go to imped us  we need to be realist about that  and i think we need to take it on board now   i agre with presid pool   we need to be humbl about our abil to prevent a recess   i think we should also be humbl about the extent to which what we see in term of both growth and financi market is presumpt ineffici and need remedi action on our part   you spoke sever meet ago  i think a year or two ago  mr  chairman  about our need to retain a concern about inflat but not be seen as inflat nutter   i think we need to care about financi fragil but not be fragil nutter  if left to my own devic  i could have chosen a    basi point cut today   i recogn that would surpris market  but judg from the polici path that you all have submit for your project  a whole lot of us think that we   re go to have to surpris market some  e in the year ahead   have said that  i can support a    basi point cut now   but more broad i think inflat is just go to have to keep influenc our polici path   i don   t think that episod of weak in real growth mean that we put part of our mandat asid   i think it has to temper the extent to which we lower rate and temper our behavior on the other side as well   as for semant tactic  i support presid     s suggest  second by presid    and i support presid pool   s suggest as well
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   we had a fair extend discuss ye day about concern about the condit of various financi market and some financi institut and their implic for the econom outlook  and i certain share those   in this environ  i favor januari                  of     altern b   a    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate target   my own forecast is below the  book forecast for this year and next  and so my guess is that we   re go to wind up move further befor we   re done   but that said  i don   t have enough confid in my forecast to advoc that we do more right now  as far as languag of altern b is concern  i am certain happi in general with what we have as written  and i share presid hoenig   s view  although perhap for a differ reason  that the less we say about inflat right now  the better   the reason is that  in some sens  we haven   t adequ express to at least some market particip that we understand where the risk lie right now   in tri to remind peopl that we are not inflat nutter but are serious about maintain price stabil  we   ve kind of garbl our messag  in my opinion  and i think peopl in the marketplac know this central bank is commit to price stabil   i don   t think we have to remind them with everi statement   thank you
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i   ve seen the discount rate talli   i   ve listen care to all my fellow presid and to governor kohn   i suspect i know what your fellow governor are go to recommend   i   m in a distinct minor at this tabl   this weekend  by the way  i search the newspap for someth to read that didn   t have anyth to do with either a rogu french trader or market volatil or what the great second guesser were blab forth at the chat show in davo  and in do so i happen upon a delight articl   i hope you saw it in the saturday new york  e on the search for a motto that captur the essenc of britain   my favorit was nemo ne inclun lacet  which veri loos translat  i think  mean    never sit on a thistl       laughter   well  that   s where i am   i   m go to risk sit on the thistl of opprobrium januari                  of     for my respect colleagu by make the recommend that we not chang the fund rate and that we stay right where we are  now  for the record  i would have support last week   s    basi point cut for the reason that it would put us ahead of the curv and bought adequ insur against a recess   i told you that direct  mr  chairman  and i mention it to governor kohn as well   judg by the polici rule on page    of the bluebook  as well as by the adjust rule that our economist   koenig has develop in dalla  we are  inde  ahead of the curv from the taylor rule standpoint as we meet today with the rate of        as was mention earlier  we have not been docil   we have cut rate     basi point in a matter of month  and we   ve taken some new initi that i think are construct and use   i   d like to see more along the line of the taf   to be sure  in the discuss that we had in that emerg meet  i had the same concern that presid hoenig express in the call  but with the word chang that was put forward by governor   i end up where presid hoenig did   i regret not voic my discomfort with the penul  sentenc in the statement   the one deal with appreci downsid risk after the move we took   as i felt that it undercut the potenti effect of our decis   dure that call  you may recal that i point out the pros and con   i began my intervent on that call by say that there   s a veri fine line between get ahead of the curv and creat a sens of panic   i also express concern of the need to be mind of inflat  as mani have at this tabl today   there are some critic who say we panick in respons to the market sell off of that monday   i do not believ that   s the case  and i don   t believ it   s the case becaus i find it imposs to believ   as i   ve said repeat in this room  other than in theori  market are not effici  and on the bank of the hudson or the thame or the yangtz river  you cannot in practic satisfi the stock market or most other market  includ the fed fund futur market  in the middl of a mood swing   when the januari                  of     market is in the depress phase of what presid   refer to as a bipolar disord  craft polici to satisfi it is like feed jabba the hutt   do so is fruitless  if not danger  becaus it simpli will insist upon more   but attempt to address the patholog of the under economi is necessari and righteous

it is not easi to go against the will of the peopl you have enorm respect for  but i have an honest differ of opinion   i truli believ we have it right at     percent right now   i think that  even

thank you   whi don   t we take a coffe break and come back at    o   clock   thank you   coffe break
okay   whi don   t we recomm   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b for sever reason  not least of which becaus it actual seem to reason captur what we talk about ye day   so i think it has that benefit   to state the obvious  we are in a veri tough spot   there are clear risk on both side of the mandat  and for folk who are of differ opinion  i don   t think that they would januari                  of     either deni the tough spot we   re in or say that we have a lack of worri on either side   i think presid   said in the q a at the begin of this round that we   re choos which polici error we   re prepar to make or  more charit  we   re decid where our worri are the greatest  it   strike me that altern b   that reason well   to step back for just a minut  i think that the tough spot we   re in is a function of issu that were veri long in the make and will take a long  e to work out   that probabl has two implic   first  as to what governor kohn said  it   s easi for me to feel more comfort with our judgment by say that we   ll be abl to undo it realli  realli soon  but if it is go to take a long  e for this to work out  i don   t want to take ani fals comfort in that   the other implic is that  when i say that this is long in the make  i mean particular for financi institut   it has taken them a long  e to dig themselv into this hole for the credit intermedi process to be as deepli disturb as i take it to be at this point   so when i think about what polici we would make on the monetari polici front  i wouldn   t want to excus or somehow allow them to get off scot free  by go with altern b  i don   t think that would be the case   financi institut have far more work to do than we have yet to do on monetari polici   i think they are further from recogn where they need to get   that will take some  e  in listen to other peopl   s perspect on the elixir of a   percent fed fund rate  i think it would be a nice luxuri to give   percent a chanc  but it   s probabl not practic for the follow reason   i have tri to convinc myself that the monetari polici move in the last nine or ten day were a one  e step function chang  by which we were set a level base on where we think the real economi is  and we need to get back to normal monetari policymak   i think drop the word    appreci    as in altern b is one way to do so   the goal would be for monetari polici to get back to sort of normal busi in tough  e  januari                  of     anoth point  just of commentari  is that  by take this action along the line of altern b  it would be nice if we weren   t go to be lower the valu impli by the market of where the rate will end up   so my support of altern b is nonetheless with this worri as well   that the market might think that we have more dramat action and that we will have to go lower longer than is current impli   i don   t mean to give them addit credit there  but i don   t think that we have a great altern   as to the point about market expect  i would note that we will   and necessarili at some level should   dure the cours of our next sever meet disappoint market expect  and that is not someth i think we need to run from   i think that will be part of the disciplin function  but this is probabl not the right  e to do it  as a final point  altern b is consist with the narrat that we   ve start base on the data we saw in mid decemb  base on the chairman   s speech earlier this month  and base on our meet over the past sever week   it strike me that it would be prudent at this  e of financi stabil risk and uncertainti in the market for us not to add volatil   not to throw out a differ nuanc or tri to be too clever   so while i have sympathi for some of the idea and amend that have been suggest in this discuss  we   ve come to a pretti tough place  as i said at the outset   it   s a tough fork in the road   we should all feel to some degre uncomfort about the choic we make  but the choic we   re make today need to be as clear as it can be   even if we   d get some comfort in be a littl cute  a littl clever  and a littl nuanc  i   m afraid we might be undo some of the clear bet that we have to put on the tabl   so with that  i support altern b as written   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i also support altern b   i think by ani measur     basi point of eas within a month is a lot and perhap it is a near unpreced januari                  of     level of insur that this committe has purchas in such a short period of  e   but i think it make sens to have done it in these circumst becaus we have the risk of a substanti tighten of credit and financi market condit   there are still lot of shoe that may be left to drop and  in nelli liang   s great phrase ye day     unplan asset expans can occur      just today we heard that ub increas by    billion the report of their expect loss from what they report last month  and that is not their final report   they   re not go to come out with the final number for anoth month  and so it   s certain conceiv that more could be there   the socgen situat is obvious anoth thing that is potenti unsettl  and so i think it   s veri import to be buy some insur  particular when the slow burn scenario that i   ve talk about for a long  e is the one that i see as the most like   there is not go to be just some immedi credit crunch or some immedi problem of impair of capit at an institut   but just given the increas in the cost of rais capit  given the difficulti of get thing off the book  given that other thing have to come on  or given just that the old securit machin that at a given level of capit sustain a veri high level of activ  which can   t be done now becaus you can   t get the thing off the book  the machin can   t churn at the same rate that it did even with the same amount of capit   then with all these other challeng  we have to be wari of that   so the fragil is still there   as we talk about befor  we had some dramat improv in octob  through earli novemb of last year  and sudden they revers  and i just don   t feel comfort that i understand where those went  that said  howev  i think the veri recent data that we have gotten provid just a glimmer of hope   i mean  we   ve had relat low claim number   the adp number was relat low  i   m not sure how much inform content is in that  but with the claim number it make a not implaus case that there wouldn   t be a dramat negat number in the employ report and januari                  of     potenti it could be on the posit side   i don   t think gdp is quit so miracul  as we heard the veri humbl dave   tell us that they nail it   but also look at some of the place in which there was some weak now that may come up next quarter   over the next coupl of quarter probabl we   re go to see a payback in govern spend  whether it   s through direct s ulus or through more expenditur on the militari   the advanc durabl good number  which no one realli mention  was on the posit side   i don   t want to put too much weight on that  but it suggest that there are at least some mix signal go forward   so i think that mean that we need to leav our option open   we need to worri about those downsid risk  but we shouldn   t dismiss the possibl that the forecast that dave and the team have put out not onli has nail it for this quarter but also has not done such a bad job for the quarter go forward  that mean we have to think a lot about what we want to say in the statement   how do we get that balanc right   clear  it   s import that we take out the word    appreci     and the market will see that   the concern that presid   rais is a real one   if we continu to talk about    appreci risk    after     basi point of cut in a month  i think that would be unsettl to market particip   but i think the market are expect us to take that back  actual if i could just for a moment get clarif from presid     my understand was that what she suggest about the chang to the fourth paragraph and the assess of risk was to chang onli the last sentenc back to the decemb    statement
that   s correct   i was suggest chang onli the veri last sentenc
which is differ from what presid   propos
he propos  as i recal  chang two sentenc  elimin the one that refer to downsid risk and also chang the last sentenc   i would not want to see the downsid risk sentenc elimin  i would chang onli the veri last sentenc
yes  i would agre that i would not want to see that sentenc chang  i   m open to the possibl of simpli chang the last sentenc to go back to decemb      now  that clear would be taken by the market as a signal that we were move back  anoth propos that has been put on the tabl is to add someth about inflat concern or acknowledg of the inflat situat in the rational  start off with someth like    although inflat pressur remain      i   d probabl end up come down with presid  n on that   at this point  i   m not sure we gain that much by say that   that is someth we may need and want to say the next  e that we undertak a polici action   i   m not sure it   s necessari to do so now  although if there were a strong desir to say someth like    although inflat pressur remain     i would not be oppos to that   but i do think it might be reason to at least consid move back to the decemb    formul for the last sentenc of paragraph    but that   s certain a step back   i don   t think that close off option for us go forward  but i   m certain open to those concern becaus i don   t want to close those option off  final  on the broader issu of communic  particular with respect to revers  someth that worri me is that there has been a lot of discuss about japan   after they would provid more liquid or a rate cut  they would say     well  we realli didn   t want to do that  and we   re go to take this back as soon as we can      so they kept provid more and more liquid  and it had less and less effect   it was the classic push on a string   i think that show the veri import role of expect   so at this point  given that i think we want to leav our option open  i don   t think we want to be emphas that   it   s extrem healthi for us to be discuss that intern  but until we see how thing play out  i   m not sure it   s wise to do that becaus we could realli undermin the effect of our monetari polici action   that is the last thing we want to do becaus that might forc us to go down further than we would otherwis like and caus januari                  of     more volatil in the market  more uncertainti with more potenti for unanchor expect  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know from my discuss of the economi  i think that we   re skirt a recess  but i see veri larg downsid risk   when we look at the  book  i agre with the view that the equilibrium fed fund rate has drop substanti  at least     basi point from the last fomc meet in decemb   when i think about a    basi point cut in this meet  which is clear the consensus of the committe  my view is that it is consist with the downward revis in the modal forecast but it   not take out ani insur  and this is someth that the vice chairman allud to befor  so all els be equal  i would actual advoc a    basi point cut at this meet becaus i do think there is a need to take out insur   howev  there are mitig factor  so i do not feel as strong as i did at the full fomc meet in decemb  when i took the view that we should take out insur and aggress cut more than the consensus of the committe  but felt that dissent would not be help in term of the percept of the committe and the feder reserv and so was will to vote with the major   in this case  i don   t feel as strong  so i am more comfort with    basi point  although everyth els be equal  i think that insur is warrant  and i get nervous that we are not get suffici ahead of the curv  so what are the mitig factor that allow me to be more support of the consensus of the committe   one is that i do worri that market might think we are panick   this is the issu that presid   rais   a    basi point cut would be a cut of     basi point in a month  there has been a lot of discuss in the media about our panick on this  so there is a danger in this regard  and that is a mitig factor for my not push hard for a    basi point cut   the januari                  of     second issu is that we saw a sharp move up in inflat compens after the    basi point cut at the last confer call meet   actual there   s no evid at all that this was a result of higher inflat expect  but i do think it illustr that there was more uncertainti about inflat and where our long run inflat goal might be   this is a reason that the committe need to get to more clariti on our inflat object   you know  it is no surpris to peopl that i   m not complet happi with where we are now in term of the rang   exact in a situat like this  just as in       you may drift up to the top of the band and be happi to stay there or drift to the bottom of the band and be happi to stay there   i do think there is a cost   this illustr a cost to our communic strategi  and i hope we would reconsid that at some point in the futur  the third mitig factor is that there is an issu about take out insur when the committe is not complet prepar and we have also not prepar the market to think about how we might think about revers if they were necessari in the futur   the whole insur strategi is one in which you can   t take out insur and then have it be seen as alway eas and thus unhing inflat expect and lose the strong nomin anchor   so the committe has to think more about condit under which it would revers cours and actual prepar the market for that   as i said  there are two kind of inform that i think we get fair quick  along with other   particular inform on inflat expect and inform on whether financi market strain are eas   i think we need to clarifi that in term of the public   it is a point that governor kohn made  and i want to return to it in a second   but the bottom line is that i support the    basi point cut in the fund rate  so i support altern b  on the statement  i am probabl the onli person who like the altern a  paragraph    rational   but i am sympathet to presid  n   s concern   the less said the better   so i   m not go to push it   but i am comfort say that inflat expect are current well januari                  of     anchor and that there is some expect of eas of slack in the economi  and so my view is that the upsid risk to inflat are not the serious concern right now   i   d be will to state that if it were me person  but the issu that presid  n has rais that mayb the less said the better is fine with me   again  i   m perfect comfort with altern b as it is written now  one last point  which is to address an issu that governor kohn mention   i think he   s absolut right that we should not be say or think that we expect to revers right now   even if we actual did a    basi point cut at this meet  which we   re not go to do  i would not take the view that it would mean that we plan to revers it   when you put these project out it   s tough to indic that you would be will to revers but the realiti is that we   re take out the insur becaus we think that the financi strain will last for a long  e   that is our best predict  and on that basi  to give an impress that we want to take it away would creat problem   this is the issu that governor   talk about in term of japan  where clear expansionari polici was not work becaus they kept say     we   re go to take it back      as a result  from the viewpoint of expect  the polici was not expansionari   i do think polici need to be expansionari at this point   howev  i   m not sure that i agre that we should not talk about the issu of revers   it   s a question of the way we talk about it   it   s not that we expect that we would be revers quick  but condit could chang  which we   re not expect  but we realli would like that to happen   we   d be hope  in particular  that the financi strain is turn around quick  which in the past we have seen happen in some case   in some case  it take a veri long  e   the episod in the earli     s was one in which those financi strain took a veri long  e to dissip   similar  we don   t talk about it as much  but in the earli aftermath of the         recess  there was a sequenc of financi strain  particular thing like enron and the lack of confid  that last a heck of a long  e   so i would say that we do need to think and talk about januari                  of     it  but it is not that we want to revers it   we are readi to revers  but the condit must be such that we   re actual get inform that tell us that revers are appropri   thank you veri much
thank you   presid pool
just veri quick  given the number of peopl who have talk about revers  it seem to me that the minut need to say someth about it becaus the minut have to be true to the ul  transcript as publish
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just say that i am complet comfort with the way you just frame the case  not just for think about and talk about strategi for how we take this back at the appropri point  but i also don   t have ani problem with the way you talk about how you   d frame it in public   i thought that was fine  when i talk about the need for humil  it was just in our capac to design op  strategi for the  e and the slope of the path to revers at this stage   i think it   s go to requir more  e  a few thing about the polici action and the statement   obvious i support     and i support the languag in altern b  paragraph    as written   the chairman laid out in public earlier this month a basic strategi that said that polici would be direct at provid an adequ degre of insur against the downsid risk  given the natur of those risk   it was said with more nuanc and eloqu  but basic that was the thrust of the strategi   i think that the balanc of evid we have   even with all the uncertainti about what equilibrium is  what the appropri level of the real rate is  and what it actual is   suggest that we have not gotten polici to that point  therefor  get that strategi in place is like to requir further action   it   s veri hard to know when or how much   it   s veri hard to know what should frame that choic now for us  i think   as januari                  of     mani of you said  market have to go through a further set of adjust  and i think that has to work through the system   our job  again  is not to artifici interfer with that process or to substitut our judgment for what the new equilibrium should be in that context   our job should be to make sure that adjust happen without take too much risk that it tip the financi system and the economi into a much more peril state that would be harder for us to correct and requir much more polici respons   there   s a big differ between a world in which hous price fall    percent and one in which they fall      if everybodi think they have to prepar for a world in which they fall     we   re go to take much greater risk that we have a scale of financi trauma and credit crunch that would produc the odd of a deeper recess  what we face now is not the choic  as i think presid pool said  between a mild recess now and higher than expect inflat over  e   the risk we face  as the chairman said sever  e  is the choic between a mild  short recess and a deeper  more protract outcom  the scale of financi market fragil we now face  you could even say solvenc in part of the financi system  is a function of the confid we creat in our willing to get polici to a point that provid meaning protect against an advers outcom   i think the experi of the past five or six meet suggest that we cannot care enough design a messag that can lean against expect in the market about the like path of polici that we judg to be excess and that make us uncomfort without take too much risk that it will just undermin confid in our willing to get polici right   we just don   t have that capabl   we thought about it and tri it in lot of differ way  but everyth we experienc over the past four month justifi the judgment that we can   t lean against those expect without take too much risk that we undermin confid in our capac to get polici to the point at which we   re give some insur  januari                  of     it would be a mistak to tri to recalibr expect now relat to the stanc of polici as state in the chairman   s statement and our statement last week   it would be a mistak to recalibr back to a point that look more like octob   everyth we know suggest that it   s probabl that the data will get still wors from here and that the financi market will be in a state of consider fragil and tenuous for some  e   to sort of zig at this meet  to recalibr more toward a sens of balanc in the face of that realiti  just mean that we   re like to have to zag back again   i just think that would risk our look as though we   re ambival and have to correct again becaus of that   that would just be uncomfort   it   s hard to know   i think governor   said it right in mani  mani meet   whether we face the risk of a grind  downward  self reinforc set of pressur on balanc sheet that rais the risk of deeper trough in hous and creat more caution and deleverag and the economi move slowli down or whether we face the risk of much more acut cliff in asset price with much greater consequ for confid and the fragil of the financi system   it is hard to know  but i think both would be veri uncomfort for us  again  i strong support the languag in b as it is   even though i understand the rational  i   d be veri uncomfort with dial back that statement as it now exist to someth that suggest we   re closer to balanc
thank you  and thank you all   let me make a few comment  the recent period has been more rag in term of polici and communic than i would have like   in particular  dure the past few month i think a percept has develop that we are tentat and indecis and are not communic clear enough to the market and to the public  now  whether that   s fair or not  that percept is there and has to be address   i think we have begun to address it with our recent communic and the strong polici action that we took last week   for my part  i plan to speak more often and more clear in public about the economi and januari                  of     our polici strategi  and to do that i will need your continu thought input and support   all that has happen notwithstand  i think we now have the opportun to get polici to about the right place   as we have all note  the pace of econom activ appear to have slow sharpli around the turn of the year   i am veri hope that the labor market report this friday will be posit  howev  as i mention ye day  there is as yet no evid whatsoev that the hous market is stabil  as the new home sale data show   so long as hous price keep fall  we cannot rule out some extrem serious downsid risk to our economi and to our financi system   we need to be proactiv and forc  not tentat and indecis  in address this risk  i recommend a    basi point cut at this meet  to   percent   this is the valu that the  book forecast requir to achiev modest growth later this year and price stabil by next year   a declin of     basi point sinc last august fit well with both construct indic  like the staff   s medium term r   as well as market indic such as short term nomin interest rate   a   percent fund rate is lower than most taylor rule prescript  but the taylor rule make no allow for current unsettl condit in financi market  includ spread and bank capit constraint  which make a given valu of the fund rate less accommod today than it would be in normal circumst   in contrast  the  book analysi attempt to take those financi condit into account   even at the   percent level  assum that the  book analysi is in the right ballpark  we would be make littl or no allow for risk manag consider  as sever peopl have point out   for that reason  it   s instruct to note that the  book has a flat path that  sn   t revers  and the reason is precis that they   re in a certainti equival framework without ani insur have been taken out   if you accept risk manag principl  then we should be consid the possibl of cut below   percent and then revers when januari                  of     that insur is no longer need   howev      basi point of eas in two week is certain a good amount  and i don   t think that go further at this  e is advis  regard the statement  i recommend altern b   it is veri similar to our statement of last week in the descript of the economi   there are two main differ  both in paragraph    first  and veri import  we acknowledg our two recent polici action  includ today  and note that they should lead to moder econom growth and to mitig of risk   the latter part is strict true becaus a cut will certain mitig risk  but it may be read to say that we think we   ve taken out a littl insur  which is  as i said  somewhat debat   that   s someth we can discuss in the futur   second  the downsid risk are no longer describ as    appreci      i think both of these step will serv to moder expect of further rate reduct by indic that we think that our action thus far go a substanti distanc in address the downsid risk  i strong counsel  howev  against take out the sentenc refer to downsid risk  first of all  it   s not plausibl that downsid risk that were appreci just last week are no longer an issu today  and inde  in the project that we   ve submit  the committe overwhelm saw a downsid risk to econom growth   we have to be honest about that   second  although i realiz what the intent of that chang would be  which would be to say that we   re not promis further cut  it could actual be read in quit the opposit way  which is that we are say we   re not make further cut even if the condit warrant  and that would put us back in the situat we were in at the end of octob  when the market was confus about whether or not we were will to respond to circumst   we have to maintain a postur of flexibl and respons in this fluid situat  and draw a line in the sand is not the way to do that   i   m also reluct to make the other chang that have been suggest   i understand the purpos behind them  but i   m veri conserv about chang word that has just been use a week ago in a januari                  of     statement and less than three week ago in my speech   it   s just so riski to give the impress that we are chang cours when we have just simpli now identifi the downsid risk and have taken aggress action in that direct  now  i understand that sever of you will be quit unhappi with the natur of that statement  and let me tri to reassur you in the follow way   rather than tri to convey all the subtleti of our polici strategi in the statement   and here i agre with presid pool  who has point to the limit of the statement   i propos to supplement the messag of the statement  as i said  by comment more on the economi and the polici in public speech and in tes oni   between now and the next fomc meet i have a tes oni the week after next  i have the humphrey hawkin tes oni  and i have a speech  and in each of those i will talk about the economi and the polici strategi that we are take   in particular  subject to your counsel and individu  perhap even collect  consult  in my public speak i will tri to make three main point  first  i will tri to reinforc the messag of the statement  which is that the feder reserv recogn the downsid risk to econom activ and we are on the case   we have alreadi move aggress and proactiv  and we are prepar to respond in a  e manner as need to mitig the risk of veri bad outcom   convey the messag that the fed will be activ and will to mitig tail risk is critic for achiev financi stabil  which in turn is necessari for achiev econom stabil   we have to show that we   re in touch   but   and let me now address these point in particular to presid   and other who have rais concern   the second point i will make is that the fed is not on autopilot for further rate cut   monetari polici take  e to work  and our recent action will do littl for the economi over the next few month  thus  some weak econom news is to be expect in the near term and is not a prima faci case for januari                  of     addit eas   instead  we will be data depend in the specif sens that we will respond to the incom inform that affect the medium term outlook and to our assess of the risk  the third point i will make in my public comment is that  to the extent that we are be proactiv in address downsid risk to the economi  we must also be proactiv in remov accommod onc the economi is on a sustain recoveri path  and we must be clear about the circumst that will prompt that revers   again  in say this i reiter that it   s not clear that we have yet taken out a great deal of insur  nevertheless  i think that point need to be made  the need for make a polici revers at an appropri point  which may not be the next six month but when the condit warrant  is import  moreov  i think it   s actual credibl   if you look at the dealer survey or the fed fund futur  they show a hockey stick   they do show a respons and then chang  come back later this year or next year  so that   s what i   d like to do   i   d like to be conserv with the statement   given some of the problem we   ve had  i don   t want to do ani right turn or u turn or add ani confus   i want to continu on messag in term of where we have been in the past few week   but recogn the subtleti of our polici approach  the concern that we have about inflat and about financi condit and econom growth  i will be make a concert effort to tri to explain in public the subtleti of our strategi and of our econom outlook   i hope we can present a unit front to the public behind the strategi to the extent possibl   again  i appreci your support and understand of the veri difficult pressur and conflict forc that we face   so that   s my recommend   i would be happi to take ani further comment   if none     can you call the roll
yes   the vote is on the languag for altern b as it is in the bluebook and in     s handout and on the direct from the bluebook  which i will read  januari                  of        the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent     chairman bernank vice chairman    presid   governor kohn   governor    governor   presid pianalto   presid    presid  n governor              yes yes no yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

 as shown in the bottom panel  today   s brief will consist of three present   i will start by present a diagnosi of the under reason that loss on u s  subprim mortgag trigger a global financi crisi   this diagnosi will suggest that among the most import factor were     a loss of investor confid in the rate of structur financ product and asset back commerci paper  abcp   which caus structur credit

  gibson and bever hirtl  to my left  will present an analysi of issu relat to credit rate agenc and investor practic with respect to credit rate   then  further to my left  jon  le and art angulo will make the final present  which will focus on risk manag weak at larg global financi servic organ and the extent to which bank regulatori polici contribut to  or fail to mitig  those weak   i should note that also at the tabl today we have norah barger  who work with art angulo on the regulatori polici issu  and      who work with jon  le on the risk manag issu   turn to the next exhibit  the diagnosi begin with the extrem weak underwrit standard for u s  adjust rate subprim mortgag origin between late      and earli        as shown by the solid line in the top left panel  as hous price soften in      and       the delinqu rate for such mortgag soar  exceed    percent of the entir outstand stock by late        in contrast  the dash line show that the delinqu rate on the stock of outstand fix rate subprim mortgag increas onli   percentag point over the same period  to around   percent   near all of the adjust rate subprim mortgag were packag in residenti mortgag back secur  rmbs   which were structur in tranch with vari degre of exposur to credit loss   the top right panel show index of price of subprim rmbs that are collater by mortgag that were origin in the second half of        the blue line show that price of bbb minus tranch alreadi had fallen signific below par in januari      and continu to declin throughout last year  fall to less than    percent of par by late octob   price of aaa tranch  the black line   which are vulner onli to veri sever credit loss on the under subprim mortgag  remain near par until mid juli  but they slid to around    percent

wherea mezzanin cdos purchas subprim rmbs with an averag rate of bbb   the middl right panel show the typic rate at origin of high grade and mezzanin cdos   in the case of high grade cdos    percent of the secur were rate aaa  and a further    percent were    super senior    januari                  of     tranch  which would be expos to credit loss onli if the aaa tranch were wipe out  even in the case of the mezzanin cdos  the collater was perceiv to be suffici strong and diversifi that    percent of the secur issu were rate aaa at origin and    percent were super senior   as delinqu mount and price of rmbs slid well below par  the credit rate agenc were forc to downgrad  or place on watch for downgrad  veri larg percentag of outstand ab cdos   the bottom left panel show that such negat

sophist investor who reli on their own model lost faith in those model as writedown signific exceed what the model led them to expect   as a result  larg segment of the structur credit market seiz up   in particular  as shown in the bottom right panel  issuanc of all type of non agenc rmbs declin substanti over the second half of        although comprehens data for januari are not yet avail  convers with market particip suggest there has been veri littl or no issuanc   your next exhibit focus on two other market that were affect by a loss of investor confid   the leverag loan market and the abcp market   the top left panel of that exhibit show that spread on credit default swap on leverag loan  the solid black line  alreadi had come under signific pressur in june   by juli these spread had widen about     basi point   investor had becom concern about a substanti buildup of unfund commit to extend leverag loan  the dash blue line   which in the u s  market eventu peak at

the u s  abcp market grew veri rapid   much of the growth was account for by conduit that purchas secur  includ high rate non agenc rmbs and ab cdo tranch  rather than by more tradit    multi seller    conduit that purchas short term corpor and consum receiv   as investor becam awar that some of the under collater consist of rmbs and ab cdos  they pull back from the abcp market general  even to

proceed to   and bever   s present
are there question for pat   presid
you character underwrit as weak  and i guess the document circul had some heavi critic for the credit rate agenc   i want to understand more what the natur of that assess involv   basic is it ex post regret  or do we have object evid about the qualiti of the decisionmak ex ant   that evid  of cours  would involv assess of the probabl they should have place on thing we saw
is go to address that in his brief   i guess i   d prefer to delay and just simpli say that i think we can point to aspect of their methodolog that look fair weak so that it wasn   t simpli an ex post result but one that should have been foreseen at least to a degre if they had had a stronger methodolog ex ant   obvious that   s monday morn quarterback  but still you can point to specif thing that were weak
i have a question on exhibit    the top right corner   are those aaa exampl rate as of januari
i think that was the rate at origin
at origin  not afterward   okay   the other question i have is realli a comment   on exhibit    the middl panel  it seem to me someth that need to be explor here  given that this is not the first  e that bank have made a lot of bad bet  is the way in which the manag incent are design   i just get the impress   and there has been some stuff in the paper recent  the wall street journal or somewher   that a lot of peopl are realli given incent to push these product and to make these deal   they walk away with big bonus  and who in the heck care what happen some  e later   so i think that the manag incent are someth veri import to investig in order to have an idea of how that work  and we might be of some assist in design someth that would be help here
yes   your exhibit   and your risk base capit ratio  fourth quarter  are those as of decemb
okay   and do these reflect loss alreadi taken in capit rate
yes   they reflect the develop in term of the chang in their financi statement dure the fourth quarter until the year end
okay   thank you
do you have a question  presid
i want to support presid pool   s comment   i rememb veri well back at jackson hole in      that raghuram rajan present a paper in which he emphas the januari                  of     misalign of incent between investor and manag and the fact that almost everyon down the line right up to the investor themselv should have had incent here   i don   t know what they were think  but everybodi was reward for the quantiti and not the qualiti of origin  he warn us befor ani of this happen that this could come to no good  and i think he did have some suggest about compens practic   these were not popular suggest   so i think this is worth some thought   i don   t know what the answer is in term of chang these practic  mayb the market will attend to them  but it seem to me that we have had an aw lot of boom and bust in which this type of incent play a role   your present and the paper start from the fact that you note the deterior in underwrit  but we should go one step backward   i suppos anoth issu here is what we saw in our supervis and whether we act appropri given what we saw   that rais a number of issu that i won   t go into at the moment but that i think we need to be sensit to
just a question on exhibit    the bottom two panel   you have the four bank there  and when you look at the capit ratio  it  sn   t look that discourag   but when i look at the credit default swap  it look a littl less encourag   so if i put wachovia on this  i believ wachovia   s credit default swap now are up to      which would be much higher than your scale is right now   so it would be interest actual to add wachovia to that list   the second thing is what you take from the fact that the capit ratio don   t look so bad but the credit default swap and what the market are look at indic that  in the past month and a half  peopl   despit the capit infus   are actual exhibit more concern about the default experi that might occur
right   well  particular with respect to develop in the last month or two  obvious the econom outlook is cloudier   as you know  i don   t think we tri to reflect that fulli in the capit ratio  and there is an element of stress test and whatnot  but your other import effect are essenti look through the cycl   so that may be part of it   also  if you look at the credit default swap spread behavior compar with that for lot of other financi intermediari out there  these look like veri modest chang   i don   t know   if   or someon could help me out   to what extent these would translat into signific increas in actual impli default probabl  but i wouldn   t think it would be all that larg an increas
thank you   i agre with presid pool and presid   about the need to focus on compens structur and incent  but just two observ  one is that  if you look at compens practic among the guy who actual look as though they did pretti well against those who didn   t do so well   i   m not talk about in a mortgag origin sens but in the major global financi institut   the structur of compens  sn   t vari that much   what vari a lot is how well peopl control for the inher problem in the basic compens structur   rememb raghu   s present was most about hedg fund compens  and i think he is most wrong when you think about that and the incent structur  the differ realli is how you design your limit to make sure that your trader    incent are more align with the incent of the firm as a whole   the biggest error and differ are in the design of the process of the check and balanc to compens for the inher problem in the compens structur   that   s import to know becaus a lot of these thing  if you look at the formal attribut of the risk manag govern structur across these firm  don   t look that differ   what distinguish how well the guy did is much more subtl around cultur  januari                  of     independ  and the qualiti of judgment exercis at the senior level  and this is import becaus  when you think about what you can do through supervis and regul  to affect that stuff is hard  i have a question for pat   pat  not to overdo this  but where do you put in your diagnosi of contribut factor the constel of financi condit that prevail dure the boom and what those did to hous price   you know  there   s a tendenc for everybodi to look at regul and supervis and the incent that they have creat or fail to mitig  but there is a reason view of the world that you wouldn   t have had the pattern of underwrit standard of mortgag without the trajectori of hous price that occur   sure  mayb what happen in the late stage of the mortgag origin process contribut to the upsid  but if you look at a chart  the rate of hous price appreci start to deceler about the  e you had the worst eros in underwrit practic   anyway  my basic question is  where do you put the constel of financi condit  not so much just what the fed was do but what was happen global that affect long rate  expect of futur rate  et cetera
well  part what i would say  in general  about the price of risk is that mani  mani peopl  includ peopl in the feder reserv  were concern about how narrow spread were  were concern about some of the slippag of practic  and were predict that troubl lay ahead   but   and i   m certain speak for myself   i never expect this magnitud of troubl   what i   ve been focus on are some of the factor that essenti made a bad situat much wors than we expect it to be   but there is no question that we enter the period with risk be price veri cheapli and a fundament reassess of risk   again  i think that shouldn   t have surpris anyon  but almost everyon except the most extrem pessimist has been surpris by just how much troubl that repric of risk has caus   some thing that we januari                  of     have focus on certain were not anticip  and we think they made the situat mark wors than we expect it to be
are there other question for pat   okay   we can continu the present
as note in the top left panel of exhibit    we would like to stress two key point on the rate agenc and investor issu   first  credit rate agenc are one of the weak link that help a relat small shock in the subprim mortgag market spread so wide  though certain not the onli one   this is not just our staff work group   s view   most market particip have also express the opinion that rate agenc deserv some of the blame   second  the way that some investor use rate for their own risk manag has not kept up with financi innov  such as the growth of structur financ   these financi innov have made a credit rate less reliabl as a suffici statist for risk   the top right panel provid a roadmap to our present   to start  i   ll expand on some of the point that pat made on the role of rate agenc in the financi crisi   my aim is to show whi credit rate agenc were a weak link  which will lead natur to our recommend on rate agenc practic   as we go  i   ll point out sever place where the rate agenc issu link up with the investor practic issu that you   ll hear about next from bev   we feel strong that the rate and investor issu are realli just two angl on the same under issu   the crisi began in the subprim market  the subject of the next panel   the subprim mess happen   and keep get wors   in part becaus of the issu associ with rate agenc  though as i said earlier  there is plenti of blame to go around    our staff work group was ask whether the rate agenc got it wrong when they rate subprim rmbs   the answer is    yes      they got it wrong   rate agenc bad underes  the risk of subprim rmbs   last year  moodi   s downgrad    percent of the first lien subprim rmbs issu in       the averag size of these subprim rmbs downgrad was two broad rate categori   for exampl  a downgrad from a to bb   compar with the histor averag downgrad of     broad rate categori   as indic in the exhibit  the rate methodolog for subprim were flaw becaus the rate agenc reli too much on histor data at sever point in their analysi   first  the rate agenc underes  how sever a hous downturn could becom   second  rate agenc underes  how poor subprim loan would perform when hous price fell becaus they reli on histor data that did not contain ani period of fall hous price   third  the subprim market had chang over  e  make the origin matter more for the perform of subprim loan  but rate agenc did not factor the ident of the origin into their rate   fourth  the rate agenc did not consid the risk that refinanc opportun would probabl dri up in whatev stress event serious threaten the subprim market   of cours  the rate agenc were not alon in this   mani other misjudg these risk as well   some januari                  of     have suggest that conflict of interest were a factor in the poor perform of rate agenc   while conflict of interest at rate agenc certain do exist  becaus the rate is paid for by the issuer  we didn   t see evid that conflict affect rate   that said  we also cannot say that conflict were not a factor   the sec current has examin under way at the rate agenc to gather the detail inform that is need to check whether conflict had a signific effect   in the next panel  i turn to the ab cdos that had invest heavili in subprim  rate agenc got it wrong for ab cdos   the downgrad rate of ab cdos in      was wors than the previous histor worst case  just as it was for subprim  aaa tranch of ab cdos turn out to be remark vulner   last year  twenti seven aaa tranch were downgrad all the way from aaa to below invest grade   as indic in the exhibit  the main reason that rate agenc got it wrong for ab cdos was that their rate model were veri crude   rate agenc use corpor cdo model to rate ab cdos   they had no data to es  the correl of default across asset back secur   despit the mani flaw of credit rate as a suffici statist for credit risk  the rate agenc use rate as the main measur of the qualiti of the subprim rmbs that the ab cdos invest in   and the rate agenc did onli limit  ad hoc analysi of how the  e of cash flow affect the risk of ab cdo tranch   as a result  the rate of ab cdos should have been view as high uncertain   as one risk manag put it  ab cdos were    model risk squar      a final point on ab cdos is that the market   s reaction to the poor perform of ab cdos make it clear that some investor did not understand the differ between corpor and structur financ rate   becaus structur financ secur are built on diversifi portfolio  they have more systemat risk and less idiosyncrat risk than corpor secur   they will natur be more sensit to macroeconom risk factor like hous price  and by design  downgrad of structur financ secur will be more correl and larger than downgrad of corpor bond   turn to the bottom panel  as pat note  in august of last year the subprim shock hit the abcp market  especi market for abcp issu by siv   rate agenc also got it wrong for the siv   more than two third of the siv    commerci paper has been downgrad or has default   the problem with the rate was that the rate agenc    model for siv reli on a rapid liquid of the siv    asset to shield the siv    senior debt from loss   while this might have work if a singl siv got into troubl  the market would not have been abl to absorb a rapid liquid by all siv at the same  e   onc investor began to understand the rate model for siv  even siv with no subprim exposur could not roll over their commerci paper   investor who thought they were take on credit risk becam uncomfort with the market risk and liquid risk that are inher in a siv   s busi model   the next exhibit present the staff subgroup   s recommend for address the weak in credit rate for structur credit product   a common theme of our recommend is draw sharper distinct between corpor rate and januari                  of     structur financ rate   first  we recommend that rate agenc should differenti structur financ rate from corpor rate by provid addit measur of the risk or leverag of structur financ secur to the market along with the rate   we don   t make a specif recommend on exact what measur of risk or leverag becaus we believ rate agenc and investor should work out the detail togeth  on this and the recommend to follow    second  rate agenc should convey a rate   s uncertainti in an understand way   the rate of ab cdos were high uncertain becaus the model were so crude   this is what i call the barri bond solut   put an a isk on the rate if you have doubt about the qualiti    laughter   third  we recommend more transpar from rate agenc for structur financ rate   what we need is not just a tweak to the exist transpar  but a whole new paradigm that actual help investor get the inform they want and need   for exampl  whi can   t the rate agenc pass on to investor  along with it rate  all the inform it got from the issuer that it use to assign the rate   fourth  we recommend that rate agenc be conserv when they rate new or evolv asset class   fifth  the rate agenc should enhanc their rate framework for structur product   for exampl  when they rate rmbs  they should consid the origin as well as the servic as an import risk factor  our last recommend is address to regul  includ the feder reserv  when we refer a rate  we should differenti better between corpor and structur financ rate   some  we do that alreadi  but we could provid some leadership to the market by do more   now bev will discuss the work on investor practic
has describ how the rate agenc treat structur credit product  a close relat issu is how investor use these rate   did investor reli too much on rate in make their invest decis   did they take fals comfort from rate and not realli appreci the risk they were assum  lead to excess growth of the market for subprim structur credit  as note in the top panel of exhibit    our approach was to examin these question through the len of one repres type of institut investor   public pension fund   public pension fund are an inform exampl of investor use  and misus  of credit rate for sever reason   first  public pension board of director are compos larg of repres of the employe and retire cover by the pension plan and have onli limit financi expertis in some case   second  survey evid suggest that a high portion of these fund use credit rate in their invest guidelin   final  relat to some other investor  mani public pension fund provid signific public inform about their activ   while we need to be cautious in general  we believ that practic in the pension fund sector reflect the tension face by other institut investor in make risk assess and invest decis   we examin the invest practic and fund govern of    public pension plan   these plan rang from the largest fund   calper  with      billion in asset   to six much smaller plan with asset of    billion to     billion   we use the fund         comprehens annual financi report  which were general the most recent avail  and the fund    websit to generat our inform   we focus specif on the fund    fix incom segment  sinc this januari                  of     is the asset class in which structur credit product would like be held and for which credit rate are use   the middl panel list some key conclus from this review   the first is that these fund have develop workabl market solut to address inexperi or lack of financi sophist among their manag and board member   these includ hire profession invest manag to make invest decis on their behalf and  perhap as signific  hire invest consult to structur asset alloc strategi  to select invest manag and develop mandat guid their action  and to monitor and assess fund perform   while these fund clear obtain signific profession advic in manag their invest  our review suggest sever way in which these arrang could be improv in light of recent financi innov   specif  the mandat guid invest manag have not alway kept pace with the growth of structur credit market  these mandat typic requir manag to meet or exceed return on a benchmark index or of a peer group of invest manag  while constrain the risk the manag may assum   credit rate play an import role in these risk constraint   for instanc  by impos a minimum averag rate for the portfolio or a minimum rate on individu secur   howev  few of the fund we profil made signific distinct between structur credit and other secur in these credit rate base constraint  although there were some  other limit on the aggreg share of asset back posit   the failur to make this distinct provid scope for invest manag to generat higher return by move into structur credit product  without rais warn signal about the addit risk these posit entail   this is not necessarili a    nave    use of credit rate by invest manag  as they could well have recogn that higher yield structur credit product embodi signific addit risk relat to similar rate corpor debt   instead  it reflect a previous effect mechan use by fund board to convey risk appetit to these manag fall out of date with the emerg and rapid growth of a new form of credit instrument   as indic in the bottom panel  our key recommend is that the pension fund industri and other investor should re evalu the use of credit rate in invest mandat   in a narrow sens  these mandat should distinguish between rate on structur credit and those on more tradit corpor credit   howev  the more fundament point is that mandat would do a better job of enforc desir risk limit on the overal portfolio if they acknowledg differ in risk  return  and correl across instrument rather than reli on generic credit rate  a second import point is that investor should ensur that their invest consult have independ view of the qualiti and adequaci of credit rate for the type of posit in their portfolio   this is particular import if mandat guid invest manag behavior featur credit rate as a key risk constraint  that complet our prepar remark   we would be happi to take your question befor we proceed to the final present
question   presid
i am still confus   how much of these weak would have been identifi by an imparti observ in januari       say  without knowledg of what has happen sinc then
are you talk about the credit rate agenc weak
there are plenti of investor who said     we are stay out of that ab cdo market becaus we don   t trust the rate and we don   t think we have an abil to model it      but there are also enough who were will to take on that risk   so i think it is a combin
go back to exhibit    the second panel  your point that we have no evid of conflict of interest have an effect on rate  i am think about the investor practic present   there is an inher conflict of interest becaus the issuer pay the rater  by one account  moodi   s earn    percent of their revenu in      from rate structur product   i have alway wonder   and by the way  i have been on the side of the tabl that has work a rate agenc and have gotten what i want   what about just a common sens solut  which is that the investor rather than the issuer pay the rate agenc
that use to be the way it was befor        the investor paid   i think the common explan for whi that model fade was that  onc photocopi machin came into exist  there was no way to constrain the inform that they were provid just to subscrib
i am well awar of that   but is there an inher conflict of interest in the process
there is   we are not deni that there is a conflict of interest   we look at some of the mechan that rate agenc have put in place to address conflict of interest  and that is someth that everi rate agenc is awar of   the onli question is whether the mechan that are in place to address conflict of interest were work or whether they need to be enhanc   our conclus was that we don   t realli have the detail inform to know whether there were specif conflict of interest  and we are look to the sec to provid that detail inform   but lot of other thing seem to go wrong with the rate agenc that don   t reli on conflict of interest as an explan   i think peopl who have look at the question of the issuer   s pay versus the investor   s pay feel that  given how cost it is to rate these thing even in the mediocr way that it has been done  it would be difficult to generat enough revenu through a pure investor pay model   that is not to say there couldn   t be more competit between the two kind  and there are some propos out there to do that
again  rememb how cost it has proven to investor to have that built in conflict of interest   that   s all   that   s my say
actual  i want to focus on the same issu   conflict of interest  this is someth i did a littl work on in the past   when you look at the standard corpor rate market  the move to have the issuer pay realli did not creat a problem in the market  there clear is an inher conflict of interest  but there are thing that can counter that   in particular  reput
we could talk about arthur andersen  too  becaus i am go to talk about the more complic issu of conflict of interest   with plain vanilla conflict of januari                  of     interest  if there is enough inform  the market frequent can solv the problem becaus if you know that if you do what the issuer want and you give a good rate  then you lose your reput   then  if it has no valu  issuer won   t pay for it   what is interest here is that for the subprim market  you didn   t find ani evid of conflict of interest  and i am not surpris by that  becaus those secur are much more straightforward   where i realli do worri about the conflict of interest is in the structur product becaus one thing that happen was that it becam less plain vanilla   you actual had consult practic insid the credit rate agenc  these structur are veri complic  and you need to slice here and dice here  and consult were provid advic on structur them and make a lot of money  and then it was much less transpar   what i wonder about here is that you didn   t say this for the first one  subprim rmbs   you said you didn   t find the evid   i buy that   but what about the cdos and the siv  for which i would expect that this problem would have been more sever  in the book that i wrote with other on conflict of interest in the financi servic industri  we actual said that there was not a problem with the plain vanilla product becaus the market have the inform  but we worri about exact this issu in term of the structur product  i am just wonder whether or not it was an accid that you said for the plain vanilla that there was less problem   could there have been an issu here   the reason this get complic is that the standard view of conflict of interest in arthur andersen was in the firm   s compens scheme   actual  the conflict of interest was that the texa unit did not worri about and weaken   not their ethic  but what is it   the center has rule for it branch so that they don   t screw the overal firm  and that is what got weaken dure the fight between the consult part and the audit part  januari                  of     so do you have ani inform on these veri complic element  particular the nontranspar part   was it an accid that you said for subprim that you didn   t find evid  and for these is there more possibl that there was a problem   that realli   have import implic for the natur of the regul and accredit agenc and also their abil to give good rate for these veri complex nontranspar product   you talk about investor practic later  bev  when you said that we should differenti between plain vanilla and this veri complex stuff   i don   t know whether or not you have view on this
there is certain a possibl that conflict of interest were occur in all these area   we are take a somewhat neutral posit becaus we don   t realli have the detail inform to say more
right   but this is the typic feder reserv cautious  and i am push you a littl harder
i know  but i am a feder reserv economist   i would agre with your point that separ out these nonrat busi from the rate busi is import  and rate agenc have announc some chang along these line   when we look at our recommend  we didn   t realli feel as though  even if they separ out rate busi from nonrat busi and even if they did all the thing that peopl who are concern about conflict of interest want them to do  it would solv the problem
there would still be problem
we think the real problem is that they didn   t differenti well enough between structur financ rate and corpor rate  and that is where we would like to put the focus   secur regul are alreadi focus on conflict of interest  and there are code of conduct regard how rate agenc have to behav  and those are monitor   so  coupl januari                  of     with the sec   s alreadi do examin  that wasn   t an area we chose to focus on  but we realli can   t say for sure what was go on
one quick follow up on that   is one implic that we might take from this that structur product are just so complic that they may never get good rate or suffici good rate  so the market realli has to shrink   could the rate agenc just fix themselv up so that they actual could do decent rate   i   m tri to get a feel for this   it realli relat to the issu that bev rais  which is you want to differenti between the two  but is there someth inher problemat so that mayb peopl should just realiz that these structur product are just not such a great thing   financi engin can go too far
i agre   in fact  ab cdos are disappear or have disappear  investor don   t have ani appetit for them   siv are disappear as well
but they could come back   i think subprim lend will come back under a differ busi model
realli  the question is  what sort of market forc would produc that outcom   it certain seem as though thing should move in that direct  and we feel that some of the recommend we are make on the differenti between structur financ secur and corpor secur would encourag the rate agenc to put more scrutini on the structur financ side of it   yes  those rate should be lower  especi when you factor in thing like the complex and the uncertainti
my comment is on the conflict of interest as well   the onli thing i would like to add is that this is not the first  e the rate agenc have miscalcul the risk and put that out there   the incent are design to do exact that  and it will occur again   i januari                  of     think this statement is too generous to the rate agenc   the incent are drive them to do this  they did it  and they will do it again in the futur   it is just inher that  when you are go to make that kind of money and if you can get it down to work with them and push this stuff out  it realli is a matter  for those who use them  that you get what you pay for
i didn   t know anyth about siv befor last summer  but i must say when i began to learn someth about them  i was astonish becaus it would seem to me that  in financ      you don   t financ long term  riski asset with short date paper   there   s a matur mismatch  and there   s a rollov risk  and we   ve known about that kind of thing for     year  i suppos   so my question is  could these thing have been market as standalon entiti without the bank    sponsorship  which was there in  i guess  most case   second  if they wouldn   t realli fli as standalon entiti  it would seem to me that the regul should have insist that they be consolid on the book of the bank
a lot of the siv were standalon entiti manag by independ asset manag compani that were set up to do that
and they collaps
all the siv are in the process of wind down now  and in the immedi aftermath of what happen in august  that was when there was a crunch in the abcp market
but when you say the asset manag compani  are they provid at least in principl some liquid support or someth
siv had partial liquid backup line from bank cover one week   s maximum withdraw or two week    maximum withdraw   that was the way to a rate   the siv were oper under the regul of the rate agenc   the rate agenc model their januari                  of     portfolio  and they model the inflow and outflow  so i think it   s fair to blame the rate agenc at least partial for allow the siv to grow to      billion or whatev it was
there is a larg  independ siv not affili with a bank  name gordian knot  that is still in exist   it   s under sever pressur  but it has been weather the storm   one can argu it might have been more conserv than some of the other siv
thank you  mr  chairman   my question is on exhibit    and the question is  are we make ani progress here   in particular  are the rate agenc step up to the process of do differ rate  differ nomenclatur for the structur financ   my impress is that there is a lot of resist  at least there was as of a few week ago
your impress may be more inform than mine  but i would say that the rate agenc are do a lot of self examin now   i haven   t seen them will  in my opinion  to go far enough in the direct that we   ve outlin   a lot of their recommend focus on manag conflict of interest and do a better job of separ compens from the rate and thing like that   i would say that i haven   t seen enough on the sort of recommend that we are push
did you have ani question
i   d add onli that i think where the rate agenc are now is tri to come up with cleaner box and better govern   sarban oxley type of structur  ombudsmen  liaison  chines wall   the core issu that   and his team bring up seem high resist to chang  but you know  there will be noth like three month of public hear  if not hang   laughter   that could chang that dynam  but that   s in the earli stage
a few differ point   one  on the conflict of interest issu  with respect to tradit corpor credit  it seem that credit rate agenc do pretti darn well and certain have done veri well befor this   so it   s clear that it   s not just fundament to the model that it can   t work   i think it   s clear enough to remind peopl of that and that peopl trust those rate throughout all the turbul dure the summer    but that said  it get back to some of the other point that have been rais   what was special about these particular area that led to a breakdown   the question is  well  whi did they have bad model   if they were abl to develop good model for these other thing  in principl they are capabl of develop good model  but they seem to have develop poor model here   now  that could be succumb to a conflict of interest  or it could be someth specif in this area  i am remind that anoth area in which they are perceiv to have done a veri poor job was in sovereign rate back a coupl of decad ago   i don   t know whether it   s worthwhil to drill down into the characterist of where this model seem to be success and  sn   t seem to be subject to signific conflict of interest or where it    whether it relat to particular inform issu   also  one thought that i had with respect to these structur product   and you should tell me whether this is true or not   is that most  e when a corpor come to get a rate they   ve decid to issu a particular secur   that is  if gm come  their cfo has decid to issu ten year debt   if you come to a credit rate agenc  howev  the credit rate agenc can say     well  whi don   t you issu six secur rather than one   if we chop it up in these differ way  i can make more revenu off that  so i have more of an incent to work with you on this
i definit agre with you that it   s more difficult to rate structur financ secur than corpor secur becaus with structur financ secur you have a lot of januari                  of     quantit model of futur cash flow with a lot of uncertainti   clear the ab cdos are veri complic structur becaus it   s a two layer securit   a securit that invest in securit   and the rate agenc didn   t drill all the way down to model the ul  under loan   they reli on simplifi assumpt and aggreg that were veri crude  but becaus they were brand as cdos  peopl usual understood them to be corpor cdos that invest in     corpor bond  which is a simpler  one layer structur   so the rate agenc were will to rate these much more complic thing and invest bank were will to market them to investor who were will to buy them becaus they all were will to believ that a cdo is a cdo is a cdo  and  in fact  that wasn   t realli true
yes  it might just be interest to drill down and see where the success are and where they haven   t been success and whether it has someth to do with the model
oh  it   s definit not a random sampl of asset class that we chose to look at   the rate agenc have done a great job in mani other place  i agre
right  but just think about those differ  i think some  the rate agenc may be excess malign   they actual do provid someth that   s veri use  and we don   t want to throw the babi out with the bath water   but also on that  there is a sever lack of competit among rate agenc  and we   ve tri to address that through some legisl  which  sn   t seem to have been veri success at address that issu   this is get back to governor     s point and some other point about whi competit  sn   t get us to a better solut   it seem that part of it is a regulatori structur that strong discourag competit   did you think about address that issu
the regulatori structur has been chang now as a result of the law that was pass in       at least if you   re talk about get the regulatori stamp of approv from the sec to becom a nation recogn statist rate organ   that   s now just a notif process by which  if you meet some minimum requir  the sec is requir to okay you   so entri is now easi wherea befor it use to be restrict by the sec   in some sens there   s a bit of a natur monopoli go on becaus  if you realli had a coupl of rate agenc that you trust  it   s not clear whi someon would be will to transfer from an establish to a new one   but if you were to take some of our recommend to the next level and talk about how you would actual implement this and how you would go about make this have some success  one thing peopl have suggest is that mayb we should help investor set up their own rate agenc   mayb they don   t want to do that now   and mayb more transpar from the exist rate agenc and from the issuer   it would then be easier for a new rate agenc that   s fund by investor to get go and get some traction if there were more transpar around the whole process   that   s just one possibl
for sure  although i think we tri someth like that with the sarban oxley issu of independ research   becaus this in some sens is a parallel to independ research   and even requir fund of that  and that  sn   t realli seem to have taken off   so it seem as though the model  even with it flaw  is the onli one that seem to be sustain   but drill down more into where those flaw are  in some sens we   re see a privat   i   m not quit sure what the right word is   with some of the veri sophist investor effect build their own intern credit rate agenc   that   s what hedg fund do  and so you   re get in some sens a loss of the public rate   a kind of free rider problem or whatev is the right way to character it   in some sens there may be a loss becaus you   re januari                  of     get this to be just pure privat  but mayb that   s a gain becaus those are the onli guy who should be in this game   it certain make it difficult to sustain the credit rate agenc or industri
we have kind of a dual problem in that we want investor to do a better job of evalu the risk  and mayb better rate would help on that   at the same  e  the exist rate agenc did a bad job  so we have to critic them   we have to find some way to reconcil those
i have presid   for a two hander and then presid   and presid     i also see that presid   has a two hander  and i think at that point we should probabl go onto the last present
i can pass if it get too long   that   s okay
okay   all right   so presid    presid    and presid
i had an elementari question that governor     s question kick off  the background brief was veri well written and veri clear  which made me think that i understood thing  and i probabl don   t   but you use the term    get a rate     and at other  e you talk about it as if it   s a suffici statist and how the agenc were warn that it   s not a suffici statist   there are transit matric to downgrad  and yet they violat that themselv becaus you said that for the ab  they thought of it as a suffici statist themselv  is a lot of this inher a multidimension risk model that   s requir for some of these structur financ vehicl  wherea for the corpor it   s closer to a singl dimension risk model
i   d like to ask as a practic matter what weight we should put in our expect or even our recommend on reform of the rate system versus the expect that investor would actual reduc their relianc on rate   my impress is that mani institut investor  especi public pension fund  are notori understaf   then they work for  as you point out in your present  board that either repres the beneficiari or in some respect are quit polit in natur and not necessarili financi sophist   that would lead me to the conclus that  as a practic matter  they   re go to be high reliant on rate  the ratio of profession employe to the volum of invest is so low that they have to choos their restaur by star becaus they don   t have  e to do the tast themselv or they   re not given the budget to do that now   so i   m curious about this tension between get the rate system right versus have the investor reduc their relianc on rate
well  i think you   ve identifi the key problem that mani of these fund face  and the import entiti in mani way are these invest consult   at least the fund we look at all hire one or more of these invest consult   mani of them are from larg  global activ firm  and the role that those consult play is precis to address the issu that you   ve rais   they help them select the asset manag who is do the invest   they help them design the mandat or instruct   they help them monitor what the asset manag are do and assess their perform   so to some extent those consult are a kind of sweet spot for these fund in term of where the addit layer of sophist that  sn   t run just off the rate could come from
but is your impress that those supplement parti  the consult and the asset manag themselv  have the credit analysi and valuat capabl to address sophist structur product
we didn   t do an evalu of them  but some of them are from veri  veri larg firm   they are advis fund in the trillion of dollar across all their differ client   that is the servic they are sell  and so they should be   they had better be   in a posit to do that
may i just suggest that you reexamin that proposit   they usual evalu perform princip after go through initi screen devic   they almost never  that i   m awar of  provid the kind of analysi that you   re assum   so i would reexamin that proposit
my memori of financ     is that you don   t buy long term  riski asset fund by short debt without suffici compens   so the neglect aspect of the whole episod we went through was how peopl would have been compens in other circumst  but that   s a differ discuss   i think these recommend make sens  and confirm of that is that the market is move in that direct anyway   i don   t know how mani of these recommend were put forward by those market particip you cite who two year ago were not trust these rate   i think that   s a key question   but the broader thing here is that the world of financ now is a world of compet econometr analysi  and we   re never go to rate the model risk if you ask the question  what would you expect the behavior of a market like that to display   you   d expect occasion big miss from er assumpt   you   d expect those miss to be correct by peopl reflect and improv practic go forward   a sort of schum ian process in this is go to generat model risk and big model miss  and so i think it   s be care to keep track of whether the insight we   ve glean are hindsight or should have been known ahead of  e
okay   thank you   whi don   t we continu with the final portion
thank you   to support the financi stabil forum   s work group on market and institut resili  as note in the top panel of exhibit    supervisor from franc  germani  switzerland  the unit kingdom  and the unit state form the    senior supervisor group    in late octob   particip u s  supervisor includ the occ and sec as well as the feder reserv   the group   s goal was to develop a common understand  through a seri of interview with select firm  of how the risk manag system of core financi institut perform dure the financi market turbul   the top right panel of exhibit   show the    bank firm that supervisor interview   this effort was not a complet review of all firm and event   for exampl  we did not meet with bear stearn or morgan stanley as part of this effort   rather  it was design to inform supervisori author about the general effect of risk manag at global financi institut   the supervisor have prepar a paper detail their find  which will be convey to the fsf and releas public   the bottom panel list some observ about the firm    overal perform   most larg financi servic firm  while affect by market develop  general avoid signific loss   although most firm    risk manag process work as intend  there were some definit outlier   some firm recogn the emerg addit risk and took deliber action to limit or mitig them   other recogn the addit risk but accept them   still other firm did not fulli recogn the risk in  e to mitig them adequ   moreov  the risk manag practic vari by firm and by strategi  as did the rang of outcom to date   i should note that the primari risk manag weak observ here are not new   they have been observ in past episod and are thorough discuss in exist risk manag literatur and supervisori guidanc   as note in the top panel of exhibit    the senior supervisor group identifi four primari factor that differenti the organ that suffer larger loss from those that did not      the effect of senior manag oversight of balanc sheet  liquid  and capit posit      the effect of communic among senior manag  busi line  and risk manag function      the sophist  divers  and adapt of risk measur util  and     the attent devot to valuat issu   with respect to senior manag oversight  as indic in the bottom panel of exhibit    the more effect firm were more disciplin in measur and limit these risk in advanc of the crisi and prove to be more agil in reduc exposur or hedg when the crisi occur   these firm focus on maintain a strong balanc sheet with strong capit and liquid posit throughout the entir organ   senior manag of these organ had establish adequ capit and liquid buffer that could sustain the firm through a period without access to the market for fund   they have creat and effect enforc intern price mechan  capit alloc methodolog  and limit that provid effect incent for individu busi line manag to control activ that might otherwis lead to signific balanc sheet growth or conting liquid demand   convers  the less effect firm were not as focus on the overal strength of their balanc sheet across all legal entiti and thus oper with more limit liquid and capit buffer   these januari                  of     organ had weaker control over their balanc sheet and were more focus on earn growth or defens of a market leadership posit   these firm did not have limit structur that were consist or effect enforc  which allow busi line to grow balanc sheet exposur rapid and increas conting liquid exposur   they did not proper aggreg or monitor off balanc sheet exposur across the organ  includ the exposur to conting back up line of credit to abcp program and general did not have in place effect financi control  includ capit alloc process  commensur with the busi strategi   the top panel of exhibit    provid addit detail on the import of effect communic among senior manag  busi line  and risk manag function   the more effect firm emphas a comprehens  firmwid  consolid assess of risk   senior manag of these organ were activ engag and had in place a disciplin cultur and well establish process for routin discuss of current and emerg risk across the busi line  risk manag  and the corpor treasuri function   senior manag at these organ collect made decis about the firm   s overal risk appetit  exposur  and risk mitig strategi rather than reli sole on the judgment of busi line   they were abl to effect leverag the assess of risk from one busi line to consid how subprim exposur  for exampl  might affect other busi   as a result  the more effect firm had a more  e and well inform perspect on how market develop could unfold   in some case  senior manag had almost a year to evalu the magnitud of the emerg risk from subprim mortgag on it various busi line   this  in turn  enabl them to implement plan for reduc their exposur while it was still practic and more cost effect to do so   convers  less effect firm were silo  did not effect share inform across busi line on emerg risk  and were compar slower in take action to mitig exposur as each busi line had to assess and consid emerg risk on their own without the benefit of view or action taken by other busi line manag   with regard to the risk measur util  as shown in the bottom panel  the more effect firm use a wide rang of risk measur and analyt tool to discuss and challeng view on credit and market risk broad across differ busi line within the firm in a disciplin fashion   these firm have thought more thorough about the interplay of their risk measur than the other firm and use a combin of differ risk measur and scenario analysi to understand risk exposur   it also appear that the more effect firm had commit more resourc to risk manag and manag inform system   as a result  they had more  e and scalabl manag inform system and in larg part did not have to creat new manag report to understand risk and exposur   convers  the less effect firm were too depend on a singl quantit risk measur  and they did not util scenario analysi in their decisionmak and tend to appli a    mechan    risk manag approach   manag inform system also januari                  of     were not as scalabl  and there was a need to develop a number of ad hoc report to help senior manag understand the risk and exposur of the compani   the top panel of exhibit    elabor on the fourth factor that prove critic  which is the attent devot to valuat issu   the more effect organ were more disciplin in how they valu the hold of complex or potenti illiquid secur   they employ more sophist valuat practic and had invest in the develop of price model and staff with special expertis  these organ were skeptic of and less reliant on extern rate and emphas mark to market disciplin in their busi in way that other did not  less effect organ in some case did not have key valuat model in place prior to the market disrupt  reli heavili on third parti view of risk  and tend to have a narrow view of the risk associ with their cdo busi as main be credit risk and did not activ seek market valuat inform   the bottom panel explain how supervisor are plan to address the specif defici   as i mention earlier in my present  the risk manag defici identifi dure this exercis are not new  and exist supervisori guidanc address these issu   therefor  supervisori effort will includ address risk manag defici at each compani through the supervisori process and re emphas the import of strong  independ risk manag through a seri of speech  industri outreach  and possibl re issuanc of exist guidanc   in addit  supervisor plan to complet the work alreadi under way within the basel committe on bank supervis to updat liquid risk manag guidanc to strengthen industri practic   a review of exist feder reserv guidanc on market and liquid risk manag is under way to ensur that it effect outlin the need for bank to use a number of tool to includ multipl way of view quantit and qualit risk analysi  includ var  stress test  and scenario analysi  final  supervisor plan to develop  on an interag basi  guidanc relat to the manag of the origin to distribut model to ensur that bank organ effect manag the credit  market  and oper risk of this activ   i will now turn it over to art angulo to discuss relat regulatori polici
the top panel of exhibit    set forth the question we sought to address   name  to what extent did regulatori incent contribut to or fail to mitig weak expos by the recent turmoil   in do so  we defin the term    regulatori incent    to encompass both regulatori capit and financi report requir   in addit  we distinguish between polici that may have matter for the buildup to the market turmoil and those that have made manag the turmoil more challeng   our conclus are summar in the middl panel   not surpris  incent to minim regulatori capit are a much more import driver of bank behavior than financi report incent   moreov  the current regulatori capit framework is not neutral as to how bank structur risk posit  both the leverag ratio and the basel i risk base capit framework have encourag bank to securit low risk asset and  import  to support securit of higher risk asset through instrument with low mandat capit charg  such as     day liquid facil   financi report incent were not critic to bank    januari                  of     decis  although certain financi report issu   particular disclosur practic   have been a factor in how the turmoil has been unfold   befor i turn to specif recommend  it is import to emphas that improv were alreadi in train even befor the market difficulti emerg last summer   most signific  the basel   advanc approach and relat improv great enhanc the risk sensit of the regulatori capit framework and creat incent for better risk manag   in the bottom panel are three exampl relev to the issu we have been discuss this morn   first  capit charg for most unus short term credit and liquid facil have been increas to more adequ reflect the risk exposur   second  new standard for bank to hold capit against the default risk of complex  less liquid credit product in the trade book are be final  as the basel committe is current seek public comment on principl for calcul a so call increment default risk charg against such product   i should note that the work to develop the increment default risk principl was done by a joint basel committe   iosco work group co chair by norah barger   third  the securit framework in basel    which build on previous unilater u s  enhanc  establish a more risk sensit capit treatment for securit exposur   it base capit charg on es  of under risk rather than on an exposur   s legal form   i will now turn to recommend in exhibit     begin first in the top panel with those relat to regulatori capit   first  notwithstand the improv brought about by basel    there is scope for reassess the treatment of securit involv ab cdos   the risk weight and result capit charg for these    re securit    were calibr under the assumpt that loss correl within a pool of securit asset would be no greater than those exhibit by cdos back by tradit corpor bond   it is now appar that the actual loss correl within such re securit   especi for the most high rate tranch   may be much higher   at it decemb      meet  the basel committe agre to take up this issu   the second recommend address the issu of    reput    risk   there have been sever occas over the last   month in which bank have elect to purchas asset from  or extend credit to  off balanc sheet vehicl they had organ and money market and other invest fund they manag  even though they were not contractu oblig to do so   whether a bank manag will provid support in excess of it contractu oblig is a busi decis   thus  it is not practic to attempt to design an explicit capit charg for reput risk  instead  supervisor should exercis supervisori oversight to ensur that bank suffici consid reput risk and it implic for capit and liquid buffer   the third and fourth recommend deal with the issu of the procycl of capit regul   the exist of fix capit requir  as well as rate agenc expect for capit ratio  discourag bank from draw on their januari                  of     capit cushion in  e of stress   it is therefor veri difficult to devis chang in capit regul that would allow capit to function more effect as a shock absorb without compromis safeti and sound object   nonetheless  these last two recommend are aim at mitig the potenti procycl effect of a more risk sensit capit framework   the third recommend is base on element of the basel   framework that were design to allow supervisor to address both safeti and sound and procycl concern   the advanc intern rate base approach of basel   requir that bank    loss given default es  reflect econom downturn condit and that stress test of their advanc system includ consider of how econom cycl affect risk base capit requir  rigor supervisori evalu of these two element can help ensur that     regulatori capit emb forward look forecast of recoveri rate and     bank manag their regulatori capit posit in a manner that enabl them to accommod variat in the amount of minimum requir capit over an econom cycl   the fourth recommend is to explor way to encourag inclus in the regulatori capit base of debt instrument that mandatorili convert into equiti when a bank organ is under stress   the automat convers of debt instrument into equiti under such circumst is appeal from a supervisori perspect as well as from a broader macroeconom polici perspect  this concept has not yet been examin in depth by the staff  but we believ it merit further studi  includ an assess of the past experi of bank with such instrument  to determin it feasibl   let   s now move to the recommend in the bottom panel   these deal with improv disclosur practic  which can help to reduc the uncertainti that has been a key featur of the recent turmoil   first  financi institut   especi those in the unit state   improv their disclosur about subprim relat exposur as the turmoil wore on   nonetheless  supervisor and regul should continu to push market particip to make  e and detail disclosur about the size and composit of subprim relat exposur   the second and third recommend focus on disclosur relat to asset back commerci paper program   in view of the potenti exposur associ with reput risk  market particip appear to desir addit detail about bank    deal with abcp program   disclos inform about the distribut of asset under such program by type  industri  and credit rate would bring the disclosur on par with those provid for on balanc sheet asset   similar  in view of the extent to which investor in asset back commerci paper have retreat from roll over or purchas paper that they suspect may be support by subprim relat asset  bank and asset manag that sponsor abcp conduit should improv disclosur to investor  particular for conduit other than the tradit multi seller program   that complet our prepar remark   we would be pleas to take your question at this  e
thank you   question   presid
it is great to see some bank supervis peopl at this tabl  and i would just highlight one of the comment that you made about silo   it is interest that this morn we have been discuss issu of bank balanc sheet constraint and how that would occur  and it might be use to think structur within our own organ whether there are way to do a better job of get peopl in bank supervis to understand some of the financi stabil issu we think about  and then vice versa   mayb have some bank supervis peopl come to fomc meet might be one way to actual promot some of this  in term of the thing that you were talk about  anoth issu that i think has been import is that we   ve been talk about the effect of drop hous price   i know a horizont stress review was done about a year ago  and i   m sure   or jon rememb that the larg financi institut did the stress test   when they did that stress test  what was strike was that there were four institut   i think it was citigroup  jpmorgan chase  wachovia  and bank of america   in that stress test  and all four conclud that a hous price reduct of between    percent and    percent would affect earn but wouldn   t affect capit   obvious  in retrospect that  sn   t seem to have been a good forecast   one  sinc we do think that stress test is use  mayb understand that and go back to those same four institut and understand their stress test might be a use exercis to do   two  if you did that exercis  we   d learn someth about how they   re think about hous price and the indirect effect that might occur becaus one of our concern around the fomc tabl is that there may be unintend consequ if hous price drop more than they have histor   just as the bank have to think about those kind of stress test and what they have alreadi learn from the fact that they didn   t pick up some of the indirect effect  our own knowledg would be supplement if we thought about some of those indirect effect as well  januari                  of     so the horizont stress test was interest in that i think some of those institut are on the good side and the bad side of your thing   the horizont stress test isn   t what generat the decis   and i do agre with your conclus that most of the decis were made by senior manag   some organ didn   t do subprim mortgag at all   i   m not so sure it was generat from the stress test as much as a gut feel by senior bank manag that they weren   t go to engag in subprim mortgag   i think that   s true for a lot of these activ   it   s interest who   s at the top of the list and who   s at the bottom of the list for a lot of these activ  ideal  over  e  both bank supervis and bank risk manag would get to the point that it   s not just a gut decis by a person at the top but is a littl more systemat and that the risk manag process   that   are you think of way that we could actual encourag that kind of interact so that it becom less gut from senior manag and more integr into the risk manag   i know that was kind of a long entri
well  i would just comment on the first point that you made in term of silo   i guess we would fulli agre we   re have a great  e here  so we would love to see more interact between supervis and the fomc
be care what you wish for
you know  when peopl debat whether to have supervis with a central bank or not  one of the key argument is that onli we can bring to bear the resourc of the entir central bank and also provid input from the supervis side   so clear  that   s someth i think we need to do more of   in term of the second question  do you want to take a fresh crack at that
yes   my percept is that the peopl who were further down on the list made activ decis to get out of the busi or reduc their scale of the busi  not necessarili januari                  of     just on gut feel but becaus they had invest earlier on in the staff and the model to evalu the product space   so they understood that the econom of the subprim busi had deterior and that the risk relat to the return was rise  and they made an activ decis  usual  to retract a bit from that space   now  they may have made those decis gradual and increment over the year from mid      forward   it wasn   t one stress test  but it was a thorough understand of the econom of the actual busi that drove their decisionmak
i would also agre that your general point about bank be more exact in their stress test is a good one becaus it   s someth we and other supervisor  to be honest with you  continu look at  and mani  e the respons that bank get intern from either owner or manag or through supervisor is that  well  if it   s too extrem  it   s not realli plausibl  and you can   t realli act on it   the other argument you some  hear is  well  it cost a lot of money to integr that across the firm and do it the right way  and that   s a tough sell   so i agre with your point that we need to do more and then push harder on stress test   the way  that you suggest is kind of novel   you do a back test and show it to them   that   s an interest concept
i might add one thing to that   in interview we did with some firm  one point that they made was that stress test was inform and import  but a next step they   re tri to take is what it would take to caus that stress event to happen for differ type of asset  so they are tri to anticip   not so much that they just assum a    percent drop but how they would get to a    percent drop   what would be the event that would caus that to happen   then they think that through in a more systemat way   i know some compani have learn what their high rate thing are that are view as stabl valu asset elsewher on their balanc sheet and are think about how those could start to unwind or to deterior
we need to be care with the nomenclatur   stress test right now in the industri encompass a lot of thing  and peopl will tell you that they do stress test  but they are realli do static shock   what we are talk about is not a histor analysi but a kind of forward look scenario that build in your view of the world   those are the firm that  again  made more activ decis to reduc their exposur
i think this was veri interest  and i have a suggest and then a question   the suggest is that this morn we had the feder open market committe meet  this afternoon we should have the feder market oversight committe meet  and that is what we   re do right now in look at some of these institut   my question is  as you look at these and you compar the most effect and least effect  are you in the process and shouldn   t we be in the process   becaus we go back and look at these horizont review   of look at what lesson we   ve learn about more effect institut and less effect institut dure the horizont review so that we can be more proactiv in term of the outcom that we   re now see  if we do that in a systemat fashion over  e  we could anticip not all   we learn a long  e ago that you cannot anticip it all   but some of these differ and put more pressur on some institut that were not do good risk analysi to step up to it befor it becom a crisi   i don   t know if we   re do lesson learn for ourselv in that regard
i would say we   ve look at a lot of that   the one place i would highlight most articul is the degre of intern coordin and cooper we   ve had under way  the core firm in the unit state are one portion of this system now  with a number of veri signific global competitor   so the coordin between us  the occ  the sec  the u k  fsa  and the other senior supervisor group has been realli necessari for everyon to get a good januari                  of     understand of practic   it   s perhap more valuabl to some of the foreign supervisor who have onli one or two larg firm under their jurisdict   but even from our vantag point of what our direct supervisori respons is  the consolid within the industri has collaps the number of firm that we view direct
i might add that we are tri to look at this   it   s not just an issu of guidanc  but we are go back through the supervisori process in term of what we   ve learn through these interview and challeng our belief and prior assess
i think that is good becaus  if you think about it  we have the basel capit standard come forward  which involv the advanc method   reli on those institut to a great degre in term of judg their capit and their capit level   when they are under pressur  they will tend to work the model   it is natur   as we have said befor  the incent are that they will work the model   so if we are not take lesson learn from this in term of anticip those behavior  i think we will repeat histori in the surpris that we get
just veri quick  you did a terrif job   i think it   s import  though  to recogn that this isn   t done yet  and we   re not go to know fundament how we feel about the relat strength and weak in the system until we see how this play out   don   t let these initi presumpt   either the diagnosi or the prescript  particular your list of prescript   harden too much becaus there are some judgment that we   re just not go to be abl to make until the dust settl and we have a littl  e for reflect in that context   i think a lot of damag has been done to the credibl of our financi system   it   s not clear how much damag becaus we don   t know how this is go to play out   but damag has been done  and we are go to bear a lot of the burden of figur out how to craft a compel polici januari                  of     respons  recogn of cours that regul may be part of the problem and won   t necessarili be part of the solut   anyway  most i just meant to compliment you   you did a great job  and i think it   s help realli to have this much work done earli on in get us to the point where we know what we   re go to do to the system to make it less vulner to this in the futur   even as we manag the crisi  i think it   s good to have made that invest and a good tribut to the strength of the system that we were abl to devot these qualiti resourc even though we   ve all been busi manag the storm
let me also thank the staff for an excel present   this is just the tip of the iceberg in term of the work that   s be done on all these differ topic  and in turn we   re collabor with our colleagu here in the unit state and abroad  and i guess we   ll keep work and hope to find some valuabl lesson out of this experi  i   ve been ask to remind peopl that you have until tomorrow close of busi if you wish to revis your project     madigan rais a few question about consist   if you want to think about that  of cours  feel free to do so   our next meet is march      i look forward to see you then  and there   s a lunch avail for those of you who can stay   thank you veri much  the meet is adjourn  end of meet januari                  of
