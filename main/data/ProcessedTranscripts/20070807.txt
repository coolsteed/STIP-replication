thank you   as you all know  there has been consider financi market turbul sinc the last meet   problem in subprim mortgag credit have persist and intensifi  credit rate agenc have begun to downgrad asset back secur and cdos  collater debt oblig  that refer subprim debt  the problem in subprim have spread into the alt a mortgag space and into part of the prime mortgag market  corpor credit has been infect  with high yield bond and loan spread move out sharpli  and stock price have falter  although market general have been function well in term of liquid and the abil to transact  there have been some import except   the nonconform residenti mortgag market and the structur financ product market   especi the cdo and clo  collater loan oblig  market   have been signific impair  and there are concern about the abil of some asset back commerci paper program to continu to sourc fund via that market   as a consequ  market expect with respect to monetari polici have shift sharpli  with market expect consist with consider monetari polici eas over the next year   market particip are worri about the effect of tighten credit standard on hous and about the deterior in the market function in structur financ  which could broaden and be self reinforc  ul  damag the macroeconomi   i am go to be refer to this handout as we go through these comment   in trace the sourc of the turmoil that we have experienc recent  we find that the deterior of the subprim mortgag sector continu to play an import role in sever way   first  the deterior in under credit qualiti continu unab  as shown in exhibit    delinqu of more than sixti day for recent abx index vintag have continu to move higher  and the pace of deterior   measur by the steep of the curv   has  if anyth  worsen   note that the newest vintag         so the second half of          not show ani benefit from improv underwrit standard   that stem main from the fact that the pipelin to build these secur is relat long   with the averag loan referenc by this index more than six month old at this point   it also may reflect the fact that this newest vintag get   in contrast to earlier vintag   less benefit from earlier home price appreci   as a consequ of this poor credit perform  abx spread have continu to widen sharpli   this is shown in exhibit    which show the perform for abx bbb  tranch across vintag  and exhibit    which show the perform for the various tranch of the      vintag   the deterior in the    materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     higher rate tranch has been much more sever than earlier in the year   in part  this greater deterior reflect the fact that loss es  have been trend higher  put the higher rate tranch more in harm   s way   it also reflect effort to hedg subprim risk by go short these index by peopl who can   t liquid secur easili   translat these abx spread back into price  juli was a veri rough month for abx   price declin of    point or more occur in the abx bbb  tranch of some more recent vintag   second  the disturb delinqu trajectori shown in exhibit   have caus the rate agenc to downgrad a signific number of residenti asset back secur and cdos that have exposur to the subprim sector   howev  most of the downgrad appli to vintag befor        for more recent vintag  the loss experi is wors but still hard to es    this mean that mani more downgrad lie ahead   third  some of the credit rate agenc have made chang to their structur financ rate model   that  combin with huge mark to market loss even in high rate subprim tranch  has led to a fundament reevalu of what a credit rate mean and how much comfort an investor should take from a high credit rate on an opaqu structur financ cdo or clo product   the problem in subprim have spread into other mortgag market  includ alt a  certain type of prime residenti mortgag product  and commerci mortgag back secur  cmbs    countrywid  for exampl  announc a deterior in it second lien prime mortgag book   meanwhil  american home mortgag  which had oper primarili in the alt a and nontradit prime mortgag space as both a larg monolin mortgag issuer and a reit investor  was forc to shut down it oper last week and file for bankruptci ye day  market liquid for nonconform residenti mortgag product is poor  and this has contribut to a further tighten in underwrit standard   for exampl  a number of mortgag origin indic that they will no longer offer      and      adjust rate mortgag product  and some have indic that they will not buy ani alt a mortgag origin by broker   at the same  e that we have seen turmoil in the subprim market  it has spread into the corpor sector as well   credit spread in the corpor sector have also widen sharpli   for exampl  in juli  high yield corpor bond spread widen about     basi point  see exhibit      similar  the spread on key hedg index that refer credit default swap on corpor have also gone up sharpli   for exampl  in juli the spread on three of these major index rose near     basi point   this is illustr in exhibit     the itraxx crossov index refer fifti european nonfinanci name with rate below bbb  or at bbb  and on negat watch   the high yield cdx index refer credit default swap on     high yield u s  name   the lcdx index refer credit default swap on     u s  leverag loan   in contrast to the residenti mortgag sector  corpor credit fundament still look good   in particular  as shown in exhibit    corpor default rate for both invest grade and below invest grade borrow have been at veri low level   of cours  as we saw in the subprim market  readili avail credit can depress default ratio   one should expect that the tighten of credit standard in the corpor sector would generat some rise in default rate independ of other develop   nevertheless  other measur also underscor the posit fundament of the corpor sector   in contrast to the poor fundament in residenti mortgag   for exampl  global growth has been unusu strong with littl volatil  and corpor profit margin are unusu wide  both in the unit state and elsewher   moreov  the slowdown in profit growth expect for the unit state has been milder than anticip   this can be seen in the rise in the median equiti analyst    bottom up earn forecast for the s p     compani for       which is shown in exhibit     it was fall through about april   sinc then  expect for this year have actual increas  and they have been increas recent  even over the past month   so how   one explain the contagion to corpor credit from the subprim market given the dispar in fundament between these two sector   although the answer is complex  one factor stand out   there has been a loss of confid among investor in their abil to assess the valu of and risk associ with structur product  which has led to a sharp drop in demand for such product   the loss of confid stem from mani sourc  includ the opac of such product  the infrequ of trade  which make it more difficult to judg appropri valuat  the difficulti in forecast loss and the correl of loss in the under collater  the sensit of return to the loss rate and the degre of correl  and the problem that the credit rate focus main on one risk   that of loss from default   the clo and cdo market have facilit the transform of low rate paper   for which there is a limit investor appetit   into a high proport of high grade rate debt   for exampl  in a typic clo structur  the under loan qualiti averag a rate of about b   yet through the magic of structur financ and the corpor rate agenc  the result clo tranch are rate predomin invest grade   exhibit   show the structur for a repres clo   more than two third is aaa rate debt  and    percent is invest grade   the loss of confid among investor in the abil to assess the valu and risk associ with this structur product has led to a sharp drop in cdo and clo issuanc   as shown in exhibit    clo and cdo issuanc plummet in juli   this is veri import becaus the clo and cdo market repres the bulk of the demand for non invest grade debt   with this demand fall away at a  e when the forward suppli of high yield corpor loan and debt exceed      billion by some measur  a huge mismatch between demand and suppli has develop   the under problem is that the depth of the market for non invest grade rate loan and debt   exclud cdo and clo demand   is far shallow than the market for invest grade product   where do we go from here    presum buyer and seller in the corpor sector are in the process of find appropri market clear price   but it may take  e for the market to settl down  especi given the august doldrum that are upon us   moreov  we still may have further scope for market disloc   after all  some singl strategi hedg fund that emphas corpor credit may have been caught out by the sharp widen in spread that has occur over the past few week   when such result becom known  investor redempt could follow   lead to forc sell to generat the cash to fund these redempt   in addit  the asset back commerci paper market is veri skittish in two area   structur invest vehicl and extend commerci paper program   ye day at least two commerci paper program were subject to extens   it is not clear whether or to what degre these extens will further unsettl the commerci paper market  but that is clear a risk   the effect shutdown of the cdo and clo market has  in turn  rais question about the sustain of the strong bid by privat equiti firm to conduct leverag buyout   this uncertainti has undoubt been a factor behind the recent weak of the u s  stock market   the import of the buyout bid can be seen in the relat underperform of the russel      index compar with the s p     index dure the past few week  see exhibit       the problem in corpor credit and the virtual shutdown of the clo and cdo distribut mechan have caus investor to reevalu both the busi opportun and the risk associ with larg invest and commerci bank   invest bank and commerci bank share have underperform the broader stock market index   in addit  as shown in exhibit     the cds spread for the major invest and commerci bank have widen consider over the past month   the cds spread for financi guarantor have widen as well  even though the exposur of these firm appear to be concentr in the most senior portion of the subprim and structur financ debt structur   percept of the strength of the financi guarantor could prove import given the key role that they play in some market  such as the municip debt sector  that lie far afield from either the subprim mortgag market or the corpor debt market   onli in the past few week have the problem in the subprim and corpor debt market led to broader risk reduct activ   these risk reduct effort are similar to the adjust that we saw in late februari and earli march   a matrix that show the correl of return across differ asset class over the past few week  see exhibit     look veri similar to the correl matrix that we saw follow the late februari risk reduct period  see exhibit       it look veri differ from the veri calm period we had from late march through the first part of juli  which is shown in exhibit      but the adjust are not uniform across market   in some way  the risk reduct that we are see this  e is a littl more u s  specif  a littl more corpor credit specif  and a littl more mortgag specif   for exampl  as shown in exhibit     impli volatil in interest rate swap   the smove index   and in equiti   the vix index   has climb well abov the late februari peak   in contrast  the foreign exchang market have experienc a less pronounc rise in volatil   in the unit state  the turmoil in financi market has been accompani by a shift in monetari polici expect   exhibit    illustr the eurodollar futur strip   as can be seen  the futur curv has shift down about    basi point sinc the last fomc meet   we are back where we were befor the may fomc meet   current  market price impli a bit more than    basi point of eas by year end        the shift in expect appear to reflect  in part  a reviv of the    downsid risk to growth    idea rather than that the feder reserv will absolut cut interest rate   this can be seen in sever way   the shift in market expect implicit in eurodollar futur yield has not been accompani by a substanti chang in dealer forecast   as shown in exhibit    and     which show the feder fund rate project of the primari dealer befor the june and the current fomc meet  the averag dealer forecast and the rang of dealer forecast have not chang much over the past six week   instead  a gap has open up between the averag dealer forecast  repres in the exhibit by the   circl  and the forecast implicit in market yield  repres by the horizont black line   the most recent dealer survey   not captur the minor forecast chang that occur late last week   for exampl  two dealer with tighten forecast push back the  e of the first tighten  and one dealer with an eas forecast move it closer and increas the magnitud  not shown in exhibit    or       the dealer    forecast are modal forecast   in contrast  the expect embodi in market yield repres the mean of the distribut of expect outcom   presum  it includ some possibl that the current market turbul could lead to a weaker growth outcom and a reduct in the fomc   s feder fund rate target   option on eurodollar futur contract     day forward show a sharp downward skew in the distribut of rate  see exhibit       although the mode is at      percent  the same as it was befor the june meet  the probabl distribut has shift down drastic below that      percent mode   so it may not be correct to say that market particip now expect much more monetari polici eas   instead  a more proper character might be that the percept of downsid risk have reemerg  and this character is reflect in the downward skew below what is still a      percent modal forecast for the eurodollar rate   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the june fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
thank you for a veri good report  bill   are there question   presid pool
i have two question   first    the new york fed have what i might call materi nonpubl inform about firm that would suggest that there is more difficulti than we see in the newspap   that is one question   the other question has to do with the distribut of view among dealer about probabl fed polici   there is obvious an arbitrag relationship between  let   s say  a two year treasuri and these futur market   my sens is that probabl what is go on here   and i will use the two year as the exampl   is a flight to safeti  peopl are tri to shore up their liquid asset in case they have to sell some stock into the market  so they are tri to hold more of that   but there is no easi way for those on the other side of that market to go short and push that yield back to where the best inform peopl think it will be onc we are past this turmoil   so what we may be see is less a reflect of expect about futur polici action than a flight to liquid as a desper effort      desper    may be too strong   to shore up the liquid of a balanc sheet  and there is no easi way for peopl to go on the other side   those are the two question i have
let me take the second question first   you know  it   s certain possibl that  when peopl want to hedg their risk in area where they can   t easili sell the asset  they would buy someth that will perform well if those asset continu to deterior   one thing to do would be to buy eurodollar futur or treasuri secur   so  at least temporarili  those yield may not fulli reflect what the market expect are   that said  the eurodollar market is a veri deep market  and if one thought that the fed was not go to do what the market price in  there certain would be the abil of peopl to take the other side of the bet   so it   s sort of hard to know exact how big or long last the effect that you are talk about could actual be   in the short run  that kind of thing certain goe on   if i can   t sell the bad asset that i hold  then i will buy someth that will perform well if the bad asset deterior   peopl actual do talk about that on the trade side  as far as the issu of materi nonpubl inform that show wors problem than are in the newspap  i   m not sure exact how to character that becaus i guess i wouldn   t know how to character how bad the newspap think these problem are    laughter   we   ve done quit a bit of work tri to identifi some of the fund question surround bear stearn  countrywid  and some of the commerci paper program   there is some strain  but so far it look as though noth is realli immin in those area   now  could that chang quick  absolut   for exampl  one question that we   re follow with bear stearn is what their client do in term of continu to want to do busi with them   obvious  if peopl start to pull back in their willing to do busi with bear stearn  the franchis valu of the compani goe down  and that exacerb the problem   one thing that we have heard about bear stearn is that they have approach a number of major commerci bank about a secur line of credit   we don   t know what the outcom will be  but they are clear tri to get even better liquid backstop than those they have in place today   but as far as we know  they have enough liquid   and countrywid as well at this moment
let   s go back to your previous comment on the second question of presid pool   anoth standard reaction is to sell thing that are more liquid when you can   t unload thing that are less liquid   one thing i am curious about   and i don   t know if we have the data  but this is the question   in term of cdo clo issuanc  do we know how much is held by non u s  investor   for exampl  i have been told   and i don   t know if this is correct   by a senior partner at goldman that  sinc        most of the mezzanin cdos were issu or sold to asian or to european   i   m wonder if we are awar of ani tripwir by which we might have oversea the kind of reaction i just describ  which is sell asset that might be more liquid to cover the illiquid of someth they   re stuck with   i would be interest to do a littl work  if we can  on cdo issuanc and how much is held here   it seem to me to be common sens that  given that surplus liquid has come from abroad   and we have talk about the surplus of save a great deal and the chairman has talk about it a great deal   that may well be where a lot of this risk resid  and we should be awar of it   i would posit that probabl the same is true for asset back commerci paper   it is realli the cdo market not asset back commerci paper that i am most concern about
presid    i have a tini bit of inform in that regard   onc a year there are survey taken of u s  liabil to foreign holder  and they are done secur by secur   we went look for the secur that had been downgrad   by moodi   s i guess it was  or mayb it was both moodi   s and s p   in cdo packag to see if we could find them  we found a certain fraction of them in the survey  which meant that the other that we didn   t find were not held abroad becaus the custodian didn   t report them as foreign own   of the fraction of the secur that were actual found     percent were own abroad  which impli about a    percent ownership of all the downgrad secur   not all of the secur  but all of the downgrad secur   a meaning number   but not a huge number  not    percent  not more than half  but a fraction   were in the survey  of those     percent of the total outstand were what was held abroad   howev  not all countri are forthcom with what they own  and it is certain possibl that the system  sn   t captur all foreign ownership   china  for exampl  is veri unforthcom   but our liabil survey  sn   t depend on their answer the question  it depend on custodian answer the question   so i would say it   s signific  but i think i come away from this inform think that perhap we are exagger a bit how much of it is abroad
it might be interest to look at the issuanc date of those  if we were abl somehow to analyz the issuanc date
this survey  which we basic have receiv just recent  is date june        so there is alway a lag of sever month to a year in the inform that you can get out of this survey   but the survey itself is veri comprehens
where the secur are held abroad is also veri import   if they are held in a hedg fund that is high leverag  that is one thing   if they are held in a central bank reserv account  that is a small loss against all their other asset  so it wouldn   t have ani consequ   so if you talk to the dealer  they   ll say     well  we know whom we sold the thing to initi  but we don   t know what happen after that      i would expect  though  that most of the stuff probabl resid with the initi person becaus  as we have seen  these instrument are not particular liquid and so i don   t think that they pass on that far   if you did a survey of the dealer  you might be abl to make some headway in term of figur out whom they sold them to origin   it might be a fair approxim of where they resid today
i have one other quick question  and that is that i want to make sure i understand what you   re say   it seem to me from this present that this is not just a matter of price  it is also a matter of structur and coven   is that correct
i guess i would character the situat as peopl have lost faith in the structur financ product  especi the high grade aa aaa product that they thought was safe and therefor not subject to much market risk or liquid risk   they found out otherwis  and so there is a total reevalu of that market   as a consequ  sinc the vehicl that was use to turn non invest grade corpor debt and into invest grade debt is sort of broken  now they have to sell a lot of non invest grade debt direct and find peopl who are will to hold it   so i think about the situat as that demand has lessen at a  e when suppli  just by bad luck and  e  is explod   the market should clear  becaus the fundament in the corpor sector are good as oppos to bad  but at a much higher price
thank you for an excel present
the credit deriv swap for countrywid and some of the other mortgag provid spike up veri appreci at the end of last week  and they were accompani by announc that the compani were have no troubl roll over their financ   some of the boston hedg fund manag have observ that one depend correl has been that the announc of no problem seem to be high correl with the actual problem   s occur with a lag of one to two week    laughter   i am curious whether you are worri about the possibl that countrywid and some of the largest mortgag lender might have difficulti in the next two week roll over financ  which would obvious have a broader impact
they certain could   their problem is that they have a veri larg mortgag financ subsidiari and a small thrift   if the mortgag financ subsidiari were in the thrift  then there would be other way of financ all their asset   so far they are abl to maintain their liquid   but a lot of this is about percept  and that could chang at ani  e   the good news about countrywid is that peopl view them as have a strong franchis   they also have a veri larg loan servic portfolio  which might actual be worth a bit more becaus the durat of those mortgag is extend   they are not just a mortgag origin whose busi has evapor  they also have other part of their busi  which i think peopl view as potenti quit valuabl
an excel present  bill   one area that you talk a bit about was the commerci paper market   that made me uneasi becaus this segment is differ from the other segment of the market that you were talk about  and obvious that short term financ is crucial to compani   i wonder if you could expand on your comment there
two area of the asset back commerci paper market are be close scrutin  which mean that a whole bunch of the asset back commerci paper market is fine  such as the asset back commerci paper with backstop   you know  credit card receiv  that area is fine  it is not a problem   one difficult area is the extend commerci paper program that are fund some of the stuff that is veri illiquid right now   the risk is that investor  typic money market mutual fund  will look at the situat and say     gee  if they can   t roll over commerci paper  my commerci paper invest will automat be extend to a longer matur      they are worri about the headlin risk of that   they are also worri   and it is hard to know how worri   that there is no guarante that the extend commerci paper would necessarili trade at par   if it trade below par  then they would have to worri about break the buck  which is the last thing they want to do   so the risk is that the investor  who are quit risk avers in the commerci paper market in this area  will pull back and that veri pull back will caus extens   that is what was happen ye day   appar a coupl of commerci paper program were extend   now    extens mean anyth realli necessarili bad   it is not clear   it hasn   t happen befor  and so we realli haven   t experienc how this extens process is go to work   these program are backstop in various form   at the end of the day  the commerci paper holder should come out whole  but until that is demonstr  you can imagin that the extens could caus other peopl to pull back   so there is a risk of a cascad of extens that has cross all of these extend commerci paper product   that is a risk   you know  it is an interest tension right now becaus the larg investor know that  if they don   t roll  they   ll probabl be extend   so at the current  e  most of them are continu to roll so that they don   t get stuck with extend commerci paper   but this situat is veri fragil day to day  the second area is more complex   structur invest financ vehicl that basic fund pipelin of high rate cdo and clo kind of stuff   i can   t say i fulli appreci exact how this structur work  but basic there is some risk that the collater valu of these structur could fall below certain threshold   in that case  the secur would have to be liquid   again  commerci paper investor are say     do i realli want to see what this mean      so they are pull back from that market as well   of the two  the extend commerci paper issu seem to be the more immedi one in the market   s attent  but the siv asset back commerci paper is also an ongo issu
are there other question for bill   if not  we need a vote to ratifi domest market oper
i move we ratifi those oper  particip   second

thank you  mr  chairman   in put togeth the  book forecast for this meet  we adjust our outlook in five way in respons to the develop that bill   has just describ   first and foremost in term of it implic for real activ  we took on board the implic of the declin in the valu of equiti sinc the june  book   second  we adjust our home price forecast down a notch  both in respons to slight disappoint indic of home price appreci dure the second quarter and in recognit of the bleaker condit in hous market more general  includ the develop in the subprim mortgag market   in all  we took the level of home price down     percent by the end of       with about one third of that amount repres our respons to the incom indic and two third reflect the other consider   in combin and allow for some relat minor offset  the reduct in equiti valu and home price took about    trillion off the balanc sheet of the household sector and weaken our outlook for consum spend through the usual wealth effect channel   third  we further adjust our forecast of real pce to allow for a direct effect of interest rate reset   we es  that     million variabl rate subprim loan are schedul to undergo interest rate reset over the next year and a half   if all these reset were to take full effect  they would result in extra interest payment cumul to about     billion between now and the end of        for sever reason  howev  we think that     billion figur repres a loos upper bound on the like effect of reset on consumpt spend   for exampl  even in today   s relat more hostil financi environ  some household will succeed in refinanc into a prime mortgag with a lower rate  other will sell their properti and becom renter rather than bear the addit debt servic payment  and some who remain in their home with no refinanc will have the financi wherewith to shield their spend from a dollar for dollar reduct in respons to the increas in debt servic payment   in light of these consider  we took consum spend down by half the amount of the reset induc payment   fourth  we adjust down our forecast for new home sale to allow for the unusu restraint that the tighten in mortgag borrow condit sinc the last  book will like impos on the demand for new home   the adjust we made this  e follow similar downward revis in march and june  togeth  these three revis were calibr to unwind the boost to mortgag origin that we think was provid by nonprim lend in      and        overal  we took the trajectori of new home sale down   percent this round   half in respons to the mortgag develop and half in respons to the disappoint pace of sale data for june   have cut the pace of sale  we then also took down the rate of new construct in the forecast to keep inventori of unsold new home from bulg too much further   final  we trim our forecast for invest in equip and softwar a bit on the theori that the increas in spread that invest grade and especi non invest grade firm now are face might reflect greater uncertainti in the busi climat and that they might respond to that uncertainti by be a littl more reluct to invest   to be sure  the econometr evid support this hypothesi is not rock solid  but it did strike us as suggest enough to warrant a modest adjust   all told  these respons to the more hostil financi climat took about   percentag point off our forecast for the growth of real gdp over the second half of this year and next  with about half of that amount reflect the chang work through the tradit wealth channel and the remaind repres the combin influenc of the three less tradit adjust   could the implic of the financi situat for the real economi be even wors than we have built into the baselin   you bet   i almost invari resist the temptat to declar that uncertainti about the real economi is greater than usual  but the current situat strike me as the except that prove the rule   in the    altern scenario    section of the  book  we sketch three situat in which econom activ would be mark weaker than in the baselin   in the first  residenti invest drop    percent relat to baselin by the middl of next year  and home price drop a total of    percent in nomin term over the next year and a half   unpreced in modern  e but not outsid the realm of possibl  as it would mere return the valuat of the hous stock to the level predict by one of the hous price model that we track   the second scenario add a deterior in consum sen ent  give the meltdown in the hous sector an addit vehicl for spill over into consum spend more general   in both of these scenario  financi condit deterior relat to baselin but onli to the extent judg    normal    by the model in light of the weaker overal economi   the third scenario add a further and more virul deterior in financi condit  with a    percent declin in equiti valu and a     basi point widen in the spread on invest grade secur   in the third scenario  we near   though not quit   succeed in generat a recess despit a substanti eas of monetari polici   on the other hand  could it be better   a key object in put togeth this forecast has been to ensur that risk lie on both side of the baselin forecast   for exampl  ye day   s market rebound is a remind that stranger thing have happen than for calm to break out in financi market   one cannot rule out that  six month or a year from now  we will look back on this episod much as we look back on the flare up in februari of this year or as we look back on the stock market break in       with a sens of surpris that the financi event did not leav a greater imprint on the real economi   even if the financi market do not heal themselv quick  consum may prove more will to postpon the increas in the save rate that we have assum in the baselin  busi may aim to build the invest share of gdp back much closer to the level that it attain in the late     s  and home sale may recov more quick than we have assum   a second challeng that we face in put the forecast togeth   more routin than the task of factor in the implic of financi market develop   was to take account of the annual revis to the nation incom and product account  as you know  the bea revis down the growth of real gdp  …  percentag point  on averag  in             and        conveni  this  e around  the bea made onli veri small adjust to their es  of pce inflat   becaus the nipa revis gave us no new reason to revis our previous assess of the pressur in product market  we took our es  of potenti output down in line with actual gdp  therebi maintain the gap between the two at it previous level as of the end of        in line with our custom in year past  we carri the revis to the growth of potenti through into the forecast period   as a result  we now have potenti output increas    percent in both      and        a virtu of the approach that we have taken in revis the suppli side of the project is that it leav most of the variabl you care about undisturb   thank to the bea  inflat is essenti unrevis   becaus we move potenti down in line with actual  the gdp gap and the unemploy rate trajectori are also essenti unrevis   and with real interest rate and the gdp gap about the same as befor  r  is also rough unrevis   in short  if you make your polici decis base on expect inflat and expect resourc util  your polici choic after the revis should be about the same now as they were befor the revis  provid that you see the prospect for resourc util as rough the same now as they were befor the revis   the one variabl that is differ  of cours  in the project as well as in histori  is the growth rate of real gdp   but a convent analysi would view the revis to that variabl as someth you simpli have to accept   not someth you can do anyth about   in a statement that will strike you as reminisc of    other than that  mrs  lincoln       i would summar the nonfinanci news that we receiv dure the intermeet period as have been remark consist with our june project  on the downsid  the most notabl develop  to be sure  was in home sale  both new and exist  confirm the recent step down in hous demand   pend home sale   our most reliabl near term indic of exist home sale   rebound in june  but to a level that is still well below it averag in the first quarter  even so  were it not for the substanti disrupt on the lend side  the portrait of the hous sector that we would be report to you today would be substanti the same as the one we present in june   elsewher  the data on order and shipment of nondefens capit good in june were a littl softer than we had expect   the slowdown in light vehicl sale in juli to      million unit at an annual rate rais a warn flag  but we are inclin at this point to interpret that result as a temporari paus rather than a harbing of much weaker spend ahead   all that said  last friday   s employ report onc again show a littl more momentum in hire than we had expect  and initi claim for unemploy insur in the two week sinc the juli survey week have remain low  give no sign of ani materi deterior in labor market condit   the increas in the unemploy rate to     percent in juli was not a surpris given the moder pace of growth  on averag  thus far this year   moreov  the indic that we have in hand put manufactur ip on track to post a solid increas in juli   all told  the real economi seem to have enter the period of intens financi market turbul with  if anyth  a littl more momentum than we would have project at the  e of the june meet   on the inflat front  the pictur look veri much the same as it did at the  e of the june  book   we still see the bulk of the improv in core pce inflat dure the second quarter as like to prove transitori   in a nod to the relat favor recent month read  we trim our forecast for the second half of this year by     percentag point despit a number of factor that could put slight greater upward pressur on inflat  includ the slower pace of structur product growth  the higher level of commod price  and the uptick of a tenth in the michigan measur of long term inflat expect   next year  as energi price turn down slight  inflat expect remain well contain  and pressur on resourc util eas slight  we continu to have core inflat edg down to a rate of   percent  and we have top line inflat dip slight below the core rate to     percent for the year as a whole  befor come back up in line with the core over the next two year     will now continu our present
the financi market turmoil over the intermeet period has not been confin to u s  market   in today   s financi global world  event in one asset market frequent have consequ in other market and other countri  both the level and the volatil of asset price abroad have move with u s  asset market develop   equiti price are general down  although not in china  yield on long term sovereign fix incom secur are also general down   cds spread  corpor bond spread  embi  spread  and similar measur are general up   with so much action happen in global financi market  you might have expect some major revis to our outlook for foreign real growth and inflat  yet with the except of revis to some second quarter number becaus of surpris from incom data  the baselin forecast this  e is littl chang from that in june   two reason for the lack of signific macroeconom consequ in the rest of the global economi from these financi event seem particular noteworthi   one is that there is no sector abroad in ani of the major region that correspond to the u s  hous sector and it direct tie to credit problem relat to subprim mortgag   the second reason is that we do not observ ani telltal sign  such as overexpans by one or more industri or fragil household balanc sheet  that would suggest that some repric of riski asset and perhap some restraint in credit creation would trigger signific chang in real econom behavior of firm or household   the global economi expand strong in the first half of this year with the under strength broad distribut across region and sector   as a result  it is in robust condit and is like abl to withstand the adjust proceed in financi market without substanti risk to continu real expans or creation of inflationari pressur   of cours  we cannot be certain that continu or more intens disord condit in financi market will not trigger a negat macroeconom reaction  nor do we know for sure that problem are not alreadi present but are not yet visibl to us   so we see the event of the past sever week as give rise to an abund of downsid risk to our forecast of real activ rather than to chang in the baselin   despit a basic unchang outlook for the rest of the global economi  two element of the intern forecast merit some further discuss   global oil market develop over the intermeet period and the staff   s judgment that u s  real import of good and servic will expand at a rate about   percentag point lower than we project in june   on juli     the spot price for wti rose abov     per barrel and attract attent for have reach a new peak valu   although that price subsequ move back down somewhat  the spot wti price was about    per barrel higher on the day we final the  book forecast than it was on the compar day in june   in part  the upward shift in the spot wti price reflect an unwind of most of the unusu discount for wti relat to brent and other grade of oil that persist from mid march until recent as a result of larg inventori of wti at certain locat   by comparison  the spot price for brent crude oil rose near    per barrel over the same interv   the upward pressur on spot price appear to aris from the suppli side  with product restraint by opec a factor  howev  although price move up notic at the front of the curv  futur price for oil date later this year and earli next year move up much less  and futur price for crude oil in late      and beyond actual move down   as a consequ  the oil futur curv return to what is call    backward     mean that the spot price is abov futur price  which tend to flatten out at more distant date   put all this togeth  our forecast for the u s  oil import price is more than    per barrel higher for the veri near term than it was in june  but it is littl chang over        so the impact of higher oil price on our trade deficit is limit  wherea some upward push to consum price abroad might result from the recent increas in crude oil price  our expect  base on futur market  that they will prove transitori mean that few sustain pressur on inflat should result   our forecast for the growth of total u s  import of good and servic has been revis down about   percentag point for the second half of this year and near that much for next   the result annual growth rate of    percent in the near term and   percent next year are about   percentag point below the growth we are project for real export of good and servic   although in the near term slight weaker project import for oil and natur gas are part of the stori  further out weaker growth in import core good and servic larg account for the revis   for these two categori  the downward revis reflect the chang in this forecast to the project level of the dollar and to the path for u s  real gdp   we have made some small adjust to our outlook for the constitu currenc in our broad dollar index that by chanc are offset  leav the staff forecast for the rate of depreci of our real broad dollar index go forward about the same as in june   howev  the depreci of the dollar that has alreadi occur sinc your june meet result in a downward shift in the current quarter start valu for our forecast path of about    percent   that real depreci work to restrain import of core good and of servic somewhat  especi in the near term  parenthet  it also has a s ul effect on our export of core good and servic   the lower path for u s  gdp growth go forward is the primari explan of our downward revis to project import growth   with u s  gdp now expect to grow at an annual rate of   percent  rather than     percent  import of both core good and servic deceler more than in proport  as our best es  of the incom elast for each of these categori is abov     of cours  the baselin path for u s  real gdp take into account the lower import and the simultan natur of the determin of gdp and it compon   but the inform contain in the annual revis to past u s  gdp growth and the prospect of lower potenti gdp go forward was    news    to our import model and led us to make the downward revis i have just describ   with growth of real export of good and servic revis up onli slight  their posit contribut to real gdp growth is just a bit more posit   in contrast  the negat contribut from real import is now signific smaller in absolut valu   as a result  the overal arithmet contribut from real net export to real gdp growth over the forecast period is posit at an annual rate of about   percentag point   such an outcom would mean that real net export have contribut or will contribut posit to real gdp growth in each of             and        from the perspect of real gdp  a posit contribut from real net export is one veri reason criterion for extern adjust  should it be sustain     will now continu our present
i will be refer to the handout label    materi for fomc brief on trial run project      as in shown line   of the top panel of exhibit    the central tendenc of your current forecast for real gdp growth for the second half of      is     to     percent   combin with the bea   s es  of     percent growth in the first half  your project impli a central tendenc for the year of     to     percent  down     percentag point from the june trial run   the growth rate for      and      were revis down by a similar amount and now center on about     percent   as can be seen by compar row   and    the central tendenc of the project for the unemploy rate at the end of             and      are essenti the same as in june   the downward revis to real gdp growth togeth with the unchang forecast for unemploy suggest that  like the staff  mani of you revis down your es  of potenti gdp growth about   percentag point  still  as in june  fomc particip general are a bit more op ist than the staff about potenti growth   inde  mani of you made those point in your forecast narrat   as shown in row    the central tendenc for core pce inflat for the second half of      is     to     percent   togeth with the     percent rate for the first half  this impli a central tendenc of     to     percent core inflat for the      as a whole  down slight from the june project   the central tendenc for the next two year are near ident to those in june  with the midpoint edg down over  e   the central tendenc for total pce inflat  line    collect for the first  e in the current exercis  are similar to those for core inflat for      and        the central tendenc of your project for core inflat this year and next lie just below the correspond staff forecast  and the central tendenc of your project for unemploy late this year and next are also just below the staff forecast   these comparison suggest that mani of you have a somewhat lower es  of nairu than the staff   s es  of     percent  a point that some of you made explicit in your narrat   in earlier discuss of the role that your project might play in enhanc the committe   s communic  some of you note that extend the  e horizon for your project would give the public more inform about your es  of potenti gdp growth and your judgment about op  or accept trend inflat   to the extent that argument is correct  the     percentag point rang of your project for gdp growth in       shown in line   of the middl panel of exhibit    suggest notic dispers in your view of potenti growth  though those growth rate may also be affect by project adjust toward inflat rate that you see as desir   the rang of your project for total inflat in       line    is not quit as wide  suggest somewhat greater common in your view about the rate of inflat consist with price stabil  and the rang for your core inflat forecast in       line    is a bit narrow  remain at     to   percent     materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     as shown in the bottom panel  most of you again character the appropri path for the feder fund rate as broad similar to the  book assumpt   as in june  a few of you assum a modest lower path for the feder fund rate  evid reflect expect of more favor aggreg suppli condit than in the  book forecast  while two assum an increas in the fed fund rate later this year or earli next year  follow by a reduct  to fo  more disinfl   exhibit   summar the result on uncertainti and skew   you were ask to character your judgment of the uncertainti attach to your project relat to level of uncertainti over the past twenti year and to indic your judgment of the risk weight around your project   as shown in the top two panel  about two third of you see uncertainti about growth as broad similar to that experienc histor and see the risk around your growth project as broad balanc  compar with the situat in june  howev  a few more of you see greater uncertainti than histor  and a few more view the risk as tilt to the downsid  similar  with regard to the outlook for unemploy  not shown  notic more of you than in june see the risk as tilt to the upsid   with respect to core inflat  the middl two chart show that almost all of you again judg that the uncertainti attach to your project is similar to past level  while the number of you who see the risk as tilt to the upsid edg down   as shown in the bottom panel  your judgment about the uncertainti and risk for total inflat are near the same as those for core inflat   i would like to end on a person note   as the chairman note

staff have been proud to be associ with you   we will miss you   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   we   re now open for question for the staff  presid
i note     s comment about the global interlinkag with financi market  and i have a simpl question for mayb     in term of the altern scenario that was sketch for greater hous correct to spill over to confid in financi market  in that discuss and in that model or simul  when you talk about equiti price  stress in the debt market  and further weak in aggreg spend  are you talk about the unit state onli
are there other question   presid
when you were describ the implic of the gdp revis for your assess of the output gap  you said that you essenti mark down potenti by the same amount as realiz growth recent base on your assess of pressur in product market   in case we want to tri it at home  i was wonder if you could say a littl more about what data that assess of pressur in product market reli on
it reli on a varieti of consider  but ul  i would say it reli on inflat perform   one way that we have of assess whether our gaug of resourc util are move off track is to look back and see whether our inflat model that incorpor those measur of resourc util are overpredict or underpredict   it   s an imperfect mechan  to be sure  becaus the impuls from resourc util to inflat is veri weak  therefor  an error in es  on our part of the pressur on resourc util would show up in a discrep in the inflat project that could easili be lost in the nois   but that   s probabl the main approach that we take to attempt to gaug ul  whether or not we   re off base   in put togeth our assess of the output gap  we also attempt to maintain some align of that measur with the gap between the unemploy rate and the natur rate or the nairu   our analysi of the nairu factor in as well a more fundament inspect of thing like demograph influenc  includ disabl rate and the age composit of the popul   so there is an effort to bring to bear an independ analysi of some of the econom determin that might be move the nairu up or down
i guess my question was motiv by my sens that es  of the current output gap tend to play an import role in your outlook for near term inflat trend   to the extent that the current es  of the output gap is deriv from current inflat  i am wonder if it provid less independ inform than current inflat about futur inflat than one might otherwis have thought
i would make two remark regard that   first  quantit  in fact  the output gap  sn   t play a veri larg role in shift our project of inflat   if one   a sort of retrospect decomposit of the factor that were generat inflat over the past ten  fifteen  or twenti year  dure the period of the great moder  gap in resourc util are at most a modest contributor to the varianc in inflat   econometr speak  a veri import determin of inflat variabl is just shock that push inflat and that our model has no readi attribut for   so they are not direct attribut to relat energi price movement  relat import price  resourc util  or inflat expect  but just stuff happen that move inflat around   so your point is correct in principl  but quantit  i think it has a veri modest influenc on our current project   second  we enforc a good deal of smooth so that we are not  by ani mean  soak up the residu in the inflat equat that emerg in one period by say     oh  that must have reflect a variat in potenti output growth    in order to drive the residu to zero   we are allow that residu to persist and to inform our assess of potenti output growth onli over  e and with an accumul of evid
other question   we   ll begin our econom go round then  for presid     s benefit   as you probabl know  if we have a comment or a question for a speaker  we use a two hand symbol for an intervent   i would like to begin the go round today with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the seventh district have chang littl sinc our last meet   we continu to lag the nation larg becaus of difficulti in the auto industri   our contact thought that the u s  economi had soften a littl sinc june but that intern sale continu to be strong   they also voic continu concern about input cost pressur   there is no good news to report on residenti construct  some of my contact again push back their expect on when hous market would begin to improv and are now say later in        we did hear some upbeat comment from our director about nonresidenti construct in the district  but manufactur of heavi equip indic that they were see less demand for product that are use in nonresidenti construct   we also heard some less op ist report about consum spend   a major shop center develop and oper scale back his expect for the second half of this year and now think that spend will be softer than in the first half   in addit  a larg nation specialti retail saw a broad base slow in it sale over the past six week   still  no one was over pessimist   in our own forecast  we assum that the weak in consumpt relat to trend dure the second quarter was larg transitori  perhap a reaction to the run up in gasolin price  regard the motor vehicl sector  the major topic of discuss is the current labor negoti and the possibl of a strike in septemb   i get the sens that the odd of a walkout are small becaus both the automak and the uaw think that a strike would be veri damag   as our director who head the michigan afl cio note  a strike would be mutual assur destruct   the uaw realiz that the negoti are occur against the backdrop of veri bad econom condit in the tradit automak region   for exampl  sinc       michigan has lost         job   that   s an     percent declin in employ   a strike would be seen as just ad to these econom woe   so from all my discuss with manag and labor  my impress is that the climat for chang under these negoti is stronger than it has been in the past  but i am not sure how big a move the uaw leadership think it can get approv by it member  of cours  the major develop affect the forecast sinc the last round is the turmoil in credit market that we were talk about earlier   our director who run a major privat equiti firm made a number of interest comment regard the difficulti that bank were have sell off loan that had been made to riski borrow with extrem benefici term  such as coven lite and an option to accru interest charg   the bottom line is that he thought that after the current shakeout there would be fewer buyout and that price and term would becom more reflect of risk   go forward  it seem like that the market will favor so call strateg buyer  the nonfinanci firm that are look for acquisit that would direct enhanc the effici and scale of their busi oper   so while we are concern about the negat implic of tighter credit condit  market may now do a better job in price the tradeoff between risk and return  which is a posit develop  so how might these financi develop affect the real economi   if sustain  the fallout of credit market jitter on the stock market and other asset would weigh on spend through the standard wealth effect channel   with regard to the credit market themselv  the key question is how mani of the deal that are now be cancel or scale back would have result in an expans of busi activ as oppos to simpli transfer ownership   given the modest chang in interest rate on higher rate debt  continu growth in c i lend  and ampl intern fund of nonfinanci firm  the cost of capit for most invest project probabl has not risen substanti   so the first order effect on spend will like be limit  of cours  this could chang quick in the current volatil market  and we will need to monitor these develop care  or should i say you will need to monitor these develop care    laughter   howev  right now  put all these factor togeth  we view the develop in credit market as a risk to the near term forecast but not a reason to lower the outlook for growth veri much   that said  we  like the  book  have mark down our assumpt concern potenti   we now see potenti as a bit abov     percent   howev  relat to potenti  our forecast for real activ is not much differ from last round   we see growth averag close to potenti in the second half of        which is stronger than the  book  but run a touch below potenti in       and        which is similar to the  book  our inflat forecast also has not chang much sinc june   we still see core pce price increas a shade below   percent by        but i must say i remain concern about the inflat forecast   the standard list of upsid risk   the lack of resourc slack  cost pass through  inflat expect   these could break the wrong way and requir a polici respons   so  if potenti output growth is  in fact  signific lower than our earlier assess  then you could face some challeng in calibr polici as the economi and econom agent adjust to the lower trend in product growth
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   data on inflat dure the intermeet period have continu to be encourag  but the prospect for econom activ have becom dicier   the result for gdp in the second quarter as a whole actual took on a posit tone  with final sale main account for the healthi growth rate   but the quarter end on a weak note  with disappoint data for hous consumpt and for order of core capit good   of cours  the big develop sinc our last meet were in financi market   i read them as point to weaker growth go forward and greater downsid risk   the market for mortgag back secur is now high illiquid  and there are indic that credit problem are spill beyond the subprim sector   it thus seem like that lend standard will tighten for a broader class of borrow in the mortgag market  the drop in equiti price and rise rate on most riski corpor debt are further negat for growth   there are some offset to these negat factor  includ the declin in the dollar and  most import  the steep reduct we have seen in risk free rate   on balanc  howev  i expect these offset to be onli partial  provid a cushion against futur weak  becaus i interpret the declin in treasuri rate dure the intermeet period primarili as a reflect of weaker growth expect and a correspond lower path for the expect futur fed fund rate and not a consequ of the fall of the term premium   the jump in oil price sinc our last meet is a further factor weigh on aggreg demand   as a result of these consider  i have lower my growth forecast for the second half of this year    percentag point  to just over   percent   this rate is moder below my es  of potenti growth  which i now put at about     percent  go beyond this year  the outlook depend on one   s assumpt concern appropri monetari polici   i consid it appropri for polici to aim at hold growth just slight below potenti to produc enough slack in labor and credit market to help bring about a further gradual reduct in inflat toward a level consist with price stabil   bar a more serious and prolong tighten of credit market condit or a general liquid squeez  i would keep the fed fund rate modest abov it equilibrium level to accomplish this goal  howev  i now see the fed fund rate as well abov the neutral level   so i think it like that the fed fund rate will need to fall appreci over the next few year   my assess of the neutral feder fund rate declin dure the intermeet period for two main reason   first  becaus of the tighten in financi condit associ with the reassess of risk now take place and  second  becaus of the nipa revis  which suggest slower structur product growth and  in all likelihood  correspond slower growth in aggreg demand   i thus think that a larger declin in the fed fund rate will be need over  e than in the  book baselin to achiev a soft land  a key develop dure the intermeet period was the downward revis of real gdp growth over the         period   this adjust reinforc the work of product expert at the board and elsewher who had previous found evid of a slowdown in under product growth   the revis in actual product was big enough to lead us to lower our es  of growth in both structur product and potenti output  although our es  remain abov those in the  book   in addit to tighter financi condit  lower structur product growth was the reason that we lower our forecast for real gdp growth to    percent in        as a result  the unemploy rate edg up in our forecast  reach near   percent by the end of next year   the modest amount of slack that this entail should help bring about the desir gradual reduct of inflat in the futur  read on core pce price have been quit tame for some  e now  rise onli     percent in each of the past four month   although a portion of the recent deceler in core price like reflect transitori influenc  the under trend in core inflat still appear favor   we anticip that the core pce price index will rise   percent this year and that core inflat will gradual ebb to around     percent over the forecast period   this forecast is predic on continu well anchor inflat expect and the eventu appear of a small amount of labor market slack  as i just mention  for some  e now  i   ve thought an argument could be made that the nairu was a bit lower than assum in the  book  and the new evid that structur product growth has been lower than we thought for more than three year reinforc this view   it mean that the relat good inflat perform over this period occur despit the upward pressur that must have been oper becaus of the deceler in structur product   in ani event  i also expect to see modest downward pressur on inflat in the next coupl of year from the eb of the upward effect of special factor  includ the declin in structur product  energi and commod price  and owner    equival rent  in term of risk to the outlook for growth  the hous sector obvious remain a serious concern   we seem to be repeat surpris with the depth and durat of the deterior in these market  and the financi fallout from develop in the subprim market  which i now perceiv to be spread beyond that sector  is a sourc of appreci angst   of cours  financi condit have deterior in market well beyond those connect with subprim instrument or even residenti real estat more general   it appear that particip are question structur credit product in general  the risk assess of the rate agenc  and the extent of due dilig by origin who packag and sell loan but no longer hold a veri sizabl fraction of these origin on their own balanc sheet   the  book has long highlight  and we have long worri about  the possibl and potenti consequ of a broader shift in risk percept   with risk premium have been so low by histor standard  it would hard be surpris to see them rise  make financi condit tighter for ani given stanc of monetari polici   while it remain possibl that financi market will stabil or even revers cours in the day and week ahead  the possibl that the financi market are now shift to a histor more typic pattern of risk price is veri much on my radar screen  should this pattern persist and possibl intensifi  it will have veri import implic for polici
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  at the past few meet i have spoken about my district as have strong growth   i have ask question about the strength of the growth in the nation economi  and i have describ the global economi from the standpoint of the way the staff here write about it and the way we do our own work as    hotter than a    pistol      noth has realli chang sinc my last intervent   i would note that  unlik presid     s district  our district is unusu on the other side   we are not experienc the kind of declin in home price that is be experienc elsewher   we   re suffer from widespread labor shortag  for both unskil and skill labor   we believ that we are see signific labor hoard in our district   unemploy is strike and histor low in the two major citi of dalla and houston at     percent  in austin at     percent  and along the border area unpreced in the low singl digit   salari for account in our district are up   to   percent   law firm   i note that there are     million lawyer in america and     million peopl who work in the auto industri from part to final assembl  which is a statement on our societi    laughter  are rais first  and second year annual compens by doubl digit for their new lawyer   so there is still price inflat in the servic sector   we perceiv  through our discuss with ceo around the countri  that while there has been a net downward movement in the more robust measur of price inflat   the trim mean   there still are some threat on the inflat front   for exampl  the ceo of wal mart usa told me ye day that  intern  when they evalu their compar store measur  the comp are be driven by inflat  not by volum   as for the demand for ship   if you read the wall street journal ye day or from the interview i have had with larg shipper  the bulk carrier are trade at record high   the baltic index is at a record high  driven by export of iron ore  pulp  and other product to voraci chines demand and by the return of export from china to a voraci european demand   contain shipment are up    percent year over year in term of european import  the price pressur be exert there seem to be invad other area   one of the more interest observ was what has happen recent in term of the price of paper product be led by sca  which is a european corpor   kimber clark and the other have fallen in line   they are ask for doubl digit increas   so although we are see some mitig of price pressur  i am nonetheless concern that  given the intern dynam  we still have the potenti for price increas and a bit of resist to what i would like to see  in term of econom growth nation  i just want to comment on some thing that the staff present   i thought the  book was excel   i did speak to two of the five largest public held builder   they report that all in  with incent  their price have been mark down an averag of    to    percent from a year ago   those are signific number   for exampl  in the imperi valley of california  home sell for          to          have been now mark down to          to            the builder with the most experi   forti year of experi   who has live through all kind of cycl is of the strong belief that we are in the second year of a five year correct   like the point that you made  presid    this is of great concern   so net from the dalla fed standpoint  we have lower our expect for second half growth to   percent   we are still concern  despit the encourag of margin movement  on the inflat front   i   d like to leav the discuss of the economi there and just turn to the previous discuss we had and the refer made by presid   and presid    this may be a bit harsh  but if you look at the front page of the wall street journal from this morn  i see what i call the    churchillian maxim    at play  which is     i shall fare well in histori becaus i shall rewrit that histori      whether you use greg ip to rewrit the histori or you rewrit it yourself  no amount of rewrit of histori will exoner us if we are not prepar for the more dire scenario that were present by the staff   i would ask that we do some scenario prepar in term of  should we encount increas financi market turbul  what action we might take to deal with it   for exampl  it is not clear to me that a widespread open of the discount window solv the problem given the structur of what i call    ersatz credit    that is then spread throughout the system   it   s not clear to me that even deal  for purpos of the present meet  with the fed fund rate is the issu becaus it is not an issu of just price in the marketplac   it   s a structur issu  and it   s a coven issu   it   s an avail issu  i start my career  mr  chairman  with herstatt    laughter   that was not an auspici begin   i live through the correct of the s l market  portfolio insur  the crash of               and so on   when you sort through them  all of them have a common basi  and that is a search for greater yield or greater return  leverag in order to achiev that return  and some assumpt of risk mitig lead to what i call    ration complac      i believ that   s at play present   i agre fulli with presid   that it present a signific risk   howev  i want to exercis great caution in interpret these signal   i think we have to be extrem care about what we do and what we say   just to show my hand  i would not be in favor of cut the feder fund rate at this junctur   i think we have to analyz the languag care  but my request is that  in addit to our exercis on communic  we take a serious look at the various scenario that might obtain  so that no one could ever accus us of be unprepar in case the worst obtain   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  presid     just to respond veri briefli  we do have a group here at the board work with other economist and financi expert throughout the system that   scenario analysi and   monitor the market  and we certain are quit attun to these issu
thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the report that i am hear from busi leader in the fourth district lead me to conclud that the pace of econom activ hasn   t chang a great deal sinc our last meet   howev  the uncertainti surround the busi climat seem to have risen measur   the troubl hous sector is still weigh on the region  as it is nation   i now have littl doubt that this theme is go to recur throughout the balanc of the year and perhap well beyond   my view of the hous sector conform close to the way hous is depict in the  book baselin  but i have had mani convers in the past few week with anxious industri insid  who believ that hous market are like to worsen substanti over the balanc of the year with the possibl of signific spillov to other sector of the economi   the stori they tell me sound a lot like the greater hous correct scenario that are depict in the  book   inde  casualti in the mortgag market are rise  and i am hear more and more that the fallout from hous is affect deal in other sector of the economi   for exampl  i talk with a ceo who run a larg nation real estat develop compani   he told me that some of his project are be held up by his invest banker   s inabl to price deal and to bring them to market   where the deal can be price  risk spread have widen across a rang of issuer and financi instrument   this ceo   s comment are veri much in line with the point that bill   made in his report earlier this morn  becaus of these uncertainti in financi market  some of my contact confirm that they have been reevalu their capit format plan   they are trim their project of some of the project that they are go to put on the book  and that led me to trim my project for busi fix invest accord   even with this adjust  howev  i am concern that the pattern of busi invest that i have incorpor into my gdp project for this meet may still be somewhat op ist   this is a risk to the outlook that was not on my radar screen at our last meet  the june retail price measur gave us more evid that the inflat trend may be come down   inflat moder in the second quarter  as measur by the median cpi and the    percent trim mean that we produc at the cleveland fed   i am not yet persuad that this progress will be sustain  but the pattern in the june data were promis   my project for inflat in the outyear of the forecast are actual a littl more favor than what is in the  book baselin  primarili becaus i still expect a bit more potenti gdp growth than the  book envis   so i am feel more comfort about the inflat risk than i have felt for a while but less comfort about the real side risk   my overal risk assess is move closer into balanc   nevertheless  i still think that inflat is the predomin risk we face today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  as best i can judg  recent read on the economi are general consist with anticip of moder growth and some gradual diminut or at least no deterior in inflat   second quarter gdp read  as far as i can tell  contain no big surpris   in particular  the compon of aggreg demand that were expect to bounc back after period of sluggish or  in some case  correct   inventori accumul  spend on equip and softwar  and feder govern outlay   all in fact did bounc back as anticip   the labor market report for juli was posit  and anecdot and indic in our district are general quit consist with the tenor of that report   the labor market appear to be healthi   job avail appear to be ampl   the labor market overal  i would say  is strong  of cours  all of that is by way of background becaus that inform has been overshadow in recent week by what i think are three or four develop of greater signific  one of which is the revis to the nipa account   the gdp and product data and  in particular  the downward revis to product may have signific implic for the longer term perform of the economi   i won   t dwell on that now   dave   cover some of that earlier   there was also an upward revis to the person save rate  which possibl has implic for the outlook for consum spend go forward  and i will come to that briefli in a moment   of cours  the big headlin have been the turbul in the financi market and all the uncertainti associ with the durat of the repric and the adjust that are under way and their quantit signific for the perform of the economi go forward   this turbul in the financi market is like the most signific develop for the short term perform of the economi and possibl for polici   but at this point  it is veri difficult  to put it mild  to assess it effect for reason i allud to earlier   name  that we don   t know how long this will last and what will follow in it wake   even if we knew the durat  would we be   at least would i be   all that confid that we could go from that to the magnitud of the effect on the economi   so all of that suggest to me that we should have a good deal of caution at the moment   sinc we don   t  it seem to me  know enough to act decis  we certain don   t want to overreact or to act wrong in these circumst   these develop realli have taken hold forc in the past sever week   the situat has not been so dramat for ani extend period of  e  return to the save rate for a moment  i am quit cautious about draw implic for consum spend on the basi of a judgment about whether the save rate is like to go up or down   an argument has been popular in some circl that  with the negat save rate as report until recent in the data  the implic for consum spend were like that spend was go to be sluggish go forward becaus the negat save rate couldn   t persist   it seem to me that the argument now  at a minimum  has to be less compel  and so  other thing be equal  we might be tempt to becom more op ist about consum spend   that could be swamp  of cours  by the negat wealth effect come out of the adjust in the financi market and the tighter financi market condit as well   on net  i guess i come out where i usual do on this   that it is most a matter of employ and incom   and so far so good on that score  final  and this is the fourth develop that i will mention   although i don   t think it   s as import as the other three  but i did want to comment on it   it look as though  as part of the revis to the nipa account  the increas in unit labor cost will be revis up for the previous three year   that is  for               and         i think that   s right   now  this is a matter of correl and not causat  but it   appear that there is a pretti high correl in the short run between unit labor cost and inflat   that observ flash a bit of a warn light on our expect of a fundament slow of inflat over  e   thank you

thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the news in the third district has been general posit   econom activ continu to expand in the tri state area but at a less rapid pace than at our previous meet   our busi outlook survey indic that the district   s manufactur output continu to expand in juli  although at a somewhat slower pace than in june   the june measur  you may recal  was more than    in our busi outlook survey  the highest level that it had been sinc april        in juli the index drop to a littl over    although it was still signific posit   shipment of new order increas in juli  and the outlook for manufactur    own capit spend plan remain posit and is at a level typic of an expans   firm in our survey general see improv in their busi come in the second half of the year   residenti construct  howev  continu to be veri weak in the region  but we have not seen  at least accord to ofheo index  ani absolut price declin in our area  this is confirm by our busi contact  who report that they have not seen steep or broad base declin in hous price  except for properti along the jersey shore  where the boom was most preval   at our last meet i character the nonresidenti invest market as firm  and that character continu today   offic vacanc rate in the philadelphia region remain veri low and declin  and rent in offic and warehous space remain at a record high   although report on retail sale in our region have been mix  sale appear to have improv somewhat in late june and earli juli  especi at higher end retail establish  bank lend has continu to advanc but at a more moder pace than at the  e of our last meet   our bank and other busi contact indic that bank have money to lend to custom with good credit rate  and so i don   t get the sens that area busi are face a credit crunch of the normal type   bank are comfort with their lend standard and do not expect to make ani big chang along this dimens in the forese futur   for the most part our bank were not in the subprim busi and obvious don   t intend to start now   laughter  and thus they have not seen an appreci deterior in their balanc sheet or in those of the busi to which they lend   their custom   clear  there is nervous  but as yet there seem to be few consequ for the real economi  june employ growth in the region was below trend  but the region   s unemploy rate remain relat low   our staff expect employ to continu to grow at a moder pace go forward and expect the region   s unemploy rate perhap to rise modest by the second quarter of next year   yet busi continu to report tight labor market   one veri larg builder  who is headquart in our area and who build most high end home  has actual report that he cannot finish a number of home that he has under contract and that buyer are wait to move into   he cannot find labor   becaus of the crackdown on illeg immigr  who do a lot of the landscap  a lot of roof work  and all the labor that goe into finish these home  he cannot hire these worker  and so he actual has to put off close deal becaus he cannot find worker to complet the home  on the inflat front in the district  employ cost in the northeast are increas at about the same pace as in the nation   area manufactur continu to report higher product cost  but there is relat littl evid of pass through of those higher cost to custom as they see it   consum price are grow more slowli in the region than in the nation   so in summari  the third district economi continu to expand at a moder pace   while there is nervous caus by the recent volatil in the financi market  busi do not yet see that affect their current growth or prospect for futur growth   busi contact as well as the philadelphia staff expect this moder pace of expans to be continu in the come month  at the nation level  the news has been mix   on the posit side  employ and incom growth remain solid   manufactur output continu to improv  and core inflat and inflat expect remain contain  although both remain higher than i would like to see in the long run   on the negat side  news on busi fix invest and hous has been disappoint   after encourag sign of stabil earli in the year  the sale of both new and exist home have continu to declin   sale of home declin     percent in june and almost   percent in the second quarter   at the  e of our last meet  i express the view that i was get hope that economi was on track to return to near trend growth later this year   set asid the issu that our percept of long term trend growth in real gdp may need reassess in light of the benchmark revis  as we   ve been discuss   and i   ll return to this point in a moment   the recent data on hous are suggest of a weaker third quarter and perhap fourth quarter as well   though i think the under steadi state demand for hous is lower than the pace of hous demand befor we saw the downturn begin  which impli that much of the adjust in hous suppli is part of a healthi adjust to a new equilibrium  the stock of unsold home continu to caus a drag on residenti invest   i also think that there is some risk of temporari weak in busi fix invest go forward simpli becaus of increas uncertainti   so the return to trend growth  which i think will happen within the forecast period  may be delay by a few quarter and may not get under way solid until late in the first half of next year   you know the old say      if you can   t forecast well  forecast often       laughter  the biggest econom news headlin sinc our last meet have focus on the volatil of the financi market and the repric of risk   i am inclin to put minim weight on the current financi condit for a slowdown in the pace of econom activ go forward   although risk spread have widen in the past three week or so  the cost of capit for high qualiti borrow has hard chang and remain relat low by histor standard   this suggest to me that what we are see in the marketplac   at least right now but which could chang  as we   ve all note   is a chang in the relat price of various measur of type of risk   the cost of capit for some borrow is increas  but demand for busi invest that origin from larg corpor with good credit rate has not chang and is not like to be advers affect veri much in the repric of risk  if that   s what this repres   this news was reinforc to me by my convers with area banker  as i mention earlier  who say that they have plenti of money to lend to good credit risk   there is no evid of a general credit crunch from their point of view  my general view regard the limit natur of the credit repric is reinforc by the fact that default rate on auto loan  credit card  and other type of consum debt instrument have not chang much  suggest that the spillov effect  at least to date  have not been veri measur  thus  i think that the declin in the subprim market is primarili a result of lax underwrit   those lender are now pay the price  but we must be veri care not to act or appear to act in a way that support bad bet or lax underwrit standard without more widespread evid of system problem affect the real economi  let me now turn to what i think is a more fundament factor for gaug the strength of the economi go forward and  therefor  the appropri stanc for monetari polici   in the most recent  book  the board staff revis down the rate of growth of structur product more or less in line with the reduct in real gdp growth  as we have been discuss   it is certain reason to think that this new inform about the pace of real gdp growth dure the past three year contain inform about the rate of growth of structur product go forward  but that is not an infal signal   in my think about how monetari polici need to be set  distinguish temporari decreas in the rate of growth of product from perman decreas is a critic piec of the puzzl   a transitori decreas would not affect the steadi state equilibrium real rate to my mind   but a perman decreas would impli a lower steadi state equilibrium real rate and  thus  a lower natur rate for the feder fund rate   if the equilibrium real rate is lower  hold the fed fund rate constant  of cours  would impli an implicit tighten of monetari polici  i am still grappl with the implic of these benchmark revis for futur product growth   at this point in my forecast  i   m assum that the revis impli a rebenchmark of the growth rate of structur product  but that rebenchmark or that lower of the trend rate of growth of real gdp is not enough so that core inflat can deceler toward price stabil in the next two or three year or so under a constant fed fund rate   but the reduct in the growth rate of structur product   feed through to a somewhat looser requir path of the fed fund rate through      to        in my forecast  appropri polici has the fed fund rate rise to     percent in the first quarter of        hold steadi there for two or three quarter  and then gradual drift down toward a more neutral rate consist with lower inflat expect and lower trend output growth   with this path of the fed fund rate  i expect the economi to return to near potenti real gdp growth in the first or the second quarter of        i expect the hous correct to continu through the first half of       but the drag lessen over the year   i expect the core inflat rate to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year than in the first half  but i expect the economi by      to grow near it potenti growth rate  which i now assum to be     percent  about     percent lower than i had last  e  with the unemploy rate close to it natur rate of   percent and core inflat at about     percent  i have two other brief comment i   d like to make about our forecast exercis and some inform i think is relev   we continu to focus on the pce price index  and i have some object to that   i continu to believ that the cpi is a better measur  if for no other reason than that it is more familiar to the public and that it is not revis   we were lucki this  e in the gdp revis that the pce price index was not revis veri much  and i think we run the risk that focus too heavili on a measur that   get revis can caus us some difficulti   i also have some concern about the empir abil of core pce to actual be a veri good predictor of headlin pce inflat at the end of the day   so i am still struggl with our choic of the index there   the other item that i would like to emphas   and it was driven home to me in a meet with some report in the not too distant past   is that i do believ that move toward measur of uncertainti that includ some fan chart would be use   i was hesit at first about that in part becaus get appropri measur of uncertainti that are intern consist across all our forecast and all our model would be veri difficult   yet some  what i would view as veri sophist  journalist continu to confus the issu of the rang of our forecast and our central tendenc with the issu of uncertainti or certainti   they do not understand that our central tendenc is an agreement about what our point forecast is but that it may reveal veri littl or noth about the degre of uncertainti in our forecast   so i think it is veri import that we quantifi that in some way to be clearer and to elimin some of that confus   i   ll stop there   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman
i   m sorri   i see a two hand intervent
could i ask you about the issu of the fan chart   as i understood the propos  the fan chart would be in there  but we would not be produc our individu fan chart
so i think you are absolut right   i strong agre with you that it is import to have someth that is visual dynam to get across uncertainti for mani  mani reason  particular to get peopl to understand that  even when we don   t get it exact right  we may still actual be do a veri good job and then  of cours  to evalu us in a more reason way
well  i am encourag that that is go to be the case
but i think it is a question of nuanc   one of the issu that i wonder about here is that for us to do a communal fan chart would be extrem difficult technic   so the question is how we get across the issu of uncertainti in a veri graphic way  and i think it can be done by produc inform along the line that the propos mention   but i think we will need to see exampl   so i would recommend that the subcommitte or whoever will be involv with the staff give us some differ way of do it so that we can actual get some poll inform on peopl as to whether or not this is effect
that is fine   this point was driven home to me by somebodi who i thought was fair sophist   he saw the central tendenc narrow and thought that therefor we were more certain about what our forecast were
it is not just the media   think about the financi analyst who are write about this all the  e   and they get paid a lot more than we do
the two thing are not complet unrel
no  they are not
if there is a lot of uncertainti  then there will be more diverg of view as well
they could be negat correl actual   just becaus our point forecast converg   not mean that our uncertainti about that forecast is decreas
no  that is true
it just mean that there is more agreement
thank you  mr  chairman   my basic view of appropri polici is littl chang from the previous meet   none of the intermeet develop yet compel me to chang my view that our focus should remain on reduc inflat and inflat expect   the outlook for gdp growth remain accept  especi in view of the recent downward revis in the data and the associ lower of es  of growth potenti   our baselin outlook is consist with that of recent month  but the new concern is obvious the financi market that clear are skittish about spillov from the subprim market and about contagion in credit market spread beyond structur product  evid within the sixth district is consist with this basic stabl and posit outlook   florida is see some notabl spillov from their problem in real estat  but some of these problem are idiosyncrat to the state   for exampl  the widespread inabl to get wind and storm insur   the rest of the district has not seen serious spillov into the broader economi  just like the  book  we view the fundament of the economi to be stabl   although the residenti real estat market may take some  e to stabil  the problem seem general contain   our model suggest slight stronger growth than the baselin  book throughout the forecast period   our trend growth rate has not been reduc quit as much as the  book   s  and our inflat forecast is not as favor   at this junctur  we are not readi to give much weight to some of the more extrem altern  book scenario   we certain recogn more uncertainti and volatil than at the last meet  but we   re still expect result essenti in line with the baselin  book forecast  in the past few day  i have had substant convers with some well posit credit market observ  includ manag of larg invest portfolio  suggest that the skittish of financi market is not like to abat until later this fall   they have suggest that the choppi in financi market will be the rule in the near term and  veri import  that the threshold for what constitut a shock is now much lower than usual   i believ that the correct polici postur is to let the market work through the chang in risk appetit and price that are under way  but the market observ of one of my more strident convers counterpart   and that is not jim cramer  laughter    are worth share   this parti see problem in the subprim structur debt market spread to the clo leverag loan market and  in a knock on effect  to repo and commerci paper market as well as to invest grade corpor credit   this parti point to nonpric ration  commerci paper rollov risk  and general cdo contagion caus by the damag credibl of rate agenc and contract of collater valu   this parti argu that treat the widen of credit spread as normal ignor substanti subsurfac potenti disloc as evidenc by the collaps of american home mortgag corpor   all that said  anoth counterpart note a larg pool of money now on the sidelin that is readi to provid financ for reason deal if price fall low enough   import  a larg portion of this money come from reliabl long term sourc of invest  pension fund and insur compani  notwithstand some descript rhetor  this is not the credit crunch of the late     s  when the tradit financi intermediari were strain for capit   the tradit investor are still out there with substanti liquid  and they are just temporarili on the sidelin for understand reason and  bar further shock  should return to the market in forc later this fall   the disloc in the financi market call for a postur of vigil monitor of develop but noth more for now  regard the balanc of risk  it is earli to materi adjust the weight of gdp downsid versus inflat upsid risk   but i have heighten concern  as mani of you do  about the continu hous sector weak combin with some potenti of credit market turbul in  e affect busi invest and consum confid and therebi the real economi  thank you  mr  chairman

thank you   it   s now         i   m inform the coffe is readi  whi don   t we break until    o   clock
let   s reconven   presid pool   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   at the begin of the break  two of our leader made a special point of indic that i was first up after the break   i guess that was an invit to be fast and quick    laughter   i   ll tri  my overal impress from my busi contact is that thing are more of the same rather than anyth veri much differ   i would note that the financi market upset is too recent to have affect the plan of compani oper in the real economi   obvious financi firm are scrambl   there seem to be someth of a disconnect between my truck industri contact and what i see in the industri product number   the industri product number suggest that good product is rise  i don   t know how they   re move  but they don   t seem to be move by truck   one big over the road trucker say that load are down   percent year over year   the compani has alreadi cut truck capac    percent   he expect anoth cut of   percent by the end of this year   he   s trim capit spend next year for truck   obvious they see the busi as be pretti slack   incident  nobodi is talk about ani particular labor market pressur   anoth big compani probabl best known for the color of it brown truck  laughter  say that the industri overal is flat year over year   it believ that the outlook is somewhat more op ist than recent experi   the intern busi is boom   the asia pacif region is ship an aw lot of good to both the unit state and europ   my contact note someth that i thought was sort of interest   he said that there is some divers from air freight to water transport   i guess becaus of the enorm cost differ  but it suggest that there may be a littl easier inventori situat or someth that is make that divers make sens   this compani is veri much in a cost cut mode becaus they have a big infrastructur  demand is relat slack  and they have a lot of cost built in  and so the onli thing they can do when they can   t build volum in the short run is to cut cost   that compani   s major competitor is much more op ist and has capit spend plan for fiscal        which end in may of next year  up    percent from this year and see a pretti strong busi situat at least go forward  a contact in the restaur industri say that restaur price are rise everywher and volum are fall  but overal busi condit are about the same   the restaur industri has been see that   a contact with a major softwar firm is pretti op ist   pc sale are run at or abov expect   my contact point out particular that the qualiti of receiv has actual improv   they   re not see ani problem with collect on the softwar that they sell  and    percent of the custom are current on make payment   even that is someth of an underes  becaus a lot of purchas initi the payment at the end of a thirti day due period  and so the payment  sn   t come for anoth coupl of day  despit our brilliant electron clear of payment  a comment about the hous industri   obvious the subprim issu is go to have a relat perman effect   it is just chang the characterist of this industri   underwrit was too lax  and that is chang   i think it is somewhat surpris that the builder have not scale back more quick   that they continu to sit on such a larg inventori   part of the reason is that  onc a builder has start a develop and has put all the infrastructur in place   the road  the sewer  the water  and all of that   the onli way to get anyth out of that invest is to complet the subdivis   in addit  a subdivis that stop is a bad signal for prospect buyer becaus they don   t want to move into someth that is sit there most idl   so i think the builder have an intens interest in tri to complet these project   but what that mean  of cours  is that  as they complet those project  they are not initi a lot becaus they   re take  as   point out  some pretti big price concess in mani case  and so they are probabl not go to be initi as mani project in the futur  my own bet is that the financi market upset is not go to chang fundament what   s go on in the real economi   first of all  bank capit is not impair   so unlik in some past case  when loss on real estat impair bank capit and thus affect the lend in area that had noth to do with real estat  i don   t think that   s the case this  e   second  the fact that some lbo deal fall through isn   t go to chang what those compani are produc   the fact that the ownership hasn   t chang  sn   t chang the compani   s profit maxim level of product in the short run   obvious  that could chang  but it seem to me that the best inform that we now have is that this financi market upset is go to settl out and not have major repercuss on the real economi  put the hous part asid   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the fifth district we continu to see moder econom growth  though it has been uneven across sector in recent week  manufactur activ rebound somewhat in june and juli after sever month of weak  with our index show increas in new order and shipment   activ at district servic firm advanc at a steadi pace  with solid revenu growth and a broader pickup in hire   the retail sector  howev  has lost much of the momentum report last month  as soft in big ticket categori continu to constrain revenu growth   on the employ front  district labor market are increas taut  given steadi hire activ and slower labor forc growth   in addit  in contrast to the eighth feder reserv district  contact continu to report rise wage pressur and difficulti find qualifi worker   hous market remain weak across much of the district  howev  commerci real estat activ remain healthi  with steadi demand report for offic and industri space   some contact  howev  have express concern about slower activ in the retail segment of that market   turn to price  our juli survey indic increas inflat pressur   the averag current rate of increas of manufactur    price has move up for both raw materi and finish good over the past few month  revers the declin seen earlier this year  price pressur on the servic side have pick up as well  though expect for futur price eas somewhat in the juli report  at the nation level  we continu to receiv fair good news on inflat   after annual rate of month core pce inflat abov   percent at the begin of the year  we   ve now had four month of read below     but there are still abund reason for caution  as presid    for exampl  note   i   ll mention the  book  which cite transitori factor   apparel and owner    equival rent  for instanc   that have contribut to the recent moder   the pass of these damp forc could well push core inflat back up in the near term   so although i think we have reason to take some comfort from recent inflat number  and i do  i want to wait to see more evid  especi as growth move back toward trend  i still think the prospect for a return to trend growth are reason good  and my assess of trend is still a bit higher than the  book   s  in part becaus i   ve not revis my es  of product growth much in respons to the gdp revis   obvious  there are downsid risk to be concern about  and financi market activ sinc the last meet obvious rais some concern   as far as we can tell at this point  the heighten turbul of the past month is all pretti close relat to subprim and nontradit mortgag and the leverag financ of privat equiti buyout in the corpor sector   these two market segment are relat new  and they repres the latest manifest of the broad  ongo wave of financi innov that we   ve been see over the past few decad   becaus these two market are so young  one would expect particip    risk assess to be more uncertain and thus be more sensit to what is learn from market event and incom news   that said  develop in the past month have certain been quit dramat  and it look less like rapid learn than it   rapid unlearn of what was previous view as known   although that  too  is of cours a form of learn  the implic of these revis risk assess for the econom outlook and for polici depend on whether they affect busi invest or household spend on consumpt or new hous   at this point the answer to that question is not yet clear  but it   s worth note that  by mani measur  corpor credit qualiti seem to remain pretti good by histor standard  and the buyout movement  as presid pool just note  seem to have been more about restructur liabil and govern arrang and less about fund capit spend   so it   s not obvious whi there should be dramat effect on busi invest   what about consumpt   pce was fair soft last quarter  and this soft could be a harbing of more sustain weak   the second quarter soft may well be a one  e phenomenon  howev  reflect both the sharp rise in gasolin price in the first five month of the year and some payback from the strong spend growth in q  and q    moreov  the outlook for household incom look pretti good  with labor market condit fair firm and consumpt gain show no sign of slow down  in addit  household net worth is come off a relat high base   neither of these fundament seem like to be serious threaten by the repric that   s in train  hous  on the other hand  continu to be the predomin area of concern regard real spend  and financi market develop have onli heighten that concern   the  book paint a fair pessimist pictur   the declin in residenti invest acceler over the remaind of year and continu into next  and the inclus of three    greater hous correct    altern scenario suggest that the staff is especi concern  justifi so in my view  with the downsid risk to their outlook   but even though the hous market has definit deterior  the outlook for hous is quit uncertain in my mind  and i continu to think that a more moder declin is also possibl and that hous could be somewhat less of a drag on growth than the  book forecast   at this point  howev  the reassess under way in secondari market regard hous relat credit still has a way to go  and until that process play out  it   s go to be hard to gaug the result magnitud of repric at the retail level   about all i conclud at this point is that the outlook for hous is still aw uncertain right now   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the balanc of risk has chang sinc our last meet   signific  in my view   overal spend by household and busi is weaker   hous  of cours  is signific wors  and the under pace of product growth and potenti growth seem lower   in addit  financi market develop have deterior with a veri broad base increas in risk premium  declin in some asset price  pocket of liquid pressur  and some disrupt in mortgag market and high yield corpor credit market   these develop in financi market  even though they repres a necessari adjust  a general healthi develop  have the potenti to caus substanti damag through the effect on asset price  market liquid  and credit  through the potenti failur of more consequenti financi institut  and through a general eros of confid among busi and household   if this situat were to materi and these effect were to persist  they could have signific effect on the strength of aggreg demand go forward   the process now under way in financi market could take some  e to resolv  and find a new balanc could take a while  we have modifi our forecast in way similar to the chang to the  book   we have a slight weaker second half of       and a slight lower es  of growth in       and        reflect a downward revis es  of potenti growth   our growth number for               and       look rough like     rise to    percent   our inflat forecast is essenti unchang  with core pce inflat moder to slight under   percent over the forecast period   our differ with the  book are not trivial  but they seem well within the somewhat greater uncertainti we now face about the outlook for growth   the negat skew in our view of the risk to the outlook suggest a somewhat downward slope to the path of the fed fund rate go forward  to the appropri stanc of monetari polici  rather than the flat path assum by the  book   so even if financi market condit stabil and credit market  particular the mortgag market  find equilibrium relat soon and start to open up again  the growth risk have shift a bit more to the downsid around the lower expect path   in contrast  if the disrupt in credit market persist and liquid market are further impair  then we face the prospect of a signific weaker path to aggreg demand  inflat risk in our view  howev  remain slight tilt to the upsid  but these type of risk are veri differ   the inflat risk are modest and manag   we character them as skew to the upsid in part becaus of the differ across the committe as to our desir individu long run view about the inflat level  in part becaus of our differ as to what   s an accept period for bring core inflat down to that object  and in part becaus of differ view about the structur of inflat dynam in this economi   the risk to market and ul  to growth are veri differ   there   s a much longer negat tail in term of the rang of potenti outcom  and those risk are go to be harder for us to manag  part becaus they depend on confid   becaus of these differ  i think it   s hard to counterpois these two risk against each other and assess the balanc between them   of cours  as alway  we should weigh each by their probabl  their effect  and our capac to manag those effect   i think that the probabl of a bad inflat outcom has diminish from what we would have said two quarter ago and the probabl of an advers growth outcom has increas   as i said  the latter risk is interest and complic in part becaus it might be harder to manag  i want to make two point in this regard   first  a number of you have said that we want to see more evid of advers effect on aggreg demand befor we chang our view about the appropri path of monetari polici   i don   t realli think that   s the right way to think about this   if we took that approach  we   d inevit be too late   just as we think about inflat risk by look forward and look at expect  we need to be forward look and think about the potenti implic of these dynam of financi market on the growth outlook   the inform we have now about what   s happen in market and about the implic for credit market and ul  for confid and demand is veri stale and uneven   my second observ about this challeng is that what make it hard is part that you are see a combin of thing   you are see a loss of confid in the capac of investor to assess under risk in mortgag market in part becaus of uncertainti about what hous price are go to do and in part becaus of uncertainti about correl in loss across household   you are also see a collaps in confid  as bill describ it  in how to valu complex structur credit product  probabl from the loss of faith in rate and from the chang ahead in rate methodolog and in actual rate  you   re also see the difficulti that investor and counterparti now have in evalu the risk in exposur to financi counterparti  and you   re see in some way reflect all of this a diminish willing to financ what   s relat high qualiti paper   we live in a system in which risk has been transfer much more broad  but a lot of that risk has gone to leverag fund that have much less capac to absorb this kind of shock without face a lot of liquid pressur   the combin of these thing mean that you   re see some impair in the natur dynam by which  when price adjust  you have new peopl come in will to buy at those low price   but these challeng in inform and in diagnos what   s happen in market mean that the process is not work as quick as you might have thought in mortgag and in high yield corpor credit   you can see this sort of skew in the risk reflect  i think sensibl  in the chang of market expect about the fed fund rate   you can see this balanc in the distribut that bill describ  where you see a sharpli negat skew in expect about the path on the downsid  and you see that come also in the context of relat stabil of inflat expect   that shift of mean expect  in the distribut    not come with ani sens that the consequ might be some eros in confid about our capac to keep inflat expect down  now  in term of polici  i person wouldn   t want to lean against the chang in market expect that we   ve seen so far  even though it has move a long way in a short  e   it   s realli import to give ourselv more flexibl than we now have to respond to what could be a rapid deterior overal environ  that   s just pragmat essenti  given that the rang of forese monetari polici action we   re like to confront has broaden veri substanti relat to where we were a quarter ago   the challeng  of cours  is to figur out a way to acknowledg and to show some awar of these chang in market dynam without feed the concern  without overreact  about under strength in the fundament of the economi as a whole or in the financi system   that is a difficult balanc  but i think it requir some soften of the asymmetri in our assess of the balanc of risk now  an advertis in respons to a bunch of point made so far  includ by presid     the morn call that bill     s staff run from new york is a veri good  fair textur prism of what   s happen across these market   they do a good job of tri to integr a bunch of the anecdot and the fact  and it   s the most effici devic ani of us have to check in about that evolv balanc   it won   t satisfi everybodi   s demand to have as much inform as is out there  but it   s a fair effici way to get a pretti good pictur  and so i commend that to you  it   s a realli good  thought  and reason deep collect of wisdom in the market today
thank you  mr  chairman   build on what the vice chairman just said  i have been listen in on that morn call   i   ve found it veri use  and it   s certain an opportun to ask question if you have them  my forecast for the most like outcom for output over the next few year is close to that of the staff   growth a littl below potenti for a few quarter  held down by the hous correct  and the unemploy rate rise a littl further   although some recent data for hous  consumpt  and capit spend have been a bit to the soft side  we need to view those data against the background of a lower path for potenti gdp and recal the tendenc we   ve seen over the past sever quarter for short run of data that are a littl hotter or a littl cooler than we expect   i think this is sort of what it feel like when the economi is run at about   percent  i see a number of reason to think that moder growth remain the most like outcom go forward   first  as presid  n has stress from  e to  e  is the natur resili of the economi  it tendenc to grow near potenti unless someth is push it one way or anoth  if anyth  this resili has probabl increas over the past coupl of decad  reflect more flexibl labor and product market   second  global growth remain strong  support the growth of export   i don   t think this growth should be undermin by the fact that some unknown quantiti of loss in the u s  mortgag market is be absorb by investor oversea  and the recent declin in the dollar will reinforc the effect of good foreign demand for u s  good and servic   third  the most like factor to throw the economi off it potenti is the financi market   my most like forecast assum that the credit market would begin to settl down over come week with some  but limit  net tighten of condit   i   ll return to the subject in a bit  but my outlook in this regard   rest fundament on the veri strong financi condit of the nonfinanci busi sector and commerci bank and my expect that most household account for the vast bulk of consum spend will not find credit avail newli constrain   final  a resumpt of growth in consumpt should be support by moder growth in job and household incom as the rebound in product is limit by the slower path for trend product and as incom share shift a littl toward labor   i also assum that household would not face a repeat of the rise in gasolin price that has taken someth out of recent consumpt demand  then moder growth in consumpt along with good export market should  in turn  support busi invest spend   i expect this path for output to be associ with core inflat remain in the neighborhood of   percent   if energi price follow the path in futur market  total inflat would come down to   percent as well  basic i don   t see anyth in my central tendenc forecast for the economi that would push inflat veri much one way or anoth   the economi produc around it long run potenti  my nairu was    percent   inflat expect as best we can judg are anchor at someth like   percent pce inflat   i   m encourag that the most recent data on price have tend to confirm that core inflat remain fair low   most measur of compens also do not show a mark acceler that might be associ with produc appreci beyond the economi   s sustain level of product   risk around my inflat forecast remain to the upsid  provid that output follow my most like path   util is tight   the recent run up in energi price could still feed through to expect   the damp increas in product growth impli greater pressur on busi cost and margin   histor  nomin wage have tend to respond more sluggish to chang in trend product than do price  and this could be especi the circumst when worker have seen real incom held down by higher energi price and busi profit margin have been high  at the same  e  like mani around this tabl  i think that the downsid risk around the forecast of moder growth and product go forward have increas   for some  e i thought that the risk of a shortfal from our central tendenc outweigh the risk of an overshoot  main center on hous and consumpt   but the financi develop of the last intermeet period have appreci increas those risk   as mani have remark  and bill said so nice  problem have spread from the subprim sector to a good part of the mortgag market more general  includ a sever restrict on securit of nonconform mortgag   some busi credit has been affect   spread are widen across a broad array of instrument and rate   this has occur in an atmospher of great increas volatil and uncertainti  part relat to the question about the price of complex structur credit that weren   t well understood and compound by a loss of confid in the rate agenc   the uncertainti is also a reflect of the percept that activ and price in the hous market have not yet shown ani sign of begin to stabil   i agre that we need to keep our focus on the effect of these develop and the financi market on the economi  not on the distribut of wealth in the financi sector  the relationship of financi market to real activ is multifacet  not easili model with interest rate and stock price  especi when market are reconsid risk   tighten nonpric term of lend  the reduc avail of credit  and simpli the pervas sens of uncertainti about the price of asset and cash flow can also affect spend   in such an environ  it wouldn   t be surpris if busi and household postpon capit invest  i agre that this reassess is a fundament healthi but somewhat messi correct to more sustain term and risk premium   the most like outcom is that it will be limit in durat and effect  and that   s what i assum for my forecast   well capit bank and opportunist investor will come in and fill the gap  restor credit flow to nonfinanci busi and to the vast major of household that can servic their debt   in the end  credit condit will be tighter than they were a littl while ago  for the most part justifi so  and the effect on output will probabl not be veri larg   to be sure  the latest episod come on top of a rise in term premium over the may to june intermeet period   as a consequ  financi condit have tighten notic in the past few month  even abstract from market disrupt of the last week  the feder fund rate has been as high as it has been in part to offset the accommod effect of low volatil and tight term and credit premium   i think that  even in the relat benign adjust scenario  we   ll need to look at whether that rate is still suffici support of econom activ   but in the circumst   that is  the benign adjust   that reassess can await further inform about aggreg demand and further assur that inflat will remain low   i assum an eas of polici in      and      in my project to take account of this   but we can   t know how the market situat will evolv   i also believ that there   s a non neglig chanc of a prolong and veri messi adjust period that would feed back substanti on confid  wealth  and spend   with the rate agenc discredit and market vulner to advers news on the economi  the period of unusu uncertainti could be prolong   the greatest risk is in the household sector  where uncertainti about valuat of mortgag could continu to feed back on credit avail  hous demand  and price in a self reinforc cycl   moreov  as lender and borrow revis assumpt about hous price even further  credit from home equiti line of credit and mortgag refinanc will becom even less avail and more expens  put to the test the hypothesi that i have been work under   that the feedback from hous on consumpt can be approxim by a wealth effect  not someth more serious work through hous equiti withdraw   as i note  i don   t think this is the most like outcom  but this tail of distribut is a lot fatter than it was onli a month or so ago   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of us have discuss around this tabl and mani of you alreadi mention today  it has final happen   per earlier discuss  the much anticip repric of risk is upon us  and i think what we all have quick recogn  then and now  is that the diagnosi was the easi part   more difficult is to figur when the symptom would manifest themselv  harder still is to understand the second  and third order consequ  and perhap most difficult is to determin whether ani treatment is need or whether  as the hippocrat oath suggest  the patient will recov on it own   even order repric have fat tail  as governor kohn mention  and what we find in the marketplac is complac replac veri quick by deep concern   certain  this recent market turmoil look particular pronounc in contrast to previous period when tree appear to grow to the sky and market were price for perfect in a world that seem to most of us to be decid imperfect   let me discuss two distinct matter   first  the state of the financi market  build on the present from bill     and other  and then the harder part  the impact on the broader economi   befor tri to summar the situat  the financi market have realli provid wind at the back of the broader economi throughout this most recent period  even until a month ago   i think the open question  and the hardest  is whether those financi market will prove suffici resili   that is  whether the under shock to the economi that might occur are exacerb by this financi market situat or whether the worst of the outcom are made less sever by the financi market  perhap it is best to review the dynam of differ asset market to assess their implic for credit avail dure the forecast period   the threat is that these differ asset class increas look correl  particular in  e of distress   certain  the event of recent week culmin in trade late thursday and friday of last week are troubl  driven by a combin of factor   first  symbol perhap by one financi institut that has unwit call it own liquid into some question  second  a function of a reduct in confid in market themselv   a pullback in liquid   with consider less trust in under valuat  under collater  and the under structur of market themselv  and third  an expect  at least in the mortgag market  that there is still anoth leg down and so one way bet  at least for a period  appear insuffici to bring other opportunist capit in at this point   the pullback was manifest in the difficulti of roll over extend commerci paper  as bill and other have said  a lack of bid for anyth mortgag relat  a lack of trust in credit rate  and a fear of use financi institut as counterparti   the next period in my judgment hold out some promis  but not a guarante  of opportunist capit   certain  there are big fund rais by invest bank and other privat pool of capit at remark leverag level  give the potenti that the pool of liquid that are on the sidelin could quick find their way back into the game  let me now turn to differ asset market to tri to assess when we will know how they will figur themselv out and make sure that we are abl to get some judgment befor it is too late   so i will spend a moment on the bank and leverag loan market  a coupl of moment on the subprim market  and anoth moment on a third bucket of asset  which might be everyth els  as we are tri to figur out whether there is real spread   first  in the bank and leverag loan market  the volum of loan  as mani of you know  is somewher between      billion and      billion of commit capit in the pipelin   the under credit still appear quit strong  and i will tell you that i have a reason high degre of confid that  in spite of the distress  these market should work themselv out between now and the next fomc meet   we certain won   t see ani return to the market that peopl have gotten use to over the past sever month and year  but i would be surpris if we didn   t see opportunist capit come into these market and bid price   just to give you some idea  off that denomin of capit commit  we might see loss on the order of     billion or     billion   i would say that   s a fair conserv es    bank debt  which is the most secur  might have discount of   to   percent  should bid find their way into the market in the come day  leverag loan and high yield  discount of about    percent  and second lien mortgag  discount of    to    percent   almost all of these are larg relat to risk premium  not credit qualiti   real money is still in these busi   some of the hot money that was discuss earlier  some of these clo buyer  are no doubt gone for some  e   i think the most encourag thing is the new fund that have begun capit rais campaign  even over the past weekend  look to buy the distress secur  market forc the commerci institut that have been have it on their book  and mark it to market   remark  mani of the same commerci bank are prepar to stand behind these new leverag invest with leverag of about   to     so i would expect that market to increas pretti quick   market function there is thus  in my judgment  like to improv   some deal are certain like to blow up  reliev some of these bank of their commit   but in this market  becaus there are multipl gatekeep and becaus valu the under credit strike me as not that  e intens or tax a process  it is like in my judgment that  come fall  we will come to some new equilibrium  i can be far less confid  howev  about the subprim mortgag market   my base case assess there has a much lower confid level  both in term of  e and in term of outcom   the subprim market has about      trillion in outstand  and there is consider less certainti about the under credit   it is harder to measur and apprais the under pool   recoveri rate will be still harder to find   as a final note  which might have struck the market last week  appar more fraud is endem to these pool  make valuat increas difficult   as a result  i am less comfort about suggest what the under loss might be   they might be      billion   they could be consider more   i   m also less confid that there will be opportunist capit come back to these market over the next thirti or sixti day   with anoth leg down  it could take consider longer   as a result  i am quit a bit less confid that the market function will return as rapid as we would hope   i am more concern that  unlik the multipl gatekeep we find in the leverag loan market  for those that reli on the singl gatekeep  the credit rate agenc  given that their credibl has been shot  it is much harder to see that this market will unwind itself in a rather calm and comfort environ  at least over the balanc of       the final set of asset market i   d speak a moment about is    everyth els      what about everyth els that is subject to structur product   what about everyth els that is subject to complex financi instrument   some question aros late last week about the market integr regard those   i think it is just too hard to judg how that is go to work out   we are see loss show up in some veri unlik place   i   d like to say that what we have wit over the past week is transitori  but for that set of asset market  it is probabl hardest for me to come to a broader judgment  so what are the effect  then  on the broader economi   i agre with the point that presid  n made earlier that this judgment is extrem hard to make   i also agre with governor kohn   s judgment that there is a veri real downsid risk if some of these financi market turmoil issu persist   if i look at some of the credit channel and at financi intermediari and ask whether they are under stress  i see more dispers of risk among similar situat institut   some commerci bank may well be under more distress than other   i have no doubt that some invest bank are under more distress than other   we see some of this dispers in credit default swap and some of it in equiti price  but my sens is that the under fundament of their core busi are veri differ from each other and from their competitor than they   ve been at ani point in this cycl   for some of them to take loss on their own balanc sheet of    billion     billion  or    billion  as an invest bank  might not be hard to do when mani of them have been pick up market share and use their own proprietari trade and agenc busi to steal custom and revenu from other   but for the balanc  i think it is unclear how it is go to result   with mani of the invest bank    quarter end in august  the market are go to put genuin pressur on them to come clean with their loss   i expect most  if not all  of them to do so   so i think come mid septemb we   ll have a clearer sens of what their own mark to market model suggest   what about the broker dealer   again  not princip their regul but i suspect the market are go to push them to come clean with what their loss are   larg financi institut i would expect  though with less confid  to take writedown of their portfolio of leverag loan and writedown to some extent of their mortgag product to tri to assur the invest communiti of their financi posit   i hope that the process would work out this fall  but as i mention  i   m less comfort that we   re go to get that kind of transpar with the regul commerci bank than with some other  privat pool of capit are also undergo a real shakeout   for those with liquid pressur  which will tend not to be the largest hedg fund or privat equiti fund  we will read about their problem  and we will read about their close  over the come week and month  the good news is that the largest among them have use the period of strong liquid over the past year to more or less have quasi perman capit to term out their loan and provid capit so that they could take advantag in this period   i understand that there has been veri littl spike in margin call where most of the asset rest in the hedg fund communiti   so for mani of us who have talk about hedg fund bring resili to these market  this is realli a  e of test   i think the earli news for the largest among them is quit posit  mani of you have talk about what the other transmiss mechan are for have gdp effect   the wealth effect is real   we have lost about    trillion in market capit in the past twenti trade day  and that can   t be discount   question about board room confid and cap ex in the second half of this year are equal real   my sens is that we are go to final use that excess cash on balanc sheet that mani of us have long talk about   final  with respect to consum confid  though i think the recent data suggest that it   s posit  i suspect that the next set of data we get will show a retreat from those number   it is veri hard to judg how real consum are go to react here  let me make two final comment   opportunist capit is a key here to a smooth transit   it   s key to ensur that what happen in the financi market  sn   t seep it way into the real economi   of the equiti investor that were use loos credit market to get equiti return  the most sophist are focus on and look for equiti return in the debt market  so mani investor previous invest in equiti are now look to the debt market  where they see a risk reward tradeoff that is better than it has been in a long  e   that give me some confid that opportunist capit will come back to some of these market   that said  rate sensit buyer will no doubt pull back given that rate are less authorit   so i will end where i began  which is look at econom fundament   i think governor kohn talk about how the capit market  the financi market  and the labor market have proven to be absolut core to the resili of the broader economi   to the extent that there is now an unfortun  e between weak in the financi market and some potenti weak in under credit  we can reli less on the financi market to come to the rescu  should that circumst occur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i was look back at my note of the past few meet and note that the posit we are in is a bit like that in the may meet  at least the way in which peopl are character thing   that econom fundament still suggest moder growth for the intermedi term but that uncertainti has gone up dramat   then  in the june meet  we said that uncertainti went down  and now we   re say that uncertainti has gone up again   so we seem to have a littl volatil just like the market do  but obvious  we are respond to what the market are do   clear  there are key downsid risk   the risk that i   ve mention mani  e befor that concern me and that we now have more data on is product and potenti growth   with the revis sinc        the compound growth rate of product is down to     percent from     percent   the revis is fair signific over this period   i am not readi to go quit as far as the  book has gone in mark down potenti  but i do think that it is a real possibl  and it is veri close link to my concern about invest  which obvious the financi market volatil has affect  order and shipment of durabl good have been a bit choppi  and we haven   t seen the kind of rise that we would expect  given the balanc sheet and given all the other sort of strength that we would otherwis see in the economi   nonresidenti invest has been strong  and there is still some strength in mine and drill  but i have a lot of concern outsid that area   as a number of peopl have mention  there is littl chang in the actual cost of capit  even though spread have risen  becaus the treasuri have gone down   but with more uncertainti and more volatil  as governor   and other have mention  undoubt that is go to weigh heavili in the board room   it is go to weigh heavili on capit expenditur plan   so all other thing be equal  busi are like to be a bit more cautious go forward   but that caution with respect to invest and the slow of the invest recoveri make it harder to be op ist about a rebound in product growth   so that   s someth that i watch veri close becaus i think it is a veri  veri import effect  on the consumpt save balanc  certain we still have veri robust labor market   averag growth of         privat sector job per month this year  which is a step down from last year but still a robust level   we have a transit from a sort of cushion of the strong equiti market offset the negat wealth effect in the hous market   now  if they becom more correl   and  in particular  more correl and both go down   that obvious would rais some concern about slow consumpt growth and increas save   so i think that is someth to be veri mind of  with respect to hous and financi market  in the senior loan offic survey with respect to mortgag  when you drill down into it  both in april and in juli more than    percent of the senior loan offic report that they are tighten credit standard for subprim  and about    percent are for prime   that is fair signific   the depositori institut are pull back  and we have certain heard report that some of the larg institut are no longer offer     s or     s   there has also been a tighten outsid the depositori institut   the reason for part of the tighten is that some of the mortgag provid are simpli no longer there   we have had dozen of smaller provid of credit go out of busi  and the one that are still there are obvious chang their underwrit standard   as presid   mention  we are see some question about the origin to distribut model   we are also see volatil on the financi market side   but part of that volatil  as a number of peopl have express  is about concern about what is go into those secur in the origin to distribut model   that may rais some question in the long run about how much we   re go to see this market come back   i share governor     s concern  not onli from the point of view of the financi market but also regard the structur of mortgag market   that we may be see a littl less of that kind of structur than we have seen in the past   so that  combin with the tighten of standard more broad  may make financ more difficult to get   this  of cours  is occur in mani part of the countri   not all part but mani part   where hous inventori are veri high and in some case are still rise   obvious  that put a lot more pressur on the hous market  and i think the drag from the hous market  as mani of you said  is like to continu  fortun  the financi market volatil is come at a  e of relat strength in corpor balanc sheet   debt to asset ratio have been declin  and liquid asset as a percentag of total asset have been high   that provid much more of a cushion  much more insur   as presid pool mention  the bank system is in a dramat differ state from when we had challeng befor in the hous market or major challeng in financi market   the major bank have veri high  relat to histor trend  capit to asset ratio in excess of the requir minimum   they have been veri  veri profit   if you look at the largest bank   and i was just look at some that were most involv in the leverag loan market   they each have tier   capit on the order of     billion to     billion   the earn for each over the last year are     billion to     billion   there is also a lot of discuss of the amount of high leverag loan in the pipelin   on the order of      billion   but unless they have to take loss on that      billion  which is not go to happen  they have veri thick capit cushion and veri high earn   so at least for the forese futur  this will just be more a challeng to their earn than a challeng to capit  that is extrem import becaus the bank system can provid a critic automat stabil mechan  as it did in       when there are liquid challeng   in      we had the asian crisi that spread to latin america  then the russian crisi  and ltcm   there were some parallel to what we are see now   risk spread were rise veri dramat after a period of near record low level  and we saw the yield on treasuri go down quit a bit becaus that   s where peopl were go   but what was happen in the system was that peopl were pull money out of various fund and instrument and put it into the bank system   so the bank do act as liquid provid and liquid insur  and i think we   re start to see a bit of that now with peopl pull out of some of these instrument and so more is flow into the bank  it   s a littl earli to tell   we haven   t gotten enough data on that   but anecdot report are consist with exact what happen in        as peopl need an altern to commerci paper or other short term sourc of credit  it can be veri help that the bank system will have more liquid resourc to do that  and obvious it   s a strong capit environ   also  as governor   mention  there are more larg privat pool of capit to step in to bid for the ltcms  if such thing happen   when we look back to ltcm  onli one offer was on the tabl   from warren buffett   and there were a lot of question about how serious that offer would be  now a number of player have the wherewith to be the equival of that in this market  which has the potenti to be quit help   there are obvious more potenti downsid risk  but a lot of stabil exist in the bank system to deal with some of these risk and  given the strength of the balanc sheet  should be help in the short or the intermedi run  with respect to inflat  as mani peopl have mention  a number of risk are still skew to the upsid  with robust global growth  potenti pass through  some previous high energi price  and a lower dollar   so i still think that there is much more of a potenti upsid skew to inflat than a downsid skew   basic  i would start take my first step  but just veri first step  a littl more toward a balanc of risk becaus of the greater downsid to growth  although there are still upsid risk to inflat  as vice chairman   mention  overal we might want to think of move a littl more toward a greater balanc of risk but still with a predomin concern for inflat
thank you   governor
thank you   well  except for the fact that we have had a benchmark of potenti gdp downward and greater weak in hous  my forecast is basic similar to my forecast at the last fomc meet and is consist with the  book forecast   that we would have a return to trend growth a bit later than we had expect but by mid      and       in regard to the issu of inflat  let me just provid a littl inform on the model that i   m think about   you know that i think a key driver of inflat  of cours  is inflat expect  and that there are good argument to say that they are ground around   percent  we have been see number continu come in that are veri consist with that  which give me more and more confid that  in fact  inflat is gravit strong to this   percent level  but i want to talk a bit about the issu of output gap becaus i think that it is import  even if you think that inflat expect are extrem import  not to have a deus ex machina view of the inflat process  which is that inflat is caus by expect inflat and then where   that come from   so i think that resourc util is import   howev  the problem is that what is realli import is not just current resourc util  which is what we tend to put in our econometr specif  but also the futur expect path of resourc util and output gap   of cours  one problem here is that it is hard to measur   also  if you are do monetari polici right  then there is an expect that you are go to do the right thing to elimin those output gap   in fact  that is exact what is in our forecast and exact what our polici have been do   so one reason i think  in the current junctur  that it is not critic to talk about output gap a whole lot is that basic we are do the right thing  that context give me further reason for say  given our forecast  that a   percent inflat number is where we are head  just not now  and that the trend is solid in place   but we are go to stay there for the forese futur  unless we screw up somehow  and we are not go to do that    laughter  one key point that make me a littl differ from the committe on inflat is that i do not see the upsid risk as be greater than the downsid risk   i realli do see the risk as be quit balanc on inflat   again around this   percent number   yes  we do have some temporarili good news  and it is go to be unravel a bit  but it is still consist with the   percent overal trend   in term of output gap and futur expect  i don   t see those get peopl think that we   re go to have too tight resourc util  let me turn to the issu of the financi market becaus  obvious  that is the big gorilla sit at the tabl   i don   t see what is happen now as a direct spillov from the subprim market   it is veri consist with the way that bill was talk about this issu   of cours  the media are make the subprim market into the whole stori  but i think it is just not the right stori   the subprim market is realli a veri small percentag of the total credit market   what i think is much more import is that peopl are question and reassess the qualiti of the inform that exist in financi market   the point of the subprim market is just that we now trust the credit rate agenc less   basic what i think is happen in a way is quit a good thing   we were concern that the market were a littl too op ist  that there was too much opac  and that peopl weren   t worri about it   now  in fact  they are worri about it  and i think that is fundament a healthi situat   also  the part of the market that are have the problem are the most opaqu part  it is not clear that they are particular import to the thing we realli care about in term of our polici  which is what will happen to aggreg demand and  therefor  to both inflat and output   so at this point  i take the view that this could all end veri well and could in the long run make the situat healthier  and this view is consist with what governor kohn was point out  but i do worri that this reassess could actual find more   what   s the right word    skeleton in the closet or bad thing happen than were expect   in the past  we   ve seen that  when the qualiti of inform get question and peopl don   t think the marketplac is provid the right inform  headwind in the economi can becom quit signific   the most recent episod that i am think about  of cours  is the episod of enron and it aftermath  in which a key reason that the economi was so slow to recov was that the qualiti of inform was impair   then  peopl realiz that the market in fact did have some slight element of financi instabl   again  not too serious becaus the bank system was in such good shape   we could have a similar situat occur now   so the sort of bad scenario that i see is an enron type scenario  not someth much wors than that   but we realli have to keep on top of this   it mean  i think  that there are greater downsid risk to the forecast   the survey of all of us indic that peopl are now much more worri about downsid risk than they are about upsid risk   i think that is absolut right  and  in fact  it could get a lot wors   so the way i would view the situat is that right now we should be pretti calm  but we want to monitor it veri care and be readi for some potenti bad thing to happen and just hope that they don   t   the kind of scenario that we   re see in the  book is one that is go to play out   thank you
thank you  and thank everyon   presid
i want to make a comment follow the remark of governor   and governor   relat to the calendar of potenti market stabil and the leverag loan market   both of you cite a backlog of      billion or someth mayb slight less than that   in one convers i had  a market observ cite      billion and argu that it would take well beyond our septemb meet  into octob and novemb  befor the market would clear in that particular part of the market   so to connect this comment to governor     s comment about maintain some flexibl as we go into the fall and observ the market  we have differ es  out there of how much backlog there is  and therefor we are like to be still face a great deal of uncertainti at our septemb meet
thank you for the use discuss   as usual  i am go to veri briefli summar what i heard   i will be happi to take ani comment on that   then i just want to make a few short point   again  most of the key point have been made  most particip expect growth to remain moder over the forecast period   despit lower household wealth result from weaker hous and stock price  consumpt is like to continu to grow as labor market remain strong  real incom increas  and gasolin price moder   busi invest should also grow moder  although lower product and higher volatil could be drag on invest   commerci real estat  in particular  may be slacken  but it retain good fundament   the global economi is strong   industri product is expand at a reason pace   howev  downsid risk to growth were note and perhap receiv somewhat greater emphasi than at past meet   most notabl  hous appear to have weaken further  with sale of new and exist home declin and inventori of unsold home remain high   homebuild are experienc financi strain  and there is downward pressur on home price   spillov on consumpt spend is not yet evid but is a possibl risk  in this regard  develop in credit market receiv consider attent   on the posit side  the repric of risk and the reevalu of underwrit standard seem appropri   liquid still exist  credit is still be extend  and market may work out their problem on their own   a lower dollar and lower long term treasuri rate also tend to offset financi tighten   howev  higher risk premium  tougher underwrit  and greater uncertainti may constrain hous and invest spend  lead to broader macroeconom effect   in more pessimist scenario  disloc in credit market may last awhil and have a more substanti effect on credit avail and cost for busi as well as for homebuy  the possibl of contagion or sever financi instabl also exist   mani particip took note of the nipa revis and their implic for product growth  consum save  and unit labor cost   meet particip tend to put potenti growth at higher rate than the  book  view on inflat are similar to those in previous meet   recent read are view as reason favor   howev  risk to inflat remain  includ the possibl revers of transitori factor  tight labor market  the high price of commod  and higher unit labor cost result from lower product growth   in all  the risk to inflat remain to the upsid   that is my summari of what i heard   i   m sure a lot more could be said   ani comment  if not  let me just make a few addit comment   there have been two veri import develop sinc the last meet   the first was the downward revis to the nipa growth number   it   s not obvious yet  of cours  how much of that reflect a perman declin in product and how much is transitori   but certain the best guess is that some of it is more long term in natur   i think the main point i   d like to make is that the implic of this downward revis for inflat and monetari polici  except perhap in the veri short run  are not obvious   the question is  what is the effect of the lower product growth on aggreg demand   we have exampl of both type of phenomena   in the late      s  the pickup in product growth s ul a veri strong boom work through the stock market  consumpt  and invest  so it led to an overh economi  wherea in the earlier part of this decad  product growth pick up again but with weak aggreg demand   we had a jobless recoveri associ with that   so it remain to be seen exact how aggreg demand will respond to these develop   i do think that perhap that in the veri short run  given wage behavior and unit labor cost  if i had to choos  i would say that there is a slight bias toward higher inflat and tighter money   in the longer run  you would expect to see lower long term rate becaus of slower growth  the second issu that has been wide discuss around the tabl is the financi market  it is an interest question whi what look like      billion or so of credit loss in the subprim market has been reflect in multipl trillion of dollar of loss in paper wealth   so it   s an interest question about what is go on there   i think there are three reason that the financi market have move in the direct they have   first  there has been a widespread repric of risk   that is  obvious  a healthi develop  particular if there is no overshoot  which is a possibl   but all els be equal  it is restrict in term of aggreg demand  and it make our polici tighter than it otherwis would be   the second reason for the chang in market is that there has been a loss of confid in the abil of investor to evalu credit qualiti  particular in structur product   there is an inform fog  as i have heard it describ   this is veri much associ with the loss of confid in the credit rate agenc  i think one of the implic of this is that some of the innov we have seen in financi market are go to get roll back   we are go to see more lend taken out of origin to distribut vehicl and put back onto portfolio balanc sheet   so the question is how much effect this adjust process will have on the avail of credit   the third reason that i think the market have react as much as they have is concern about the macroeconom implic of what is happen   in particular  there is a fear that subprim loss  repric  and the tighten of underwrit standard will have advers effect on the hous market and will feed through to consumpt  and we will get into a vicious cycl   that certain is reflect in the expect of polici  i am not go to go through all the thing that are go on now in the market   you have had veri good review of that   obvious  the market right now are not function normal   some conduit of credit are simpli close or frozen   a number of compani are have difficulti with short term financ  and so  per presid     s comment  we are watch those thing veri care   we are prepar to use the tool that we have to address a short term financi crisi  should one occur   in the longer term  of cours  our polici should be direct not toward protect financi investor but  rather  toward our macroeconom object   that is veri import   then the question is what the long run implic of the financi market adjust will be for the economi   i think the odd are that the market will stabil   most credit are pretti strong except for part of the mortgag market   but even so there will be notabl tighter credit  tighter standard  probabl some loss of confid in market  and higher risk premium that will on net be restrict   this restrict effect could come in various magnitud   it could be moder  or it could be more sever  and we are just go to have to monitor how it adjust over  e   again  there is a bit of a risk   and tail risk has been mention not onli in a financi sens but also in the macro sens   that  if credit is sever restrict so that we get feedback from lower hous price  for exampl  into the financi market  that situat would be difficult to deal with  those are the two major issu that peopl have talk about   just veri briefli on the overal assess   on the output side  econom growth look a littl softer to me  most becaus of hous   there are also some slight worri develop in term of automobil demand  which suggest some weaken in consum spend   but there are some strong element as well   also the labor market has margin soften   the unemploy rate is about    basi point abov it recent low  so there has been some movement  and i still expect to see some reduct in construct employ   so i think there is a bit more soft and there are a few more downsid risk to output than at our last meet   like other  i think the recent inflat data are moder encourag   i continu to see risk   if you   re not satiat with risk  i   ll add one more  which is that if the hous market realli weaken and peopl go back to rent  we could get the same phenomenon that we saw last year  by which rent are driven up and we get an effect work through shelter cost   so i agre with those who still view the risk to inflat as be tilt to the upsid   if there are no comment or question  let me turn now to   to discuss the polici action
thank  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      financi market have experienc except strain over the intermeet period   the bluebook provid a thorough review of these develop through thursday  and i had intend to provid onli a brief summari of and updat on those develop  as in exhibit    and some thought on their implic for monetari polici   but given the extens discuss of this topic so far this morn  those point seem all to have been made  and i will turn direct to a discuss of polici altern   as note at the top of exhibit    the risk of weak in aggreg demand stem from tighter credit condit and disrupt in credit flow form part of the rational for the    basi point eas of altern a that was present in the bluebook   even if your view about the modal outlook are similar to the  book baselin forecast  you may be concern that the deterior in credit condit  the signific increas in market volatil  and potenti declin in confid have tilt the risk to growth distinct to the downsid   you may also see the recent spate of soft spend indic as have rais the likelihood of sluggish growth in aggreg demand   the consider gap between the  book consist real feder fund rate  the dash   line in the panel to the right  and the rang of model base es  of the equilibrium real feder fund rate  shown in red  may add to question about the possibl of weaker growth than in the staff forecast and reinforc your belief that some eas of polici is appropri   moreov  you may be more op ist than the staff about either product growth or the nairu or both   inde  as i mention earlier  sever of you note just such op  in the narrat accompani your trial run project   the financi s ulus from a polici eas  of cours  would help support growth direct   a polici action might be high potent in current circumst  possibl help to buoy consum and busi confid in a period when sen ent may well be deterior   you may    materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     also believ that the inflat outlook would support a near term polici eas   core inflat read have been relat subdu in recent month  wage growth seem to have remain moder  and labor market pressur may be start to eas  although the evid on that score is so far quit limit   in the staff forecast  core inflat converg toward   percent  an outcom that  judg by your project  some of you would find accept   and your forecast suggest that you think the odd favor a prompter and slight steeper declin in inflat   in contrast  as note in the bottom left hand panel  you may concur with the  book forecast for spend and price  given it polici assumpt  but judg that the forecast trajectori for inflat is too slow and leav inflat at a level that is too high to fo  op  econom perform   if so  you may be inclin to firm polici   percentag point  as in altern c   the declin in core inflat in the  book is slight and slow   as shown in the bottom right panel  the op  control simul in the bluebook base on a     percent target for core pce inflat suggest an increas in the feder fund rate of about   percentag point over the next year   credibl or learn effect that might flow from a polici firm  as in the simul  could limit the output and employ sacrific necessari to fo  a lower path for inflat   moreov  you may agre with the staff   s baselin assumpt that the effect of current market strain will prove temporari  that market will soon resum clear  albeit at higher and perhap more ration and more sustain spread  and that the restraint on aggreg demand will be modest   final  you might see the risk to the inflat outlook as tilt to the upsid  given high level of resourc util and increas energi price   altern b  discuss in exhibit    may be seen as an appropri balanc of the consider motiv altern a  on the one hand  and altern c  on the other   under this altern  the committe would leav the stanc of polici unchang today   the statement would acknowledg the recent volatil of financi market and tighter credit condit but would also convey an expect that moder growth will like continu   core inflat would be character as subdu in recent month but subject to upsid risk   the committe would expressli refer to increas downsid risk to growth but indic that it predomin polici concern remain the risk that inflat will fail to moder as expect   a rational for altern b is laid out in the upper left hand panel   in the baselin  book forecast  the economi expand at a moder pace  resourc pressur eas slight  and core inflat ebb to   percent with the feder fund rate held at it current level through next year   that forecast may be close to your own view about the modal result  and you may see it as an accept outcom   as shown to the right  op  control simul base on the  book baselin and an assum core inflat object of   percent would suggest leav the feder fund rate unchang for the rest of the year befor eas slight   return to the left hand panel  hold steadi at this meet would also be consist with the committe   s past behavior as captur by the es  outcom base and forecast base polici rule present in the bluebook   you may also believ that altern b repres a suitabl weight of the risk   for exampl  even if you are a bit more op ist about potenti growth and the nairu than the staff  you may nonetheless see maintain the feder fund rate at it current level as an appropri risk manag approach  given the upsid risk to inflat and the higher cost should they be realiz   care consider of the most recent develop also may inclin you toward altern b   in particular  even if the incom data and increas financi market strain of recent week inclin you to believ that the downsid risk to growth have increas  you may be quit unsur about the extent of those risk and not wish to exagger them  as suggest by ye day   s develop  it is not inconceiv that market will soon begin to right themselv and that the  book baselin assumpt of onli modest financi restraint will prove correct   in these circumst  watch wait may be the best approach in order to allow more inform to accumul that will enabl you to better assess the like eventu adjust of market price and flow and the appropri polici respons   inde  you may be especi concern about the risk of overreact  or be perceiv as overreact  to temporari market develop   particular if you see a signific probabl that market could misinterpret chang in the stanc of polici  or in your word  as an indic that you place a higher prioriti on financi market stabil or econom growth than on price stabil   moreov  your inflat concern may not have diminish much  if at all  over the intermeet period   while the most recent core inflat read have been relat low  you may concur with the staff that some of that good perform will like prove transitori   also  overal inflat has remain high  and with resourc util elev  you may be worri that high rate of overal inflat could allow inflat expect to move higher   the statement associ with the revis version of altern b is provid in the bottom panel   given the volatil market condit of late  get a reliabl read on market particip    expect at this point is difficult  but an announc rough along these line seem to be anticip by most market particip  notabl  the statement explicit mention downsid risk to growth   that mention may be seen as open the door a crack to futur eas or at least give the committe greater scope to move in that direct   although onli a minor of market particip appar expect the committe to point explicit to downsid risk to growth  a sizabl market reaction to the inclus of such a refer in paragraph   seem unlik  as the committe still would state that inflat risk are it predomin concern   the final exhibit is an updat version of tabl   for your refer   chang relat to the bluebook are shown in red
thank you   are there question of     if not  let   s begin our go round   presid
well  mr  chairman  against this background of skittish  my best advic would be to recogn  to an extent  in our statement what is go on in the marketplac  what ail the marketplac   the best guidanc would be that we must not ourselv becom a tripwir   i think we have to show a steadi hand   i rather like the refer to the hippocrat oath earlier     do no harm      i think we can best accomplish this by acknowledg market turbul and yet not impli that we are given to a reaction that might creat a moral hazard  i   m particular mind of the discuss in the press and by secur analyst of a so call bernank put  and i want to make sure that we do not take ani action or say anyth that might give rise to an expect that such is to occur   therefor  i would suggest that altern b offer the best polici respons   that is  i am in favor of keep the rate where it is   the word in the second paragraph acknowledg that there has been volatil in the market   i think it address the point governor kohn made about growth in employ  incom  and a robust global economi   i   ve wait a long  e to see the word    global    in these statement   laughter   whether it get left in or not  it   reflect realiti   i   m mind of presid     s point of soften a littl  and yet that is where i worri that we might becom a bit of a tripwir   i would under normal circumst be somewhat inclin toward the last paragraph in altern a  and yet i didn   t hear around the tabl  nor do i fulli believ myself  that thing are exact rough balanc   i take the point that was made just now in the present that  by say    downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat     we are open the door  the onli refin that i might suggest is that we soften a littl the word befor    polici concern remain the risk that inflat will fail to moder as expect      by take out the word    predomin     i would leav that up for consider   i actual talk to somebodi about this earlier  i want to acknowledg that   but otherwis i would stick with altern b  again  mind that we are deal with a skittish market situat and yet acknowledg the fact that a sens around this tabl is that there are risk to growth  that we are make progress on inflat  and yet there is no convinc evid that we have complet turn the corner on the latter front   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s clear that the market are veri skittish   i haven   t heard anyon suggest that we should be chang the fed fund rate  and i believ we should keep it steadi   so what is import now is what we say rather than the feder fund rate   i think that the market is look to us for leadership  but we have to defin exact what that mean in a difficult market situat   i start by say that we need to view the current market situat not as uniqu but as a particular exampl of a class of event   each one has uniqu characterist  but this is part of a not uncommon thing that happen   it happen everi now and then  so what should our respons rule be to event like this  not how should we respond to this particular case   i think there are two thing that we need to do  given what we know at the moment  which obvious may chang   what we know at the moment is  in the current situat  we ought not to give ani hint that we are tri to suggest a polici chang at our next meet becaus i don   t think we have enough inform to say that such a hint would be appropri  second  we want to make clear to the market our readi to respond to the situat should the environ chang so that respons by us would be help   now  if we were to hint or if the market were to view what we say as hint  we could produc a posit market outcom this afternoon   i don   t doubt that   but then what   where do we go from there   would we  have given such a hint inadvert or on purpos  want to actual carri through at our next meet   that will depend on what we know at the next meet  but in the mean  we would have creat a market dynam that would not be at all help   reduc the fed fund rate    basi point at the next meet or the one after that is not go to fix the subprim market  that market is chang perman from a situat of realli veri poor underwrit  and the market will fix it in due  e and sort it out  i favor basic altern b and the languag there  but i am concern about paragraph    that the market could interpret    although the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat    as our effort to give a hint that we see a cut in the rate ahead   so i would like to suggest a littl differ way of do that   if you look in paragraph   at the sentenc that begin with    nevertheless     i would insert a sentenc immedi ahead of that which say     consequ  the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat      that follow the discuss of the situat in the market  credit condit  and so forth   then i would leav the last paragraph the same as it was last  e   the point of do that is to make clear that the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat  but nevertheless  the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace   that was what i would suggest we do so that we do not inadvert give a hint   we are awar that the market are upset   we are make that veri clear  but there is no intent to give a hint of polici action in our mind at our next meet  thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i guess the thing that strike me first about the current situat is that the incom news on core inflat has been promis   at least as far as i   m concern  the inflat outlook is satisfactori   so that  in and of itself  suggest no chang in polici   now  if we append to that the financi market turmoil and the adjust that is under way there  that   rais the risk to real growth   i think we have pretti well acknowledg that in this discuss   but in my view  that shouldn   t prompt a chang in the feder fund rate target at this meet for the reason i cite earlier have to do with the substanti uncertainti associ with all of this and  of cours  i would be lax if i didn   t mention the resili of the under economi that has been demonstr through the period of the great moder   i do think it   s import  though  that we use the languag to make sure that the public is awar that we are awar of what is go on here   altern b  as draft  larg   that   i don   t think we should feel constrain at this point  as we some  do  to tri to make the chang to the languag as few and far between as possibl   i   m pretti comfort with altern b as draft   in fact  i might be prepar to go even a littl further than b  someth closer to a balanc risk statement  but i don   t feel strong enough about it to insist on that  even if i could    laughter
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we have a coupl of issu in front of us today   first  do we react to the recent inflat number   i have been pleas by the recent report  as i said  come in better than expect  but there seem to be a substanti chanc that the improv we have seen is temporari and that we will get some higher figur later this year   moreov  inflat expect remain abov where i   d like them to be  so i don   t think we should relax our character of inflat in this statement   a second question we face is how to react to the recent turmoil in financi market   i think we need to be care to maintain our focus on the implic of market develop for the anticip path of inflat and real spend   at this point  i don   t see those implic be substanti enough to warrant a polici respons on our part or a chang in our sens of the like near term polici path  though obvious this assess may chang as event unfold   absent evid of such implic  our financi stabil respons can be met quit adequ through the automat suppli of reserv under the desk   s oper procedur for target the overnight feder fund rate or through the suppli of reserv to solvent institut at the discount window   unfortun  the recent behavior of the fed fund futur market and recent financi press commentari suggest that some market particip  perhap think back to      or       believ that financi market turbul per se will induc us to respond with interest rate cut   even if we did cut rate to counter financi market volatil  financi market jitter might take some  e to dissip   we may be reluct to undo such rate cut in the mean   and we would run the risk that polici then becom too easi and we get behind the curv   my main concern is the risk that our communic today might mislead market into think that we may cut rate in respons to asset price volatil per se  absent ani expect of sustain effect on the real economi or inflat   accord  i believ the statement languag should acknowledg the recent develop as in the second part of altern b but not go ani further   i   m concern about paragraph   and ad the passag about downsid risk to growth increas   i   m concern that it may go a bit too far in that direct   i think that the minut should acknowledg the problem in subprim and privat equiti market  and i also think the minut should educ financi market that the mitig of volatil in asset price is not an fomc object   thank you
thank you   presid
i didn   t know i rais my hand  but i   ll go anyway    laughter   i certain don   t want to recommend a chang in the fed fund target at this point  mr  chairman  so i agre with altern b in term of the fed fund rate portion   i do want to go on record  sinc this is my last meet  as say that i   m not agre with altern b becaus i   m comfort with a   percent quantit guidelin for inflat   but i am  on balanc  comfort with altern b   i am concern about inflat   i think the improv that we see may be transitori  as i mention   as presid  n mention in his earlier comment  unit labor cost will like be increas  and i think that  although the forecast on inflat look promis  there could be signific risk that it might go higher   in term of the develop in the financi market  i think we have all talk about them extens   there is noth more to be said there   at this point  it is a period of watch wait   i would agre with presid    with his comment about paragraph   of take out the phrase that the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat   i would prefer to see it in the minut rather than in the statement  and i would prefer to have paragraph   exact as we had it at the last meet
thank you  mr  chairman   as i said earlier  i do think that the risk to the outlook for econom growth have increas while the risk to the outlook for inflat have moder but are still to the upsid   so i found the suggest on page    of the bluebook that we might want to mix and match the altern a and b languag appeal  but i did think that chang our statement in that way could convey a greater shift in our risk assess than i believ is warrant today   so i think the revis version of altern b make the modest but import adjust of acknowledg the recent chang in credit condit in the rational section  and it signal the greater downsid risk to growth in the risk assess section   so i support our altern b   that is  no chang in the fed fund rate today and the languag that is in the revis version   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the inflat news has continu to be encourag  but the risk remain on the upsid   with respect to growth  the prospect have worsen  and i think there is greater downsid risk for the reason that we have discuss   i think the market respons to these event is not inappropri   they perceiv a greater likelihood that we will need to cut the fed fund rate sooner and more deepli than seem like onli a few week ago  and i think we should essenti tri to leav those expect in place today to indic that we intend not to respond to asset price or to the problem of particular dealer or financi institut direct but to assess the econom consequ of the turmoil  so the question is  what is the right languag to do that   the altern b languag that is propos is tri to achiev exact what i think is appropri   so i agre with the goal of altern b   i   m simpli concern about some of the actual languag that is propos  particular i worri about the languag in paragraph     when you say    although the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat  the committe   s predomin polici concern remain the risk that inflat will fail to moder     that   s like say   perhap becaus i respond so strong to the word    predomin      that  yes  we see greater downsid risk  but we don   t care  we remain total focus on inflat    laughter   that bother me   that   s how it come across to me   i don   t think the intent is to make it that way  so i would make two propos to soften it   i think what we need to do is dial it down  but i do think that inflat risk remain to the upsid   i would second two suggest that have alreadi been made   i would second presid     s suggest that we remov the word    predomin    from paragraph     we might say     the committe remain concern about the risk that inflat will fail to moder as expect      now  i do think the downsid risk has increas on the growth side   i   m not sure it is actual necessari to say so explicit  and i think dial down paragraph   by simpli remov    predomin     along with the addit languag that is propos in line    might be suffici   but i think that we actual do agre that downsid risk have increas   if we want to express that  i would endors presid pool   s suggest that we move the languag about downsid risk to paragraph    say someth after    for some household and busi  and the hous correct is ongo      we could then say     although the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat  nevertheless the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace      so we would get it in there  basic we would say that we see it  but nevertheless we think most like the economi will grow at a moder pace   if financi turbul diminish and market stabil  not have downsid risk to growth in paragraph   and continu to express some asymmetr bias  some worri about inflat  we   ll be comfort live with that go forward  and it is a good summari of where we are   so those are my suggest
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  a coupl of thing   first  i am satisfi with the current polici   i think that for the moment our concern should still be on inflat  and i think our polici is design to address that   in say that  i also recogn   from my own observ and from what i   ve heard here today   that more downsid risk are emerg and that we have brought the risk more in balanc  i guess is the way to say it   complic that  of cours  are the tighter credit condit   i think they are probabl transitori  but we won   t know that for a while yet   mayb by the next meet   that lead me to conclud that i am comfort with altern b and it languag becaus i think it recogn this dynam and put it out there for the public   so i would stick with what we have in altern b and then see how we develop between now and the next meet   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i am certain comfort with maintain the fed fund rate where it is  so i   m support of that   i think the real key here is languag  what are we tri to convey to the market   how far can we go  acknowledg what mani peopl share   a sens of some increas risk   without creat anoth set of concern in the marketplac   so the languag is the t i piec here   i   ve waffl a bit in my feel about this   i   m inclin to be about where i think bill pool and     are   move the downsid risk into paragraph   as oppos to put them in the assess of risk   i would be support of that tone   also  in respons to some of     s comment in his earlier memo on this  i actual prefer the languag of repric of risk rather than of tighten credit condit simpli becaus it emphas that this is part a relat price adjust that is go on   but i don   t want to take a strong stand on that  onli one other word concern me  and i   d like to rais the issu here   in paragraph    which nobodi has talk about yet  in the first sentenc     read on core inflat have been relat subdu in recent month    is a chang in the languag from our previous statement  which say     improv modest recent month      i worri a littl about the word    subdu    becaus i think it becom veri close to make some kind of normat judgment about the level of inflat that we are happi with   i   m uncomfort about that particular chang in the languag becaus it  again  might impli some normat statement without the committe   s agre on what we view as be subdu or not   so i   d like to suggest that we chang that back to what it was befor becaus  if we want to convey stabil and some continu here  there are place to chang  there are place not to chang  and i would rather chang fewer word than more word go forward   that would be the onli addit suggest i would make  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  feel that we should hold the rate  so i am concern princip with the way the statement play to the various audienc  particular the market   the postur we should take is to acknowledg  while not react prematur to  the turbul in the financi market and the subdu or the improv inflat number  and we should make an effort to maintain some flexibl   so i am a bit torn on paragraph   between presid pool   s suggest  which i have some sympathi for  and the concern that paragraph   will come across as ritualist repetit of what we   ve said everi month for sever month and  therefor  will convey a sens that we   re not pay attent to what   s go on in the market   so i come out ambival on that   i can support presid pool   s suggest  but on balanc i guess i like the statement in altern b as it is
thank you   presid
i support leav the target for the fed fund rate at    percent  howev  the news sinc the last meet would seem to be more elev downsid risk to econom growth   this elev risk reflect the baselin growth for real gdp as   percent  a consider reduct from the previous  book   greater uncertainti about the evolut of the hous market  and concern about the fallout from financi market disrupt   given the greater downsid risk  i would prefer languag in the assess of risk paragraph from altern a  though i do like the modif to altern b that was made  and i am worri about an interpret of a fed put for financi market   so although i   d prefer the risk assess in altern a  which more accur reflect my assess of risk  i could certain accept remov the word    predomin      that would be my second choic   my third choic would be to bow to those who have a better understand of nuanc languag  sinc that is certain not my expertis  though i hope i will develop it over the year  and i could live with the altern b languag as my third choic
okay   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like the other  i think keep the feder fund rate where it is is the right thing to do   we need  as other have said  to watch the situat care and see how it evolv   i think we   re tri to do two thing with this statement  as other have remark   one is to make peopl awar that we   re awar that a major market event has occur and to say that we   re look at it and tri to assess it implic for the outlook but that it hasn   t realli   not yet  anyhow   caus a major chang in our fundament assess of where the economi is go   the second thing we are tri to do is make sure that we have a flexibl platform we can move from over the next coupl of meet or even  should it becom necessari  in the intermeet period   so one can see this go in lot of differ direct   the market get much more turbul with implic for the outlook and we need to move in the intermeet period or thing settl down and we go back to inflat as the predomin risk   the incom data on demand and product remain consist with the central forecast   as i and some other note  we could end up come out of this and eas polici somewher down the road  but not right away  i thought the languag of altern b did both of those thing   it acknowledg the situat   it reinforc the sens that moder growth go forward was where we thought thing were go becaus we ad the    support by solid growth in employ and incom and a robust global economi      so we have some rational for that  which we didn   t have befor  i also thought that paragraph   was a realli accur read   i was actual a littl surpris through the go round just how  almost univers  peopl said that the downsid risk to output have increas but that they were still most concern about inflat   so i thought that paragraph   turn out to be prescient   on the part of the chairman     or whoever draft it   a realli accur view of where the committe was   my concern about move the first piec of that into paragraph   is that then we have one risk in paragraph     we haven   t done that befor  right   the risk to output and to inflat have all been talk about in paragraph    anoth risk is in paragraph    the risk to inflat  and that is an asymmetri of how we discuss risk   it was intend to soften the risk  but i think it strike me as creat a preced that in the futur will be hard to live with  when some risk are in some paragraph and other risk are in other paragraph   anoth thing we could do is move the inflat risk into paragraph   and not come down one way or anoth   but i think the committe want to come down on the inflat side   in term of predomin risk or main risk   and the committe isn   t quit readi to go to balanc   so it seem to me that paragraph    as written  realli captur the center of graviti of the committe   so i am in favor of that  one word on the moral hazard and the concern about be seen as react   i am not worri about it   i think we have kept our eye  through the past twenti year  on the macro environ   we have adjust polici to stabil the economi  to bring inflat down  and we were pretti darn success in all of that   asset price go up  and asset price go down  anybodi who bought a lot of high tech stock  bet on the  span put  is still wait to recov their money    laughter   i don   t think it ever exist   i realli don   t care what peopl say  i care about what we do  and we just need to keep our eye on those macro implic  now  as i said in my present  i think the connect between the financi market and the macroeconomi is pretti complic and run through confid and other thing  too   but i   m not realli worri about a moral hazard from act   should market continu to be turbul and we see that turbul in the futur   i agre with the vice chairman that we have to be forward look in this   such turbul has the potenti for advers affect the economi  i think we should go ahead and act   i think we basic did the right thing in       and        and i don   t think we need to apolog for it   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   befor dive into altern b  i   d say part of the reason that we are tri on differ cloth around the languag in altern b is that we have an odd juxtaposit of growth and inflat at this  e   that is becaus the growth risk seem to be driven larg by a financi market situat that we still don   t total understand  and we even have some disagr about how quick we will come to that understand   so unlik our typic juxtaposit  when we have intermedi concern about inflat and about growth  here it strike me that the differ are in  e and in magnitud   that is  if the downsid risk from the financi market happen soon and we   re in the middl of it and we just don   t see it yet  boy  we might know it soon and that could have veri ugli outcom   i think there are differ here   i also think there are differ in our power   our power over inflat is pretti darn good  and we can exercis that kind of judgment   our power over get in the middl of these market by move rate   percentag point or move our languag is harder for me to deciph   that   s whi i think the suggest about the languag of altern b are good one  and they are hard for us to all wrestl with  the reason i come down for altern b as written is that it strike me that we have two goal   one is to be as clear as we can be with the market  notwithstand their expect of what we see  and i think altern b   that   the second goal is tri to buy ourselv some insur and some flexibl   i worri that  if we were to drop    predomin     which has becom part and parcel of their view of where we are  it might turn out that these market are benign and this isn   t the storm i talk about just a moment ago  and it will be hard to go back to that word   i don   t know how we go back to    predomin    in septemb or in the meet after that if we have drop it   so in some way i think the question is  as in the pool approach  do you drop    predomin    and move the downsid risk to paragraph    and is that rough equival to altern b as is   the reason i do not think so is that altern b as is provid us with more flexibl to end up drop the downsid risk if that eventu come to pass   so for the reason that governor kohn has given  i think we probabl have the right construct here in altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i also support keep the fed fund rate unchang  and i veri much agre with the way that governor kohn was think about what we   re tri to achiev   so let me just describ whi i think that altern b as is larg achiev that  the key to my think about the decis on chang the statement is  first  whether someth has materi chang so that the market will realiz that  when we chang the statement  we do so becaus someth has actual happen and  second  whether it give us the flexibl go forward to make anoth chang if new inform come in   so  for exampl  in paragraph    acknowledg the volatil and talk about credit condit  about the hous market  and then about the offset factor of employ  growth in incom  and global demand   all those thing are relev   the new thing   the financi market and credit condit   have been there a bit but are now more import than they were befor   so we   re acknowledg thing that actual have happen in the intermeet period   i also like that it give a bit more color about what   s go on and how we   re think about thing  and each piec is one that we can easili leav  add to  or take back  and that is veri valuabl   so i like the formul of paragraph   becaus it both acknowledg new inform that has come in and   so not in a way that suggest fear or excess concern but just sort of acknowledg various factor  particular the financi condit in the context of other on the upsid   the balanc is  i think  veri nice  on paragraph    i agre with presid   that it is not clear to me that we had new inform so that we would want to chang the character   i see noth wrong with the character that we have there   i am not as concern as presid   is that it make more of a valu judgment   but my question is just whi we have made the chang   i am happi with either way  but use my criterion that if no inform is new whi chang  i am not quit sure whi we chang it   i think it is fine either way  on paragraph    i think it is veri import to take a step toward balanc without go all the way toward balanc becaus it is much too earli to tell  as mani peopl have said   put the downsid risk there make a lot of sens becaus of the tradit of the structur   again  i don   t see ani reason to chang the overal formul or the overal structur at this point  particular when the market are jitteri   i don   t think we should be go about a sort of structur chang in the statement   even if ul  we might want to think about it  i do not think this would be the  e to do it   also  i like that it is veri easi to put on and take off  so that if growth   come back up  we can easili remov the languag   if growth goe down  we can move toward balanc of risk veri easili there if we want to  and as governor   said  if we drop    predomin     we cannot get that back   i feel that we are not at a stage   or at least from the discuss around the tabl and from where i am   where we should do that   also  i think you would have a veri strong reaction in the market   if the market saw that we both acknowledg the downsid risk and took out    predomin    or even just took out the word    predomin     that would indic a much stronger risk and be a much stronger signal that we are go to move more quick   i do think that this statement as is will lead to a slight increas in expect of a cut a littl earlier  but that   s perfect accept becaus i can   t see ani better way to get the balanc right   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious i agre that we should not have a chang in the feder fund rate   so i want to talk about the statement   when i think about the statement that i would write  a key thing from my viewpoint is just to ask what the inflat object is becaus it realli affect the statement in a major way   i believ that a   percent goal is reason for reason that i have discuss befor   in that context  inflat has moder  and so i would have difficulti say that we are concern that it has not moder when i think  in fact  it has   but i do have to say that i think we want to stick with altern b as it is written here for two reason   the first reason is that i am actual in a conflict situat becaus it is not clear whether i should think about write a statement that   s appropri for governor   or a statement that   s appropri for the committe as a whole   we are go to have to deal with this challeng   when i read the project  it   s clear to me that i   m on the high side  that my   percent is higher than the median  which is around    or       i would not have difficulti accept an inflat object of     as long as the committe came to a consensus   i think that the issu of write the statement is much more difficult when we don   t have consensus of the committe   it is creat a problem for me in term of think about how to get involv in the intern deliber on what the statement should be  and that will be import in the futur   i do not think that now is the  e to deal with that   so one of the issu then is let   s deal with that at some point in the futur  the second reason is the issu of what is go on in term of the financi market and what kind of impress we give outsid   i agre with governor kohn that we have not been oper under a  span put or a fed put   it is veri clear to me that we have not been do so  except that i think an impress has been creat  and i would like to mention that i am a littl less sanguin about what was done in the past   i think that one mistak was made  perhap becaus i   m look at it ex post   when the fed lower interest rate    basi point in the ltcm episod  it was a brilliant stroke   it was exact the right thing to do   but when you think about an oper like that  which was basic to restor confid to the market and was veri much like a classic lender of last resort oper  we know that you want to put in liquid  but when the crisi is over  you want to take it out   at that  e  i was quit critic that the fed did not then remov the    basi point declin  and i think it creat an impress   i don   t know about a  span put  but there was some element of that   and it is veri hard to dissip that impress   mayb it is true that peopl said we weren   t tri to do that  but we did creat some kind of impress along those line   so i think the issu of percept still is import   in that context  it is veri import that we not give the impress that we are respond to financi market now becaus the discuss here has been that we are veri concern that this might be a problem in the futur but right now it is not affect our forecast in a major way   that   s exact what we have to communic to the public and the market  and in that context  chang the statement too much in move toward balanc will creat problem along those line  if i were not worri about these issu  i would take the word    predomin    out of the statement   in fact  i might even take out the issu that i   m worri about  that we say inflat has not moder   but given the current situat  i think it is best that we stick with    predomin     that we mention downsid risk to growth and then the    predomin    side in term of inflat   creat an element of balanc   thus i think there is a potenti issu that we have to worri about in futur statement and that we will have to grappl with   i hope that this committe could come to a consensus on what our inflat object is so that we can have a more coher discuss of these issu  howev  i do not think this is the  e to pursu that   so i support altern b as written   thank you
thank you   presid
about classic lender of last resort oper  we ask peopl at the open market desk how much addit reserv it take to lower the feder fund rate   percentag point   it is on the order of a coupl of ten million   so    basi point ad mayb       mayb      million in that instanc   you know  i   d ventur that that was probabl trivial in term of ad liquid to the market after ltcm   the real effect it had was alter the then current and expect path of the real overnight feder fund rate   as you know     the classic lender of last resort option had to do with the     s and prevent interest rate from spike abov current rate  not from ad reserv or drive down interest rate   so i think it is a confus to link thing like what we did in       or       to the classic lender of last resort oper
but there   s alway an issu about what we mean by the word    classic     what i   m think about here is that a lender of last resort oper is realli about restor confid   it can be done without actual put ani liquid into the system   if you look at a success lender of last resort oper  just the announc that you will be a backstop for the system has tremend impact   of cours  this is one reason that what was done in         with  span not actual sit in the tub that morn but get up earli and announc befor the market open that the feder reserv was go to be a backstop   was extrem import  i   m think of it in that context  which is that we want to provid inform to the market  which was that we were go to be there and that we were not go to be the bank of japan and allow someth to spiral out of control   clear  it was basic take out insur  say that the fed will be there   onc you don   t need insur anymor  there   s a realli strong argument to take it away   so i   m not talk about this in term of liquid per se but what we are tri to do in term of expect   that episod was import for do the right thing  which was critic to the way the financi market recov  but i think a problem was creat when we didn   t revers it in the same way that  when you actual do a lender of last resort oper  you put liquid in and you take it out   that   s the sens in which i mean put lower interest rate in and then take them out when the crisi is over
all right   let me get us back to the statement    laughter  vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   just quick  i think we are actual all in a fair similar place  not far apart in our basic diagnosi  and that   s good  given the complex of our decis go forward in some sens   we want to soften slight the asymmetri in our current statement to give us a bit more flexibl and to show some awar of the chang in the realiti out there  quick on the statement  first  i agre that  on the question of how we character and how we display some recognit of financi market develop  the refer to volatil itself may not captur it   somebodi suggest that we say someth instead about go to    risk premium    or someth more general  and i think that might be slight better   a small point   the second question is whether we should revert to june on the inflat read in respons  i think  to the right observ by presid   that this   convey more comfort with a level than the previous word did   so i would be fine go back to june  but i could also live with this becaus it convey a sens that the read have been and continu to be reason favor   so i would be fine with the way it is  but i could go back to the june languag  on the question about whether we refer explicit to downsid risk to growth  which we   ll be do for the first  e   a sort of consequenti act   and  if so  how we do it   i would have been fine leav it implicit rather than introduc it explicit   i think don is right   if we   re go to do it  unless we   re go to chang the structur of the statement signific and put some risk assess on growth in paragraph   and some risk assess around inflat in paragraph    then we need to leav it in paragraph     so  again  on the risk to growth  i   m okay with put that languag in   i think it   s consist with the broad object   i guess my prefer would have been to leav it implicit  final  on    predomin     my own view is that we should not repeat    predomin    and that we would be better off simpli state that the committe remain concern about the risk or concern that inflat will fail to moder as expect   i don   t think the argument for stick with    predomin    are that compel   i don   t think that take it out constrain our option go forward   it is true that it   s a shift in some broad sens  but i don   t think we need to say so stark now that we   ve look at this set of risk   veri differ type of risk  some veri fast move  veri uncertain  and some slower move  probabl manag over  e   and say that we weigh that balanc and we think the latter risk continu to predomin   i think that   s the substanc of the argument we face   i think it would be better to slight soften that further   have said all of that  i can live with altern b as draft    laughter
may i make a two hand intervent
could i ask a question of        predomin    is a key word   so what do you think might be the respons of the market if we leav it in or take it out  in term of two element   one is the issu of how the market would think about the futur evolut of our polici  two is how the media might read whether we are react to the distress in the financi market
well  as i said earlier  it   s a littl hard to judg market reaction right now  given the flux in financi market   that said  i do think that the introduct of    downsid risk     as an explicit phrase in the statement will obvious not be overlook by market particip   laughter  and i think that they will see it as at least some slight shift in the committe   s bodi english   with regard to    predomin     that   s just anoth step in the same direct   and i think mayb even a bigger shift
i think it is a bigger shift   i think if the first is one unit  the second is mayb two unit in term of how far you go
i just have anoth object to take out the word    predomin      i don   t think the sentenc make ani sens if you take it out    laughter   you have to put someth in   you cannot say that it is our onli problem
well  right   you realli have to rewrit the sentenc   let me tri to evalu this with your guidanc    laughter   so i agre with   that this is one of the toughest one to write and to assess the respons   if you read the commentari  expect are all over the map  and so it is veri difficult to know how this will be taken   i don   t pretend to know  let me start with someth easi   i think that presid   is absolut right   there is no reason to chang paragraph   without a reason   so unless anyon has concern  i   d like to chang paragraph   back to the june languag   okay   that   s the first thing  regard the tougher question   and presid    presid pool  and other have rais an interest possibl   again  without much confid i am go to resist it for the follow reason   the first reason is most that it is complic   laughter  and it move thing around in way that will make it even harder for the market to understand what we   re tri to do  anoth reason is that the statement    although the downsid risk to growth have increas somewhat     if we follow your advic and put it after the new sentenc in paragraph    will essenti say that the financi market are the reason that the downsid risk have increas  wherea there are other factor   the hous market  automobil sale  and thing of that sort   that could be view as increas the downsid risk   so i guess that   s my recommend   on    predomin     i think the word has been neutral to a signific extent by it use   you may recal that we use the phrase    predomin polici concern     and we chang the second sentenc  and the market base on that decid that we had gone all the way to balanc   my concern is that  if we get rid of    predomin    and if we mention the downsid risk to growth anywher  that will be view as have gone most to balanc  and i don   t think that   s where we are right now as a committe  i have one thought  which may have come too late in the day here   this is go back to paragraph       financi market have been volatil in recent week      presid   rais the idea of chang that to someth about risk   one small concern i have  and it would have been good had we put this in earlier  is that the phrase refer to someth go on in the market per se and not an effect of the market on the economi  which heighten some of the put risk a littl   an altern would be to replac that first phrase with someth like    investor have demand greater compens for risk      that would be a market develop that evid affect yield and borrow cost   i see some nod   i see some frown   so i   m not sure
could you clarifi   are you say that you would then get rid of    credit condit have becom tighter
no      investor have demand greater compens for risk  credit condit have becom tighter for some household and busi      all right   no excit
it is not clear whether probabl distribut over the fundament have shift or whether the probabl distribut over margin util has shift   do you see what i mean
no    laughter
it is not clear whether their attitud to a given risk have chang or their assess of the magnitud of the risk have chang
oh  i see what you   re say   well  actual the way i phrase it was intent not to say that risk have increas but rather to say that the price of risk has increas
but that say one of them   that say the latter
but that   s what i want it to say
but that   s not clear   it is not clear that it isn   t just a widen of the probabl distribut over the relev outcom
okay   i don   t see ani snowbal    laughter
don   t give up yet      risk premium in financi market have increas  credit condit have tighten for some household      it is true that you don   t realli know what the sourc of the increas in risk premium is  but it is true that risk premium have increas   volatil itself is not particular interest from a polici perspect  and as mani peopl have said  we   re not here to damp volatil   the consider relev to the macroeconomi and to financi market stabil in some sens are what happen   and that   s a differ way of say it
no  it encompass both of what i was refer to  and so that would be a way to do it
i would agre with that   now  that  sn   t say that price has chang   let me give you an exampl   kimber clark last week went to market on    billion in debt   they couldn   t move it unless they had a chang of control provis   no price impact   so it is part of the risk premium  but we   re not see price per se   i like the word that presid   has suggest
governor     i   m sorri   you were next
yes  in principl i think that is a good way to character what   s go on   but go back to the criteria that i was use  in mani case the risk premium have simpli move close to histor level from record low   so if they stay at histor averag over  e  that   s not necessarili someth that   s wrong or problemat   it may be veri difficult to take that phrase away if risk premium stay where they are in at least some of the market   i don   t think that   s necessarili a bad thing  and i   ve heard a number of peopl around the tabl suggest that   in certain market  they have been abov histor averag  but in mani market they have simpli move to the histor averag  and i am just a bit concern about be abl to take that away
well  just to say    have increas    and then have the next phrase say    credit condit have becom tighter    also make no valu judgment on whether they   re appropri
mr  chairman
governor kohn  do you have a comment
yes  i do   i see whi you want to take out    volatil     and i agre with that  unlik presid    i think it is import to keep credit condit in there becaus it   s more than just price   so i was a littl concern that say    risk premium have increas and credit condit have becom tighter    put it all on price   suppos we didn   t have the phrase in red   we just had    owe to develop in financi market  credit condit have becom tighter     or    reflect recent develop in financi market  credit condit have becom tighter
i am okay with that
i prefer    risk premium
you could just go back to the origin languag in the bluebook   it say essenti the same thing   just chang the sentenc around
i think that is a good idea   credit condit are becom tighter   we saw that in the bank survey befor ani of this happen
that is in the bluebook
i understand  but i think that some acknowledg of the effect of financi market develop in the recent week on the economi is need just to make sure that peopl understand that we   re awak
so the propos languag is    risk premium    and    financi market
have increas  credit condit have becom tighter      and the hous
fine with me
i just want to point out  mr  chairman  that those two claus seem to overlap to a consider degre     tighter risk premium    and    tighter credit condit      it   s not clear to me precis what distinct we   re tri to draw there
well     credit condit    is more general becaus it can encompass both price and nonpric
so it rais a question in my mind as to whi the first claus is necessari
well  think of it as be market trade asset  and    credit condit    sound like mortgag  retail type of credit provis   presid hoenig
i   m okay if you want to put    premium     the vice chairman   s languag  in there   but i think that the market have becom more volatil  and noth is wrong with say that  and credit condit have tighten  which is a fact  and peopl are think about the volatil of the market   so that is on their mind   we   re acknowledg it  as you said  and so i was comfort with the languag
okay   let me just get a sens around the tabl  if i could   i think presid hoenig make the point that volatil in financi market could be view as have an effect on the economi through uncertainti and those sort of factor   one option is    financi market have been volatil in recent week      the second option is    risk premium in financi market have increas      who want    volatil       laughter   i see five   who want to make the chang
i guess i would
oh  great    laughter   all right
we flip a coin
you have the decid vote
