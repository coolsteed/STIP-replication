move   discuss   thank you   all right   let   s turn now to the desk oper   bill
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the handout that you have in front of you   in my mind  there are three key question   first  how did the problem in the subprim mortgag area   with loss that probabl will ul  turn out to be in a rang of      billion to      billion   lead to such broad market distress   second  what is the caus of the dysfunct in u s  and european money market   third  how far along are we in term of the adjust process   in other word  when might we anticip a resumpt of normal market function   turn to the first question  the loss in subprim mortgag had wide rang effect becaus the poor invest perform made investor much less will to invest in structur financ product more general   investor lost confid becaus high rate secur that referenc subprim asset perform poor and becaus investor found it difficult to valu complex structur financ product  this loss of confid trigger sever broader develop   the inabl of mortgag origin to securit nonconform mortgag loan  the rapid    materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     contract of the asset back commerci paper  abcp  market  the virtual shutdown of the collater debt oblig  cdo  and collater loan oblig  clo  market  the sharp shift we saw into and out of treasuri onli versus prime money market mutual fund  which in turn disrupt the treasuri bill market  and the anticip pressur on bank balanc sheet and the upward pressur on term fund rate   the pressur on bank balanc sheet is come from three major sourc   first  investor demand for securit non agenc mortgag back secur has dri up  bank origin now have to hold such loan in their bank portfolio   second  bank backstop liquid facil have been trigger as investor appetit for asset back commerci paper has fallen sharpli   third  bank are expect to have difficulti syndic the bridg loan that they provid to financ leverag buyout   of these three sourc of pressur  the rollup of abcp program has been  in my view  the most import   the magnitud of the potenti fund requir is the largest  and how much will come back onto bank balanc sheet is veri uncertain  the constraint on mortgag loan origin can be seen most visibl in the widen of the spread between fix rate prime jumbo mortgag loan rate and conform mortgag loan rate   as you can see in exhibit    the spread has widen from around    basi point to around     basi point in recent week   the sharp contract in the abcp market began when commerci paper investor becam awar that their invest could be vulner to loss but were uncertain as to the extent of their exposur in particular program   this fear of loss had a legi  basi for those abcp program that financ mortgag relat asset without full bank credit enhanc   an inabl to roll over these program in the current market would forc the liquid of the asset   in the current market  that could lead to investor loss   the problem start in extend commerci paper market program  where the credit enhanc backstop by bank was typic either absent or less than     percent   the problem then quick migrat to structur invest vehicl  siv  program  which suffer from similar shortcom   from there  the problem spread as risk avers investor start to shun the entir asset class   asset back commerci paper rate rose for those program that were abl to roll over their outstand commerci paper   this is shown in exhibit    which compar unsecur and secur commerci paper rate   the volum of outstand asset back commerci paper shrank sharpli as some issuer were unabl to roll over their matur paper   exhibit   illustr the downtrend in the volum of outstand abcp   exhibit   show the matur structur of outstand asset back commerci paper and highlight the high proport of paper that is now be roll on an overnight basi   the pressur on the asset back commerci paper market was temporarili exacerb by the behavior of money market mutual fund investor  who shift fund last month from prime money market fund to treasuri onli money market fund  see exhibit      becaus the total asset in money market mutual fund are near four  e the size of outstand treasuri bill  these flow led to a larg  albeit most transitori fall in treasuri bill yield   that is shown in exhibit     the good news is that the money flow into the prime money mutual fund have stabil   this reflect greater discern among investor about the risk associ with differ type of asset back commerci paper and the widen yield differenti between prime and treasuri onli money market fund   it is noteworthi that those area of the asset back commerci paper market with under structur problem   primarili the extend  siv  and siv lite portion of the market   repres onli a small proport of total asset back commerci paper outstand   for exampl  as shown in exhibit    siv program repres onli about   percent of the asset back commerci paper market befor the recent sharp contract   moreov  as shown in exhibit    much of the asset back commerci paper market   not financ residenti mortgag asset back secur  so there is less uncertainti about the under valu of the asset   also  much of the market has solid credit support  with     percent bank credit enhanc   this suggest that  as  e pass  investor will gradual be abl to distinguish between the differ type of the abcp program and stabil will return to the multi seller  bank sponsor program   alreadi  the pace of contract of the overal abcp market has slow signific   howev  the extend and siv program are like to continu to be under pressur   the third sourc of balanc sheet pressur stem from the sharp contract in cdo and clo issuanc   as can be seen in exhibit    cdo and clo issuanc volum have plummet in recent month   the virtual closur of the cdo market has led  in turn  to a virtual cessat of high yield debt issuanc   illustr in exhibit      these develop have creat uncertainti for commerci and invest bank about their abil to syndic the larg volum of loan and debt commit that they have made to financ privat equiti buyout   these institut are face with the prospect that they may have to carri such loan on their book for an extend period at a discount to par valu   syndic will be more difficult becaus the abil to transform a larg proport of these oblig into market invest grade product through the alchemi of structur financ is not current an avail option   this pressur on bank balanc sheet   both exist and anticip   has led to signific dysfunct in financi market   in particular  primari dealer have pull back in their willing to financ the secur posit of invest bank  hedg fund  and other leverag investor   exhibit    illustr the median repurchas rate bid ask spread by primari dealer for three type of collater   gse mbs  prime mbs  and high yield corpor debt   at overnight  one week  and one month matur   as can be seen  there has been an upward trend in bid ask spread  especi at the one month matur    exhibit    illustr the median haircut appli against such collater   again  there has been an increas  which has been particular pronounc at the one month matur   at the same  e  this balanc sheet pressur and worri about counterparti risk have led to a signific rise in term borrow rate   bank that are seller of fund have shift to the overnight market to preserv their liquid  and this shift has starv the term market of fund  push those rate higher   as shown in exhibit     the spread between the one month libor and the one month interest rate swap rate has widen sharpli  and the one month libor has general trade consider abov the anticip level of the overnight feder fund rate   the same pressur on fund rate has been also evid in euribor rate  see exhibit       the rise in term rate has push bank that depend on fund from the interbank market into the overnight market   in addit  these depositori institut have turn to the feder home loan bank system as a sourc of term fund   for exampl  fhlb advanc rose      billion in august   in contrast  despit the    basi point reduct in the spread between the discount rate and the feder fund rate target  the dollar valu of discount window borrow remain modest  as shown in exhibit      this reflect the lower cost of fhlb advanc  the abil to borrow at longer term from the fhlb  and the lack of stigma in use such advanc as a sourc of fund   so where do we go from here   clear  the adjust process is far from over  asset back commerci paper program are still be roll up  and there is consider uncertainti about how difficult it will be to roll some of this paper over quarter end   moreov  it remain unclear what proport of leverag loan commit commerci and invest bank will be abl to syndic and at what price   despit the big backlog and the end of the august doldrum  there has  as yet  been littl syndic activ   the good news  of cours  is that as  e pass  the uncertainti about bank balanc sheet pressur and fund requir should lessen   moreov  investor    abil to distinguish between    good    and    bad    abcp program and structur financ product should continu to improv   the bad news is that the stress caus by the forcibl deleverag of the nonbank financi sector could lead to further loss accompani by headlin that could further damag investor confid   moreov  the increas relianc by bank on overnight fund increas rollov risk and may limit the willing of bank to expand their balanc sheet to accommod the deleverag of the nonbank financi sector   in the mortgag sector  depositori institut will undoubt   at the right price   take up the slack in the prime jumbo mortgag market   but nondepositori institut are unlik to be abl to origin and securit nonconform mortgag in appreci volum for some  e   the tone in financi market has improv a bit in recent day   nevertheless  we still appear to be in an environ in which the domin theme is risk avers  this can be seen in a matrix that measur the correl among the price movement in the major asset class  see exhibit       in  e when market are calm and untroubl  the correl coeffici are general low   as you can see in the exhibit  which examin these correl sinc the august   fomc meet  the correl coeffici have been veri high recent   in the foreign exchang market  two develop are worth note   first  the turmoil in money market did impair the function of the foreign exchang swap market   this made it more difficult for bank in europ that are structur short of dollar to obtain the dollar fund need to fund their asset   in recent day  this market function has improv   second  the dollar has weaken   as shown in exhibit     the dollar has fallen to a record low against the euro   but don   t be too impress by that headlin   on a broad trade weight basi  the declin of the dollar has been modest  with a declin of less than   percent from the last fomc meet and a fall of slight more than   percent from the start of the year   moreov  this soft in the dollar   not appear to signal ani fundament shift in the willing of foreign investor to hold dollar denomin asset   instead  it appear to be driven main by chang interest rate expect   as shown in exhibit     the exchang rate of the dollar versus the euro has continu to track chang in expect short term interest rate differenti between the unit state and europ   not surpris  our dealer survey reveal a larg declin in short term rate expect   exhibit    and    compar the dealer survey befor the august   fomc meet and befor the current fomc meet   the   circl repres the averag of the dealer forecast  and the blue circl repres the rang size by the number of dealer at each valu   as can be seen  the averag of the dealer modal forecast for mid      has fallen more than    basi point   market expect   as reflect by the solid bold line   have declin about the same amount and remain below the averag dealer modal forecast   with respect to the outcom of this meet  a slight major of dealer expect a    basi point reduct in the target feder fund rate rather than a    basi point cut   onli one dealer expect no chang in the feder fund rate target   uncertainti about the short term interest rate path has also increas   this is evid both in the dealer survey and in the probabl distribut of rate outcom impli by option price on eurodollar futur   as can be seen in exhibit     the probabl distribut of rate outcom has becom much broader sinc the august   fomc meet   final  open market oper sinc the last fomc meet warrant some discuss   as you know  in earli august  follow persist upward pressur on the feder fund rate and an extraordinarili larg reserv ad provis by the ecb  we aggress ad reserv on august      that provis of reserv did break the upward pressur on the feder fund rate  and the feder fund rate trade notabl soft over the remaind of that two week reserv mainten period   sinc that  e  we have attempt to pull back on our provis of reserv in order to push the feder fund rate back up toward it target   notic that the blue bar in exhibit     which measur daili excess reserv befor borrow  have been general in negat territori over the past month   although we have had some success in push the effect feder fund rate higher  it has general trade over the past month below the    percent target   our effort to push the feder fund rate back toward the target have been undermin by sever factor   first  expect about the possibl of an intermeet cut in the feder fund rate target have caus the feder fund rate to trade somewhat soft   also  in recent day  the effect rate has been held down somewhat by expect of a rate cut at today   s meet   second  the narrow margin between the discount rate and the feder fund rate target make it more difficult to push up the effect feder fund rate   the upper band of the corridor abov    percent is now half as wide as befor even as the lower bound for the feder fund rate remain at   percent   the lower discount rate act as a cap on how high the feder fund rate can climb when reserv are tight   third  we have had bad luck in the sens that most of our forecast miss in term of autonom factor that affect reserv   such as float  treasuri balanc  currenc demand  and borrow at the window   have caus us to inadvert leav more reserv in the bank system than we had intend   our difficulti in push up the effect rate can be illustr by our experi last wednesday  the last day of the two week reserv mainten period   despit a consist stingi provis of reserv that result in    billion of overnight primari credit borrow for the day and      billion in total borrow  the effect rate for that wednesday was      percent   i would note  though  that in the past two day we have actual push the fund rate effect up to it target   there were no foreign exchang oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the august   fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
are there ani question for bill   presid
i appreci your comment on this last point  but i think that the fact that the fed fund rate has been trade so low for so long is problemat   certain around august    when we start the intervent  that   s all understand   but the committe made it veri clear at that  e that it wasn   t chang the target fund rate  and yet for the past month it has been essenti below   so in my mind that has rais three question   one is a technic question about our abil to actual target the fed fund rate use the procedur that we have in place   we continu to quot a price target and tri to control it use quantiti   i still believ it would be a lot easier just to set the price target and buy and sell   that   s an oper question that i think is on the tabl for anoth day   it also rais the question to me as i watch it go on whi the desk did not choos to interven more frequent dure the day to be more aggress when they saw that their forecast for the day   s balanc was not accur   there is noth that say you can   t go back in dure the day to help rectifi some of that  and i   d like some explan as to whi we didn   t do that or whether that   s an option   the third question is actual a more serious one becaus it combin a technic issu and a philosoph one   i think allow the fed fund rate to trade so low for so long away from our target realli creat a credibl problem for this committe   it put us in an awkward posit now becaus  in effect  it hasn   t gone unnot by the invest communiti   some have call it a    stealth    rate cut that is alreadi in effect   some have said that the fed has alreadi cut the fed fund rate  and it put the committe   s decis today in a somewhat awkward posit becaus peopl look back and say     well  they have alreadi done it      so i think it is import that we think about mechan and way to ensur   at least go forward   that  if the committe has a target  we can be success in achiev it   so i   d just like some further enlighten there  if i could
turn first to your first question  whi we do it the way that we do   well  with the new author to pay interest on reserv  we are go to take a pretti broad look at the whole issu of how we target the feder fund rate and how we manag reserv more general  so i think that   s a legi  question  and it is go to be done as part of that process   obvious  the way we do it today is base on a sort of histor evolut that start when the fed did not reveal what the feder fund rate target was   so i think it   s probabl fair to say that four or five year from now  when we have that new author  we may be do thing quit differ  in term of the issu of go back in later in the day  the problem there is that we don   t realli know what   s happen to the autonom factor until the next morn   so we don   t know exact how we   re do in term of track the reserv provis relat to our forecast in real  e   we don   t have that
but you see the rate
we do see the rate   we could be more aggress and push peopl to the window  but i think it is import in this environ not to be contribut to market turmoil   we felt that the right thing to do was to err on the side of not push peopl forcibl to the window when the market was under some distress   i would also say that the fed fund rate  while it has trade soft  it hasn   t trade that soft   the effect rate so far this month has been       and i think that  come into this meet  we have pretti much elimin from the mind of peopl in the market that there was a stealth eas  especi in light of where the feder fund rate has been trade over the past week   so i don   t see that as a signific issu for this meet
thank you  mr  chairman   bill  i just want to make sure that i understand what you said in your excel present   i think i heard you say that  as  e pass  investor in the market will becom more discrimin   alreadi we   re see sign of return stabil  i   m tri to differenti between what we had earlier   serious counterparti risk and phobia   and what we have now   which seem to be concern about balanc sheet risk   i want to understand better the distinct between the two   i read egon   s brief last night  which by the way was veri  veri solid   what i read was that the largest bank are well posit to absorb even larger exposur than they current anticip  and the number in that document was    trillion   a signific number for five bank to absorb   given what you just present to us   i think i interpret you correct   the concern about counterparti risk is diminish  but it is still there  the balanc sheet risk issu is somewhat defin  although there are uncertainti   you mention them yourself   there   s headlin risk  which cut two way  by the way  and i want to talk about that dure my other intervent   there is also a surpris loss that might occur   could you distinguish for us whether or not we   ve seen a reduct in counterparti risk  and if so  could you defin it somewhat   how serious is the balanc sheet risk from your perspect against the background of the brief we receiv last night  which indic that it appear to be manag
well  it   s difficult to sort out exact how much of that term premium that we see in the term fund market repres counterparti risk versus balanc sheet constraint   i think in the unit state that it is probabl more of a balanc sheet issu   in europ it   s probabl more counterparti risk   the general sens is that the u s  bank are veri healthi and  as you note  well capit   howev  the fact that you still have quit a bit of room befor you hit that boundari of    well capit     sn   t mean that the bank aren   t concern about potenti balanc sheet pressur   the problem they have right now is that they can   t realli size with ani accuraci how much will be come onto their balanc sheet over the next few month through asset back commerci paper  through bank conduit  and through other thing for which they may be on the hook that they didn   t expect to be on the hook for   so i wouldn   t take the boundari line of    well capit    versus    not well capit    as the constraint   i think the constraint actual start to bind quit a bit befor you get to that point
we talk about the conduit question somewhat on the call   again  i assum we   ve done sensit analysi to the degre that we can in term of the potenti for have to absorb some of that risk and bring it onto the balanc sheet   is that correct
the analysi that has been done has suggest that the bank are well capit and should  with one or two except  be abl to handl this balanc sheet expans reason well  but they can   t say that with absolut certainti
of cours  of cours
anoth thing happen is that there is a potenti problem on the earn side   you can imagin a worst case scenario in which you can   t syndic ani of the loan and then the loan have to be mark down signific   that has an earn consequ   so then the balanc sheet is go to be affect not just by what   s happen in term of the asset but also by what   s happen in term of the capit   i think the uncertainti about it will probabl turn out to be more of a problem than the actual realiti  but it   s go to take  e for us to find out what the actual realiti is
may i ask one more question  mr  chairman   at the last meet i ask about commerci paper risk in europ and got nod of not a great risk   is there anyth that you see or that you can think of that we don   t know or that hasn   t been in this present that would indic signific potenti for risk
i would hesit to say that i know with ani great clariti that there   s noth els there in europ   i think we have all been a bit surpris by the size of some of the conduit that some european bank were sponsor relat to their capit   i would be veri hesit to say that we have transpar regard that marketplac and know with certainti that there   s noth els there
thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
i would like to return to the issu that presid   rais  which i think are veri serious for this committe   mayb the question is what you would have done differ with the benefit of hindsight to have come closer to the target   my    back of the envelop    calcul start with august   or august    is that mayb the fed fund rate averag about   percent   so a full   percentag point below the target   if you felt constrain to enter the market later in the day becaus of concern about ad to turmoil  you certain could have consult with the committe about the tradeoff there   but it   seem to me that  when we establish a target  we have an oblig to achiev that target   obvious  earli in the period er on the side of generos was no problem  but it seem to me that we gave away some degre of freedom  shall we say  by the way thing proceed   i find that of consider concern
but i would just reemphas the fact that we did tri to be stingi   our ex ant provis of reserv was less than what we thought that the market need  and we thought that would push up the feder fund rate   we do not have control over all the factor that affect the demand for reserv  and unfortun they consist came in on the side of ad more reserv into the system than we intend   that said  we have been pretti consist tri to push back on the market to get the effect feder fund rate back toward the target  and i think we can say that we made it by the meet   i think there are veri few peopl in the market today who believ that there   s a stealth eas in the market
mr  chairman
just to reinforc what bill said   of cours  we spent a lot of  e think through exact the risk that you are worri about in this context  and we   ll have a lot to reflect on in term of the natur of the regim and what the legisl author give us go forward   but i think that bill and his peopl realli had just a simpl choic  which was   particular at that point late in august and earli in septemb   whether they should have act in a way that rais the possibl of have fed fund trade signific abov target over this period  if you look at the experi of the other central bank manag this situat in the past six week or so and what happen when they prematur act in a way that end with have their rate trade substanti firm to target and the effect of that on behavior and the market  i am complet confid that our guy er in the right direct   i also don   t believ  just to reinforc what bill said  that anybodi serious in the market view what the desk was do and the behavior regard where fed fund were trade as have a signal effect or as constrain the flexibl of the committe   it is true that you had a bunch of peopl in mid august talk about that possibl and wonder whether they should read the veri soft trade of fed fund as an indic of the stanc of monetari polici go forward  but i think that got suck out of the market relat quick  again  i think you   re rais absolut the right question   we grappl with those question everi day   we basic made the judgment that to adopt a much more aggress stanc in be stingi with the reserv at various point in this period would have creat too much risk of fed fund trade firm relat to target at a moment when psycholog and confid were veri  veri fragil   i realli think the experi of other central bank was a good counter exampl of the cost of the altern strategi   now  of cours  we will have a chanc over  e to go back and do a much more detail review  anoth thing i would say about come in later in the day is that it   s veri import to have some stabil in the basic framework with which the desk oper  particular after what we did the week befor august    and on august      to have a lot of chang at the same  e in the standard oper procedur of the desk would have creat more risk of uncertainti about what we were do   we were tri to find a balanc between the imper of a relat steadi hand and the risk that you are phrase in absolut legi  question   we   ll have a chanc to reflect on a lot of thing after this period  but my own view is that they made exact the right judgment
one complex in this whole period is that there is a surpris larg demand for dollar in europ  which of cours is earli in the day   so the fed fund rate was open veri  veri high  veri tight  and then there were judgment about how to bring it down dure the peak trade period of the u s  market   that led to guess about how mani reserv to inject befor the end of the day   so the dysfunct in the normal interbank market process   precautionari demand for dollar in europ   led to some veri unusu stress earli in the day  which complic bill   s job consider
we still love bill  by the way
oh  we all love bill    laughter
for the record  i laugh
i want to ask about the term fund market  and i want you to help us understand what we know about that   in typic  e  like befor this  do we know how much lend was done at term in the fed fund market   do we know what name were typic involv   is there a flow across the bank system of some particular structur   and what kind of spread are typic   then  what have we been observ now  in contrast   relat to this  do we know what name are borrow at term now   do we have a sens of the extent to which the elev spread is a risk premium or some other effect   are peopl who are borrow at term tap out at the home loan bank     that have some signific in the term market   is there an interact between option at the home loan bank and the term market
on the question about volum  there   s no question that volum went up consider in the overnight market   about    percent  as near as we can judg over this period  sinc the term market was most shut down  especi in term fed fund  there has been veri littl in term fed fund trade   you can almost infer that most volum is done overnight but probabl    percent or so is done term   almost all of that crowd back into the overnight market   so there was an increas  as near as we can measur  of about    percent in overnight fed fund activ over the past month compar with normal   now  in term of who is actual borrow at term   well  veri few peopl were actual borrow at term   there was probabl a bit of a    lemon    problem in the term market in the sens that   becaus term rate were elev and those rate were not veri attract econom   your want to borrow in the term market was a sign that you were probabl not in good shape in term of your own liquid posit   i think that contribut to the shutdown of the term market   becaus of the econom realli   whi are you do that unless you   re in bad shape and you realli need the fund   i think that contribut to the shrink of the term market   realli two thing were go on   one  bank that had the fund to lend didn   t want to lend term becaus they weren   t sure what they would need that money for down the road  depend on what was go to come onto their balanc sheet   two  peopl who want to borrow term were the least attract borrow   that caus the market to essenti dri up over this period   i think it is start to come back   we   re not back to normal becaus obvious the term rate are still somewhat elev relat to the overnight rate   so it   s still not that attract from an econom perspect  but it is certain more attract than it was even a week ago
if i could just follow up  i know the desk track overnight fed fund trade  and you get from the dealer the quantiti at differ rate in order to calcul the effect rate  are you infer term volum from that  or do we have ani other independ quantit sourc on the volum of term fund
i haven   t actual seen ani volum data on term   they may  in fact  exist  what we did  though  is look at the volum in the overnight feder fund market  and we saw that go up about    percent   so if you start with the premis that the bank that have excess fund to lend aren   t go to chang much month to month  you can pretti much infer that most of it is come out of the term market
both larg bank in our district have gone from be net borrow to be larg net lender   one  in fact  say it   s the largest in the market and lend     billion to     billion everi night overnight  and they use to borrow a coupl of billion dollar everi day  could someth like that account for the volum in the fund market
yes  obvious that move in that direct  but if i rememb correct  the number on the volum of the fed fund market is in the      billion to      billion rang  twenti percent on that kind of level is quit a bit bigger than what you   re see
that would includ broker trade and nonbrok trade
but  mr  chairman  if i   m not mistaken  i think that the term market for interbank liquid is larg offshor in europ  not in fed fund onshor   i   m not sure that help when we get into this context
right   i was ask about the demand   i was curious about what we know about the domest part
our research peopl have tri to figur out whether they could infer or take from fedwir data other indic of who   s lend at what matur and who   s borrow at what matur and what the balanc is   my own sens from look at this  and mayb i just haven   t figur it out yet  is that it  sn   t give you the kind of clariti that you were look for
it   s an over the counter market  and in most over the counter market we do not have the kind of volum data we would like to have
just one tini thing   in the overnight market  from the broker  we have volum trade at differ rate   for the term fed fund rate  which is show up in a graph or two   i can   t rememb where     that come off broker screen   we don   t have trade on that  do we
i don   t know the answer to that
there is not a regular data sourc
all right   thank
are there other question for bill   if not  i need a vote to ratifi domest open market oper
without object   thank you   may we turn now to the staff present on the econom situat   dave   and    son will start with the econom overview  and then   will make a few comment on the project that we submit   dave
thank you  mr  chairman      this has been a far from placid  e   inde  the intermeet period has been mark by financi tumult of such a magnitud as to signific alter the outlook for the economi   a deeper retrench in u s  stock market  more cautious credit provis  and more serious disrupt to econom growth abroad are now expect to combin to produc a sharper deceler in output than we had project in august      these word were taken from the first page in the  book of septemb         laughter   while the particular obvious differ in mani import respect from that period  we onc again face substanti financi turbul  and onc again  we have mark down our project of real activ on the expect that recent financi develop will impart consider restraint on activ in the quarter ahead   befor explain these chang  let me read to you from the first page of anoth  book  and i quot      t he economi has continu to exhibit remark dynam  generat hefti gain in employ and incom   we have tack about   percentag point onto our previous forecast of first quarter real gdp growth  and the evid momentum of domest demand has led us to elev our project for output growth over the near term a bit as well      that passag was taken from the  book of march       just six month after the onset of that period of financi disturb   needless to say  the experi of that episod was not lost on us as we approach the construct of the current forecast   but neither were the episod of the summer of      and the fall of       when we thought financi and other factor would result in a period of below trend growth but that outright recess would be avoid   so the question is  are we project too much or too littl weak in real activ over the next sever quarter   answer that question has two aspect  one is whether we have correct gaug the magnitud of the potenti restraint on real activ aris from the recent develop in mortgag and other credit market   the other is whether we have appropri assess the under strength of the economi be subject to those shock   i think it   s fair to say that part of our mistak in      was a failur to appreci just how strong the u s  economi was as we enter that period   could we be make that mistak again   possibl   the incom data did lead us to revis up our es  of the growth in real gdp in the second and third quarter by   and    percentag point  respect   most notabl  consum spend has surpris us to the upsid   last friday   s report on retail sale provid anoth posit innov   although the spend figur for august were right in line with our expect  the upward revis to juli suggest that the growth of real pce in the third quarter will be about   percentag point stronger than we project in last week   s  book   elsewher  the growth of export has continu to outstrip our expect  provid greater impetus to domest product   that ad impetus may help explain factori output  which has also been a bit stronger  on net  than anticip in our august project   manufactur ip exclud motor vehicl is es  to have fallen     percent last month  but that declin came on the heel of upward revis increas of     percent in june and juli   we are now project manufactur ip exclud motor vehicl to have increas    percent in the third quarter  a bit more than in our august forecast   not all the news  howev  has been favor   despit a rebound in motor vehicl sale in august  the automak still found themselv with uncomfort high inventori at the end of the summer and have announc substanti reduct in assembl schedul for the fourth quarter   in our project  the cut in motor vehicl product lop    percentag point off the growth of real gdp in the fourth quarter  about   percentag point more than we had earlier expect   the labor market report also was a bit weaker than we had pencil into our project at the  e of the august fomc meet   privat payrol increas just        last month  which  combin with downward revis in june and juli  left the level of employ about         shi of our expect   nevertheless  we didn   t attach a great deal of signal to the employ report in term of it implic for real activ   as you know  despit the fact that real gdp was come in close to our expect most of this year  we had been fair consist surpris to the upsid by employ   for the most part  we had attribut that surpris strength to an unusu degre of labor hoard that was result in a more pronounc cyclic sag in product than is typic   now that the employ figur have soften  we are inclin to let much of that soft show through in higher labor product rather than weaker output   still  there is no deni that labor demand over the past three month now look a bit weaker than we expect   we see the incom data taken togeth as suggest that there was a bit more strength to the expans through the summer than we had earlier recogn   but we have seen littl to suggest that the economi was either gather ani momentum or serious falter as we enter the period of increas financi turbul  obvious  get the start point right for the project is import   but the main action in this forecast has been our reaction to develop in mortgag and other credit market   i would love to dazzl you this morn with precis scientif es  of the effect on spend and activ of difficulti involv subprim mortgag  structur invest vehicl  leverag loan  and the like   but  sad  that will not be the case   rather  becaus you seem to be on the brink of join me in the humbl world of forecast  i thought that i would invit you to don your hair net and white butcher smock and join me for a tour of the sausag factori   laughter   the difficulti we confront in this forecast is that  even after decad worth of research on credit channel and financi acceler   much of it done by economist at all level in the feder reserv system   the financi transmiss mechan in most of the workhors macro model that we use for forecast are still rudimentari   as a result  much of what has occur  sn   t even direct feed into our model   but that  sn   t mean that it isn   t import   inde  the residu in our main spend equat seem to be negat correl with measur of financi stress   in other word  our model tend to overpredict spend in period of financi disturb   to be sure  that general tendenc is not evid in all episod  shortfal in spend were sizabl in the    headwind    period of the earli     s and in the aftermath of the stock market collaps in the earli part of this decad   but we have found littl evid of ani materi effect on spend dure the         episod   in veri broad term  we were guid in our revis to the forecast by the averag histor tendenc of these spend equat to overpredict in period of financi stress   as for the specif  we made adjust in those area that seem most like to be affect in this particular episod   hous  of cours  is at the epicent of the current financi shock   in respons to the intensifi problem in mortgag market and the increas bleak anecdot  we slash our hous forecast signific further   we now expect new home sale to drop anoth    percent by the end of this year and singl famili start to drop anoth    percent by earli next year   if this forecast come to pass  this hous downturn will come close to match in sever that of the late     s and earli     s   under this project is an assumpt that nonprim origin will remain virtual dead in come month and stage onli a modest and partial rebound over the next year and a half   we also expect some of the spillov that we have seen recent in prime jumbo mortgag to persist for a while  though the effect on hous demand from this part of the market are like to be much smaller  moreov  in contrast to the partial recoveri in nonprim mortgag origin  we are expect a full recoveri in jumbo mortgag to occur by earli        obvious  our es  of the effect eman from nonprim and jumbo market are subject to consider uncertainti   in term of both depth and durat   as for the rest of the economi  we don   t think it will escap entir unscath by the recent turmoil in financi market  and we have made some modest downward adjust also to busi invest and consum spend   in particular  we have mark down a bit our forecast for nonresidenti construct on the expect that higher borrow cost and tighter underwrit standard will hold down the volum of commerci real estat lend and construct activ in come quarter   in that regard  we have alreadi seen some increas in    bust contract    for commerci properti transact   like the effect in residenti mortgag market  the restrain influenc on commerci construct are assum to fade by the end of next year   we have also revis down our project for equip spend  but here the stori is a bit differ becaus we are not realli anticip a spillov that will result in signific fund problem for most nonfinanci firm   rather  in previous forecast  we had incorpor an extra dollop of spend growth to reflect the general strength of corpor balanc sheet and the tendenc of some of our model to underpredict equip spend over the past few year   with heighten uncertainti and less favor financi condit  we have move the e s forecast down closer to the model in both our august and our septemb forecast   final  we made a modest downward adjust to our consumpt forecast  in part to account for the likelihood of some tighten of term and standard on consum lend and for the possibl that weaker home price may make it more difficult or expens for household to financ consumpt through the equiti in their home   we also assum that there will be some hit to consum sen ent in an economi with a weaken labor market  ongo strain in financi market  and continu downbeat news on hous price  home sale  and foreclosur   the restraint impos by these factor is assum to fade over the next year   again  on much the same schedul as we are expect the financi restraint to lessen   i think we have the sign right here  but i must admit that this element of our forecast seem the most problemat to me   to be sure  we   ve alreadi seen a fall in consum sen ent that  if sustain  would impli a drag on spend go forward that is at least as larg as is incorpor in our forecast   still  the direct fallout of recent develop for the cost and avail of consum credit could be quit limit  and consum sen ent could recov more quick than is assum in the baselin   i would be more worri about the upsid risk of this aspect of our project if i didn   t also see some sizabl downsid risk to other element of our baselin forecast   first  even with the   percent declin we have project over the next two year  hous price will remain at histor high level relat to rent   with foreclosur increas  there is a clear risk that the drop in home price could well be deeper and fa  than we expect   second  implicit in our forecast is the assumpt that we are experienc the worst of the financi turmoil now  there would seem to be more downsid risk than upsid risk to this assumpt   final  we are still project what amount to a veri soft land   the unemploy rate rise by a few tenth  growth converg to potenti  and inflat level out near current rate   such an outcom would be near unpreced   turn to our inflat forecast  we did not receiv ani news that materi affect our outlook   both headlin and core pce price in juli came in a bit lower than we had been forecast   for the most part  the key condit factor govern our inflat project chang littl over the intermeet period   food and energi price were near unrevis  nonoil import price were a touch lower  reflect lower commod price  and most measur of inflat expect have been rough unchang   the onli adjust of note in our inflat forecast was the   percentag point reduct that we made in our es  of the nairu  we did so becaus of some tendenc of our wage and price equat to overpredict inflat over the past few year and becaus we   ve seen a continu of some of the structur forc in labor market that we thought had lower the nairu in earlier period   the adjust also better align our es  of the nairu with other read of labor market tight   all told  some slack in resourc util now emerg in this forecast  howev  becaus the es  slope of our aggreg suppli function is quit flat and inflat expect are expect to remain reason well anchor  this chang is pretti small potato for our price forecast   inde  it trim onli     percentag point from our forecast of overal and core pce price inflat in both      and        that conclud my tour of the sausag factori   i hope it was somewhat reveal  though i recogn that sausag factori can test the convict of even the most ardent propon of full transpar     will now continu our present
in the intern divis  we  too  were challeng to assess the avalanch of event and inform that arriv dure the intermeet period and to make our best judgment as to how these develop would affect the rest of the global economi and the u s  extern sector   one strike featur of the baselin forecast that result is the differ between prospect for the industri countri and those for the emerg market economi   for the industri countri  the surpris in the latest data were general negat  and consider financi turmoil has been evid in the market in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada  in contrast  the most recent surpris in econom data for the emerg market economi have general been posit  and so far there has been littl evid of financi disrupt in those countri   we have revis down total foreign growth a bit less than    percentag point for the second half of this year and   percentag point for next year   this downward revis is due entir to revis to project averag growth in the industri countri   the foreign industri countri are larg be spare the direct effect of contract in the residenti construct sector so far   but they are vulner to negat effect on the pace of overal econom activ from increas volatil and impair function in financi market   as market particip have demand higher return for riski asset and have withdrawn from some exposur  mani asset price in europ and canada have fallen sharpli   as in the unit state  these develop have had implic for bank balanc sheet and earn  as bank have experienc call on line of credit or have taken other step in respons to fund difficulti of conduit and other entiti sponsor by them   some market have experienc sever disrupt  particular european abcp and a portion of the canadian abcp market   although it is too soon for us to have actual data on the consequ of stress be put on bank balanc sheet  we think it is like that some constraint on credit extens will result   in addit  busi and consum confid could well be impair by the general awar of heighten risk and uncertainti as strain persist in financi market   we have veri littl histor experi on which to base a project of the magnitud of these effect   our downward revis of the forecast for real gdp growth in the industri countri in respons to recent financi market event has been small  but we acknowledg that recent financi event have been sever and have last long enough that they like will have some effect on domest demand in the affect countri   other channel of transmiss from develop over the intermeet period are more straightforward   the downward revis to u s  real output growth caus us to lessen project export demand growth in our trade partner  for canada  this channel could be particular strong   in exchang market  the intermeet period has seen upward pressur emerg on the euro  with the dollar euro rate reach new high   this euro appreci should weaken demand by other countri for export from the euro area   the downward revis of real growth in the unit state and in other industri countri should  in turn  reduc demand for export from emerg market economi   econom indic of activ from month befor august have also led us to revis down project growth in the major foreign industri countri   in canada  both retail sale and real manufactur shipment fell in june   in japan  second quarter real gdp growth has been revis to show a declin of more than   percent at an annual rate  and industri product and real household expenditur fell in juli  in the euro area  some moder in expans is impli by recent data   real gdp deceler in the second quarter  and a number of measur of busi sen ent  some of which contain respons after august    have move lower   take all this togeth  we revis down our outlook for real gdp growth in the foreign industri countri  with the chang for the second half negat    percentag point at an annual rate   accord  we now expect that monetari tighten measur in those countri this year and next  which we and the market had been project in august  will not occur except in japan   the upward revis of our figur for averag second quarter real gdp growth in the emerg market economi from   percent at an annual rate to about     percent is indic of the magnitud of posit surpris we receiv about activ in these region   the news was broad base across asia  latin america  and other area  import  at the  e of the august  book  we had alreadi receiv data on china   s near    percent real growth in the second quarter  so the develop under this upward revis aros outsid china   our forecast call for real growth in the emerg market economi to slow to a more sustain pace of near   percent over the forecast period from the veri rapid second quarter outcom  we judg that  go forward  the upward boost provid by fa  activ earlier this year is about offset by the implic of the weaker outlook for the unit state and other industri countri economi  and so our project for real expans in the emerg world is about unchang from august   at this  e  we do not see suffici evid of financi stress in these countri to warrant incorpor into the forecast restraint from credit channel or from confid effect   we do recogn that there are risk to the moder strong forecast we have for the emerg market economi   on the upsid  with the pace of growth so strong in china  we may onc again find that the govern is unabl to put in place suffici restraint to caus a discret step down in real output growth there   howev  chines stock price have continu to rise veri sharpli  and we see a possibl downsid risk to growth from a burst of that bubbl with consequ effect on real spend   it is also possibl that we are underes  the spillov of contractionari pressur from the industri countri onto activ in the rest of the world   for exampl  one channel by which such forc could weaken activ in mexico more than we now expect is through reduc remitt   with the u s  construct sector particular weak  earn of immigr labor and remitt to mexico could be reduc  and the result could be a slow of growth in mexico by more than we have forecast   anoth element of the forecast worth a brief mention is the price of crude oil  the price for spot wti recent surg abov     per barrel as recent data on u s  inventori and some sign of hurrican activ led market particip to bid up price for veri near term oil   howev  price further out on the futur curv have move down sinc august  and our overal path for the price of u s  oil import is littl chang to down slight by the end of        with the futur curv show pronounc backward  the spot price is veri sensit to unfold news   should a serious hurrican or some other factor threaten near term product  we could see an outsiz reaction in the spot price of crude oil   with the shock to the global economi this  e aris larg in the u s  economi  it is fit that we might look to the rest of the world to provid some support to overal demand  some contribut to stabil global econom activ in general  and some help in damp rather than augment fluctuat in u s  econom activ   as we now read the evid  such an outcom is like this  e  strength in the most recent data has led us to revis up project real export growth in the third quarter   although foreign gdp growth has been revis down a bit  therebi weaken export  the dollar is on a path slight lower than in august  and relat price should provid a bit more boost to export than we previous thought   all in all  the contribut to u s  real gdp growth from export should be somewhat more posit over the forecast period than we expect in august despit the global financi turmoil   if the  book forecast is realiz  net export should make a posit arithmet contribut to u s  real gdp growth of about    percentag point dure the second half of this year and about   percentag point next year     will now continu our remark
i will be refer to the tabl in the packag label    materi for fomc brief on septemb trial run project      i will first focus on the near term   the upper panel of the tabl show the forecast for the second half of the year that are impli by the es  that you submit for the first half of      and your project for the year as a whole   particip revis down their expect for real gdp growth in the second half of      by sever tenth of a percentag point   most of you cite the steeper than expect downturn in hous market and tighter credit condit as key factor   the downward revis to output growth was accompani by a slight upward revis to the unemploy rate  your forecast for total inflat in the second half of this year was revis down notic  but the central tendenc for core inflat was unrevis   almost all of you condit your outlook on near term monetari polici eas   a slight major character the  book   s assumpt of a    basi point near term reduct in the target fund rate as appropri monetari polici  but almost as mani think a somewhat larger cumul declin will prove appropri   the lower panel show your annual forecast   the central tendenc for gdp growth in      was revis down about   percentag point and now center on about    percent rather than     percent   the central tendenc for the unemploy rate at the end of the year revis up     percentag point   your total inflat forecast for next year edg down     percentag point  but the central tendenc of your core project was unchang   you also again character your view of uncertainti relat to histor norm and skew   those view presum appli primarili to the relat near term outlook   most of you again see risk to growth as tilt to the downsid   in contrast  almost all of you now see inflat risk as rough balanc rather than as tilt to the upsid   a major of you judg that the uncertainti attend the prospect for econom activ is greater than has been typic in the past   look further ahead  the project for      chang littl   for the first  e  you submit forecast for        the forecast for those year and your commentari suggest that most of you see actual and potenti gdp growth over that period at around     percent  a bit abov the staff   s es    the unemploy rate hover just below   percent    let me note at this point that in the tabl there is a typo in the      column for the unemploy rate   the central tendenc of august project should read     to     percent    with the unemploy rate just a bit abov the    percent that a number of you have identifi as your es  of the nairu  both core inflat and total inflat are expect to edg lower in the out year   at least if you squint hard and focus particular on the lower bound of the central tendenc   laughter   your forecast for core and total inflat in      are essenti unrevis   not surpris  if you view those forecast as reflect to an import    materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     degre your longer run object   the relat narrow central tendenc and rang for total and core inflat in      and      suggest substanti agreement in your view on this score   that conclud our present
thank you   mr    has been read upton sinclair  i think    laughter   question for our colleagu   presid
dave  your present seem to hit on all the right point with regard to the forecast   i am remind  though  that chicago is no longer the hog butcher capit of the world    laughter   still  i have a forecast question   in the brief ye day  you quantifi the financi stress effect on gdp growth that you talk about this morn as about    percentag point in the second half of this year and about    percentag point in        have read the altern simul for a number of year  i know it is not uncommon for an altern that start off with financi difficulti to have a small effect on the outlook  then there is a layer on of the consum sen ent and it drop off a littl more   so i am curious about sort out these compon with an idea toward  if the polici action were taken as a form of insur against these risk  what the earli warn sign that those insur reason are realli no longer critic would be   would we quick see object measur of the turnaround  is consum sen ent the key   presum  financi condit would be a littl more evid in their improv
in this particular forecast  the hous revis is basic all driven off our assumpt about the difficulti in financi market   there are no addit sen ent type effect there   on commerci real estat  i   d say pretti much the same thing   as i note in my brief  the area where we have ventur into a looser sort of approach would be on the consum spend side  where we are not realli expect a signific amount   we would expect some restraint on consum lend and consum borrow associ with tighter underwrit  so there will be some increas in cost   but i don   t think those effect are like to be larg   here we are reli more on an assumpt that some disturb to consum sen ent will persist into next year   one thing that i would be look for   for that piec of the forecast to be wrong and  therefor  for there to be more under strength in the economi   would be a quicker rebound in consum sen ent and a move up to the low   s in relat short order   that piec of what we built into the forecast would look to be question and might be worth a coupl of tenth on the level of gdp next year  the other area where i would be look if i were in your shoe and audit our forecast is that we are expect the labor market to be quit weak move into the fourth quarter and  by the end of the fourth quarter  no employ growth  basic flat employ   thus far  we have seen some uptick in initi claim for unemploy insur   that seem consist with some of the slow that we have alreadi seen   but i think we would have to see a further rise there to be consist with the weak that we are expect in the labor market   if that were not to occur  it would suggest  again  that we are like to be off the mark on the weak in activ that we are project   so i would say that those two area would be at the top of my list for monitor the weak of the forecast  the factori sector would be the final area where i think  again  we get relat  e inform   some of it physic product data  not just data base on the labor market   we are expect thing to be a littl weaker than they were in the middl of the summer but not so weak as they were in august   howev  if we saw continu strength there  i think that would suggest some inconsist with the weak of our forecast
thank you  mr  chairman   my first question was veri much relat to what   just ask   first let me say that i appreci the tour of the sausag factori   it was a littl bloodi  but i want to commend you in that i think it was a fair balanc way of look at what the risk are in various place   but i want to come back to my interpret of what you just said   your answer to presid   sound to me as though a signific part of your downward revis  particular to consumpt  was the factor of consum sen ent  which is loom rather larg in this forecast   while you   ve revis down some other thing  it sound as though you were say that consum sen ent is a particular sensit and difficult thing to forecast   we know it is veri volatil  it can chang rapid   but i heard you say that in the forecast you have implicit reduc consum spend and held it low for a period of  e into the forecast   am i misinterpret your answer there
that is basic correct   i mean  we expect some recoveri   we weren   t expect that august figur to prevail through the forecast period   if that were to occur  we would be look at an even weaker outlook than we are see   again  in all these thing  i don   t want to make it sound too precis  but we do think underwrit standard and the cost of consum credit are like to increas  and that rise is like to imping on consum spend  in our model  the fed fund rate show up in our consumpt equat   we have some consumpt equat that we run with consum credit rate   they don   t actual do ani better than our standard equat   so we have ad a littl for someth that we think is outsid the model on consumpt  probabl oper through the credit channel   but i don   t want to deni that in some sens  again  if we saw a signific rebound in consum sen ent from it current level into the low   s  it would be inconsist with what we are current forecast
that would be a signific chang from the standpoint of how you are view the forecast
that would rais the forecast  as i said
my impress from studi and empir work is that consum sen ent usual is a much bigger coincid indic than it is a forecast tool
yes  it help for forecast near term consumpt   but you are right  i don   t think the low level of consum sen ent that we have seen through the middl of septemb is tell us a great deal about where consum spend will be earli next year  there is not a lot of predict content that way
yes   that   s realli my point
therefor  in some sens  to be consist with the forecast  we would have to continu to expect that consum are go to be worri and more downbeat  again  while i would say that   s obvious a signific sourc of uncertainti  i don   t think that   s necessarili unreason in an environ where there will continu to be a lot of bad news and where the bad news is compound with a weaken labor market and some thing that could lead to some extra model type of restraint
i appreci that clarif   the other question i had has more to do with the nairu and employ issu   i wish you could clarifi a bit for me   the downward shift in employ number for the past three month is for me signific   at the same  e  i say to myself     well  you know  now it is about at the level that the board has been forecast all along      in your previous discuss you have talk about particip rate and other thing  and now the level seem to be about where you had been predict it all along   yet you still interpret that as bad news from the economi point of view   so i would like a littl discuss of that   the second thing is that  at the same  e  you have lower the nairu   i am a bit puzzl and would like a littl discuss about the interact between those two thing   final   and you may have said this  but i may have miss it   if you had not chang the nairu  would inflat have been     or     percentag point higher over the forecast period   or what would it have been   i just need a littl clarif
on that last point  i think it probabl would have been a littl higher  but if we hadn   t revis the nairu  we might also have had a higher unemploy forecast go forward   it wouldn   t be just like    everyth els equal    if we lower the nairu   i think it did contribut to a slight larger output gap in this forecast  but also contribut to the larger output gap in this forecast was a weaken of activ relat to potenti that we are assum is go to be driven by this   we are realli split hair becaus  as i indic  we chang the forecast onli     in each year  but it would have been a littl less than that had we not chang the nairu  on the first point about our interpret of employ  i was tri to convey a sens that a lot of peopl were veri surpris at how weak employ was   we have been expect weak employ   i think we were less surpris   we also  as i indic  had written off some of this weak in employ as sort of extracycl labor hoard  and we hadn   t realli bought in fulli to that   we let that show through in lower labor product   now that we have actual seen some of the weak that we were expect all along  we don   t think there was as much labor hoard as we previous thought   so it wasn   t as big a surpris   still  there is just no deni the fact that the labor market report was weaker   even if we had gone back to where we were  we weren   t expect thing to be that weak   so i think there was some small negat signal attach to the labor market report but probabl not as much as would be suggest by the market reaction
thank you  mr  chairman   what do we know about the likelihood of an auto strike  what might come out of it  and how long it might last   second     my sens is that the financi market in the unit kingdom are probabl the most disrupt of ani of the industri economi   perhap you could comment a bit more on that
so thus far   unless someth has happen while we have been sit here that i don   t know about and you do   i think thing look reason encourag on the labor front with the auto negoti   we are not expect a strike  in fact  we are expect them to work through the final detail   obvious  the creation of the trust fund for health expenditur is one of the biggest remain issu   but the fact that it is still on the tabl and is still be activ discuss lead us to think that a strike is not like at this point
the situat in the unit kingdom is an unfold drama that is just a soap opera in mani respect   at the root there seem to be some sever differ of opinion of what the right respons is to situat in the market   in the begin  there was virtual no explicit action by the bank of england to counter heighten demand for liquid on the part of bank in u k  market   so the spread of overnight pound libor  relat to target  open up wide  and they were not address   they were allow to just sort of sit there   the term pound market had a problem  too   of cours  mani of the dollar issu that we have spoken of   and that bill talk about   are realli be captur as a london phenomenon   but you might say that  from the point of view of the bank of england or the u k  economi  these dollar issu are somewhat separ from the domest economi   there is some truth to that  but also the institut are involv  the institut have oblig  and the shock to the institut reverber back into the domest economi  it seem to me   that process went on for a while  and it is to some degre a function of the way the bank of england manag it reserv and the system of reserv market interact that exist   it has  among other featur  a month  et  not a two week  et  so even though the bank of england oper daili in the sens that we do  it tie it own hand a bit each month   toward the end of the month in which august   occur  it announc that the subsequ month it was go to eas thing just a bit in respons to a lot of pressur both perhap from disagr insid the bank and critic of the bank   it has taken some step to provid for greater flexibl within it exist system than it had for the three week befor the month turnov in august   inde  the bank of england did a two day oper last night  or this morn u k   e  which is the first temporari extra inject of reserv it had done on this basi   so it is move in the direct of introduc flexibl into the market that was not there on august   and wasn   t there for some  e after august    i think there is a great concern in the bank of england  or certain in the person of mervyn king  with the moral hazard aspect of enabl the market to solv their problem and deal with the consequ of their own decis by the bank of england   s provid them more liquid   that lie behind some of his reluct   on the other hand  we now have the northern rock issu   that is somewhat distinct from the problem of overnight lend or even term lend  in that northern rock has been question for a while  has been look at for a while  has been kind of talk about a bit  but has not realli been on anybodi   s radar screen for a while   it is an institut that fund itself to an except extent in wholesal market as oppos to from a deposit base  and yet it had grown to be a veri  veri larg mortgag lender in the unit kingdom   one might say that it is a bad coincid that somehow northern rock hit a turn point this month  but that is perhap go too far   i think the fact that the wholesal market were disrupt had to interact with it busi plan  had to be part of the reason that concern that have been fe  for a while becam acut  and so forth   the action that the bank of england took with respect to northern rock were realli from it lender of last resort institut base mechan as oppos to market concern   but they came out basic on the same day   they announc that they were go to introduc flexibl into their reserv manag system  and a differ announc was all about northern rock   they got it wrong on northern rock  quit understand   that  too  was a function of their deposit insur system  which is now under review becaus it is prone to this sort of thing   it was just  if you will  one thing after anoth  all of which are interact  we have revis down somewhat our u k  gdp forecast   in general  the industri countri are where we see the weak   that economi was  in term of domest demand  pretti strong   we think it can absorb some of this   but the set of factor is veri complex   some of them are deep and structur  like the way they do deposit insur  some of them have been ongo for a while  and some of them are relat to this crisi   i think the differ of opinion among the financi servic author  the treasuri  and the bank of england aren   t help  the differ of opinion within the bank of england aren   t help  and the situat remain to be total sort out
i see a two hand intervent
yes   just a question  realli  for bill and     one thing that is posit about all of this   although mayb i   m wrong about it   is that the spillov into the other market outsid the unit kingdom have been veri  veri minor   normal  what   s happen in the u k  context would be an inform shock that could trigger problem   the good news here is that  if anyth  the market have actual gotten a littl better sinc this whole episod occur  and it has been contain in the u k  context   is this a fair assess
yes  i agre with that
it is realli an import issu
three week ago  if this had happen  i think there would have been a differ market reaction   the market reaction has been veri mild   they seem to be abl to sort it out as a specif problem pertain to northern rock and the u k  regulatori regim  not someth that appli to a broader market   so i agre with that
but  i have to say   as when presid   ask that question about whether we know what we don   t know  to which  of cours  the answer is alway    no       laughter  five day ago  i wouldn   t have brought up northern rock   so  i can   t promis you that there aren   t
previous newcastl  should have been call sandcastl    laughter
the spanish bank  for exampl  and the spanish mortgag market are place  if i were go to dig deeper and look for hidden problem  that are a possibl
i won   t ask a silli question like the one i ask befor   i just have two quick question  one for dave  and the other for     when we look at the labor situat  from an analyt standpoint  it seem to me that there is cognit disson between that and what we are hear anecdot   what i   m hear anecdot   and i will talk a bit about that in a minut  but i   d like your viewpoint   are still complaint about labor shortag  from bank teller to chemic worker to hotel maid  et cetera  et cetera  et cetera   you see it in the beig book   you hear it from the ceo with whom i   ve talk   you see it district by district   how do you squar these two corner  dave   that   s my question for you  then  for    my question is this   you talk about the non industri countri growth   i would submit  by the way  that those are the industri countri now in term of how they are fuel their growth  what we call    industri    countri are servic driven economi  set that asid  you talk about the impact on growth  and you mention oil in particular   i would like to get your view on the potenti inflationari impact from the kind of demand growth that we are see and the growth that you are project elsewher in the world
the way i squar the corner is that  even by our es   the labor market is still tight   the     percent unemploy is still below the    that we are es  the nairu to be   even on our forecast of the labor market  the unemploy rate  sn   t get to the nairu until the middl of next year   so it wouldn   t surpris me if some complaint about avail of labor linger for a while here   the labor market  even with our weak employ forecast  onli gradual begin to loosen up   realli not until next year would we have someth approach an equilibrium in the labor market and then beyond that befor we got some slack   i think there is sort of a level versus a chang issu here   the current state of the labor market is tight  even though we are forecast it to deterior go forward
i think there are some inflat risk out there   in general  mexico  say  or brazil   some of the countri that target inflat   are oper pretti near their target  mayb even a tini bit abov it   one of the pre august but sort of persist problem we have been face for about six to nine month  mayb even for a year  has been to understand food price   whi   everybodi say that our inflat is up but it is food price   some  it   s hog diseas in china  and some  it   s an allus to biofuel issu or other kind of one off thing that you might see in some emerg market countri   but the strength of demand in these economi   and asia is realli oper at a veri high level of capac and at a veri strong growth rate   rais the potenti for upward pressur on price in some of these countri   now  china is obvious an outlier in this regard  right   the number are crazi  the number aren   t trust   again  the govern say it is food   but if most of the food is domest produc and food is approxim one third of the weight in their cpi  mayb that   s where you ought to look   the most import thing you can do with respect to tri to achiev an inflat object would be to do someth about food price  either by address your suppli side polici or by do someth about the rate of money growth or both   so china is a uniqu case in this regard   i think peopl are veri skeptic about some of the data   peopl fear that the inflat problem might be even wors   it has alway seem to me that the obvious solut to china   s problem is to let the exchang rate rise   it would solv mani  mani ill  includ lower food price and get the inflat rate down   i don   t hold out much hope for that  in place where market are more effect and where monetari polici work in way that look more like our experi in the servic sector economi  we are probabl go to see some monetari tighten continu to be in place   some of those countri are experienc a littl exchang rate appreci  and that will help   but i think they are oper with as much inflat as they realli want   the industri countri probabl won   t be do some of the tighten that we had in mind for them and that the market anticip  but some of these emerg market   india  for exampl   need to continu tighten  and they need to be veri alert on their monetari polici   there could be some case in which their polici aren   t abl to do the job or they don   t move quick enough
thank you   thank you  mr  chairman
other question   if not  we are readi for our econom go round   for presid     s benefit  we do have two hand intervent as a possibl   it   s like the discount window   rare use but there if you need it
is there a stigma  mr  chairman    laughter
there   s no stigma   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   as far as where condit are today  i   ll keep my remark short sinc they don   t differ a great deal from the  book  part    and the remark of other   on the district itself  our district continu to do econom well   energi obvious is a strong factor   for agricultur  we have even adjust the earn number up dramat sinc februari   manufactur has shown strength in august  and servic seem to be good   the survey we   re do also suggest those are continu to do reason well   my outlook in term of what the reaction is or what we   re see in the economi for the nation economi is not unlik that  except that the data are more mix  as describ by other   so i won   t go into that  the issu is not so much where we are   it   s where we   re go to be six and nine month from now  and the issu around that are issu of uncertainti   bank condit in our region  and i think more broad  are good   the issu there  as we will talk about later  are issu of balanc sheet  liquid  and such thing  which are import consider to the economi go forward   that will be an import discuss   as we survey our busi look forward  we see the effect of some of the uncertainti where peopl  in a broad cross section  are say that they have not pull back on their capit spend or in their hire plan general but are in a littl more of a wait and see mode   so there is a tendenc to want to hold back  and the effect of that are realli up in the air   i think that   s import for us to consid   also  we have seen back off from fund commit that were there   just like other  we   re see that as well in our region   as a result  look forward  we have reduc our outlook  but not anywher near as dramat as the  book   i think that we will get through this transit and that the economi has enough momentum that it will go forward if confid hasn   t been lost   so i don   t have quit as pessimist an outlook go forward  the other element is the inflat outlook  and i think that inflat should remain relat modest   the thing that struck me is that the real rate has increas as inflat has come down over the past year sinc we last held  and so real rate are actual tighter   that should have a favor effect on the inflat outlook and also it own slow effect in the economi  and i think that will be a veri import part of our discuss go forward   with that  i   ll just stop for the  e be
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  with regard to our district  we continu to grow appar fa  than the rest of the countri   there are sign of overbuild  particular in the multiresidenti and some commerci sector area   i will give you one data point that focus the mind  and then i   d like to go on to a broader discuss   in the citi of austin  texa  between      and       fifti condominium unit price at    million or more came on the market   over that seven year period  forti of them sold   there are now more than     come onto the market   we have seen a signific boom in construct in all the major citi of our district  and that   give me paus   nonetheless  we continu to speed along  driven not so much by energi as by medicin and the servic sector   so i continu to expect that we will outpac the rest of the countri   we are see some declin in term of advanc airlin book as they affect our district  but they   re not that differ from the rest of the unit state  what i   d like to address is the broader issu   mr  chairman  i am a littl confus as to whi we are talk about the econom situat and then skip a beat befor we talk about the propos discount window facil   i do see the two go hand in hand   i   d like to suggest that we   re navig a veri narrow passag here in someth of a fog      i think  was honest about that   on the one side is a serious risk of overcompens in our navig cours and incur a moral hazard or overcompens for what is a perceiv risk in unchart water   on the other side  i think we run the risk of bite off our employ growth respons to save our inflat fight face   so on the starboard shore we hear a siren call    veri larg financi institut     which infer that a reduct in the fed fund rate will rescu them from peril  howev self inflict that peril may have been and despit the fact that they   re well capit accord to the report that we have put togeth   on the other shore  we are reli on navig chart or uncertain landmark or   as you said      rudimentari tool that are give us mix read  i   m go to argu today that we should eas by    basi point  mr  chairman   i   m just show my hand earli   and indic through our word that we might tilt the rudder a bit further if need  further  i am go to argu that we should defer discuss of the new discount window  and we can get to that later   my concern is that if we fail to eas  we risk steer into a recess  but if we shift the tiller too radic on the fed fund side  i believ that we risk tack onto that siren call that i mention earlier and that we will indulg rather than disciplin riski financi behavior  what i   m about to talk about i base on a rather in depth sound  just to kill the naval analog onc and for all in this discuss    laughter   i sent you and the vice chairman a list of the peopl i consult   it is also base on what we   re hear from our economist in the district and in our bank and  veri import  on what the  book and the bluebook have said   there is no question that our contact report a slow in the pace that occur through the third quarter  and they do detect a pull in of the horn in term of cost control  budgetari plan  and u s  capit expenditur as oppos to foreign cap ex  which they   re still plan to expand signific   all in light of the press given to the subprim debacl  financi turmoil  and just a general sens of caution  howev  there are some veri bright spot  and i   m go to go through these at a bit of length becaus i think they   re import to recogn   at t  for exampl  a local but signific compani say     we   ve had the best quarter we   ve had on the consum side  and on the busi side it   s the hottest august in histori      their averag revenu per user has risen for the past two quarter after declin for the past two and a quarter year   texa instrument  an

perspect  he said that the chang are margin  now  to be sure  there are some weak be report   the one util i talk to at length is txu   the hous market has left a bit of a slowdown in demand   hookup by big industri  howev   steel  aluminum  et cetera   are run veri good load accord to their ceo   up report that the packag line has been flat to slight up  with a pickup occur in juli and august

categori   in summari  under econom growth  from the standpoint of anecdot evid from the contact i   ve talk to  is stronger than it would appear from the press or from most prognost   i think that   s one import point to take into consider  it is also veri import  mr  chairman  to think of how peopl react to what they   re see  there   s no doubt an effort  if you   re worri about the futur  to tighten up on cost of good sold and to reduc your head count   yet everybodi is complain that there   s a massiv shortag of labor in everi one of the compani i spoke of but one   the other thing is that you chang your strateg approach   one relief that   s been provid here is that the privat equiti firm have been taken out so that bid of  say  seventeen  e ebitda  which is an actual case  with no due dilig  are no longer the case   four of the compani i spoke with are now abl to make strateg acquisit  and they plan to proceed   the point is that the economi is not grind to a halt   i won   t mention lawyer again in this discuss except here  but see how they   re be hire now  akin gump  veri larg firm   they are work on strateg acquisit  and you can see a ramp up in the volum that   s occur there   so i think that   s an import thing to consid  anoth veri import point to consid is that price pressur have not disappear   i believ they are be maintain by global demand   i   m go to give you just a coupl of refer point  and then i   ll stop   as you know  i like to quot the panamax ship rate   when we last met  the spot daili rate for a panamax ship   again  the dri bulk carrier   was         a day   ye day  it was           port util is run at a record high   whi   asian demand  after ten year of deflat  the major retail sourc from china  accord to wal mart and other interlocutor  report cost increas run at   to   percent   after ten year of deflat  they   re now inflat slight    although i said i wouldn   t mention lawyer  but just so you know  for the first  e in histori in los angel  new york  and dalla  all begin lawyer start at           i think they are rais it to          in all market    sara lee   from an agflat standpoint i think this is import and i think we have to be awar of the public percept   just announc a   percent increas in the cost of bread  and they announc that they    may hike anoth   percent at the end of the month      the spread between wheat and corn  mr  chairman  is the widest it has been   it is usual       to        it is now         cook oil price  milk price   even the italian went on a one day strike to protest the price of pasta   it wasn   t success  but that   s what they did   the firm respond by    weight out    the increas price by put less in the packag here in the unit state   i want to mention again that we   re hear widespread report of labor shortag  and i do worri  dave  that it somehow just  sn   t squar   i think your report certain was elucid  but it   have implic for how fast consumpt can fall off  if inde we   re suffer from a labor shortag   final  there are price pressur that ensu from the boom construct market in china   chines demand for skill labor last year  year over year  was up     percent   they   re build a huge shipbuild market and so on  so  mr  chairman  i am concern  first  that while we have made progress by ani measur  includ our belov trim mean measur of the pce in dalla  that we   re just begin to make such progress and that there are risk out there and we need to acknowledg them   they stem larg from global demand   second  i   m veri concern that we   re lean the tiller too far to the side to compens risk taker when we should be disciplin them   so i   m go to conclud not with a sail analog but with a footbal analog   i don   t think it   s  e to throw a    hail mari    pass   i think it   s  e just to continu to move up the field  run the ball as we   ve been do  and i would strong recommend a rate cut of onli    basi point and no more  if  inde  we accompani it with a chang in the primari credit facil  then i think we have to have a veri serious discuss of how far we   re will to go on the fed fund rate   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   the news about the italian strike is concern me consider    laughter
it didn   t work
presid    you rais a legi  issu  which i think i should address now   we will this afternoon be discuss this auction credit facil with a possibl swap that would allow the european to provid term dollar fund as well   this work has been go on for a few week   it has been veri intens   the staff has done a great job  but as you know and as bill explain  the financi market condit have improv somewhat in the past few day  and so we view it   i view it and i think the board view it now   as a relat close call as to whether such a facil is need at this junctur   what i would propos to do is discuss it as plan on the agenda   we would like to have a thorough discuss and  if the committe approv the conting permiss  to use it should market condit appear  in our judgment  to warrant it   but just becaus  as you point out  there is some interact with the monetari polici decis  i   d just like to say that  at this point  it is not by ani mean a certainti that we will go ahead and appli that particular agenc
well  thank you  mr  chairman   i look forward to that discuss   i didn   t know that   if they are  inde  tie togeth  then i would be make a veri strong argument against a    basi point cut if it were tie at the same  e to this facil   so thank you veri much for that clariti
sure   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   on balanc  the data and the anecdot evid in our district say that the economi continu to expand and advanc moder  but the pace may have slow somewhat sinc june   read of our busi outlook survey of region manufactur have been veri volatil this summer   you may recal that in june  our activ index rose to     which was it highest valu sinc april        the index fell to   in juli and to   in august   the septemb survey  conduct dure the first two week of septemb  remain confidenti and will not be announc to the public until this thursday at noon   so these are realli new data   in fact  we final it onli ye day   it indic some recoveri in general activ  new order  and shipment   the general activ index rose from   to        new order and shipment index also improv   anoth piec of good news from the manufactur    capit spend plan is that they remain posit  with the index at a level typic seen dure expans   plan to increas capit spend were common among near all the major manufactur sector cover by our survey   consist with this  our respond general see improv in their busi activ come over the next six month   in septemb we ask a special question about whether the recent chang in the construct and financi sector had ani advers effect on their busi or their busi plan   about two third of the respond said there was no impact on their order or shipment   about    percent report a substanti declin   most of these firm were hous relat industri   one was in auto part  and one was in apparel   similar  three quarter of the respond had no chang in their capit spend plan  and onli about   percent expect to cut back substanti on their capit spend relat to plan over the rest of the year   my read of this is that the manufactur sector in the region is hold up pretti well  in contrast  residenti construct activ in the region continu to deterior  and we are expect to see declin in hous price   earlier these declin were seen onli at the jersey shore  but now they seem to have spread a littl more wide in the district   interest enough  homebuild report reduc price to s ul sale but with relat littl success   sever contact told us that they were more concern about the negat effect on buyer psycholog of recent financi market develop than they were about the avail of mortgag financ  that our region has been larg less depend on subprim lend than some other area may be part of the reason for that   nevertheless  none of our contact in the real estat industri were will to forecast when the demand for hous was go to pick up   nonresidenti construct has also soften somewhat in our region  as indic by the valu of contract  but that   s a veri volatil number   these data tend to be revis up  but the declin still is quit pronounc  and it bear watch   at the same  e  vacanc rate remain veri low in the philadelphia area  and so the demand seem to be there  but the contract are down for the moment  employ growth over the three state region end in juli remain below trend in new jersey and delawar and kind of flat in pennsylvania   some firm continu to support what has alreadi been said   difficulti in find qualifi worker   one of our board member run a temporari employ agenc that goe through ten of thousand of peopl everi month   she said that there has been an uptick in walk in traffic of peopl appli for employ  particular skill worker  but in fact  there has been no falloff whatsoev in the demand from firm look for these peopl   so she has seen no declin in demand for these worker  but she has seen a littl uptick in the suppli come through their offic   our three state unemploy rate remain relat low and below that of the nation   nonetheless  juli unemploy rate in our three state were a littl higher than we saw earlier in this year  the inflat pictur for the district has chang littl sinc our last meet   wage increas have been moder   sever firm report larg increas in benefit cost but not an acceler of those benefit cost   the price of industri good are increas  but retail price increas haven   t been as widespread as they were earlier   in summari  our region   s inflat has not acceler   it hasn   t deceler either  econom activ in the third district continu to expand  but it pace has perhap slow somewhat   our busi contact general expect activ to remain slow but on an upward trend and are more uncertain about the outlook than they were  but their plan seem to be in place   one board member spent a great deal of  e talk to a number of ceo and cfos about capit spend plan  and it was funni   he said that they said  well  everybodi thought there was go to be a capit spend program reduct   they weren   t plan a reduct  but they knew somebodi els who was   it was veri hard to find the person who was actual do it  but everybodi thought that someon els was do it   so it was a littl anecdot  the nation economi look more vulner to me than it did six week ago  but it would be a mistak   and i think dave   did an excel job of remind us   to count out the resili of the u s  economi at this earli stage   i think there can be a tendenc in the midst of financi disrupt  uncertainti  and volatil to overes  the amount of spillov that they will exert on the broader economi   for exampl  the rate cut after the stock market crash in      were revers fair quick   unfortun  we have veri littl hard data as yet to help us gaug the potenti size or persist of the impact on real activ of the august turmoil  and earli sign may be fraught with nois and overreact to headlin   so i think we have to be veri care  of cours  it is possibl that disrupt will further restrain the alreadi weak hous market by reduc the suppli of mortgag credit   nonconform mortgag rate  even to prime borrow  remain elev  but conform rate to prime borrow are actual lower right now  reduc lend in the alt a and subprim market is not a surpris   it has been difficult to obtain those loan sinc the earli part of this year  and i think that is not a big chang   the biggest surpris  at least for me  is that the impact on the obtain of mortgag to homebuy of the recent disrupt has been in the area of nonconform jumbo mortgag   yet the avail of these mortgag and their rate are like to settl back down more quick to normal level sinc most of the peopl borrow at the jumbo rate tend to be closer to prime borrow than to subprim   howev  as bank take some action to bring some of these riski asset back onto their balanc sheet  we may look forward to further restraint on credit becaus they don   t want to push their capit ratio ani harder than they have  and so that may have a diminish effect   but put asid ani financi market effect  sign of stabil in the hous market that we saw earli this year just have not been sustain  as we all know   home price have deceler and have been fall in certain local  and that   s like to continu   incom data suggest that the downturn in hous may be both more prolong and somewhat deeper than certain i had earlier anticip  the question has been whether this decreas in hous wealth would spill over into consum spend  regardless of the sourc of the decreas in hous wealth   the argument has been that the strength in the labor market and the stock market gain would continu  and continu person incom growth would buoy the consum and mitig those declin   i remind everybodi that  even though the market is down heavili in august  it is still up rough   percent for the year   so it wouldn   t be a tank unless someth further happen  august nonfarm payrol surpris fell by       job in august  as we know   i wouldn   t be too surpris to see this number revis up   loss of govern job concentr in local educ took a veri big hit  and this might be overst the season adjust factor that are go into this in the  e of the start of the school year   still  there was weaker privat payrol growth   there   s no question about that  and the revis done in june and juli were down substanti   thus  nonfarm payrol gain have averag about        over the past three month  wherea privat payrol have been a littl more than        for the past three month  and that   s weaker than we   ve seen dure the rest of the year   there   s no question about that  on the posit side  busi spend remain fair solid  but our hard data are somewhat stale and may be a littl sketchi   although not in the data yet  there   s some risk of temporari weak in busi fix invest go forward simpli becaus of the increas uncertainti inher in financi market disrupt   so far most of the firm we   ve talk to  as i said earlier  say that their capit spend plan remain in place  and onli a few nonmanufactur firm have mention not cancel but just delay them until the market has settl down   risk premium have increas from abnorm low level  which is probabl benefici   this has rais the cost of capit for some firm  but for most firm  financ for capit spend remain avail  mani bank say that they have lend avail and that they will lend to good custom   there   s not a problem   inde  most capit expenditur by busi  in fact  are intern financ  and so the turmoil in the credit market may not have as much spillov on capit spend as we might otherwis expect   so unless there   s a sharp declin in busi sen ent  which could occur if the financi market turbul worsen  i don   t expect to see that much of a pullback in busi invest spend  except possibl in the veri  veri near term  on balanc  i believ that within the forecast period we can see a return to trend growth  which i still es  at about    percent  somewhat higher than the  book   i still think that   s the most like outcom  but i now expect that return to be delay by a coupl of quarter given hous  and it won   t be under way until certain late in        i admit there   s still consider uncertainti surround that forecast  and i certain see that there   s a possibl of particular bad outcom  some of which the  book scenario have laid out   i also expect that some of the indic we receiv over the next few month are like to be weak  but not necessarili weaker than mani of us have alreadi built into our new forecast   inde  becaus of the financi market disrupt  the august data won   t be particular help or use in read the trend in the economi  i think it   s go to be crucial import for us to convey to the public that we are forward look  that we expect to see somewhat weaker data come in  but that they may not necessit a further chang either in our forecast or in our polici   onli when we accumul suffici new inform that caus our forecast to deviat from our alreadi lower project do we want to revis our forecast and perhap our polici   i think this is a point that we need to make veri clear to the public  if not in our statement  which we should tri  then in the minut and in our speech as we go out   i think it would be detriment to our caus and to good polici if the public expect us to react to each piec of incom data  on the inflat side  i see that recent read on core inflat have moder   headlin inflat remain quit elev   i don   t think that we can afford to be sanguin   i continu to see under inflat pressur  as has alreadi been articul   long rang inflat expect have been stabl  but i   m concern as we go forward with potenti rate cut   i   m concern about their remain stabl  particular when we may be lower rate without be clear about what our inflat goal are   inde  i think the current situat clear show the benefit of have an explicit inflat goal   by anchor those expect  an explicit goal would mean less of a tradeoff between our two goal and so might make this polici decis easier and even perhap more effect   thus  while my forecast has built in some near term polici eas part to offset the anticip of tighter credit condit  i believ that we might find ourselv in a posit some  dure       in respons to rise inflat of have to rais the fed fund rate back up   we need to be particular care now with our communic regard ani polici action we take  but i   ll save that discuss for the polici go round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   read on core inflat dure the intermeet period have continu to be encourag  and the downward trend has persist long enough that i   ve lower my inflat forecast slight   with the weaker outlook for growth  i also see less upsid inflat risk eman from cyclic pressur   with respect to econom activ  i   ve downgrad my forecast for growth in the fourth quarter by about the same amount as  book and lower it onli margin  a bit less than  book  in        the downsid risk to this forecast are substanti and worrisom   the downward revis to my forecast reflect three factor   first  incom data bear on the outlook  second  my assess of the like impact of the financi shock that   s been unfold sinc mid juli  third  the offset effect of the polici chang i consid appropri in respons to the first two forc   my forecast assum that the fed fund rate will fall to about     percent in the fourth quarter   in other word  my forecast is premis on  e action by the committe to mitig much of the potenti damag  let me begin by comment on the econom data that we have receiv sinc earli august   some has certain been posit   growth in the second quarter was revis upward  suggest more momentum head into the current quarter  and most indic of consum spend and busi fix invest were also robust   like most observ  i   ve conclud that these data taken togeth support a small upward revis in my es  of third quarter growth  howev  recent data on hous and forward look indic relat to this sector suggest even greater weak in residenti invest than we previous anticip   manufactur activ recent turn down  and import to me  the august employ report show a mark deceler in payrol employ growth over the past three month  suggest that the financi shock hit an economi possess quit a bit less momentum than i had factor into my previous forecast   moreov  survey measur of consum confid are down  and these result probabl do incorpor earli effect from the recent financi shock  of cours  the most import factor shape the forecast for the fourth quarter and beyond is the earthquak that began roil financi market in mid juli   our contact locat at the epicent   those  for exampl  in the privat equiti and mortgag market   report utter devast   anecdot report from those nearbi   for exampl  our contact in bank  hous construct  and hous relat busi   suggest signific damag from the temblor   for exampl  a larg furnitur retail with store in utah and nevada has seen sale fall off  and he has tighten credit term for his custom and has alreadi frozen his hire and invest plan   in contrast  our busi contact oper further from the epicent appear remark unfaz  luckili for them and for us  the financi quak has thus far produc at most minor tremor in their busi   this is not surpris   it is still too earli to expect the rippl effect to be notic by our contact or to show up in the spend data  we could take a wait and see approach to the financi shock  incorpor it impact on our growth forecast onli after we observ it imprint in the spend data   but such an approach would be misguid and fraught with hazard becaus it would depriv us of the opportun to act in  e to forestal the like damag   this mean we must do our best to assess the like effect of the shock   the simplest approach is to reli on our usual forecast model   howev  as   emphas in his remark  the shock has not affect to ani great extent the financi variabl that are typic includ in our macro model   sinc we last met  there have been onli small net chang in broad equiti index and the dollar   of cours  risk spread in credit market are up across a broad rang of instrument and for most borrow  both corpor and household   but there has been an offset drop in treasuri rate so that key rate appear in our model   the interest rate on conform mortgag and the interest rate face prime corpor borrow   are littl chang or even slight lower   it is riskier corpor borrow and household seek nonconform mortgag loan  includ jumbo  that have seen their borrow rate rise over the past few month   but import  it is the drop in treasuri yield  about    to     basi point sinc earli juli  that has thus far shield so mani borrow from higher interest rate  and of cours  this drop reflect the market   s expect that the committe will eas the stanc of monetari polici rather substanti   as i note  my forecast assum that we will plan to eas by around    basi point by year end in line with market expect   even under this assumpt  i see movement in interest rate alon as ad to a modest tighten of financi condit  but  of cours  an evalu of the like econom impact from the financi shock must also take into account chang in credit avail and lend term even though these variabl rare appear explicit in forecast model   it is appar that the avail of lend of some type  includ subprim and alt a mortgag  has diminish substanti or disappear entir   moreov  bank and other financi institut are impos tighter term and condit across a broad rang of corpor and household lend program   for exampl  fico cutoff have been rais and maximum loan to valu ratio lower in mani mortgag program accord to our contact   in part  these chang reflect the pressur that bank and other financi intermediari are experienc in the context of sever illiquid in secondari market for nonconform mortgag and other asset back secur  asset back commerci paper  and term loan in the interbank market  mani of the liquid problem now afflict bank and other financi market particip will presum be resolv at least eventu  but it   s hard to believ that market will return to busi as usual as defin by condit in the first half of this year even after that occur   for one thing  mani of the structur credit product that becam so wide use may prove to be too complex to be viabl go forward  and this would more or less perman reduc the quantiti of credit avail to mani riski borrow   moreov  if the financi intermedi that was routin conduct via asset securit and off balanc sheet financ vehicl ul  migrat back onto the book of the bank  borrow spread and lend term are like to remain tighter given current limit on bank capit and the higher cost of conduct intermedi through the bank sector   most import  the recent widen of spread appear to reflect a return to more realist price of risk throughout the economi  this develop may be posit for the long run  but it will be contractionari in the short run  similar to the  book  we   ve incorpor these financi develop into our project by revis down our forecast for residenti construct and home price   but as we all know  hous is a small sector  so a major question is to what extent the financi shock will spread to other part of the economi   we see a larg drop in hous price as quit like to advers affect consumpt spend over  e through a number of differ channel  includ wealth effect  collater effect  and negat effect on spend through the interest rate reset   a big worri is that a signific drop in hous price might occur in the context of job loss  and this could lead to a vicious spiral of foreclosur  further weak in hous market  and further reduct in consum spend   sever altern simul in the  book illustr some of the unpleas scenario that could develop   a final concern is that the uncertainti associ with turbul financi market could make household and busi more cautious about spend  caus some invest plan to be put on hold and some plan purchas of hous and consum durabl to be defer   so at this point i am concern that the potenti effect of the develop credit crunch could be substanti   i recogn that there   s a tremend amount of uncertainti around ani es    but i see the skew in the distribut to be primarili to the downsid  reflect possibl advers spillov from hous to consumpt and busi invest

thank you  mr  chairman   most of the econom data we have for this meet reflect the economi befor the liquid issu in august   the employ report  while probabl not wholli reflect of the problem and affect by some anomal season  nonetheless provid evid that labor market were slow at the outset of the financi problem   given the layoff that are be announc by financi servic firm and the potenti for continu difficulti in construct  some further eas of labor market seem quit like   although we do not have hous start and permit for august  the outlook for the second half of      is like to deterior further than forecast had predict befor the liquid issu   there is good reason to believ the staff forecast that residenti invest will remain weak well into        stock price of all the major homebuild have continu to declin sinc our last meet  and the credit deriv swap for sever of the largest homebuild are at level that reflect a veri high probabl of default  the news from the financi market has improv margin from the last meet  but i still have some signific concern   certain  some of the financi anomali have abat  such as the extrem low rate for short term treasuri secur  and there are some tentat sign of improv liquid   howev  these improv are tenuous  and the abil to rais fund in a number of short term financi market remain quit difficult   i would just highlight a few of the financi anomali that are reflect of the situat   usual  the overnight eurodollar trade veri close to the overnight fed fund rate   both are overnight dollar loan between financi institut on an unsecur basi   over the past month  the fund for overnight eurodollar have frequent been trade much higher than overnight fed fund   this highlight the difficulti that some european financi institut are have borrow in dollar and the unwilling of mani financi institut to arbitrag these spread if they involv credit exposur to european financi institut  even for overnight   these difficulti worsen when the matur extend out to one to three month   both the one month and three month libor rate have remain veri elev  particular given that the fed fund futur dure this period have indic a market expect of fall feder fund rate over the next three month   the elev libor rate tighten credit for a varieti of domest borrow and could affect area that are alreadi troubl   for exampl  mani subprim mortgag are tie to the libor rate as are mani loan that have been use to financ leverag buyout  a second exampl is the signific swell of bank asset in august   the month growth rate for bank c i loan was     percent and for other loan and leas was     percent  these are among the largest month increas in thirti year   as in other period of liquid strain  bank balanc sheet becom particular import   as bank honor loan commit and agreement to provid liquid support  their balanc sheet grow   my concern is that bank oblig will continu to expand bank balanc sheet in septemb and crowd out other invest opportun  mani financi market particip are veri concern about the next two week  despit some recent eas of condit   some investor are not will to lend except overnight   the asset back commerci paper market has remain under stress  and the rollov have been for shorter matur   there is signific concern that holder of commerci paper may be reluct to hold asset back commerci paper on their balanc sheet at the end of this month  and rumor abound about whether money market fund and other short term investor will continu to hold commerci paper for structur product  particular of the siv  so we have a situat of a veri weak hous sector  some evid of slow employ growth  and a period of extend illiquid that may get wors befor it get better  the tail risk of liquid problem and econom problem has grown  and we clear want to avoid outcom by which declin in price for hous and for financi asset tie to the hous sector could creat more sever econom outcom   the fact is that we do not have much experi with period of extend illiquid  especi when the hous sector is so weak  so take out insur against these risk seem entir appropri   the decis is made easier  in my view  becaus i see the risk of unaccept high inflat result from such an action as be quit low   my hope is that with appropri eas of polici the liquid issu will abat as we start the fourth quarter

thank you  mr  chairman   the report that i am hear from my busi contact reflect a sudden and a signific deterior in their evalu of the busi climat   the data in hand  except for the troubl august employ report  have not been especi dire  and neither are the impress i get from the busi communiti regard their current pace of econom activ   in fact  by most account  busi activ in the fourth district  outsid of the residenti real estat market  remain reason posit  and the beig book report that we submit for this meet reflect that view   in most case  the sharp downward reassess of the busi situat that i am now hear from my contact describ greater uneas over what may happen and not what has happen   as we discuss earlier  our forecast model are not well equip to accommod the role that shift expect play in shape the econom outlook   nevertheless  the sharp falloff in busi confid that i am hear from peopl in mani sector in the district has had a materi influenc on the econom project that i submit for this meet  the market for real estat is still declin  perhap even in a freefal  accord to the descript i have been get from peopl across the sector  includ real estat profession  develop  and manufactur of home construct suppli and materi   i don   t pretend to have a veri confid forecast of where the bottom of the residenti real estat market lie  but the industri sourc that i am talk to have convinc me that we should anticip that this process will play itself out for a consider  e to come   moreov  and unlik my last report to the committe  my busi contact are now fear that we are go to see a spillov from the declin in the residenti real estat market  and they now expect some amount of retrench by consum   i have incorpor some of that sen ent into my outlook   the most noteworthi develop affect my econom project  howev  has been the deterior in busi confid and the effect that deterior may have on capit expans plan   the diminish confid in the outlook that busi leader are report to me has had a signific negat effect on my outlook for invest   like the  book  i have scale back my growth outlook to reflect a consider softer trajectori for busi fix invest   even with a monetari polici respons  the combin of weaker consum and busi spend has led me to mark down my gdp project for next year near    percentag point  to   percent  meanwhil  the incom inflat report continu to point to a gradual disinfl  the usual caveat about inflat forecast appli  of cours  but i am not see in the data   and i am not hear from my busi contact   the same concern over rise price that i heard in the spring   my outlook for inflat hasn   t chang that much sinc juli   i am still expect core pce inflat to be just under   percent   but i am more confid  if just a littl  that we are see the progress toward price stabil that we had hope to achiev  so i believ that the risk to the outlook  given no chang in our polici  have shift decis toward potenti rapid deterior in the real economi   some of that deterior may reflect the unwind of earlier financi imbal  and everi prudent effort should be made to allow that process to run it cours   but the moral hazard caveat   not diminish the signific of the falloff in busi sen ent that i have heard sinc our last meet  and so i am concern that we have seen greater risk to the econom outlook sinc our last meet  thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   in the sixth district  we indulg ourselv with the conceit that our district look a lot like the nation as a whole   we have    million consum and an industri composit that   resembl the countri  so you can process my region remark with that conceit in mind   hous market continu to deterior in august in the sixth district   hous market weak was most pronounc in florida  as you might expect  follow by atlanta and middl tennesse   the consensus view is that the recent tighten in mortgag credit avail will exacerb the region   s hous market problem  and most region contact believ that hous market will continu to weaken  bottom out no earlier than mid       and some see a much longer adjust period  asid from hous  real econom read in the sixth district were mix   anecdot feedback across a number of industri suggest that busi spend has not yet slow mark  but the major of contact indic that they are now approach new capit spend more cautious   that said  most contact acknowledg that tighter credit standard have not signific affect busi capit invest outlay   report of factori activ were mix  with defens and export industri do well  while industri link to hous were predict weak   transport contact indic ongo weak domest demand  consum activ in the district was flat to slight up in august compar with a year ago  hous relat home product sale were especi weak  as were auto sale   perhap the most notabl chang from previous month was a turn to pessim on the part of director  reflect their sound of busi contact in their communiti   i will mention that we have five branch  so we actual get director feedback from more than forti director across the district  sixti percent believ that econom activ will be slower six month out  twice the percentag record in juli   even factor out idiosyncrat condit in local such as south florida and the gulf coast  the outlook  base on these anecdot report  has turn to the negat  to summar my region comment   current fundament are mix  and the outlook is pessimist   in our view  the econom outlook has chang sinc the last meet  and the balanc of risk has clear shift to the downsid   we do not see a near term recess as a high likelihood  but we do anticip that growth will approach trend much more slowli with employ edg up as a consequ   so in direct and tone  if not magnitud  we are in agreement with the  book  but our forecast differ from the  book baselin forecast in the depth of the below trend growth  our be somewhat milder becaus we condit our forecast on deeper cumul cut in the fed fund rate over the come month  turn to capit market  my recent convers with a number of capit market particip suggest that the adjust process in financi market is far from complet   their anecdot feedback reflect a rang of view about the sever of the current problem and the outlook for stabil   here is the overal pictur i glean from these convers   some debt market have firm a bit   the leverag loan market  for exampl  is like to renew trade in the come week  but structur debt secur market are not yet clear   the princip reason   and this has been mention earlier by bill and other   that debt market remain illiquid is weak counterparti transpar and  therefor  uncertain counterparti risk  as well as uncertainti regard the perform of collater pool that back secur   the process of achiev adequ clariti and stabil of the market will like take mani more week   market will remain volatil while the condit of heighten uncertainti persist  there has been some spillov into market that are unrel to structur debt and subprim  but creditworthi borrow are get credit   there is suffici buyer liquid current on the sidelin await greater clariti regard counterparti  market price of secur  and the depth and scope of the difficulti   widespread deleverag  particular by siv and hedg fund and nonbank entiti  is occur and is like to continu  one parti argu  howev  that all the news of financi distress has not push risk spread to the extrem of histor band   this parti argu     we are experienc a pain adjust from excess high leverag to more ration or more realist price in line with histor averag      but all contact believ   and this is perhap not unexpect   that prolong credit market problem will affect the broad economi  most through the consum credit channel  so i believ our decis today boil down to whether we cut   percentag point or    percentag point  obvious in combin with care word of the statement that convey a rational focus on econom fundament while signal some recognit that the problem in the capit market have the potenti to deliv a credit shock to the broad economi  i consid it appropri to adjust the feder fund rate to the now weaker econom outlook  and i support a    basi point move with the rational that at least    basi point of that repres recognit of a lower equilibrium rate and the remaind is a preemptiv  prevent measur design to renew confid  facilit condit that resolv uncertainti  and shorten the necessari adjust  elin in a deleverag financi sector   it is a fair question whether the process of inform revel   that is  remov uncertainti   will be acceler by an aggress rate cut   my view is that this action  along with other liquid action  remov the psycholog barrier   that be the concern that the fed might fail to ensur enough upfront liquid and might be pursu an inadvert tight polici  compound problem by put undu stress on the real economi   i think a distinct can be drawn between tri to influenc the psycholog around danger financi sector circumst and bail out the market  and care should be taken to reflect this in the minut  let me add that i agre with the earlier comment of presid   that we perhap should be look at ani polici move in the context of a total packag that includ the auction credit facil   so i do have  let   s say  some sympathi for the view that the total packag must be discuss   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   recent inform from the fifth district  both from contact and from our survey respons  suggest that growth in econom activ in our district has slow in recent week   the survey indic that retail sale have weaken  with big ticket categori such as automobil and build materi lead the way   shopper traffic has trail off somewhat as well   servic firm report slower revenu growth and less op  about demand go forward  activ in some district hous market has slow mark in the past two to three week  and some former healthi market are now show sign of weak   one contact in charlott  for exampl  say that sale agent there are say the same thing they were say in atlanta sever month ago   residenti foreclosur are more widespread  though they appear to be concentr or overrepres among investor rather than owner occup  mortgag activ has fallen off in the past sever week  accord to our contact   while standard have tighten for margin qualifi applic  it is report that mortgag remain readili avail for creditworthi borrow   the ceo of a nationwid titl insur compani report that their open order have been trend down in recent week   he also say that they are see an increas in cancel of titl insur order becaus peopl are appli for more than one mortgag in the current climat  in contrast  commerci real estat condit appear general healthi  although recent report suggest that closer scrutini is be given to margin project propos   condit in manufactur also look posit  shipment and new order continu to expand  and hire indic for this sector have edg higher   district price pressur remain at about the same level they have been in recent month  let me say that  broad speak across our contact  we have heard in the past week or two more report mention a sens of gloom   this echo what presid pianalto and   said   on the other hand  one contact in charlott  who has had a lot of success experi in real estat market  said that compar with past crise this is a walk in the park  mayb that is just becaus he has made his   it may be particular to this situat  so i don   t want to make too much of that  the nation econom data that we have receiv sinc our last meet point pretti clear to a weaker econom outlook for real growth   the employ report is a promin exampl   slower growth in the month ahead would weigh on incom growth and consumpt  although the  book   s outlook for incom remain pretti healthi   recent report on hous activ have also been quit disappoint   i think the key question is the effect on the hous market and broader econom activ of the recent financi market turmoil   i won   t survey what has happen  presid   and   and mr    did an excel job on that   i will just comment that it seem  broad speak  as if we are on a travers from a configur of intermedi that place a fair heavi relianc on fair complic and structur product and rate agenc    assess of those   it is a travers that is obvious go more rapid and is fraught with more peril than the path that took us to the configur we are come from   so it is hard to know how much of an effect this turmoil will have on hous   i suspect that a lot of the slowdown was alreadi in train befor the middl of august   i base that thought on the fact that mani mortgag rate rose earlier in the summer than august  though the jumbo market is an obvious except to that  beyond hous  ani project of real effect from event in financi market seem like guesswork at this point   my sens is that  while we may see some margin slow in busi invest  the effect are like to be small becaus i don   t think the margin cost of fund for most busi has gone up much and we aren   t hear report of wholesal tighten of lend standard in the corpor sector   i haven   t heard that from around the countri either   i expect consum spend to grow more slowli than in recent year  but not too dramat so   i think that there is a fair amount of uncertainti about the size of the hous wealth effect and that household net worth overal remain fair high relat to incom at this point   as i note earlier  the  book   s project for dispos incom isn   t too bad  so that would support consumpt growth at least at a moder pace go forward   overal  then  i come out a touch abov the  book  with real growth about   percent in the second half and then gradual return to trend   of cours  i have been expect less of a slowdown than the  book for about a year now   it turn out that  although we have both been too op ist  the  book has been closer to realiti  so my confid in my forecast abil is wane here  the inflat number have been encourag   core pce inflat averag under     percent for the past five month  and overal pce inflat was under   percent for both june and juli   i am particular pleas that tip inflat compens has not increas even as market particip have mark down their expect fund rate path in the midst of the recent turmoil   that said  it still look as though market particip expect inflat to settl near   percent rather than lower  as i would prefer   that conclud my remark
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   to date  econom condit in the seventh district have chang littl sinc our last meet   we continu to expand at a modest rate  as report in the beig book two week ago   even after account for continu declin in the hous sector  most of my contact thought the nation economi had soften   outsid of hous  they general report a modest deceler rather than an abrupt chang in condit   retail thought that continu high energi price were hold back consum  but demand was not seen as deterior sharpli   a similar slow was report on the hire front   for instanc  kelli and manpow experienc softer demand for temporari worker  but again this was not character as a general pullback in hire   mani contact ad that find skill worker remain difficult  as presid   mention  in term of the busi outlook go forward  sever director and other contact note that mani in the busi communiti were apprehens about the prospect for growth   they were concern that these worri might soon begin to weigh more heavili on actual spend  for exampl  in the motor vehicl sector  both ford and general motor caution that the august sale number overst the under strength in demand for vehicl   they thought some select incent program had boost the sale figur   i ask all my contact about the effect of the turmoil in credit market   though it is still earli  none of them thought that the recent financi turbul was caus creditworthi nonfinanci firm to have unusu difficulti in find adequ financ   as sever peopl have said  mani busi peopl suggest that the situat is much better than what they hear from financi comment on wall street   of cours  we heard mani exampl of difficulti from financi market contact  and sever have spoken about that alreadi  turn to the nation outlook  three broad develop sinc our august meet have influenc my view on the econom situat   first  financi condit have becom more restrict   second  the incom data suggest a greater declin in hous and a somewhat weaker labor market   third  inflat prospect have improv to the point where my outyear project are within a rang that mani particip would view as consist with price stabil   these project emb a path for the feder fund rate that is similar to the  book assumpt  with regard to financi condit  i think it is use to consid the situat relat to an assess of a neutral or an equilibrium feder fund rate   take into account the slower growth of structur product  a neutral rate is like between     and    percent   the  book consist rate is in this rang   until recent  one argument for keep the target fund rate at    percent had been to offset otherwis accommod condit   as recent as june  we had veri low risk premium and ampl liquid for all type of privat borrow  includ larg commit for privat equiti deal   now  of cours  overal financi condit have tighten and in some market have turn veri restrict   clear  this restrict is a downsid for growth   whether it is as larg as    percentag point  as the  book assum  is uncertain   in ani event  the ongo repric of risk also add a good deal of uncertainti to the forecast   you all know it is veri difficult to forecast the impact of such financi turbul   recent histori and dave   remind us of this   in the earli     s  restrict credit due to depositori    capit adequaci problem had a signific impact on real econom activ   in contrast  in the fall of       we thought financi condit would imping a good deal on the real economi  but      turn out to be a veri strong year for growth   bottom line   and we all recogn this   we need to be care how we react to the current financi situat  turn more specif to the outlook for growth  our chicago forecast have tend to be somewhat more op ist than the board staff forecast  and we remain so   that said  the incom data have been softer than we expect   so we mark down our assess of residenti invest again  but not as much as the board staff did   again  and the declin in payrol employ caus us to lower our near term outlook somewhat   as long as the financi difficulti are contain  and that is our work assumpt  we expect growth to return to potenti by the second half of       and we have a higher potenti output growth rate than the board staff   howev  i admit that the risk seem weight to the downsid of this project  with regard to inflat  the improv in core pce inflat earlier this year appear to have a bit more stay power than we thought it might   if aggreg demand   weaken  as expect  then there is less risk of inflationari pressur aris from constraint on resourc util   energi price  though  are a concern   my contact do not seem to have much difficulti pass cost increas through to their custom   overal  howev  we have core pce inflat edg down to     percent next year and remain near that rate in        i see the risk to this inflat forecast  condit on the outlook for growth  as be fair well balanc   thank you  mr  chairman

presid  n   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make a few comment about current econom condit and then talk a bit about the outlook   by way of overview  i will say that i larg agre with the  book  both about the current quarter and about the near term outlook  in ani event   the current quarter   look as though it is go to turn out to be certain respect real growth of     percent or perhap a bit more   the anecdot from our district that relat to the third quarter seem to be consist with that   employ has been sustain  and if anyth  the report of the scarciti of skill labor have probabl increas   in fact  some of our director have specul that perhap the aggreg employ gain have been restrain by that avail issu   the largest bank in our district and sever other say that  base on what they are see  consum spend and consum unsecur borrow are proceed normal   repay are proceed normal  and credit qualiti on the consum side is in good shape   the one except to what i would describ as a general posit pictur is what we are hear in the nonresidenti construct sector   i don   t want to make too much of this  but i have a sens that it is signific   some of the larg develop in the district have report that  becaus of the chang in financi condit that has occur in the past month or two  some project are clear be postpon   whether they will ul  be cancel remain to be seen  but there certain have been some effect there  turn to the outlook  i think that the outlook for real growth over the next sever quarter is less favor than it was former   i admit that it   s a stretch to get there  if we reli on our familiar model to produc that result   nevertheless  i take a cue from the comment i made a moment ago about nonresidenti construct   it look as though that will be somewhat slower than i earlier anticip becaus of chang financi condit   i would guess that we would see the same thing in outlay for equip and softwar  so i   m expect a less favor perform there   as far as the hous sector is concern  it seem to me that  given the inventori of unsold home  even if financi condit improv and improv relat quick  hous is go to exert a depress effect on the economi for quit some  e to come  just becaus of the inventori overhang   more broad  the chang in the cost and avail of credit that we see are like to hamper the econom expans for sever quarter   so i have mark down my forecast accord  base on chang in the factor i cite   name  a somewhat less favor outlook for nonresidenti construct and ul  for spend on equip and softwar  prolong weak in the hous sector  and a somewhat less favor outlook for consum spend as a consequ of chang in credit cost and credit avail  on the inflat front  the incom inform is slight more favor than i had earlier expect  and so on margin i have adjust my forecast there as well   i had been expect a diminut of core inflat as a consequ of the eb of transitori factor and of a moder restrict monetari polici   it appear to me now that the decreas in under inflat is occur a littl sooner than i had anticip  and i think this is obvious a posit develop from a number of perspect  one of which is that it is potenti signific as it give us a littl more maneuv room on the polici front if  in fact  it is sustain   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in my view  the balanc of risk has chang signific over the past sever week   although outsid of hous we don   t see much evid nation of a signific soften of growth  growth is like to be somewhat softer than we had expect  and the downsid risk to that lower path have increas substanti   i think inflat risk have diminish somewhat  but we have to remain attent to the familiar sourc of continu upward pressur   financi condit have tighten sinc the august meet  even with the increas in the amount of eas price into market  and despit the moder in the libor term spread to fed fund over the past few day  condit in credit and fund market remain veri fragil   even under relat op ist assumpt about how these develop in market will unfold  the process of adjust will take some  e to work through the financi system  and veri protract impair to market function would rais  of cours  the possibl of even more advers outcom on the real side of the economi  these chang  in my view  justifi a reduct in the fed fund rate at this meet  monetari polici has an import role to play in reduc the width of the advers tail of the rang of potenti outcom for real activ   by reduc the probabl of an extrem bad outcom on the real side  monetari polici can help mitig some of the coordin problem that are hamper financi market function and delay the necessari repric of risk that need to take place  particular in market for term fund  the interbank market  and for mortgag relat product   the difficult and consequenti judgment we face is about the appropri size of the monetari polici respons to these chang in risk to the outlook   i believ the argument work in favor of do more now rather than less   polici need to provid a convinc degre of insur against a more advers outcom  of cours  there are risk of er on the side of do too much now  and let me just address three of those risk   first  a larg move could add to concern about the downsid risk to growth and about financi fragil rather than mitig those concern   my view  howev  is that do too littl now would risk exacerb uncertainti about the macroeconom outlook  and a gradualist  tentat respons would be more disconcert than encourag   the risk of underdo it now is that we will ul  be forc to do more   a second risk is that a larg move now could add to uncertainti about futur inflat outcom   this is true  howev  i think various measur of chang to the inflat outlook suggest that risk to inflat have moder a bit  and the market are display a fair amount of confid in both our will and our abil to keep futur inflat stabl at reason low level   act in a way that suggest that we believ our credibl is more fragil would be more disconcert than encourag to the market   the third risk is that a larg move could reinforc concern that we are ad to the moral hazard in the financi system   this is  i think  an inevit  necessari consequ of act to provid insur against an extrem negat outcom  but it   s not a good argument against do what we think is justifi by the balanc of risk to the outlook   in this context  it is import to be care in the way we talk public about moral hazard regard this balanc   in our financi system there is a substanti amount of leverag in institut and vehicl that are subject to veri acut liquid risk  and part of what you are now see in europ  in the unit kingdom in particular  are the effect on confid of find the wrong balanc  frank  between concern about moral hazard and the appropri role of the central bank in situat like this   i think the framework that the chairman laid out in jackson hole explain exact the right balanc between what we cannot or should not tri to do and what is import to do with monetari polici  the process of adjust and deleverag that is under way in market  in asset price and risk premium  is necessari  and we should not direct polici at interrupt or arrest that process or at insul investor or institut from the consequ of the decis that got us to this point   our object should be to help facilit that process but to do so in a way that reduc the chanc that it will caus too much damag to the function of the core of the financi system and to confid  becaus of the consequ of such a scenario for the real economi   to get through this process  bank balanc sheet need to expand substanti  and we   re fortun that they can expand and are now expand veri substanti   a rang of nonbank financi institut and financ vehicl will have to be unwound and restructur  asset price and risk premium may have to move further as more deleverag take place and asset are liquid   some of the inevit increas in macroeconom uncertainti is price into expect   investor will have to get more comfort that they can make judgment about how to valu mortgag relat and other asset back secur  despit the loss of faith in rate   the process of differenti among strong and weak institut  conduit  financ vehicl  et cetera  also has to continu   but as mani of you said  this process could take quit some  e  and it will leav us with the risk of a fair amount of fragil in market in the interim  let me end just by remind you of what i   ll call the    bernank doctrin of credibl    that the chairman laid out at one of our previous meet   credibl for a central banker is not just about the confid that we instil in market that we will act to keep inflat stabl and low   it is also a function of our capac to demonstr that we have a suffici feel for the evolut of the economi and about confid and that we will meet those inflat object without excess cost to real activ and confid   part of that credibl is a feel for what is happen in market and a capac to look forward and anticip the potenti implic that those develop may have for the outlook   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   the repric of risk and rechannel of credit flow under way i believ will exert restraint on spend  especi in the near term  but over the longer run as well   a critic channel of contagion that came into play in the intermeet period was the involv of the bank as provid of credit and liquid backstop in the abcp market   as a consequ  uncertainti about real estat market  the perform of nonprim mortgag  and structur credit product came to rest as greater uncertainti about bank exposur   the classic flight to safeti under way   the desir to protect capit and liquid   has caus bank and those provid them credit to becom more cautious   this has result in great reduc fund in term market spread the constrict of credit potenti well beyond the mortgag and leverag loan market we talk about in earli august  like so mani around the tabl  i feel that i can honest say that the uncertainti around the output forecast were inde larger than usual this  e   fortun  we don   t have mani degre of freedom to test hypothes about the sort of relationship that we   re talk about here   i think we can expect effect on spend to be greatest in the short and intermedi term  while market are disrupt and while particip are struggl to find new way of intermedi credit that address the perceiv shortcom of the previous practic   in the short run  to preserv capit and liquid while secondari market are impair  bank have tighten term and standard for loan   you can see this direct in the rise in spread in the prime jumbo market  but it must be true for other less easili observ credit as well   some credit  such as nonprim mortgag and leverag loan  just haven   t been avail for a while  an alreadi weak hous market has been most direct affect  and construct sale and price will probabl fall substanti further becaus of the reduc demand along with a larg overhang of unsold home   consumpt spend is also like to be trim   tighter term for home equiti line of credit and second mortgag mean not onli that hous wealth is declin but also that it is probabl less liquid and more expens   to the extent that asset back secur market are affect and lender have question about consum balanc sheet  the cost of consum credit could well rise also   household confid has appar been affect by the advers financi market news   invest spend may also be held down by uncertainti  by a sens that consum demand will be grow less rapid   i have been struck in listen to presid around the tabl report about their district that the tone has shift notic toward less op   slower growth  and more caution on the part of our busi respond   it has been one of those shift that you hear everi coupl of year around the tabl that are differ from what might have been anticip  say  from read the beig book  there is also some tighten of credit condit in the busi sector   for exampl  for commerci real estat credit  as some have note  and for credit for below invest grade firm  as a consequ  some downshift in gdp is high like over the next few quarter  and without polici action  we would most like end up with a substanti lower gdp a few quarter out   inde  in the  book  the output gap is notic wider at the end of       despit near term polici eas of    basi point   i also note downsid risk to my output forecast   it seem to me that  in this period when market are adjust  those risk are most skew   the potenti for advers interact seem larg  as nervous creditor assess the implic of declin in hous price  volatil earn of commerci and invest bank  and setback in overal confid   i think there is a non neglig risk that the constrict in credit avail would feed back on the economi and  in turn  feed back on credit suppli   as market particip are better abl to distinguish and assess risk  liquid will be re establish in mani market   although we have seen some improv in the past week or two  market are still quit dysfunct in mani regard   like other  i think it could take a while to discov how to structur securit that have the requisit transpar and appropri princip agent incent to restor investor confid and to recalibr the role of secur market and bank   the process could be particular drawn out in mortgag and relat market  which are like to be affect for some  e by uncertainti about the price of hous and about the perform of mortgag   moreov  some effect of the recent turmoil will be longer last   risk spread in a great varieti of market are like to be at higher  more realist  and more sustain level  bank should be charg more for credit liquid backstop  less leverag in the financi sector impli a need for return on the greater amount of capit involv in intermedi  includ at bank  and some credit condit at ani given fed fund rate will be tighter one year from now than they were a few month ago  i have concentr on problem for growth  but the upsid inflat risk have not disappear   unit labor cost have been rise   markup  while still high  have come in  afford a reduc cushion for absorb labor cost   resourc util remain high by histor standard   import price may prove problemat   although commod price may level out as in the staff forecast  foreign economi also are produc at high level   pressur on the cost of finish good could increas  especi if the dollar declin further   my expect for the most like path for inflat have been revis just a tick lower  given the favor incom data and the lower path for econom activ relat to potenti  which will increas competit pressur in labor and product market   for now  given this outlook  we need to concentr on the potenti effect of the disrupt to financi market on the real economi when we consid polici in the next portion of this meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as governor kohn just suggest  i think financi market tumult is like to be of suffici durat to have a meaning effect on the real economi   the polici that we   ll be consid later today are unlik to be a panacea  but i think that is not a reason for us to avoid take some smart and preemptiv action   the recuper of these financi market trend is posit  but i wouldn   t measur the recoveri period here in week or even the next coupl of month   i suspect it is go to take longer  the moder growth stori that mani of us have been tell and that is reflect in the  book and has been for some  e appear at best case to be even more moder   the downsid risk and the possibl of some nonlinear event in these financi market are higher  perhap not as high as they might have seem when we last met by videoconfer  but those prospect are still veri real   when we had the videoconfer on august     there appear to be at that moment extrem poor market function  necessit our action that day   i think we right determin that there was a liquid shock  mayb even a liquid crisi  that was affect financi intermediari and that our action were necessari to stop the liquid symptom from manifest themselv as a credit crisi   to that end  our work goe on today  the result from that action and the benefit of  e seem to have stop the bleed  and the deterior of financi market condit has larg ceas   howev  although the improv at this point are quit encourag  i don   t think they are yet convinc   let me just spend a few moment on the distinct phase of what this financi market distress has look like and tri to outlin  mayb even oversimplifi  where we are in that  phase   strike me as liquid replenish by financi institut and marketmak alik   dure the past three to four week  commerci bank  invest bank  asset manag  and other privat pool of capit have had to reassess their liquid need  their cash need  in light of the tougher financi market condit   today  by and larg  they have more cash on hand than they ever thought would be necessari or prudent   but that liquid replenish  at least for the median and stronger firm  is somewhat complet as they evalu what the risk are of conting liabil come on their balanc sheet and as they reevalu the stress test and the comment of the peopl and the risk manag who had been tell them that they were ripe for financi distress   some degre of confid has been broken over the past six week   i wouldn   t say it has been reestablish  but i think that is probabl one of the thing in the post sarban oxley era that are give the decisionmak at these financi institut a littl less interest in dive back into these market   they learn that mayb what they had at their dispos or what they thought they knew wasn   t as certain as they had hope   mani of these financi institut dure the past sever week still thought that anoth leg down was possibl   that strong financi institut were continu to ensur  and would continu to ensur even today  against four sigma event   and that the best way for them to lose their job in this environ was to be short of liquid   they are also veri focus on what is happen among their peer   they are veri focus on their relat strength  and they certain want to be the survivor if the situat get dramat wors   all of these are in some way ex post ration for whi mani of these institut didn   t serv in the shock absorb role that we would have expect them to take quick after market distress had begun   i think they are get use to the new environ   they have long sinc forgotten the robust  e and the robust profit of the past five year  and they are look at their capit ratio and get some comfort from what their peopl are tell them   but when we look at these financi institut  we are probabl more prudent to judg them by their action rather than what these capit ratio would suggest   their action are still not ebulli   their action are still not over opportunist  i said befor that liquid is confid   well  in  e like this  i might be wrong  liquid is oxygen   they can   t live without it  and no price can compens them dure this liquid replenish period for a lack of oxygen   i think o  level might now final be return  so that they can enter phase   of this process  when they are abl and will to part with their cash   phase    thus  is about find new market clear valuat  be abl to discrimin among differenti asset  and be abl to put opportunist capit to work  admit  i   d say this valuat phase is less advanc than the liquid phase  but the process of price discoveri is slowli but sure work it way through these asset class   high yield bond are one exampl   chrysler price high yield bond at      a coupl of day later they were trade at      other sort of leverag loan and high yield financ have indic price in the mid   s  but there are veri big pipelin  as we have discuss befor  that could take a while to clear   my best guess is that we won   t see those market clear until after the commerci bank announc their third quarter result   so in mid octob  we might see a new es  of that  but i will admit it   s veri hard to say   the price discoveri process around subprim mortgag is less advanc  but even there we are see trade desk ask the execut on the top floor for balanc sheet capit becaus they see great price for which they just need the balanc sheet   that those discuss have begun and are somewhat more advanc than when we last talk is an encourag sign  but the process of adjust to the new market realiti will take  e   bill   spoke in great detail about other import develop   discrimin among asset back commerci paper program be made depend on sponsor and collater  financi institut and the counterparti risk they repres be differenti  and commerci bank more so today than even some week ago will to invest in jumbo prime mortgag in the expect that the securit market will reopen  it strike me that we are substanti advanc in the liquid phase and onli somewhat advanc in valuat   that would take us to the third phase   the third phase is about the cost of capit   we   ll talk about it more in the next round  and op  i would say that the liquid replenish and valuat necessari would be far more advanc befor monetari polici action would have to be put into place   but i think we bought ourselv some  e  and this strike me as the right moment for us to take monetari polici action   the good news is that we have seen some tentat progress in those first two phase  and we   ll talk more about our action to come  let me just highlight a few more issu   what are the key challeng   what are the thing to which we might want to look to see if the situat continu to improv modest or revers itself   i would look at a few thing   first  as you look at some of these siv structur and conduit  particular outsid the mortgag asset  to this point they are larg suffer from a liquid crisi rather than a credit crisi   that could chang if the real economi falter  and that is an addit reason for us to take monetari action today   second  mani still believ that it   s not safe to come out and play  and they are continu to hunker down   i would have thought  right when this start brew in the middl of august  that by now folk would have been more comfort  but the median person is still more scare than i would have expect  third  leverag is harder to come by   even on invest for which the credit work seem pretti easi  like high yield  it is hard to get leverag alongsid these equiti placement  make folk less interest to jump back in a big way becaus the return aren   t there   anoth indic i   d look to is the medium term note market  which we haven   t discuss a great deal but is realli a sibl of some of these other commerci paper market   they don   t appear to be too distress at this  e  but as mention earlier  i would also look at the mortgag back secur around commerci real estat   the lack of term fund  which we   ll discuss when we discuss the auction term facil  has put financi market improv at some risk   even though we have been see real improv in recent trade day  the prospect that these institut are roll over their fund and look for fund everi day strike me as signific increas the tail risk and suggest that we need to take action  final  on the real economi  have spoken to a rang of credit card compani ye day to tri to get their sens of three thing  i can give i think general posit report  first  as a measur of retail sale  the view of institut that cater to the high end  the middl end  and the low end is that retail sale in august and through the first two week of septemb were fine  not great   but when i ask them the question    if you weren   t awar of what was happen in the financi market and you were just to review these data    it look as though someth happen     it look as though there was some exogen shock     to a person the answer was     no  it look as though thing are come along okay      i think that   s reason encourag   second  i ask them about the credit qualiti of consum behavior  whether delinqu for individu credit card behavior at the low  medium  or high end had chang  and the answer was that they realli hadn   t chang much   they can look and find yellow or red flag  but they said general that consum credit qualiti also look fine   i   d say the biggest caution from three or four of these credit card compani came on the corpor side  corpor want to be more protect  be more risk avers dure this period  seem to have cut back on allow expens for thing like airlin  hotel  confer  and the like  so their corpor credit volum had slow up somewhat   but  again  noth over dramat  last  i would just share the uncertainti and hesit that has probabl crept it way back into boardroom general as mani of these compani outsid the financi sector are tri to figur out what the crystal ball look like for the real economi   that hesit is not use  and as i said at the outset  i think the best case is that we give up a coupl of tenth of gdp   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   obvious  i agre with virtual everyon around the tabl that some of the downsid risk have increas  and it   s import to think about them in term not just of the overal averag but of tail risk   as vice chairman   point out  one of the respons we have overal is for think about macroeconom and financi stabil  and so we have to take into account those tail risk   even if they may not chang the mean or the median forecast that much  it is import that we think about those downsid scenario   obvious  the chanc of those has increas   now  whether that is like is someth we will continu to discuss   some of those channel through which this could be happen are from the real sector in hous  concern about inform in subprim market lead to broader problem in the market   i   d like to character the market as be brittl  that is  they are in a state such that a littl pressur here or a littl pressur there has the potenti to caus some crack   mani market are function  but some are not function veri well  and there is alway the potenti for someth els to come along the line  even just a small amount of pressur   we saw that what realli initi thing right after our fomc meet was bnp pariba   s announc   that get back to someth that    son said earlier in one of these thing   it was hard to know that it was come  and it would have been hard to know that it would have the kind of effect that it seem to have of lead to a revalu of risk not just in the subprim sector but much more broad   so i think we have to be veri   mind of the brittl of these market   i do think that the number that have come in  look in the rearview mirror  are pretti  strong   look forward  there is more uncertainti  as dave and other have mention   we     obvious have the hous market problem  and we have the challeng in the labor market    to throw someth in from an anecdot survey  although it   s a fair systemat survey   at    duke they survey     cfos of major corpor  and they ask a seri of extra question  the survey was done in august  and so it was fill out by the end of august   we don   t know      exact when they fill these out  but they had to be in by the end of august   ask about the   financi market turmoil  three quarter of the cfos said that it had no direct effect on them  but     onli    percent said that they were take no action becaus of the financi market turmoil   a   third of them said that they were go to be reduc capit spend  and    percent said that     they were go to be reduc hire   this is not just of the one quarter who said that there     would be direct impact but of everyon  three quarter of whom said that there would be no   direct impact   but they said that they were reduc capit spend plan and hire plan   so       this uncertainti could have real effect from these channel that we haven   t yet seen   also  for   what it   s worth  though i guess it   s more relev for the next round  one of the question was       would you be help by a    basi point cut in the feder fund rate      a resound     percent said no   less than one third said that it would be more than a moder help to them   but that   s someth we   ll get to in a bit      one thing that i want to do   it has been import in my think and was also rais by   a few peopl   is look at the parallel and differ with      becaus that is the closest   episod that i can think of in which mani of the same liquid issu came up   a dramat widen of the on the run  off the run treasuri spread  actual  much larger in      than we have seen recent  a plung in short term yield  and a veri strong desir for short term treasuri paper   exact as we have seen in both case  although greater volatil in that short term market today than in      and higher volatil with respect to the equiti market today than in        spread also move up   term spread  swap spread  and cp spread went up quit dramat  although in certain type of cp spread a littl bit less back then than today  an interest thing i note in go back and look at the old memo  which were creat i think by some of the peopl who are in the room now  was that one thing that brought the cp market back in         was not an innov but the dramat greater use of someth that had onli just start to be use   asset back commerci paper   provid collater that help peopl to feel confid that they could buy this commerci paper and someth would be there   so it is sort of iron to see that the challeng today was the innov that  to some extent  save the cp market back then   we are see the same kind of swell of bank balanc sheet today that we were back then   an enorm amount of liquid come into the bank system   in term of the macro shock  there are some parallel and differ   we came into the summer of       with an economi that was grow reason strong  exact the  e of those product shock that weren   t fulli understood   some peopl had the intuit that those product shock were go to be strong  but they were stronger than the  book and  i think  ani of the privat sector economist had anticip   there was also an import intern shock  which we don   t have now  and there was also a veri strong polici respons  which help provid liquid in the emerg market   interest  there was a polici cut of    basi point in a fair short period of  e   we will get to that in the second round  but someth that i think is differ is that the sourc of the uncertainti  at least so far as market particip were concern  was realli focus veri much on     the intern market and     ltcm   the intervent in the intern market through the imf  the world bank  and other were help to respond to some of those   there was the work out in septemb  actual befor ani of the fomc rate cut occur  to tri to settl the ltcm issu  but be abl to focus on the sourc of the uncertainti as the market particip perceiv it back then was veri import   i think we have a much greater challeng today becaus the sourc of uncertainti is realli a chang in the whole model of how these market are oper  in the old day  we use to know where the risk were  unfortun  we knew that they were all on the bank balanc sheet   with the origin to distribut model and securit  we have been abl to move to a differ model in which the risk are much more dispers   not all of them are on the bank balanc sheet  although some of them are certain go to be come onto the bank balanc sheet  so the bank never fulli get out of this   but it lead to potenti pocket of uncertainti  and that is exact what has come up   peopl don   t have as much inform as they thought they had   they were reli on tradit rate agenc and on other sourc that were perfect fine for tradit credit but more of a challeng for the newer credit   so i have some  said to market particip who talk about this     well  you know  you were too trust of those rate  and i think now you   ve learn that ronald reagan was right     trust  but verifi         thus there   s a lot more that is be spent on tri to verifi what the valu of credit is in these market   you can see that as be somewhat ineffici becaus now everybodi has to do that individu rather than just reli on a central credit rate agenc  but obvious there are question about the effect of that credit rate agenc  that is one reason that i see a slow recoveri in some of these market   market particip realiz that they didn   t have the inform they thought they had   they are now go to have to invest much more in get that inform   i think one thing that has been import in the action we have undertaken is to provid liquid and support so that peopl should feel it is worthwhil to make the invest  to do the due dilig  and to tri to understand that they need to verifi the rate or other thing that are out there  the bank system  as has been mention  is in a good state  but i don   t want to overst that becaus there are challeng in bring thing onto the bank balanc sheet   as was mention  a lot of capit is abov the regulatori minimum  but there is a reason that bank hold capit abov their regulatori minimum   they are concern about rate  regardless of what peopl may say about rate agenc these day  they are still sensit to that   bank are worri about make sure that they are perceiv as have suffici capit and suffici liquid   so one shouldn   t just say     well  you can use up all that capit      with the divis of bank supervis and regul  we have tri to add up the maximum amount of siv conduit  the abcp that could come onto the book  which is potenti in the hundr of billion of dollar  and the amount of leverag loan commit  which is about      billion to      billion just for the four or five major bank alon   that still  sn   t bring you to say capit fall below    well capit     but that is not where their bank want to be   so i do think that the bank would react if these thing start come onto their book   in addit  we did some investig with the occ through the share nation credit program   we pull record on about     credit at the major institut to tri to see what the underwrit standard were   we found   or i should say that the examin found   that about    percent of those were consid to have weak underwrit standard   now  that  sn   t necessarili mean that there are go to be problem or loss  but it was much higher than had been expect  about    percent of those were on u s  bank and    percent on foreign bank organ  but almost half of them were on nonbank organ   i don   t want to overemphas the challeng to the bank  but there still may be these pocket of weak out there that we are not sure about  what that bring me to  in think of where we are  is that we have gotten into a veri good situat from a risk manag point of view   by hold the line and be veri credibl on inflat  we have seen core number declin over the past three to six month and in a fair consist way  exact as     said   even as the market have dramat reevalu where they think polici is go to go in the short and intermedi term  we have seen veri littl chang in market expect of inflat   that give us a lot more potenti to be abl to move forward   also  from a risk manag and insur perspect  what if the economi   take off   what if it is           i have some number that the staff provid to me   in the novemb      fomc meet  which was the last  e they rais interest rate  real gdp was forecast at     percent for        and it turn out to be       they were predict     percent growth for        it actual turn out to be       but the key from my perspect is what happen to inflat  becaus one way of think about it is  what is the steep of the phillip curv   there may be other explan for this   the  book forecast for the novemb fomc meet was     percent for core cpi inflat in        and the  book was spot on   that   s what it was in         the  book was forecast     for         it turn out to be   percent   it was actual lower than it had been and than was forecast   so even with a    basi point increas  even with veri littl effect on the macroeconomi  it turn out that there was not much of a tradeoff  not much of a loss in buy that insur   that hearten me as we go into the next round to think about the polici choic   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   clear  the key issu in think about where the economi is and what we need to do about polici is the financi destruct that is go on right now   when i look at it  i think about the differ episod that we   ve had in the post world war ii period and separ them into two set of episod   there   s the episod of      with the penn central crisi  there   s the      stock market crash  there   s the      ltcm episod  and then  of cours  the world trade center terrorist tragedi in        that   s one group  in those context  there was a lender of last resort oper   it was activ polici on our part  and it did resolv the situat in the financi market veri quick   the other episod is the earli     s  when there was much more of a sever structur problem in which the bank got into troubl   therefor  it took quit a long  e for them to fix their balanc sheet in order to get player back into the financi market to make loan to peopl who had good invest opportun  when i look at the current episod  i see someth in between   i do not think that in this case the situat can be resolv quick becaus i think that the price discoveri issu are sever   in particular  we   ve gone to an origin to distribut model  which governor   mention  and we have found some serious flaw in it   the expect is that we will have new model come out   in fact  i think that this is actual go to be a long run profit opportun for the bank   so if we were allow to buy bank stock  i think it would be a good idea    laughter   but the key problem is that this is go to take a substanti amount of  e  even if thing go veri well  in that context  there is a substanti negat shock to aggreg demand and  therefor  a substanti weaker economi   howev  the issu that most concern me here is that  even though i think the modal forecast is that growth will be slower than we expect  the downsid risk is actual veri  veri substanti   though we may not be allow to mention it in public  we have to mention the    r    word becaus there is now a signific probabl of recess   the problem here is realli the interact of the financi side with the real side   i   m worri that  as the economi becom more nonlinear  we have the potenti for a vicious circl or a downward spiral  whatev phrase you want to use   that  in particular  we have a financi disrupt  which mean that it   s harder to alloc capit to peopl with product invest opportun and  as a result  you get a contract in econom activ  a contract in econom activ make inform revel or price discoveri harder to do  that can then lead to more financi disrupt  which lead to a downward spiral in term of econom activ   so the big issu here for me is that this nonlinear element is veri real right now   the question is what to do about it  and that   s what we will be discuss short  howev  i think it is also import to recogn that inflat risk are just not that sever right now   that   s the good news becaus it will allow us flexibl to deal with the situat   in particular  we see inflat expect that are veri ground  someth that everybodi has mention   also  even in the modal forecast and not worri about the downsid risk  the expect futur output gap are more negat  so we have less pressur go forward there   i was happi that the staff slight lower the nairu es   which was consist with my view in the past coupl of cycl  when i thought that it might be a smidgeon under   percent   i think their revis make sens  and  again  it mean that there   s a bit less likelihood of upsid risk to inflat   then  also  there are the downsid risk to real growth  when i look at the inflat situat  i do think that inflat expect are ground around   percent right now   by the way  that   s not necessarili written in stone becaus thing that we might do could actual chang inflat expect  but i think that we have to take inflat expect as given right now   howev  i see that the risk are slight to the downsid from that   percent level becaus of the thing that i   ve just mention   the key point here is that we have a situat of potenti nonlinear  big tail risk  that could actual get veri nasti  and in fact there is a potenti for recess   on the other hand  i don   t see that inflat risk is the big problem right now   thank you
thank you  and thank you all   let me just briefli summar and make a few addit comment   financi market condit were a key theme of our discuss today   recent develop in financi market have been reflect in reduc willing to take risk and in tighter credit condit   bank balanc sheet are a potenti constraint on credit extens   particip were unsur about how long these condit would persist  but the repric of risk seem like to be persist   the tighter credit condit will veri like weaken an alreadi veri weak hous market  as nonprim borrow are ration out and jumbo mortgag borrow pay higher premium   mortgag rate reset and foreclosur pose further risk   industri relat to hous are natur show weak  howev  creditworthi borrow are abl to obtain credit   second quarter and third quarter gdp figur may be solid  but even so there have been some sign of slow in the economi  even befor the financi market develop  notabl in the labor market and in hous  auto output is also on the weak side   labor market do remain tight  and in general main street has been far less affect thus far than wall street   consum spend continu to grow along with incom  and net export remain strong   financ should continu to be avail for capit invest   there were some region differ in sound on busi confid and expect  but in ani case  uncertainti has increas   some of the key question includ whether the further weak of hous will spread to consum spend  whether credit tight will affect sector other than hous  includ the household sector and commerci real estat  and whether the labor market will continu to slow   there is a general view that downsid risk to output have increas with some veri bad scenario at least conceiv  howev  other note the resili of the u s  economi and the fact that previous financi crise had not necessarili reduc growth   inflat has moder somewhat  and more particip view the risk to inflat as closer to balanc   inflat expect remain stabl  and cyclic slow is like to reduc the pressur on resourc   howev  tight labor market  strong foreign demand  high oil price  and other pressur still do exist  are there ani question or comment   let me just make  as i said  a few extra comment here   more so than usual  we have to look forward rather than backward   we have to tri to assess how these recent develop chang the outlook  and that is veri difficult   to me  the critic element to look at are hous and labor market   i think the interact of those two sector will determin the dynam of the economi   there has been some discuss about the fact that in      there was veri littl effect of the financi market on the real economi   there was no obvious channel of effect in that episod   in this case  there is  i think  a pretti clear channel of effect through mortgag lend  and we have alreadi seen chang in avail of mortgag and chang in cancel  sale expect  and the like   i would note that there are also   as you can see in the consum confid number  for exampl   expect on the buyer side   if buyer think that the hous market is go to be veri weak  they will be less like to want to get into it   final  credit avail to homebuild may also be an issu   so i think there is pretti much a consensus that the hous sector will take anoth leg down base on financi market condit   i mention parenthet that i have some concern also about a few other area  notabl commerci real estat  and perhap other like consum credit and auto as well  but  again  i think the focus should be on hous  on the labor side  i think we can pars the job report number in some detail   for exampl  on the one hand  the august report was not quit as weak as the market thought it was  on the other hand  it revis down some previous number   so overal there seem to be a sens that labor market were slow a bit befor the financi crisi   even so  we have been expect weaken in labor market for some  e  and i think now that the odd of that are realli quit high   i do expect to see continu expans in construct layoff   there are loss of job  obvious  in mortgag financ and other relat area   so i don   t know how quick the labor market will weaken  but i do believ that it will weaken over the next coupl of quarter  now  those are two predict   then the question is  what is the interact between those two thing   i think there is potenti for a negat feedback cycl  which is of some concern   if labor market weaken  particular if they weaken sever in certain local area  it will hurt hous price through two mechan   first  hous price capit employ and other econom opportun in an area  so hous price will fall as econom activ slow  second  the demand for hous or the abil to make hous payment direct depend on labor incom   work in the other direct  as hous price fall  the normal wealth effect  but also possibl precautionari save effect or other liquid effect  could begin to affect consum confid and consum spend  and we get the make of a potenti recessionari dynam that may be difficult to head off   that is the scenario that concern me   i don   t know if it   s the modal scenario  but i think it   s one we need to watch veri care  beyond that scenario  there are further tail risk   as a number of peopl have mention  most recent governor    these financi effect   financi acceler effect  if you will   can be quit nonlinear   the  book has a   percent declin in hous price in each of the next two year   it   s veri possibl that the declin could be greater than that   even if it   s not greater than that  it will not be uniform distribut around the countri   in some part of the countri  hous price declin will be much more signific   the nonlinear i   m talk about has to do with the distribut of equiti among famili   if you have a    percent declin in hous price and two famili  each of which has    percent equiti in their home  then each famili is go to experi basic the normal wealth effect   but if one famili has     percent equiti and the other has   to    percent equiti  the effect on behavior will not be linear  there will be a bigger effect on the famili that find itself in financi stress  and the possibl exist that weaken in these market could feed back into some of the financi problem we are see   so i am concern about get ahead of what could be an advers dynam between the job market and the hous market  on inflat  i think the slow that we are like to see will probabl remov some of the upsid risk that we have been concern about   i don   t know how these hous develop will affect owner    equival rent   we saw some pervers effect last  e   they are still possibl   a veri small piec of inform is that the ppi number ye day actual had some favor news in them in term of both intermedi good and medic cost   so the near term still look to be fair good   but i don   t dismiss inflat risk by ani mean  and we know that polici chang can work through expect as well as through resourc pressur  and so i consid that to be a serious concern   nevertheless  i do at this point think the princip risk are to the downsid  and the interact between differ compon of the economi present the biggest challeng in that respect   i will stop there      if you are readi to introduc the polici altern now
thank you  mr  chairman    to guard against the conting that our secur procedur have broken down and the committe   s polici draft are be monitor by unknown forc  the staff has taken countermeasur by circul multipl draft of tabl      laughter   of the two draft circul this morn  i will be refer to the draft label  perhap too obvious  septemb            to summar  altern a and b would both reduc the target feder fund rate    basi point today to    percent but would differ in their risk assess  altern a would conclud that  even after the    basi point eas  the downsid risk to growth would outweigh the upsid risk to inflat  wherea altern b elid an assess of the balanc of risk but cite heighten uncertainti about the outlook   altern c reduc rate    basi point and describ the risk as tilt to the downsid   altern d leav the stanc of polici unchang but would character the risk to growth and inflat as now balanc   base on your remark this morn and the propos by near all the reserv bank to reduc the primari credit rate  it seem like that most or all of you favor some eas in the stanc of polici today   thus  the question this morn would seem to be how much to reduc rate as well as the rational for that action and the type of forward look languag to provid   the modal outlook in the staff   s  book forecast would seem to argu clear for polici eas befor long   the staff has interpret recent financi develop as like to inflict an appreci and fair immedi advers shock on aggreg demand   as dave note  real gdp growth is project to slow to   percent in the fourth quarter and to remain near that sluggish in the first quarter   the economi skirt recess  but real activ expand onli    percent next year  less than potenti  so modest slack emerg  and the unemploy rate rise to near   percent  a bit abov the staff   s downward revis es  of the nairu   this slack contribut to an edg down of core inflat to just under   percent  and declin in energi price help push total pce inflat down to    percent next year  beyond next year  real growth gradual strengthen to around it potenti rate   as i note earlier today  the central tendenc of your out year project suggest that most of you would find a pce inflat rate level out in the vicin of    percent  in conjunct with econom growth return to a potenti rate of around     percent   a rate a bit higher than es  by the staff   to be an appeal outcom   of cours  while you may be satisfi with such an outcom  the key question is what monetari polici path would be most like to produc it   in the staff   s baselin assess  a    basi point eas in the feder fund rate over the next few month suffici cushion the blow of the current financi shock to keep the expans go in come quarter while still allow inflat to settl down to rate that    materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     most of you evid would find consist with price stabil   if your own modal outlook is similar to the staff   s baselin assess  you might find the select of ani of altern a  b  or c at this meet to be appropri   an immedi    basi point reduct  as in altern a and b  would acceler the drop in the actual feder fund rate by just a month or two relat to the  book   a    basi point eas today coupl with an assess that the risk are tilt to the downsid  as in altern c  and an expect on your part that anoth eas would like be forthcom would also be essenti consist with the staff outlook   thus  your choic among those three approach might depend import on risk manag consider   sever of the  book altern simul explor the possibl that polici might need to be eas more aggress   in the    greater hous correct    scenario  the subprim mortgag market is assum to remain close over the entir project period rather than to recov partial as in the baselin  and hous price declin    percent over the next two year  rather than just a few percent   in such circumst  aggreg demand weaken consider below baselin  and the taylor rule suggest that the fund rate should gradual be eas to    percent by        the    greater hous correct with larger wealth effect    scenario  in which the effect of the greater hous contract are augment by a larger sensit of household spend to household wealth  point to an even greater eas   anoth possibl is that forc acquisit by bank of larg volum of abcp  leverag loan  and other asset erod their capit ratio  bring them closer to regulatori threshold and benchmark negoti with rate agenc  and that bank respond by tighten credit term and standard   part becaus episod featur sharp chang in credit avail are relat rare  assess these effect is fraught with uncertainti   but the    bank capit crunch    scenario in the  book  which was base loos on the earli     s headwind episod  suggest that polici might need to be eas signific and quick  with the fund rate dip to    percent by june   if committe member are inclin to put appreci weight on the possibl that someth resembl ani of these three scenario could transpir  they might be inclin toward altern a   an immedi reduct in the fund rate of    basi point at this meet coupl with an assess that the risk remain tilt to the downsid   the effect of a preemptiv eas of polici   work through the standard transmiss channel of lower long term yield  a lower exchang valu of the dollar  and higher equiti price and household wealth   might help cushion the economi from a sharp weaken of aggreg demand   in current circumst  a relat aggress eas of polici and the sens that more could be come if need might be particular help in thaw financi market or at least in prevent a harder freez and thus might work import through credit channel as well as direct through open market price   a relat larg and immedi reduct in the feder fund rate might go some consider distanc toward allevi concern on the part of market particip regard further eros in the valu of asset held as collater   it might also be seen by investor as a signal that the feder reserv will act forc to sustain econom growth  help to limit lender    concern about loss   by reduc the fear of market particip and banker about counterparti credit exposur and credit risk more general   or at least help to prevent them from worsen   a prompt and sharp eas of polici might help avert a signific tighten in credit term and standard and thus sustain growth in aggreg demand   in this way  monetari polici might be direct proxim at improv the function of financi market but ul  at the committe   s longer run object   this argument is easi both to misconstru and to exagger   easi to misconstru becaus it may appear that polici is respond direct to asset price and easi to exagger becaus polici eas cannot do much to dispel the fundament econom loss alreadi in train  for exampl  on subprim mortgag invest   but it may be abl to help prevent them from contribut to a cumul weaken of activ that would increas credit risk more general and feed back advers onto growth   on the other hand  the committe may not be persuad that the hit to aggreg demand will be as sever as project by the staff in it baselin forecast  let alon in the weaker altern simul in the  book   member may feel that at least some of the histori of financi crise over the past two decad suggest that financi market can bounc back fair quick onc the immedi crisi has pass and that the real economi can be surpris resili in the face of temporari financi disrupt   both      and      come to mind  as was point out previous  as episod in which  at least arguabl  the restrain effect of financi event on the domest economi were not near as sever as policymak fear   a separ point is that mani of you see potenti gdp growth as a bit more robust than the staff  suggest that you may also see equilibrium real short term interest rate as a bit higher   come back to the near term outlook for aggreg demand  even if you think that the staff may be right about the like degre of forthcom financi restraint  you may be quit uncertain on that score   ani of these argument may motiv you to consid the approach of altern c   under that altern  you would eas    basi point today and issu a statement that character the downsid risk to growth as outweigh the upsid risk to inflat   such an assess would posit you well to respond to incom sign of econom weak  should they appear  by eas polici at some point over the next meet or two   this approach might also be seen as advantag if you are particular concern that the committe would find it difficult to quick revers eas move that subsequ prove to be unnecessari   you might also prefer a    basi point rate cut for now if you are concern that investor could misread a    basi point eas as a sign that the committe was respond direct to asset price  potenti exacerb moral hazard by encourag excess risk take   altern b may be seen as the middl ground between altern a and c  altern b would adopt the more aggress    basi point polici eas of altern a but would not make an explicit assess of the balanc of risk and thus would provid no direct indic that the committe was consid a further eas move   as note in the bluebook  adopt of altern b would be consist with the    basi point downward revis to the  book consist measur of r    polici eas of rough that magnitud over the next sever quarter would also be consist with the op  polici calcul under a   percent inflat rule as well as with a number of the polici rule present in the bluebook  even if you are not sure that the advers effect on aggreg demand of ongo financi develop will be as sever as built into the  book baselin  you may be concern enough to judg that a    basi point eas of polici today would provid a measur of insur that could prove valuabl if  as seem like at a minimum  further financi aftershock becom evid   as i note  the risk assess propos for altern b is relat open end   the current version suggest be explicit that uncertainti about the econom outlook has increas  for that reason  it   not provid an explicit risk assess  you may believ  given consider uncertainti about the implic of financi develop to date and their like cours go forward  that character the balanc of risk would be quit difficult and may lack credibl   for the same reason  you may find appeal the noncommitt approach of this altern regard futur rate action   as bill   note  market expect for the path of monetari polici have fallen sharpli over the intermeet period   at the moment  market particip seem to put substanti odd on both a    basi point and a    basi point eas today   although  given the modest improv in credit market over the past few day  the former is now seen as somewhat more like   short term rate would like drop a littl under altern b and more sharpli under a  wherea they might move up a littl under c   longer term yield could declin notic under altern a if the statement and the action prompt greater concern among market particip about the outlook   the inconclus risk assess of altern b would like surpris market particip and might prompt some volatil as they attempt to discern your messag   but all thing consid  the rate action and the statement associ with altern b and c do not seem sharpli at odd with expect  and we would not expect larg net market reaction
thank you   are there ani question   if not  we   ll have our polici go round   mani peopl have alreadi tip their hand   we do have a      constraint  so i hope that peopl will keep that in mind   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   have been a part of this polici group for a while  the one thing i can tell you with certainti is that  no matter what we do today  it will be critic   laughter  and unlik us  our critic will be absolut confid in their posit   so have recogn that  i would feel comfort if the committe move down    basi point today  and if possibl  i would like to be certain that we don   t convey that other move will follow in the futur unless the econom and inflat outlook requir it   there are a coupl of reason for this   the first is obvious   the turmoil and the increas uncertainti about the futur  which i think as a monetari polici group we have to take into consider   second  as i said in my earlier remark  i think that our effect polici has becom tighter over the past year and  therefor  it warrant some reduct in real rate   this will take us a littl bit closer toward neutral  which i think is an appropri place for us to be  with that said  as far as the statement goe  i feel most comfort with altern b   that cover one part of my reason for want this reduct  and i think that the inflat outlook and the real rate can go unsaid for the  e be   i would also just mention that  depend on how our convers about the auction credit facil goe  i would be comfort with an appropri discount rate of the same amount or  as i said in our earlier video confer  i would not have ani opposit to that discount rate come down an addit    basi point beyond what i   m recommend here for the fed fund rate   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you might imagin  i   ve struggl mightili with this particular decis   my outlook for the economi has chang suffici for me to support a cut in the fed fund rate at this meet   my reason may be a littl differ from that of some of you  nonetheless it lead to the same outcom   my view is in mani way similar to that of presid     that econom growth has slow  and it is like to be somewhat slower into        thus my view that the equilibrium real rate has declin and it forecast has declin somewhat lead to my view that the fund rate need to follow that real rate down   also  given the current behavior of inflat  i am more comfort move toward what i would consid to be a more neutral rate  if we do cut the fund rate today  howev  i believ that how we communic that is far more import than anyth that we may do in a long  e   this is particular true sinc we have not been particular clear about our inflat goal   as i mention in my earlier comment  i   d be much more comfort with this if we had a numer target  which would help anchor expect   i think we need to convey the idea that our polici  as mani have said  is base on our forecast for growth and inflat and that it is forward look   that forecast has chang  and we have lower interest rate consist with that revis   with that chang in polici  we need to have a balanc of risk statement that is much more balanc in it assess  moreov  we need to convey to the market that we expect to see some weak data in futur month but that those data to a larg degre are alreadi built into our forecast   the weaker than expect data in the come month will not necessarili result in a new forecast   for exampl  i won   t be revis my forecast just becaus the septemb employ report come in weak   it   s onli when we accumul suffici evid that the economi is veer from our new project path that we would want to revis our forecast and perhap our polici  although i do want to remind everyon that revis can go both way   we might be revis our growth forecast up if the evid suggest that we   ve been too pessimist about hous or about bank credit avail or  as dave   mention  about consum sen ent   similar  we might find that we   ve been too op ist about inflat if inflat expect rise   i think it is crucial that we tri to convey these idea to the public  if not in the statement then at least in the minut and our speech go forward   let me note that our decis to produc our forecast on a more frequent basi will be a major step forward in actual tri to convey this type of inform  i think it would be a mistak  as presid hoenig suggest  to set up expect with our languag that the rate cut today is necessarili or even like the start of a seri of rate cut   this expect could even undermin our action to the extent that it caus consum and busi to postpon spend until they think we   re done and could give the impress that  with each new piec of weak data  we   ll be lower the fund rate further even though we have alreadi incorpor that into our forecast   this reason lead me to think that  if we   re go to cut rate today  i would prefer to do    basi point  provid   and it   s a big proviso   that we work hard in our statement to convey the idea that the action we are take is base on someth like balanc risk   we have brought the rate to a level that we think is consist with our new forecast and consist with our goal of inflat and output growth   in fact  we may even be on hold for a while after this if thing pan out accord to what the  book suggest   i think a    basi point cut would risk set up expect for further cut  which perhap would be read as take the same strategi to lower rate as we took to rais them   i want to avoid that   i do realiz there   s some risk that a more aggress action could actual reignit inflat expect   vice chairman   made three good point about what the risk of a more aggress action are   expect of inflat  fear in the marketplac that we see someth they don   t and that the economi is actual wors than they   re predict  and the potenti for fuel those peopl who think we are bail peopl out and therebi creat moral hazard   those are risk   i don   t deni that   but i think they are manag  particular if we mitig them through our statement by say that we now think risk are balanc and convey the forward look impress that i have given  this bring me to languag   of the three altern in the bluebook  obvious in term of rate cut  altern b is probabl where i   d start  although i   m more inclin to have a more balanc approach to risk in paragraph     in fact  someth more like paragraph   in altern d would suit me better  but perhap a simpler way would be to rewrit paragraph   as follow   this is just a suggest   it   s a littl shorter      with this action  the committe judg that the downsid risk to econom growth are now rough balanc by the upsid risk to inflat   the committe will continu to monitor incom econom inform relat to the outlook and act as need to fo  price stabil and sustain econom growth      that is a littl shorter and convey the kind of balanc that i think is import   in some version of the statement  we have had a littl too much of a temptat to promot the idea that we can fine tune the economi  and i think that   s a danger and slipperi slope   with regard to the rational  i   m happi with paragraph   on inflat  inde  i notic that there was no capac util in that statement  which pleas me no end   laughter   you know  we have to take small victori when we can  i would like to see some chang to paragraph     in particular  i   d like us to say a littl less about the disrupt in the financi market   i think this has the potenti to confus peopl   that our move is be taken as a desir to bail out bad actor   and that could feed into moral hazard  we are move becaus our outlook for the broader economi is weaken   the tighten of credit condit may have the potenti to affect the real economi  and that   s whi we are act preemptiv   so i would again tri to simplifi paragraph    and i suggest the follow languag     econom growth was moder dure the first half of the year  but labor market strength has moder  and the hous correct appear to have intensifi and may be exacerb by the tighten of credit condit   today   s action is intend to help forestal some of the potenti advers effect of those event on the broader economi and to promot moder growth over  e      final  as i said earlier  i believ it will be veri import to communic  in the minut and perhap our speech go forward  that our forecast incorpor weak data in the near term and  although we may individu have differ view as to what that near term might look like  that forecast has been incorpor in our fund rate assess and we intend to alter our bias or our polici onli if our forecast chang appreci in the month to come   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think there   s a general consensus that we should eas   to me the question is not whether to eas but how much is appropri   to eas by    basi point  i think  could be justifi by slow hous and weaken labor market in the absenc of ani financi turmoil   howev  i   m concern that a    basi point eas today might veri well need to be follow by anoth eas  quit possibl befor the next meet   given the econom slow we have seen and the addit slow that is alreadi like as a result of the increas in mani short term interest rate  i prefer a more aggress approach   a    basi point reduct will offset some of the tighten that has alreadi occur in short term interest rate and will reduc the likelihood that the most pessimist outcom for hous price and residenti invest will occur   furthermor  it seem appropri insur against tail event given that inflat pressur are unlik to be a problem given the current econom outlook   altern b in conjunct with other action design to improv liquid seem the most appropri given the current econom outlook
thank you   governor
i   ve alreadi said that i don   t see that the risk is on the inflat front right now  although clear we have to keep monitor inflat  and that the serious risk is the nonlinear downward spiral that could occur   of cours  the big problem is realli the issu of inform revel and price discoveri   i want to point out that there are realli two sourc of this   one is that it   s veri difficult for the market to figur out what the valu of asset in these structur product is   clear  that will take a long  e to work out  and it is not someth that monetari polici can do anyth about   the second sourc of the problem of price discoveri is the fear that  in fact  we might have a sever econom downturn  and we can do someth about that   so in this context a cut is not controversi becaus everybodi is come to the conclus that we should cut the feder fund rate by    basi point and  in particular  that we want to get ahead of the curv to indic to the market that we are on top of this and that we are tri to remov the downsid tail that we   re particular worri about  but i want to talk a littl about a somewhat longer run perspect on monetari polici strategi and how we might proceed from here   the way i think about this is that the situat we have to deal with fall into two camp   the normal situat is when thing are fair linear  when we don   t have financi disrupt   in that case  there is a lot of reason to have what has been character in the academ literatur as polici inertia   that is  the idea that  when you move the feder fund rate  you don   t move it back quick and  in fact  you have veri persist feder fund rate move   inde  i think that is the right thing to do under normal circumst   clear  there   s an issu that move a veri short term interest rate will not have an effect unless peopl expect it to persist   becaus the longer run part of the term structur is more relev to peopl   s decis in term of spend  there   s a veri strong case for pursu thing in a persist way  also  there is alway a problem that  when you revers  peopl may say     gee  you didn   t know what you were do  and you had to chang your mind      so there   s alway this issu of flip flop that you have to be concern about   the other situat is exact the environ we   re in  when you realli have to take out insur against someth that has the potenti to creat a downward spiral that   s hard to control   it   s particular imper in that situat that you get ahead of the curv   in fact  there   s a veri strong case to make sure in that situat that you emphas to the market that you are tri to take out insur against the downward spiral   but if you are success  thing may start to turn around  and if thing go the right way  which is what you hope happen  then you want to revers cours   so in the project that i provid  i did someth that was unusu   i think i was the onli person to have a rate revers in the project  oh  you did  too   okay   so i had us go down    at this meet   i thought there was a possibl   though i hope not   that we might have to go    at the next meet and  if we did  that would certain be enough  and then we would move back up afterward   so in this context  i think that we realli do have to think in term of potenti revers and  therefor  to not be scare of overshoot a bit   there tend to be a lot of inertia in the way we do monetari polici   it is well document   there   s even inertia in general  just in that we have nineteen particip at a tabl  as an academ  i mention to don kohn at one point that some  i think these meet have element of faculti meet  and that is not alway someth that you enjoy    laughter   some of you guy may not have experienc that  but it   s a lot of fun   so i think the bottom line here is that we have to be prepar to think about be much more aggress  not just now but even in the futur   howev  i do want to point out that this   not mean that we should have an altern that indic that we are go to do further cut in the futur   i strong advoc altern b becaus  by aggress action now  we may start turn the market around and  if that   s the case  then it will not be necessari for us to quick do more   so we do not want to say to the market that we have to keep on go when we   re hope that we won   t have to keep on go   i think that   s extrem import in think about where we are right now  anoth issu in term of an extrem aggress polici and then possibl do revers is the moral hazard context   again  i think this is a communic issu   i have a slight disagr with presid   in that i think we have to talk about the financi market disrupt becaus it is veri import to indic that  in be veri aggress  we are not lose sight of our inflat goal and that this is a case of worri about the downsid tail that we have to deal with and realli show that we   re on the ball in that context   so we   re in a slight differ situat from the normal one  and i would advoc keep the discuss of financi disrupt in our statement the way we have it now   thank you
thank you   as you know  i   m an advoc of two day meet   this is exact whi   michell inform me that our true drop dead  e is        so we do need  pleas  to be effici   next is presid
well  in my earlier remark i state my reason for support    basi point  so i will play calvin coolidg here   that is     basi point  altern b   it   s import that we neither signal further action nor suggest that we   re through and that we preserv some flexibl becaus of the uncertainti   so that   s my comment   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   given the shift that i am project in econom outlook  i think that a more decis action is call for today  and i support a    basi point cut in the fed fund target rate   in the past few meet i was in favor of set our fed fund target rate abov neutral to secur progress for disinfl  but that stanc no longer seem compel   recent inflat report have been encourag  and my outlook for inflat show inflat remain in an accept rang   furthermor  an abov neutral stanc   not seem prudent given my project for econom growth   i   m in favor of move our polici stanc back to neutral   obvious it is difficult to know exact where that is  but if the economi is in the midst of a rapid adjust  i would prefer not to be behind the curv   so i would prefer not to be chase neutral down   gradual has it place  but in this instanc i would prefer a more aggress move today and to not leav market with an expect of a long sequenc of move  as other have alreadi note  i prefer the languag of altern b   yes  we may see a great falloff in confid and a further deterior in the econom outlook  but the recent busi pessim that i talk about earlier may also prove to be unfound   therefor  i   d prefer not to lock ourselv into further rate reduct   i also like the uncertainti languag that   s been ad to the new version of altern b   i think  again  with the    basi point move today there   s a good chanc that we   ll be close to neutral  and that   s exact where i think we should be with the uncertainti that mani of us see in the outlook   i also take veri serious the risk of undermin the appropri price of risk in financi market that we face   the long run success of a decis move today pivot on the abil to make clear that we take such action in recognit of the current econom environ and that it is not a rush to protect investor from poor past busi decis   so i support a clear statement that  should be we later find ourselv in calmer financi water and stronger econom wind  we will move quick to affirm our commit to achiev and maintain price stabil   now  becaus of this prefer for downplay the financi market disrupt  i think a simpl way to remov at least one refer to them is to end paragraph   after the word    aris      so    today   s action is intend to help forestal some of the advers effect on the broader economi that might otherwis aris      that get rid of one refer to disrupt in financi market   also  the last part of that statement on promot moder growth over  e almost get lost in that languag  so it might be simpler to just end the paragraph after    aris      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the actual sign of soft we   ve seen are signific enough to warrant a    basi point cut in the fed fund rate   i expect that the slowdown is go to be a littl less sever than that in the  book  and i   m concern about the likelihood of inflat   s remain abov my object   argument for a larger cut appear to rest on the possibl that financi turbul sinc last month could caus signific further reduct in real activ   i think that   s certain a plausibl possibl  and we can   t rule it out at this point   but i don   t see it as extrem like  and so my prefer is for a cut of    basi point   i would describ that prefer as a mild one  and i could support a    basi point cut   i just have this hunch that a    basi point cut might make it easier for us to resist a further cut two meet down the road  whichev we choos  though  i   m veri concern about how we justifi our action  and i share the concern of presid   and pianalto about paragraph     that languag motiv the cut as a way of take out insur against the possibl effect of financi market turmoil   i worri that  if we tie our action too close to the expect effect of financi market condit  as much as we are concern about this  we may make it harder to respond appropri down the road if the data indic that we should take back some rate reduct   the sens of fragil in financi market could well persist  and as long as it    so will the possibl that financi market volatil could creat a drag on spend and growth   the persist of that fragil could hold us back from revers cours if we find that real indic and inflat data indic that we ought to   if we do reduc the target rate by    basi point  i think we should remov the tilt   i like the origin version of altern b that was circul in the bluebook   as draft now  it talk about uncertainti  and one could argu that   s a mean preserv spread  but i think in the context it   s go to be read as the equival of a downward tilt   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   given my outlook for growth and inflat and my assess of the neutral feder fund rate  i can readili agre to    basi point in cut on a cumul basi   i came into this meet have a slight prefer for altern c and do    basi point today with an expect of    at the next meet   i thought that that would take us to a point at which more data would come out and it would be more like that we could perhap stop at a    percent fed fund rate   obvious  if we cut    basi point today  and i have no disagr with that  i think it is then a littl more difficult to stop there   i agre with some of the previous comment that ani action beyond that should be base on incom data that we don   t expect   that is kind of difficult from a communic standpoint   but i   m fine with altern b  in fact  the languag is fine  i   d just like to take a minut to talk about risk manag   we talk a lot about that in term of tail risk and nonlinear and insur  and i think this is quit appropri in the current environ   but we have to continu to ask  what happen in the more like event that thing turn out better than these tail event   that   s whi they   re call tail event   so i agre with governor   that we have to be veri care to think about take them back   if we respond aggress to address financi condit beyond our dual mandat goal  we should be prepar to retrac that pattern of feder fund rate cut if condit calm   with respect to the comment that governor   made about inflat  i think you have to be a littl care   my memori of       was that we actual had a tighten bias when the russian default   ltcm came in   we cut    basi point   thing got better   by the spring  we were debat whether or not we should tighten   by the june meet  we did begin to tighten  and we went up to     percent   my memori of core cpi in      is that it increas about   percentag point   i think there was some diverg between pce and cpi over that  e period   it is someth to keep in mind  but i can support    today
presid   join the tabl with twelv year of experi alreadi    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be glad if you don   t tell how mani year of experi i have around this tabl    laughter   i support the action and the languag of altern b for the reason that have been given by mani other around this tabl   i think that the odd favor a signific reduct in aggreg demand owe to the financi condit we   ve all been talk about   i agre with governor   that part of the disrupt effect of the financi condit are the small chanc of a veri advers effect   the sort of interact you were talk about  mr  chairman   hold back and do just    in that context would be a mistak   go ahead and do    will larg reliev some uncertainti  with regard to some of the comment about languag  the discuss of credit condit in financi market in paragraph    i guess my read of what we talk about today was just this  and it seem to me that the way it is now is veri transpar   it   s a nice replic of the discuss we have had  and so i don   t see a need to subtract languag about financi market from this   with regard to the balanc of risk in paragraph    also consist with our discuss is the sens that there   s a huge amount of uncertainti about how thing are go to evolv  both the market and the effect on the economi   i don   t feel as though i know enough to say that the risk are balanc   i don   t know   the rang of outcom is just too wide  and there   s veri littl central tendenc in it  so i   d be veri uncomfort with a statement say that i kind of thought the risk were balanc  i am much more comfort with a statement that say there is a lot of uncertainti out there and that   s uncertainti around the econom outlook   so i think the current languag in paragraph   is also a nice represent of the discuss we had today and consist with our ignor  i   m not concern about the moral hazard issu   i think our job is to keep the economi at full employ and price stabil and let asset market fluctuat around that   there will be winner and loser   that   s fine   the congress told us to have maximum employ and stabl price  and that   s what we should be about here   some  that mean you need to move to keep employ maximum or price stabl  and we need to take account of the asset market but not worri about the effect of those action on asset market per se   hold back   inertia   becaus of concern about moral hazard would be a serious mistak   we shouldn   t hold interest rate higher than they need to be in order to impos addit cost on borrow to teach lender a lesson   too mani innoc bystand would be hurt in that process   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i strong support the bluebook altern b   i think a    basi point cut right away is appropri  and i like the languag   my reason for support this action are  first  that inflat has been quit well behav   i   m pretti sanguin about the futur   second  i think the avail econom data that preced the financi shock are separ from it and support a fed fund rate cut entir on their own   you can see that just by look at the backward look taylor rule in the bluebook  which suggest that the fed fund rate in the third and fourth quarter should be well below where it is now   in part  inflat has come down  and as presid hoenig and other have point out  that   s rais the real fed fund rate   so a real rate of    percent now   i think the stanc of polici is unnecessarili restrict  and that is befor recent develop   third  of cours  is that the financi shock has made financi condit more restrict   even if thing sort themselv out  i think the condit will remain more restrict   i thought the bluebook gave us a good method for see how much more in show that the  book implicit equilibrium fund rate has declin    basi point sinc august  that say to me that a    basi point cut is not too much to tri to neutral the shock and tri to forestal it from damag the economi   as i contempl the issu of    today or    with the presumpt that we would do    more in octob  i find myself strong favor    today   i think we should be take a forward look approach and tri to forestal damag  i agre with governor   that  should develop later on call for us to revers what we have done  we should not hesit to do it   i realli don   t like the messag that a    basi point cut would essenti send to market   it would seem to say     well  whi did we do    basi point today   it   s becaus we want to wait and monitor incom data and see what effect the shock has     i think that   s an unwis messag to send   first  it say that the polici is reactiv rather than forward look  and i hope we   re go to be come out with a communic packag that send a rather differ messag   also  i realli don   t think we   re go to see that much in the spend data over the next six week that   s go to be convinc   i am also veri concern about the asymmetr natur of the risk that we face and the possibl of the type of nonlinear  negat dynam that governor   and kohn and you  mr  chairman  have mention  i like the languag in the statement   i think it   s veri well craft   i like the idea of discuss forestal negat effect and our hope and sort of op  that we   ll be abl to do it by suffici action today   i don   t like the idea of put out a statement today that say there are continu asymmetr downsid risk   it leav us open to the question     if you think that  then whi didn   t you do more      i agre with governor kohn   i like the risk assess becaus i honest don   t know exact what the risk are   i like the approach that we   re go to watch and do what is appropri as event unwind in the futur  and i don   t want to have to say that i now feel the downsid risk are essenti balanc with other risk to inflat   i don   t know that
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor a cut of    basi point  and i think that the altern b languag   what we need it to do   it   s veri much in our interest that the market settl down sooner rather than later   i also think that the moral hazard argument in this context is simpli wrong   it   s wrong becaus if you take an insur compani context  there the issu is that the policyhold take action that is advers to the interest of the insur compani  it   s in our interest and it   s in the economi   s interest that the market settl down sooner rather than later   we want subprim paper to trade   if it   s    cent on the dollar  okay   nobodi is talk about subprim paper trade at     cent on the dollar or    cent on the dollar   we want the market to function so that the posit can be adjust and so that we can go back to a normal situat in which the paper trade for what it   s realli worth   if the data and the anecdot inform justifi go down    and go down onli     our best chanc to make that stick is actual to do it all at onc becaus  if we can leav rate unchang in our octob meet  that set the default option for the follow meet also to be no chang rather than further action   so it seem to me our best chanc of avoid an overreact is to do    now and then make the case that we   re wait to see how all of that work and we don   t think that as  e goe on it will probabl be necessari to do anyth more   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i favor meaning action today  so that   s a    basi point reduct in the fed fund rate target along the line of altern b   i think i pretti well laid out the reason for that in my earlier comment   i think the financi disrupt do matter for the short term path of the economi in a negat way   my judgment is that it is like to be nontrivi  and so we should respond to that  especi when under inflat seem to be move in the right direct and  if anyth  move a littl more rapid than i earlier anticip  with regard to languag  well  it   s veri tempt to carri on about that and make michell even more nervous   laughter  but i   m convinc as i listen to the convers that beauti realli is in the eye of the behold   i would make onli two comment   first  the languag in altern b is basic fine with me   i think the final paragraph  the assess of risk  leav our option open  which to me is what we   re tri to do   i don   t have a convict about what we   re go to want to do in octob  and i don   t worri veri much about whether at some point down the road   i don   t think it   s go to be all that soon becaus i don   t think we   ll have enough evid   we will decid we need to revers some or all of whatev we wind up do   that   s okay  too  becaus we   ll be abl to explain that fair readili when the  e come   second  i don   t understand these suggest to take out refer to financi market condit   we devot a lot of  e to talk about that subject today and at the last meet  and so to act as if it somehow hasn   t been import in what we   re consid here just  sn   t make sens to me   thank you
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i alreadi present my posit   like presid    i came into this room expect to argu for a    basi point cut   unlik presid    i   m still there   laughter   i just want to record  sinc i   ve alreadi lost the battl  two point   i think vice chairman   said it right   governor kohn is absolut correct   we should be guid by what we think is go to happen in the economi and not be push around by the market   that   s one reason i   m in favor of    basi point and not     with an eye open to possibl move further later   but the point that vice chairman   made that i think is relev here is that we should direct polici not to insul but to facilit   i think that   s a key point   anoth is that we need to demonstr credibl that we have a feel for what   s happen in the market   on that basi  we need to at least be mind that this is the first decis to move under the new fomc   i   m a littl worri  despit my enorm admir for presid    about her interpret of what is reactiv   inde  we might be view as be reactiv by move    basi point   i think that   s a real risk   what we say  therefor  is veri import   not just in the statement but also in our subsequ minut and speech  as presid   said   i   m  therefor  a littl sensit to two refer to develop in financi market   yes  that   s what we talk about  but get ahead of the curv  we can state it too strong and look as though we   re just way too reactiv  particular given that this is the first decis to cut   as presid   said  there   s no question that we   re go to eas  the question is how much   the onli suggest i would have on the word is to refer to the financi market onc rather than twice   the other thing i would ask to be reassur on  mr  chairman  is that  if we   re go to go to    basi point  it is not a lock that we will put forward the new credit facil becaus i think do that simultan with    basi point would basic confirm that we are reactiv and that we   re overreact to the market  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   just a quick point on moral hazard   i think there are fair concern about it   the loss that have been felt in the market in the past six week   that money is gone   it is not come back   it is true that some of these institut will find new way  creat new product  buy asset cheap  but that lesson has been learn   behavior is chang  i won   t say forev  laughter  becaus that is an aw long  e  but it is chang for purpos of this cycl   profit profil of all these financi institut are now fundament differ  nondepositori institut are look at their access to capit in a dramat differ way  think about whether they have busi model that work   so i think it overst our abil to suggest that  whether we move    or more over the ensu month  we would somehow fix that and make thing like they onc were   so i think the moral hazard argument in this context is realli a straw man that i just want  after governor kohn   s comment  to kick one more  e  in term of the stanc of monetari polici  as we   ve discuss  the equilibrium rate here is a function of fed fund and a function of what   s happen in the real capit market   the real capit market are fundament differ  and so a reduct in the fed fund rate today of    basi point may or may not be suffici to find some new equilibrium   i think we will need to continu to evalu that as we go forward   bottom line on the statement  i support altern b and the    basi point reduct   i think the market will have some genuin con n this afternoon and in the ensu day in figur out what we mean by paragraph     as other have said  there is some ambigu  but i suspect it is inevit given that we realli don   t know what our next action will be   so i support altern b as written   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as i mention befor  from a risk manag perspect i think it   s veri sensibl to make a    basi point cut   we have an environ in which the economi has been grow modest   some of the number that we   ve seen recent   the lower number in the labor market in the revis from the previous month as well as from august   presum had noth to do with the august financi turmoil or i think it   s high unlik that the august number had anyth to do with it   the hous market was turn down   so even though we have been grow a littl more strong  we   re realli come in face headwind in some import market   as the chairman mention  the interact between those two lead to a potenti for downsid risk  particular in light of the financi market turmoil that we   ve been see   i think it   s import to be awar of that and to take that into account in undertak our monetari polici action  also  as i   ve mention befor and as other have mention  even given the dramat chang that we   ve seen in the past month in market expect about what we are go to do  we have not seen an uptick in inflat expect in term either of survey or of the market  which hearten me that a    basi point action is unlik to have a larg negat effect on expect about the futur path of inflat  particular  i think  given the languag in altern b  i don   t see this at all as be reactiv   one thing that i   m extrem pleas to see is that the fomc did not have an intermeet cut   i think that would have been seen as reactiv  rememb back in        the ltcm situat was work out in late septemb   there was the meet with the    basi point cut  and then there was the concern with anoth    basi point cut that came after that  and then the follow meet they did it   there was an intermeet move  that seem much more reactiv   i think our approach has been veri level head  and that is one thing that has allow the expect inflat rate to stay stabl even as they expect us to cut the polici rate   so i   m veri much hearten by that   then with respect to what   and other have brought up about revers  that   s veri import   exact as presid   said   pardon me for revert to your civilian name    laughter  certain what happen was that  by june  the fomc decid to revers and then in the next three meet revers the    basi point   the fomc went up to     percent  and onli about six or seven month later dramat revers that   mani peopl ex post have said move up that much was ill advis   even befor septemb     the fomc had drop interest rate approxim     basi point in a veri short  e  suggest a veri rapid revers   so i   m not sure that it was necessari to go up to those height to forestal inflat pressur  so in this circumst  i   m veri support of altern b   i think it will be read well by the market that we   re awar of what   s go on   we haven   t overreact   we haven   t been reactiv   we   ve wait until our meet  and we   ve left our option open in altern b  honest admit that we are uncertain about what is go forward and leav open the possibl of futur action   take a stronger action now has the potenti to help unlodg the logjam in the market  and we may have to take fewer action in the futur
thank you   vice chairman
i support  mr  chairman  cut the fed fund rate    basi point today and the languag in altern b  and i cede the rest of my  e to you
thank you   thank you veri much  everyon   the one person at the tabl who i know is go to be right is presid hoenig  who say that whatev we do is go to be critic   i can write the wall street journal editori for tomorrow    laughter   i just want to say that i think that moral hazard is a terribl misunderstood idea and that as the central bank we have a respons to help market function normal and to promot econom stabil broad speak   we are not in the busi of bail out individu or busi   as long as we make that distinct  i think we   re fine  but it may be histori that agre to that rather than the newspap  so i do advoc    basi point   the modal assess of the  book suggest that at least    basi point are need to restor a pre financi crisi neutral   there have been some differ about how sever this is like to be  but someth on that order of magnitud seem about right   there seem to be signific tail risk  and i think some insur is worthwhil   quit frank  i thought about the altern c option      basi point and a downward bias   one of the concern i have would be that turmoil dure the intermeet period would sort of forc us to come in and do the next     and i would rather say that we did what we had to do   we are move at the meet   and let the market absorb that   i also want to agre with   and other who have note that we should be prepar to take this back  and i state that for the record  on the statement  i prefer altern b   i have struggl with presid pianalto   s interest suggest about delet the last claus in paragraph     i guess in the end i would prefer to leav it as it is   what this is do is two thing   first  we   re tri veri much to clarifi in this paragraph that what we care about are the effect on the broader economi   that is  financi market disrupt have occur  but we are tri to amelior the effect on the broader economi  second  we need in some sens to play a littl defens in that this is a sharp chang from the statement of august     what has chang sinc august     well  clear  the most obvious thing that has chang is the financi market situat  which in turn has fed through to hous and other part of the economi  with respect to the assess of risk  i think what the market want to hear is that we get it  that we   re here  that we are readi to move as need  and that we pay attent to both part of our mandat   i do think that it   s a littl prematur to make that a balanc of risk  and the inher flexibl here is use   presid     s comment that this is actual a downsid balanc of risk is an interest one   it might be taken that way to the extent that market think that the economi will deterior much further and the fed will have to respond   but our perspect is that we will respond as need  and we should be care to emphas that in public   in the minut and elsewher   so that   s my recommend      basi point and altern b   are there further comment   if not  could you pleas call the roll
i   ll be read the direct from page    of the bluebook  and the assess of risk from the tabl distribut today     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     then      develop in financi market sinc the committe   s last regular meet have increas the uncertainti surround the econom outlook   the committe will continu to assess the effect of these and other develop on econom prospect and will act as need to fo  price stabil and sustain econom growth     chairman bernank vice chairman   presid     presid hoenig governor kohn  governor   governor   presid pool  presid   governor
thank you veri much   we can recess now for half an hour yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes                     for lunch   the board of governor will vote  but the rest can recess for lunch    laughter   dure lunch  our congression liaison person  la  blanchard  will give us an inform updat on congression matter   we will tri to reconven around        meet recess for lunch
whi don   t we reconven our meet   item   on the agenda is communic   we have a coupl of thing to do   scott alvarez and his colleagu have prepar a memo  which you receiv  on the issu of vote on the full statement   could you give us a brief overview  scott  and then i   d like  if possibl  just to get a sens of the tabl  i hope we don   t have to get into a lengthi discuss
i was delight to hear this morn that employ of lawyer is now a factor in assess the robust of the economi   i recommend that in the committe   s drive for transpar  howev  the fomc not disclos this new factor becaus undoubt there will be those among my colleagu in the legal profess who will sue for a more promin and perman place in the committe   s forecast model   today  i   ve been ask to address an element of the committe   s govern   over  e  a consensus appear to have develop that the committe would prefer to chang it current practic of approv onli the assess of risk portion of the polici announc issu after each committe meet and instead approv the entir statement   if that is the committe   s desir  there are sever method for achiev that result   each method has advantag and disadvantag   a key concern in choos an altern involv the amount of flexibl that the committe wish to retain to allow other method for announc it decis  especi in emerg  intermeet  and special circumst   a second key concern is how much attent the committe want to draw to it chang in practic   the first and simplest altern would be for the committe just to begin vote on the entir statement along with the polici action   this approach maintain the maximum flexibl for the committe to alter it practic in differ situat and to adjust the content of the statement   this approach also maintain the flexibl of the chairman to issu a statement in  e of emerg or special need  if the committe choos this altern  the committe also control the amount of promin that it call to this chang in the minut   if the committe believ this chang is signific  it may includ a robust discuss in the minut   if it view the chang as not signific  it may have no or onli a brief notic in the minut   a second and slight more formal altern would be to adopt a nonbind resolut outlin the committe   s desir new practic   a nonbind resolut provid a more formal vehicl than the first altern for explain the chang in vote practic in the minut   at the same  e  becaus the resolut would be nonbind  it retain the flexibl of simpli vote on the matter   the remain two altern are the most formal and involv adopt a bind resolut or chang the committe   s rule to requir committe approv of statement issu at each regular schedul meet   these altern are more bind becaus they requir further deliber committe action to chang the practic in the futur   a rule chang would also be veri visibl becaus  in addit to an explan in the committe   s minut  a rule chang entail public in the code of feder regul   this would attract attent in part becaus the committe   s rule current do not address vote practic beyond the requir of a quorum    a formal resolut or a rule chang may hold an advantag for a member who want to delin public the exact content of the statement   on the other hand  were the committe to desir to retain flexibl to alter the content of the statement  a rule or resolut would have to be care craft to ensur that flexibl   a bind resolut or a rule chang could also limit the flexibl of the committe and of the chairman to speak about the fomc   s action   to date  the chairman has retain the flexibl to speak for the committe in emerg and other situat   inde  the statement was origin a statement of the chairman  not of the committe   if the committe desir to retain this flexibl and yet adopt a bind resolut or rule  the resolut or rule could be draft to maintain that flexibl   that conclud my present   i would be happi to entertain ani question
are there ani question for scott   well  it appear that one thing we can do is just do it   preced have been pretti effect in this committe   for exampl  our circul of tabl   has becom a regular modus operandi   that   leav flexibl   on the other hand  if other would like to go further  that   s fine with me   is it the sens of the committe that simpli begin to adopt this action would be adequ  sever   yes
my sens of the tabl is  then  that we will just begin the practic at the next meet of vote on the entir statement   that  of cours  rais the possibl for dissent base on the statement   we have to use good judgment on that particular decis   if there is dissent on the statement  scott  it would be explain in the minut
that   s the current practic   that   s right
that   s the same practic we use for a dissent on the action
mr  chairman
i don   t feel strong  but would it make more sens to have this chang be consist in  e with chang in communic strategi more broad   now  recogn this is not of the same import  but rather than have a question be rais and then have to explain it through our communic folk and other  i wonder whether this might not just be sort of a housekeep footnot as part of a broader communic rollout
well  if our communic schedul continu along current line   and we can discuss that next   it would in fact be in these minut that we made this decis  right
well  if we   re just go to do it  we haven   t had a vote yet
so would it be okay if we just put this in the octob minut  reflect the first  e we took that action
this would be just a discuss
all right   in that case  it would be part of the overal descript   okay   that   s a good suggest   thank you   anyon els
i   m sorri   i   m confus about that   this is an agenda item at this meet
that   s true
we could just say that this is our sens at this meet of what we   re go to do now and just leav it at that
well  we also have anoth element come up right now   an updat by governor kohn on the communic strategi
the committe needn   t take a formal posit today on what it    particular if the discuss suggest that the committe simpli want to act when the  e is right   so the minut could be veri general
i don   t attach much substanc to this   i don   t think veri mani peopl even know or care or would view this as a chang
all els be equal  we   ll tri to get it into the octob minut   but if it turn out to be a problem  we   ll address it   ani other comment   don  do you want to updat us on the project
thank you  mr  chairman   we are plan right now to go live with the enhanc project process after the octob meet   the plan is to have a speech by the chairman in earli novemb  and then the forecast and it narrat would be publish with the minut of the octob meet  so three week into novemb   i would have to say that   s a plan presumpt  and we are go to proceed on that basi   but who know what the circumst will be when we get to the octob meet   the committe could well reconsid whether that is the right  e to add a new way of communic about the futur  if it   s an unsettl  e   so we can discuss it again   no vote or final decis today  but just to alert you about the plan process go forward  the subcommitte sent out some recommend in term of the variabl  and that   s what we use for this dri run   what we would like from you is  if peopl have comment on the whole thing or on the particular variabl that we use  to hear them   we also sent out some materi on uncertainti and how that is portray   the most import thing to lock in soon is what variabl we are go to ask you to use for the octob meet   we will have a two day meet in octob   we can discuss thing further   we can discuss what the box on uncertainti might look like when it come out in novemb   so we don   t realli need to have a detail discuss on that   though if you have comment  they would be use   but we do need to lock in the variabl   so the floor is open for anybodi who want to bring someth to the attent of the committe
i was complet fine with the propos   the onli thing it mention that i would slight differ on is that i would like the box on uncertainti to come out with everi forecast narrat   you know  the four  e a year deal   the negat is that it would be the same each  e  so there would not be much that is new   but when you look at inflat report that peopl have done  they frequent have a box that   s the same each  e   in my view  the issu of make sure that peopl understand that there   s a lot of uncertainti about our forecast is so critic that  even if they ignor a bit becaus we   re put it out everi  e and it   s just a standard part of the packag  i think it is extrem import
other comment   vice chairman
i feel general comfort with the trajectori you   re on and with the evolv shape of this thing   there is one issu still where it seem to me we don   t quit have it right  which is that the narrat descript   not  becaus it realli cannot  describ the stori that is reflect in the central tendenc of the forecast   so the narrat is realli more a repetit of the number and of what is in the tabl around dispers  and that is probabl becaus we haven   t given the staff a way to talk about or let us talk about the stori that underpin it in some sens   sinc a central valu in this innov to the communic regim is to give a bit more textur to the stori that underpin the central tendenc  it would be worth explor whether we could figur out a way to design our discuss so that the staff could write a narrat in a way that   a better job of allow that   with that except  that qualif  it seem as though what you laid out  don  make sens
i think the staff shouldn   t hesit to talk about differ point of view   it is not at all necessari to come up with or tri to manufactur a consensus narrat
i didn   t mean to suggest not have anyth that reflect the dispers of view or the uncertainti around those view   but right now it   s so skelet that it  sn   t add much valu to the tabl  and it give in some way less textur than what is in the minut  frank  about the outlook over  e   if the central purpos of this is to anim the set of judgment about the evolut  we could do it a littl better that way   this is complic becaus we have all sort of differ condit assumpt that underpin our forecast   when those condit assumpt vari  you can   t realli tell much from what the varianc in the forecast is   we don   t ask peopl to give a modal and an expect forecast and the differ between the two  even though we ask them about the balanc of uncertainti in that sens   so it is hard in some sens  mr  chairman  but i didn   t mean to suggest you would want to do that becaus you want to tri to forc a consensus view
a lot of us this morn discuss tail risk  and it   seem that the tabl we have right now might not captur the natur of tail risk that actual was critic to a lot of that discuss   some thing that are relat to your abil to forecast variabl are tie to uncertainti   but look forward  there are also the kind of risk  which i don   t think we   re captur  that were central to some of our discuss   is there a way to captur tail risk or the distribut   kind of like the scenario that are done in the  book  but  in effect  what peopl were talk about with tail risk   i don   t think we   re quit there yet  and i don   t know that we need to do it for the first round   but we need to give some more thought to what tail risk mean and what we actual mean when we talk about insur
we have a section on the risk  though  right
and the skew   it should be possibl in that context
it   s hard to think about exact how to do that in term of the survey  but certain that   s exact where the narrat would have a lot of valu becaus it   s realli hard to do it just in term of some kind of standard survey   i hope that in the futur we won   t have mani discuss like today   s  but we might   mayb that could be handl in the narrat
yes  it get to the textur that   was get at   i was think about mayb have a question that tri to captur it so that we could at least respond to it if it   s an import point for us to cover
other comment   okay   thank you   our last item is approach to stabil money market   let me make  if i might  just a few introductori comment about where this came from and what we   re ask of you today   as we have been think about various money market issu  two thing have come up   one is that there have actual been a surpris larg number of problem in dollar market in europ   that is  bank that need dollar base fund    remind me that this is a joint board fomc meet and that i need a motion
i move to close the meet
without object   thank you   the first issu is the need for dollar fund and dollar term fund by european bank  which has caus problem in europ but also has bled over to some extent to dollar market in the unit state   we have been in convers at various  e with europ about a swap arrang that would provid dollar to europ to address this issu  but the issu has not yet  obvious  been brought to you as a committe   the second issu that we have been look at is how to address the stigma of the discount window   are there way to provid liquid that would help normal money market  particular term money market  and would allow bank to make use of the enorm amount of collater they have at the discount window  but would avoid the stigma and creat a more effici system   the solut that the staff came up with on that was to have an auction facil that would essenti set an endogen price and  becaus it was an auction  it might look more like a good busi proposit rather than like a move of desper and  therefor  would not have the same stigma   so there are these two separ issu   the auction facil as a way of address the stigma of the discount window and the swap as a way of get dollar into the european dollar market   some convers that i had  in particular with presid trichet of the european central bank  came up with the possibl of combin these two thing  essenti have auction simultan in the unit state and in europ  and then use the swap market to provid the dollar to the extent that the ecb would like to have them  the swiss nation bank express interest in join this as well   in a moment you will be hear from the staff a few detail about these propos  now  let me just say a coupl of thing   first  one thing on govern is that the rule here are that the auction credit facil requir an amend of regul  which is a provinc of the board  so in that respect it   s a board decis   howev  obvious  the bank presid are veri much involv in this becaus it would involv discount window manag  and therefor  i think it   s fair for us to have the discuss of this from the perspect of the entir committe   second  the swap would be  of cours  a decis of the fomc  and they obvious would need a vote  we began work on this some week ago when the market were in a particular stress condit  and our hope was to tri to normal those market   as i said earlier today  the market seem to be get better  and this may not be the exact moment that we want to be do this   howev  it might be a good idea to have this process or  altern  the two separ process   we could do either one without the other   avail should market condit demand it   so what i would like to propos is that we have a present  some comment  discuss  and question from you  and we   ll get a sens of the committe in term of where you are on this   what i will commit to is that we won   t take ani vote today  but befor use either option or a combin of both option  we will have a videoconfer and ask for your formal approv of the swap and at least your consent to the acf   so we are not plan to implement this immedi  but we would like to have the possibl of have it as an option  should money market seem to requir it   so with that  let me turn to the staff
could i ask a question
yes  pleas
what   a close meet mean  scott     it mean there   s a transcript  with a normal releas  or there   s no transcript

but the minut of the fomc meet will be releas in two week
they will be veri general   someth like there was a discuss of mean to address money market issu
explor the rang of option to address
exact   presid
anoth question about govern   mayb this isn   t the appropri  e  but do you envis that approv by reserv bank board of director would be requir for this facil   is that part of the govern  or is that mayb a question for later
well  the auction credit facil  sn   t requir the approv of the reserv bank   the board is requir to set the rule for lend under   b  which is what we   ll explain in the program   howev  the interest rate on loan under the credit facil would  of cours  be establish by the reserv bank and review and determin by the board   so depend on the govern of the differ reserv bank  it may be that the interest rate that is the result of the auction would be someth that the board of director would want to recommend   our propos  as you   ll hear it later on  will be that the board of director adopt the process rather than a particular interest rate  and that would allow the auction to continu over  e
all right   so they would have to act to make the rate they set determin by this process
right   like season credit work today
whi don   t you go ahead and make your present  and then we   ll take question
thank you  mr  chairman   your introductori remark and the question and some answer that we just had cover some of the point that i was go to make in my introductori comment   it has been a long day alreadi  and you receiv a detail memo   so in view of that  we thought we would abbrevi our brief relat to what we had initi plan   in respons to recent develop  as you know  the staff has propos consider of a set of respons that could be coordin with action of foreign central bank   we distribut consider materi to you on friday  the gist of which is propos an auction credit facil and swap line for foreign central bank  i   d like to note that a larg number of staff here at the board and at the new york fed contribut intens work to that document and to plan for the facil more general  and i   d like to mention pat parkinson and myron kwast  whose name were inadvert omit from the list of author   under the propos facil  the feder reserv would auction block of collater twenti eight day discount window credit to institut elig to borrow from our primari credit program   as the chairman said  base on discuss with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank  we understand that those institut are interest in conduct parallel auction of term dollar credit to institut locat in their jurisdict   those institut have request  but to date onli on a preliminari basi  the establish of reciproc currenc swap line on which they would draw to fund the extens of dollar credit under such auction  we have provision assum that     billion of twenti eight day acf loan would be auction each week over the cours of four week  build up to a maximum of     billion   the ecb would  similar  auction up to     billion  and the swiss nation bank would auction up to a total of     billion   jim clous was go to present a brief provid addit background on the market and the pros and con of the propos  but we have decid to skip that at this point in the interest of  e   jim could answer question on that if you   d like  but you may not have had a chanc to absorb the detail of the implement  and the reserv bank presid in particular as well as the board member may be interest in them   sandi krieger will talk a littl about that  and then    son will wrap up with some comment on the swap line   sandi
thank you   i will discuss at a high level some of the oper aspect of the auction credit facil   ye day  scrm  subcommitte on credit risk manag  member and discount window offic at your reserv bank talk togeth about the oper detail   although they have had onli hour to learn and to think about this  they seem to be comfort with the basic and are help to work out the open item   so  how would this work   first  the watchword for implement this program would be    simpl and robust      this mean employ mani of the procedur that we alreadi use local to extend discount window credit   the discount staff have the necessari expertis to receiv and to screen bid inform   the local reserv bank    materi use by ms  krieger are append to this transcript  appendix     staff member are in the best posit to know the bidder in their district   they would use mani of the same procedur they use to accept discount window loan request   the applic we use to determin adequ collater for discount window loan request would be use to determin accept of auction bid  with a supplement calcul to screen for the excess of collater we would be requir for acf credit   the discount window    hotlin    telephon infrastructur   a number with multipl line known to depositori institut  dis  in each district   would be use for reserv bank staff to receiv and confirm bid and award from dis in the district   the scrm member and discount window offic are work now with board staff member on a communic plan for outreach to dis should this facil be implement   let me now walk you briefli through the auction cycl that is in the handout   we have been contempl that on friday at noon the board would announc the term of the next auction   it would includ  for exampl     on monday  octob          there will be an auction for up to     billion of twenti eight day fund  to be issu on thursday  octob           bid may be submit to local reserv bank between  e x and y on the auction date  the minimum bid size will be     million  and the minimum bid rate will be z percent   the auction result will be announc on wednesday  octob    at    a m  ea n  e      detail pertain to the elig  the bid  and the award procedur would be defin in an announc post to the board of governor    websit  and discount window staff would be avail on the announc date to answer call to their local hotlin regard the term of the specif auction   on the morn of the auction date  typic a monday   the reserv bank staff would perform the necessari calcul to determin the maximum bid size for the elig dis in their district  base on collater pledg   also on the auction date  reserv bank staff member would receiv and confirm or reject phone bid dure the announc bid window  follow defin procedur   after the close  the reserv bank staff would submit format inform to the auction agent by encrypt e mail   next  the auction agent would combin the inform from the individu reserv bank   a first step would be to constrain the separ bid from branch of the same foreign bank organ to compli with singl bidder rule   the administr of the other element of the auction alloc is straightforward   a predefin process would award partial alloc at the stop out rate when bid at this rate exceed the maximum amount express in the auction announc   the auction agent would communic the award back to reserv bank on tuesday afternoon  and the reserv bank staff would check these against the stop out rate inform that the auction agent provid   on wednesday  the board would public announc the auction result and post this inform to it websit   at that point  reserv bank would begin to notifi the dis in their respect district that submit win bid of the award they would receiv the follow day and the rate they would be charg   on thursday  reserv bank would post the term credit to the autom applic that they current use for extens of credit   unless otherwis request by the di  the credit would be post to the di   s reserv account at the end of the day   i have cover most  if not all  the detail in the tabl of auction term and the auction datelin that are in your handout  and i will turn to   to continu our present
in conjunct with the establish of the acf  the staff propos that the fomc author temporari reciproc currenc arrang with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank   these facil would provid dollar financ for parallel credit auction for euro area and swiss bank  which the staff understand would be conduct in a manner broad similar to that provid for u s  bank by the acf  which sandi just describ   the propos is for swap arrang that would author the ecb and the snb to draw up to     billion and    billion  respect  each week with individu draw for a period of twenti eight day   cumul total may reach     billion for the ecb and     billion for the snb   the swap arrang would expir after six month unless renew   the purchas of u s  dollar with foreign currenc would be base on the prevail spot exchang rate  and the ecb and the snb would charg their bank and pay interest on the swap at the rate establish each week by the u s  auction   these temporari swap arrang are propos so that dollar fund problem now face by european bank  particular at term longer than overnight  can be address in a parallel manner and at the same  e that dollar fund problem of u s  bank are address   improv condit in european dollar trade would guard against the spillov of volatil in such trade to new york trade and could help reduc term fund pressur in u s  market   establish of these swap line in parallel with the acf could have broad  posit confid effect   given the financi posit of these two central bank  the swap line would involv virtual no credit risk on our part   by provid dollar to the ecb and the snb to use in their effort to address the term dollar fund problem in europ  we benefit the credit market without ourselv provid support to bank oversea
are there question for the staff   presid
just so i understand this  let   s say pariba show up at our auction  window   can they also show up at the european window  or are we go to make sure that there   s no duplic   how do you make sure there   s no duplic so that foreign bank might get an advantag or vice versa
they will be abl to bid in both  presid
just as our bank will be abl to bid in both
that   s whi i said vice versa   so for certain bank  hold compani  or organ  there is realli more than the state limit  right
well  the european are go to impos a structur   it   s not    no limit     it   s the sum of the two
i understand that   i just want to make sure that that was the case  thank you
two thing  one relat to that   on the first page  you said that you consolid all the foreign bank organ   so in the unit state they would just oper as one  even though they may have differ subsidiari  and they will be treat as one organ  even if formal they have multipl organ in the unit state
under the singl bidder guidelin  they   d be treat as one   but for extens of credit  that   s done at the local reserv bank   so their bid would be combin and treat as one  and then they would be disaggreg so the loan could be book at the local reserv bank
but again  for pariba  for exampl  which can come to our discount window  the total sum would be    percent for ani singl credit across the system  even though it might be piec out by bank
second  in term of the  e of the auction itself  are there ani challeng becaus of some of the delay here   this seem like a somewhat slower process than some other auction that are run   the bid are submit on monday  and the notif isn   t until wednesday
yes   we   ve given ourselv a lot of  e just becaus of the uncertainti associ with it  with an opportun to chang it if we were to do this over  e with learn
so you have the flexibl  if you get use to it  to be abl to do it almost in real  e
right   the prefer is for settlement alway to be on thursday  so we can  e it with open market oper and  to the extent that this is or is not combin with action in europ  with some  e paramet that might be sensit to european  e zone  but in term of how long it take to run a somewhat autom and somewhat manual auction  we don   t realli know   we don   t anticip that it will be that complic  but we   re give ourselv a littl flexibl in the begin
one point in this regard  governor    is that we   ll be take the bid over the telephon   that just mean that there is go to be a certain amount of  e depend on how mani bidder show up   it   s not a fulli autom process
presid    question
i think that this is a veri creativ solut to think about the stigma issu and provid liquid to the market  so i applaud the effort to tri to broaden the tool that we have to think about these kind of issu   when i was think about how this might actual work  i did come up with a coupl of oper question   my thought was that if we had this auction  who would be the most like to want to take the money out   i could imagin a situat in which you would have five borrow take out the full     billion   if those five were countrywid  washington mutual  and three european bank  it would certain give the percept that we were focus on financi institut that had signific risk   in term of worri about market as oppos to institut  i think there is a potenti percept issu   so my first question relat to that is the follow   you pick    percent of the auction  but if you pick a smaller percentag of the auction that ani one institut could take  by broaden out the number of institut  i think there would be more of a percept that it was design for market rather than for institut   now  i am awar that the offset to that is that you might not take down the whole auction   so the less that ani one institut can take  the greater is the risk that you   re not fulli subscrib  or you presum could chang the amount  but i   d like to hear at least some thought as to how you came up with    percent  the second issu is that when we think about the discount window  which is primarili for overnight loan  there seem to be a bit of ambigu in term of whether you are primari or secondari credit  and in this situat i think it start becom import   when i think of an institut like countrywid have a    billion loan  the ot view them as a   rate institut  and i don   t know how we would view them if we were regul them   i do know that the market seem to be assess them as be a good bit differ from a   rate institut   so when we   re think about an institut that we might have concern about give   a exempt and an institut that might have difficulti rais fund becaus the market percept is that they are veri  veri riski  how comfort are we with the way the discount window think about primari and secondari credit for institut that the financi market at least think have a high probabl of a fall  my third question tie to the european bank   it seem for the european bank that the ecb is better posit to make the credit evalu of whether they are riski or not riski and the equival of our primari secondari distinct   given that the european bank have the option to borrow  assum that the swap did go through  it would seem prefer that they borrow in europ rather than borrow here becaus i think about the incent go forward   if a european bank that has financi problem that  say  the german author and the german bank are awar of but we may not be fulli awar of borrow    billion from our liquid window  i wonder what the incent are for either the institut or the regul to fulli disclos the natur of the problem   i   d like to get your sens of whi you think it necessari for u s  bank to have access in both locat and for european bank to have access in both locat   those were the three question that i had
well  start with the last question  i think the sens is that it   s a dollar fund problem   obvious  the market are deepest here  so that   s part of the interest in offer it here to the broad rang of institut and the institut that need it   it is also relat to your question about the limit   one thing we did was to look at what the treasuri   as an auction   they have a    percent limit   so we were work down from there  tri to see how low we felt comfort go and not depart from what are typic auction norm   also  if this is realli meant to facilit fund for those who need it  is there a possibl that  if you go too low  you won   t have the desir impact
could i add a coupl of thought befor you move on to the next thing  the concern of the sort you rais are part of the reason that the swap is be propos at all  consid just do the acf   these are duli licens depositori institut in the unit state   if we were to creat the acf but to say that no duli licens di in the unit state with a foreign parent could particip  that   s a huge chang in our nation treatment polici   that   s enorm   so without a decis to realli chang the way we approach licens entiti in the unit state  we don   t have a way of distinguish foreign parent organ from domest licens dis
but we would know whether they have access to an acf facil in europ or an acf facil here  and it would seem as though say that you have access to an acf facil somewher would not exclud  say  the canadian or the japanes but would exclud the european if they were particip in the same program
i   ll leav that to the lawyer to decid   but i am suggest that by creat a swap  the staff had a presumpt that the european could work with the ecb and a certain hope  if noth els  that they would work with the ecb   otherwis  with no swap  we have basic put them back in the posit that they are get this direct from us
if i could just make two point   one reason that you might want to let them borrow in both place is that their collater may be in both place  and they may have differ avail of collater in the two locat   the second reason is that your goal at the end of the day is to get the money to those who most need it   to the extent that you put constraint on the system  you are go to make it more difficult for the money to get to the peopl who valu it the most
we make that distinct alreadi in the discount window with primari and secondari   so if you are at a camel rate of   or    we normal would not allow you to borrow as a primari credit   if we are take the discount window as an analog  yes  we want to give it to the peopl who need it  but we don   t want to give it to the peopl who need it so much that they are about to fail
no  i think we all agre on that    laughter
but i think it   s clear in the document that to be elig to bid you have to be elig to borrow at the primari credit facil
to be elig to bid in the auction  as it   s design  you have to be elig to borrow from a feder reserv bank at the primari credit facil  now  if you are an institut that is migrat across state of the world and rate in the midst of this four week program  then we   d face some awkward decis in that context   but i think that     s respons is right  which is that in general  in the world today  we have a lot of larg institut that are essenti dollar base  that live with a big mismatch between the access to liquid in the currenc where they may need it and the liquid that the home countri central bank is will to provid   in that context  be open to respond to request for a swap is a way to help limit the risk you refer to  which is that we don   t want to live in a system where  if there   s substanti dollar base liquid need at a non u s  institut  if the onli option that exist is for us to be the one provid liquid  then that would not be a terrif situat for us or for the home countri central bank and it supervisor  probabl becaus they will be better at make the liquid solvenc judgment in some sens   you would want them to have the mean to actual respond to that need  if they think it   s appropri  without have the entir burden for that come on us   on the other hand  they exist here in the unit state as depositori institut   they have a set of not right but expect about what they can borrow and what kind of liquid insur they can get from us  and we can   t chang those in the middl of the game
governor   had a question
actual  great mind think alik   the first question you ask was exact the one i was go to ask
okay   presid
i have two question   the degre to which this new lombard facil   s bid process would avoid the stigma issu is unclear   could you repeat to me how this deal with the stigma issu   that   s my first question  and then i have anoth one after this
well  part by auction credit  so institut are come to the feder reserv voluntarili and pay a price that is market base   anoth point is that the institut are regard as general sound   they have to meet a certain qualif standard to get to the discount window  and we would be take certain step in term of our report to tri to distinguish this from other discount window credit   now  that said  i think we have to admit that we   re not sure the degre to which this would deal with the stigma issu
i mean  aren   t they still say that they are distress
no   no  the econom are better becaus you have to think about the minimum rate   the minimum rate is the swap rate plus    basi point  which is well below one month libor and well below the one month term fed fund rate   so there is that room in between   you could actual critic a bank for not particip in this   they are somehow leav money on the tabl by not take advantag of this
i   m sure the small bank will   that   s what i mean   that   s whi they   re not go to like it   in other word  this is a big institut facil
just as long as you need    million buck
well  you have to have     million  if you   re use the ratio you   re use  in collater   so there is that aspect   i understand that   s what it was meant to address  my second question deriv from the first  and that is  could you give us a littl background on the staff   s discuss on have tighter standard   i gather there was some discuss of that in term of come to the acf and be well capit but also well manag   whi the distinct  and what is the state of play of that argument as oppos to the regular requir for go to the discount window
we did consid impos a higher standard  someth like    well capit and well manag      the financi hold compani type standard   and two concern were rais   one is that it has the same problem that presid   refer to that we have to reli on the exam rate and the capit adequaci determin by anoth regul   we don   t get out of that problem by rais the standard  and most of the institut that were refer to actual fit into the higher standard   so it didn   t achiev veri much   the second thing is that there was some concern that it might have a blackbal effect   for folk that were between the standard for primari credit and the higher standard that we were set  it might indic that the feder reserv felt those folk were weaker   those may in fact be peopl we want to get some fund to   they   re the one that seem to be struggl with liquid  and this might make their problem wors becaus the market will perceiv that the fed wouldn   t even be will to lend to them under the facil
other question   presid hoenig
just kind of on this point   there is a descript of this as somewhat prequalifi   you have to be avail for primari credit   second  it   s temporari   third  it   s in pretti rough  e as far as when you   re borrow   i   m not sure you   re go to get rid of the stigma problem with this  and you   re go to go through a lot of gyrat to do someth that then you   re go to have to unravel   are you sure that you want to do this    laughter   if i were introduc this  i think i   d be more inclin to introduc it in good  e  so that you get a perspect go that is less subject to wide interpret   that   s a littl concern i have as much as anyth
ani other question befor we take general comment  governor
quick  as a follow up to that   if you are success in get rid of the stigma problem  then   the discount window effect disappear
but there might be pressur for it to disappear becaus this certain would be more desir than the discount window   it   s cheaper  and there   s no stigma
but this is a temporari program
deposit insur  i   ll remind you  in      was temporari
but when you have that inadvert overnight overdraft that you are face  you can   t wait until the week auction
okay   well done
you are cap the amount in a way that you could not reason decid you   re go to cap total access to the discount window
of cours  this wouldn   t substitut at all for secondari credit  by construct
in my think about the stigma point  the  e line is an import part of that   if you have to submit your bid on monday to get award on thursday  this is not the action of a bank that   s desper for fund   i think the stigma come becaus  at the discount window  apart from bid strong at the end of the day and then end up pay this penalti rate  you don   t have anywher els to go   so it seem to me this auction facil look much more like a liabil manag facil than it   a facil for bank that absolut have to get fund  given that there   s a three day or four day wait until you get them
okay   whi don   t we start our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve been think a lot about this sinc i heard about it last week   i want to start by compliment the staff at new york and the board who wrote the summari memo   i think it   a veri good and balanc job of articul the cost and benefit of this propos facil   i was go to say that they undoubt did it in a compress  efram  but then i heard you guy have been work on it for week    laughter   but in ani event  my hat is off to them  i veri much agre with the staff that weigh the cost and benefit to reach an assess about the desir of this is inher a difficult judgment   for me the critic question concern the normat implic of what we   re see in the marketplac for term fund and the normat implic of this propos intervent   bank that are borrow at term now are pay up for insur against the eventu that their fund cost rise   for exampl  becaus of a deterior in their perceiv creditworthi   bank that have view themselv as more at risk are natur will to pay more for such insur  and some report suggest  as mr    did this morn  the presenc of an advers select problem in the sens that borrow at term reveal oneself to be a borrow of high risk  and so onli high risk borrow are will to pay more   bank that are reluct to lend at term are place a high valu on be abl to use their liquid to accommod asset that may come on their balanc sheet soon   we had a lot of discuss about this in the morn   balanc sheet capac appear genuin to be a scarc valuabl commod these day   that   s consist with the notion that rais bank capit is expens in the current environ   i think the advers select stori is worth consid serious in this context becaus it   s the interpret of what we   re see that provid the best hope for this be an intervent that improv market function in the microeconom sens of the term  but if advers select is what has impair the function of the term market in this normat sens  then there must be lower risk bank that are unwil to borrow at the same high rate as high risk bank but that are ration becaus they   re unabl to distinguish themselv from high risk bank   now  if this is the case  the onli way to improv market effici by lend is to lend more than the current volum of term lend becaus otherwis we   re just go to lend it to the current term lend borrow and none of these ration out  lower risk bank are go to get access to it   in other word  if we do lend through an auction facil to draw in disadvantag borrow to tri to reach them with credit  we can do so onli by subsid the high risk borrow as well   now  i   ll mention that  from the discuss this morn  my understand is that we have veri littl idea what the volum of that term lend is   so i don   t see how we chose this number and how we can be confid that it   s go to do this and reach through the high risk borrow to pick up the low risk borrow  more broad  i   m not sure i see how this facil could improv the normat function in the market   we   re go to auction off onli the same contract that market particip are capabl of offer now  onli we   re also go to subject ourselv to the addit constraint impos by our singl price auction format   so we   re not improv on ani contract out there   the onli uniqu attribut we would appear to bring is our abil to subsid lend term   we could conceiv improv market function if advers select is the right stori here by do someth that market particip are incap of do  and that would be compel borrow by everybodi or by a set of peopl to achiev a superior pool alloc   but i don   t think we want to do that   or we could conceiv improv market function by act on inform that   s superior to that of market particip   a knowledg of the creditworthi of institut  for exampl   but it isn   t clear that this is a key part of the propos either  becaus institut have to be rate   or abov to get access and i think virtual all the current affect institut in these sort of high risk and low risk categori are in the   or abov categori alreadi   a relat point here is that  if we realli think inform constraint are at the heart of the problem  it might be better to address this problem by address those constraint direct by use our supervisori author to encourag and facilit greater transpar   so my sens is that this facil would just subsid borrow bank without do anyth to mitig under inform asymmetri or ani other type of market friction that i can think of   that mean to me that this propos rais the usual moral hazard concern   the staff memo was veri clear and articul about those   i think there   s a danger with this facil of rais expect that  in the futur  signific increas in interbank fund spread are go to be amelior by central bank intervent   if we rais that expect  we   re go to undermin to some extent market mechan for assess the relat risk of institut  i   m a littl worri that if this   not produc a demonstr effect on relev market condit  it could erod confid in us  and i feel so especi in light of our previous chang in discount window polici  which i think is wide view as have had littl substant effect so far   i think that   s the view out there   i also worri that this could complic the resolut of fail institut whose condit  as vice chairman   suggest  deterior while they   re borrow from this auction facil   it would put us in a veri awkward place   as governor kohn said  this isn   t like a one day emerg kind of thing   it take some  e   but some institut in question situat  some problem institut  look for term fund and are will to wait four day to get it and know enough about their condit to line it up ahead of  e   i worri about this sound like a cloak for the ecb  for us to give money to the ecb  and i worri about presid     s issu as well  and i   d be more comfort with the swap line than i am with the domest facil   if those foreign author want to extend credit and have the knowledg and capac to do so  and it   s on their dime and they   re bear the credit risk and they want to borrow the dollar from us  i see that as a reason step for a central bank to take   i also worri about valu collater   i don   t think that our mechan for do that are robust and strong  especi in the current environ with at least standard haircut  now  i can appreci the broader problem articul by the staff and other that bank that are constrain in the term fund market might tighten borrow term for consum and busi and that might have real econom consequ   but if that   s the problem  i think it would be better for us to just cut the fund rate rather than alter the relat fund cost of differ bank   this is essenti what we did today   we cut the fund rate to offset the macroeconom effect of higher credit spread  just a final set of comment   more broad  i   ve been hope for some  e that bank polici in our countri was move slowli but sure toward greater relianc on market disciplin and away from forbear and subsid   i   ve been hope that we as a central bank would gradual move away from thing that are taint with credit alloc    e like these don   t come around veri often   you know  onc a decad   and my sens is that the preced we set here is go to be rememb for a long  e and it   s go to affect market behavior for a long  e to come as well   in my opinion  we ought to look at these episod of market stress as an opportun to make some reput progress on the  e consist problem that is at the heart of moral hazard   so for me the balanc of consider weigh heavili against this propos  mr  chairman
let me echo what you first said and congratul the staff on an enorm amount of work and a terrif present   i do want to just say a word  presid     most of your argument are premis on the idea that market are basic in some kind of equilibrium and we   re just mess with the equilibrium   there   s a longstand tradit  both in central bank and in theoret analysi  that you can have period when there is insuffici cash in the market and price are  therefor  driven away from fundament by the lack of cash   what central bank do is provid cash against collater   i refer you  for exampl  to franklin allen and dougla gale   s new book  understand financi crise  in which they present a model with exact that properti  the moral hazard issu is the follow   there is a good reason to allow some deviat of cash base valuat from fundament becaus it creat incent for provid suffici liquid and reward those who have suffici liquid   but beyond a certain rang  the model as well as central bank experi suggest that  when you have a fire sale type of situat  then the central bank can be use by provid cash against that collater   essenti this process would take      billion of undervalu  hard to sell  or illiquid asset onto the central bank   s balanc sheet and provid term liquid fund in it place  which i find total consist with bagehot and the tradit of central bank lend   now  the question aris whether the market is in suffici distress   if it   s not  then we   re in the first regim where some deviat of valu from fundament is legi    if the market is in extrem distress  i think   i repeat what i said befor   there can be situat in which market are simpli not function well and there could be a lot of reason for that in which case the central bank could help the market function better   i agre that some of these issu about bid size and so on do confus the issu   we need to make a strong distinct between help these market to function better   we can address  for exampl  some of the counterparti risk becaus we have all this collater in our discount window   and help or bail out ani individu institut   i agre with you that we certain want to avoid that percept if at all possibl   presid
i like the idea   i think it   reduc stigma  and it would like reduc the spread dure a  e of crisi   i would want it spread out among a larger number of institut than just five becaus i do worri about that potenti   while i know that in your document you highlight that there wouldn   t be a way to identifi the institut  my guess is that  given that this is a new facil  there may be congression hear  and i wouldn   t be surpris  particular if onli five institut borrow from it  if we   d have to at least be prepar for the possibl that it would becom more public than under normal circumst  so in these term  i think the haircut that we think about for a twenti eight day period are a littl differ from the haircut you might take overnight  in which case we   re go to have to make sure that we realli are collater suffici so that we   re not take risk  sinc that is a principl of the discount window   i worri a bit about whether our primari secondari distinct was design for this  and we might want to at least rethink exact how we classifi primari versus secondari credit   dure  e of distress  this would be a way to tri to provid liquid  but it might also be worth at least think about some of the potenti issu dure those  e of stress
thank you   governor
again  i   ll echo prais for just the incred work that the staff have done   a veri clever way to address some specif problem that we   re face   one is the stigma problem  and two  as i mention earlier  is the sourc of the uncertainti   we don   t realli have the tool to get at that direct  we can get at it onli veri indirect   with the      situat  there was anoth way to get at that   some peopl thought it was a good way  some peopl thought it was a bad way   we won   t debat that  but the market percept was that a particular institut was at the heart of a lot of the uncertainti  and if you could resolv that  you could reduc that uncertainti signific   also the intervent by the imf and other organ dealt with some of the intern uncertainti   with the tradit tool that we have  we   re somewhat hamper in tri to get at that  so i think this is a veri clever way to tri to do so   but realli my comment echo what presid   has said   when we start to move from do overnight to do term fund  we may need to rethink what kind of collater we have   obvious  we   re now use    percent of collater rather than     percent of collater   that   s certain a step in the right direct  we need to think about whether we need    well capit and well manag      that creat some challeng in tri to differenti this from the overnight lend facil  and as mr  alvarez said  it rais some issu with respect to singl out institut that make one hurdl but don   t make the other hurdl   but we need to think about it veri care becaus the potenti challeng both from an optic point of view and a substant point of view is that  in the short run  we want to help out institut in certain way by provid fund but we don   t want to be help out those that have not taken appropri action  in extrem circumst like those we have now  as the chairman said  one could certain say that we   re out of equilibrium on price a lot of the asset  price the collater  price the valu  or price issuanc by certain institut  and so it is extrem import that this be short term and that those kind of consider be brought to the fore and thought through veri care and have the potenti to be alter over  e if we don   t feel we   re have suffici haircut   if we do feel that certain institut may transit from one rate to anoth within twenti eight day  we need to be prepar to think about how to respond becaus it rais question for a least cost resolut of institut that may be go down   but i do think this is an extrem creativ approach to tri to get at someth that we otherwis didn   t have easi tool to get at   it may creat a longer term issu of an expect that this kind of thing will come out again or that there will be anoth type of clever innov that will deal with the next market problem so that peopl don   t have to worri about those market problem   but that   s a veri difficult tradeoff to make   i can support this as address the short term problem  and i think we can larg deal with some of those longer term issu if we do stick to our gun and make it temporari and if we clear articul what we   re tri to get at
thank you   presid hoenig
one of the appeal thing about it is that it broaden option  and i think that  ani  e you are in a set of circumst where you have to find solut  broaden your option is good   i appreci the fact that we are not vote on this today becaus i think it deserv a littl further thought  especi about the unintend consequ   there are advantag to say it is temporari  but i   m not sure that there aren   t also some disadvantag from that   there are advantag in tri to remov the stigma  but i   m not sure what other hazard you creat becaus  if you don   t pre qualifi  what have you said to the world about that as well   so there are lot of uncertainti around this that i would appreci more  e to think though befor we actual begin to implement it
okay   presid pool
the staff did a fine job of design and explain   i want to concentr on the issu that i have   i   m pleas that we   re not about to launch it   if we had  one of my concern is that the unit kingdom is left out  which i assum is by choic  but it might still creat a whole lot of issu for the unit kingdom   i   m sure there would be a lot of question in the market   whi didn   t you do it    or whatev   it might have ad pressur there that would not onli have complic the u k  situat  but it might have end up complic our own situat   that might still be an issu if we go this way in the futur   i   m concern that the method of set the minimum bid rate is not realli transpar   as i gather from read  we   ll tell the market the number  but we won   t say what the refer rate is   are we go to announc that it   s tie to the overnight swap rate   i had understood that we were not go to
we didn   t say   it was base on a market rate for term fund
but weren   t we go to announc that this overnight index swap
no  i don   t think that had been the plan
okay   but then the first  e that you chang that rate you are go to rais a whole lot of question   well  how did you decid how to chang it   i   m more worri about the transpar of set it that way becaus it is bound to rais question about where that rate come from   how did you decid on this one   it might be particular true if that rate end up be below the target feder fund rate
this is news to me  by the way  becaus the logic of this was that the normal spread between the overnight index swap and term fund is about    basi point
yes  but that depend on the market   s expect of where the fund rate is go to go
but the oi captur that   the one month oi
i understand that  but that can be differ from the current target rate that   s in effect right now   that   s my point   this rate could be below the current target rate  and that seem to me to creat an issu that we are go to have to be prepar to explain  and i   m not so sure that   s go to be easi to explain   at ani rate  i   ll leav that on the tabl for the moment
are you say that the minimum rate is go to be a secret
well  they   ll figur it out
won   t they figur it out almost immedi
if they   re go to figur it out  whi don   t we tell them
the question is whether you identifi a particular market rate that you   re peg or whether you say you   re look at market base rate   i think that   s a decis variabl of this program
i just didn   t realiz this was as high confidenti
but you have the auction announc   you must tell the bidder ahead of  e what the minimum rate accept is
you   ll tell them the basi point
they should figur out pretti quick what this rate mean
i would suggest that we not get too involv in this   i think we ought to be as transpar as possibl
no  but i just say that i think there   s a transpar issu here that might have to be explain   so i   ll just leav that on the tabl to be talk about   there is certain a risk that this facil will not be   well  mayb this would not be a wrong judgment   avail to small bank  and the larg bank would be get access to discount window fund at a rate potenti well below that avail to small bank   if this were to becom a polit controversi with some of those who are less friend to us in the congress than other  it would complic the valu of this   i would hate to see us get embroil in a polit controversi over this becaus we were discrimin against    percent of the bank in the eighth feder reserv district as well as some of the other feder reserv district  if we were to launch this  if we were vote today  this would creat a big issu in term of our director becaus we would be announc to the director what discount rate they would have to set under the feder reserv act   so if we are prepar to do this in the futur  i think it is veri import that we have materi prepar and that we take it up with our director in advanc so that they will know what we will be ask of them becaus this could be a veri big problem   we need to make sure that we have the director on our side and that we have prepar them so that  if we have to do it  they will know what the reason is  final  onc the dust settl  assum that we don   t need to do this befor the market return to a reason normal  i don   t see ani reason that we couldn   t have this well plan and actual run a trial or mayb even have a trial onc a year or someth like that so that the bank and the market understand how this work   then you can pull it out of your pocket if you realli need it in crisi circumst   everybodi would have understood it becaus you would have actual done it   thank you
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  a lot of what i have thought about this sinc i realiz we weren   t go to do this immedi has been address by the previous individu who have spoken   i   d just like to touch on a few point   first  like everyon els  i want to congratul the staff for excel work   it is creativ   it   s also veri well balanc in the way that the pros and the con are argu   bagehot and the lombard facil not withstand  it seem to me that  if we proceed down this path  we have to posit it so that it   s a refin of what we did in august rather than a confess of failur or insuffici   that would be point number    still  presid   made some veri good point  and part of this get to what presid pool just mention  and that is that some polit risk  in addit to the risk of failur  is there and we have to acknowledg that it may not work   i have some concern about the valu of collater and the automat  as it were  in this kind of new facil and our abil to valu complic collater  my biggest concern are the idea  as presid   put it  that we   re subsid foreign bank without realli do anyth to mitig hazard   i think that rough translat what he said  which get me to the point of presid pool   s comment   we have to be mind of the risk of be perceiv as     help a limit number of veri larg money center bank and     bail out the european   now  we understand that   i don   t think the public understand that   if you look at my discount window  there are five bank that could meet these collater requir  the     million minimum   some district have less  some district have more   our backbon at the feder reserv in term of our polit support is the communiti bank system   to be sure  we all understand that we have system respons  but the idea that we might be facilit these huge institut or    bail out    the european is just a risk i think we need to be awar of  and if we proceed  we   re go to have to figur out how to manag that  i   m not against a swap line  anoth point that presid   made   usual i would expect presid   to be against a swap line  but he   s not against the swap line   i   m not against the swap line   it   beg the question of whether we couldn   t do a swap line and work with the exist facil but for the fact that we think that the exist facil is insuffici   again  i would present this  if we proceed  as a refin  mr  chairman  i would like more  e to think about this   i   m grate that you   re give us more  e to think about it  and i  again  would like to consid the govern aspect of it   but those are the question that i have at this junctur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s a veri creativ propos  and i agre basic with the comment that presid   and governor   said about it   it   s import that the collater be appropri and well establish  and it   s definit better if we don   t have simpli a small number of borrow   it   s also import we know that we hit our fund rate target becaus this is  you know  tie to the effect feder fund rate   so if we   re realli soft on that  then it   s go to be an even better opportun for everyon   but as i think about it  it seem as though this is an opportun to narrow the spread to    basi point instead of the    basi point that we actual have on the discount window  except for the elig requir   so i can support this as a temporari facil  but i   m glad that we   re go to have more  e to think about it
thank you   presid
i  too  want to congratul the staff on a creativ propos   i think i need more  e to think about this  but let me offer  just to some degre  specul remark  they   re specul becaus it has been a few year sinc i   ve even been around a treasuri of a money center bank  but i do think i have some feel for it   first  look at it from the market perspect  lengthen the matur of liabil and then  in train  asset is desir   clear  that will assist financi stabil  which is our object here   the sub object are to reduc stigma and to unstick the market from it short term orient  so i tri to put myself in the shoe of a bank treasur think about whether or not to use such a facil   the way that larg bank treasuri work  or at least work when i was close to them  is that you have essenti what is call an mco  or maximum cumul outflow  schedul  which is a schedul of liabil matur go out for     day or more   today   s pictur on the margin   that is to say  in the money market  noncor deposit  the thing basic where bank are fund themselv on the margin   spike veri earli   it   s dramat earli  and then it tail off  and it seem to me that the treasur would think about this by ask     what mco gain do i get from use this      it is just a matter of day   mayb two or three day  not twenti eight   becaus you   re just ad it to a mix of liabil that you alreadi have   the offset of that would be the reaction of the market  the stigma question  as they perceiv a bank use this   that is  whether there would be some countervail reaction   it   s probabl not insignific no matter how hard we tri that  when you use the lender of last resort as a fund sourc  you are use the lender of last resort as a fund sourc   so if i were a treasur  i would be make a kind of calcul as to whether i was realli gain from an mco point of view ani signific comfort relat to the direct i thought the market was go  my own hope is that this issu will improv dramat in the second half of octob  this week and next week  i believ  we are go to go through the broker dealer disclosur  and then in mid octob  we   ll get the larg bank and other bank disclosur  and the market transpar should improv  it seem to me  reason strong in that period   so it is conceiv that we   ll have differ circumst in the second half of octob regard the market   s be so terribl short term at this  e   so  again  i am tri to think this through as a treasur would think it  and i think there are some market dynam consider that a treasur would have to think about  which suggest mayb not use it except in realli extrem market circumst
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   my inclin after read the memo over the weekend was to be support of the propos   howev  given some of the comment that i   ve heard from my colleagu today  i welcom the addit  e to think about some of the concern  especi some of the issu that presid   rais about onli five institut borrow  i have some of the same concern that presid hoenig rais about whether introduc a propos like this dure these  e realli   address the stigma issu   then the memo also rais the issu that there is a risk that such a program would exacerb the moral hazard problem  and i   m concern about this   but i heard a lot of comment today around this tabl that  in term of financi stress  it   s critic that we do the right thing and play the appropri central bank role  so  again  i like other comment that were made earlier   we have a great staff  a skill staff  which came up with a veri creativ propos  and my inclin is to support it   i am pleas that we have the addit  e to think about some of these issu so that i can better understand some of the concern that were rais   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   actual  i do have some sympathi for this propos   i think it is veri creativ   but there are a lot more peopl around this tabl who know a lot more detail about this market  how it work  and how treasur work than i do  and i will certain defer to their judgment   but i have a coupl of point that i   d like to make   presid hoenig made the point that realli give me a littl paus as i absorb this   what i   m realli worri about is the law of unintend consequ  and i don   t know what they are right now   mani of you around the tabl have rais some possibl that this could exacerb   i think presid pool   s suggest about creat a tension between larg and small bank about who has access to this could prove to be a problem   i also agre that it might be unusu  but it would be troubl if  in fact  we end up lend money in this facil go below the target fund rate  which would be mayb unlik but would complic our live in other dimens as well  i also worri a bit as i look at the market   and this probabl has more general to do with provis of liquid   that part of the problem here is price discoveri   who has the risk   where are the risk  how much are they  and how do we price them   i worri a bit  too  about the degre to which provid liquid shut down or slow down the price discoveri process  which is someth that we realli want to get done   i don   t know how to answer that question  but it   s one that i just sort of struggl with in tri to think about whether we are hamper the process of price discoveri  by slow it down and make it easier for peopl  or are we move it along at a fa  rate   i don   t know the answer to that  the last point  i think  is more of a polici question   again  presid hoenig  i think  made it   if we view this as a temporari tool  which i think is fine  it is import that we lay out in our own mind under what circumst in the futur we would decid whether or not to implement this tool and how we decid   what criteria do we have   we need someth a littl more object than just whenev we want to   i worri a bit that by fail to do so we will abandon some expect about how the market will react to this and when they might expect us to use it or not  do i know what the consequ of that will be   i don   t know   i   m struggl with those kind of question  so have a littl more  e to think through some of these thing would be veri help   those are my comment   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   well  at this  e  my bottom line on this propos is that it   s okay  but i   m not altogeth enthusiast   it   s okay becaus i think have anoth arrow in our quiver is not a bad idea  and so to have done the work and put this forward strike me as clear construct   i   m not enthusiast becaus i didn   t find the case for it that compel  and let me elabor on that a minut   i probabl would have thought it more compel a week or two ago  but the market seem to be work a bit better  and i think it   s to our advantag to let that unfold  assum it continu to do so   more broad  i think there   s a question of whether the price that we   re see in the term fund market is someth that we realli should be address   mayb  given all the concern and everyth els  that price is perfect fine at the moment and will adjust over  e to someth more normal without ani action on our part   if so  that would strike me as prefer   but the real question for me at the end of the day is  that it seem as though the ul  justif for someth like this has to be relat to our macroeconom object   do we believ that  say  a malfunct in the short term fund market is go to have signific macroeconom consequ   is it go to make the economi behav signific wors than perhap the economi otherwis would have behav   my answer to that is    perhap     but i don   t realli have a real convict about that   so that   s whi i come out  at the moment anyway  with    yeah  this could turn out to be use     but it   s hard for me to get realli enthusiast about it
thank you  mr  chairman   i think this is aim at address a serious problem that i   m afraid we   re lose sight of a bit   the pile up of financ in veri short term vehicl is an issu for financi stabil   part this is  yes  the term rate are elev  and if this were just a risk premium on certain counterparti  i don   t think that would be a big deal   but i do feel that there has been a malfunct in the market   as is typic in a financi crisi or panic  peopl have fled toward liquid and safeti in treasuri bill and overnight lend  and the normal arbitrag that happen across market just isn   t happen   it   s great that the market seem to be get better  but if they continu to malfunct or if it get wors again  i think there   s a serious problem   the problem is that all these bank are be financ in the one day to four day area  and it leav them open to huge rollov risk and huge liquid risk   in turn  becaus they have this risk  they   re more reluct to lend   they   re more reluct to use all that capit that you saw in the chart the other day   so it is have a potenti macroeconom effect  and i complet agre with presid  n   we would do it becaus there   s a macroeconom effect and becaus there is a financi stabil effect   but i think there is an issu here that we can   t shrug off  i agre that the facil would attract those bank that need it most   that   s what auction do  right   that   s whi they   re design that way  and i think that   s fine   for the most part  with one except  that   s the way it would have the maximum effect of reliev some of these issu   you bring in the folk who need it the most  and it reliev some of their problem   that is a problem regard the borderlin institut that peopl have been talk about  and if an institut is in transit from be sound to be not sound  this is an issu   it   s an issu for two reason   one is that it could facilit the runoff of uninsur liabil holder  and the congress has told us not to do that  and we shouldn   t do it   that   s a moral hazard problem   the second is that it might allow the bank that aren   t be run well to make that last bet   to do some other thing that would put them at greater risk   but i think those would be veri  veri rare institut that are in that kind of spot where they   re just place the final bet befor go out of busi   so the borderlin institut is a bit of a problem  but i   m not sure it   s as big a problem as other have said  i think this would have a chanc of success   there are no guarante   i absolut agre  when arbitrag isn   t work  you have veri strong prefer habitat   peopl want to lend short  and other peopl want to borrow long  and the fed would be step into that breach in some sens where the market aren   t work   we would be suppli treasuri bill and  to a certain extent  do match sale purchas or revers rps or whatev they call them these day  borrow from the public at the veri short term  and we would be extend the term credit   in a sens  we would be step in for the arbitrag that   s not happen  and that would reliev pressur on these market at least a littl   it has a chanc of have some second round effect of help those bank that want to use their capit do so more than they are alreadi   so no guarante   i don   t know that it would remov the stigma   as i said  i think the auction process  make it a total separ discount window  and have the long period over which it has to happen make it look veri  veri differ from a discount rate loan  on the moral hazard issu  of cours  this isn   t do anyth realli to reliev peopl who made subprim loan   it   s not go to chang the price of those asset  so it   s not realli affect that in ani moral hazard way   it   s not aim at individu institut   it   s more like open market oper than it is like the old form of discount window lend   even when normal function is restor to market  bank will be pay for the liquid insur that they wrote   there   s no relief on the credit side   they   ll still have to tie up capit  make good on the liquid insur  forgo more profit opportun   it would reduc  perhap at least a littl around the edg  the extra cost of financ this liquid insur that they sold that come from the disrupt of the market  from the fire sale aspect   i think that  if we thought that the market weren   t improv and it would have a feedback effect on financi stabil  step in would be worthwhil   that   s the classic central bank thing to do   to step in and reliev some of the extra panicki pressur on the market to get them function again   so i guess i don   t see an import moral hazard issu or  to the extent that there is a moral hazard issu  i think it would be more than offset by the benefit to the macroeconomi of the function of financi market  should we decid that this were need if those market weren   t work   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   veri briefli  when i think back about a week ago to mayb one of the darker day that we   ve had in the past six week  there were so mani more institut that were fund themselv on an overnight basi that it wouldn   t take much imagin for us to get veri fear veri soon if there were some kind of shock that made it imposs or much more difficult for them to fund themselv twenti four hour later   so i think the acf would have held great promis then to be use in address some of the headlin risk that could veri quick have had system implic   i think the acf hold great promis now  i   ll highlight onli one question  which is  e   i share the view put forth by presid  n that  to the extent we see these market improv on their own term  which is someth we   ve seen in recent trade day  we wouldn   t want to do anyth to stop that momentum   if we had hit the button today  it may well be that they would have had to take stock of this new instrument and compar it to the other altern they have  and that improv could have potenti been delay   on the other hand  if we wait until these market deterior to where they were a week ago  the efficaci of hit the button then would also be less than ideal   so my own sens on  e   and it   s someth that the chairman will  i think  brief us all on if we get to that point   is to the extent that we see that momentum has stop and we see the ground weaken        below us  then we might have to make a risk adjust call at that point   i don   t think it will be a   veri easi or a veri appar one   but on balanc  i think that the macroeconom possibl are        pretti scari  which make me suggest that we would lean forward on this   thank you  mr   chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to congratul the staff   this is a   veri clever and target intervent  and it   s a veri nice put togeth propos   i   m support   i  think it   s someth that   s good to have avail   i   m glad that we   re not plan to put it in place   instant   it   have the potenti to address the stigma issu that bank have come to the      discount window   realli  the spike in the spread between term and overnight loan in the interbank     market has been quit sizabl  and it   s obvious that that has been complic the difficulti that    bank have had in manag liquid     i have also been concern  given how mani other borrow rate are link to libor      that if the spread remain elev  it has the potenti to spill over into the rate that a lot of     borrow pay   i think this has a chanc in succeed and reduc that spread and bring   libor down  but it   s not     percent obvious to me that it will succeed   i think it   depend on       your interpret of exact what that spread repres  whether it   s credit risk or liquid risk         as i read the propos  i thought it realli didn   t make the case in a power way to me that     the inabl of bank to fund at term was creat system risk   it seem to me that  given a   propos of this magnitud that involv coordin central bank intervent and has a chanc of        not succeed  we ought to be do it to address someth that we regard as an import     system risk   the comment that governor kohn and   made have convinc me  as we       have discuss this  that there could veri well be system risk here and that we might  if thing get wors again  want to put this into place   so i found that discuss veri use   it seem to me that the case that was actual made in the document in a sens was more a monetari polici case that bank face these fund pressur would like rais rate and that would have macroeconom consequ   that then suggest to me  well  whi don   t we use the feder fund rate more   it is a more general tool to remov those pressur  i share the concern that we will be perceiv as bail out a small set of weak institut  includ washington mutual  countrywid  and other that may be associ with the crisi  especi if we   re use this overnight index swap rate   it has been sit here  i guess  around             or someth like that  which if we had had this facil in effect would be below the fund rate and would rais question about whi we were lend so cheapli   one way or anoth  i would certain be happi to approv a swap agreement with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank to provid them with dollar fund whether we go ahead or not  if that   s desir
thank you   governor
i think that this propos has an import advantag in that it is channel fund to a place where they are most need  so it has macroeconom consequ   if you think about it  open market oper are a veri blunt tool   here you are actual abl to direct credit to a market that isn   t work   we have a libor market that realli is not work  it clear has spread that are way out of line   when peopl talk about what   s go on in the market  they basic say     yes  there   s an arbitrag opportun  but there   s so much risk that i can   t take advantag of it      that is someth that i think is import   for exampl  my understand of commerci real estat deal is that all the deal are done off of libor  and so this actual is an import market   do i think this will solv the problem of price discoveri in general   no   but i do think that this is an import market that is have import macroeconom implic  and go in and do someth about it can have veri strong benefit  there are some t i issu   the issu i realli worri about the most is the    percent number  where we might have five guy  and everybodi know that some peopl will be polit problemat for us   so mayb you might want to think about whether that    percent number is exact the best number   that   s whi i was go to ask the same question that you ask  and now that we have some  e  i would encourag the staff to think about exact that issu  anoth element here is import   which is that we   re say to the marketplac that we   re not just think about use monetari polici tool  in fact  becaus it is a credit problem  we   re think creativ about how to use credit tool as well   in that regard  there   s an advantag that we are think outsid the box and tri to deal with this anoth way   let me give you an analog to someth that we did on august      on august    we pull out the discount window  we did it with a    basi point penalti   you know  you look at it  and in one sens it was not a success   it didn   t make a big differ in term of the number   it wasn   t bad  but i   ll tell you  when you ask peopl out there whether it was a posit thing to do  they   d say     oh  yeah      it realli sent a veri  veri good signal   my sens is that this may not complet solv the problem   there are some issu about how much should be taken up   but i think that it would send a signal that we   re on the ball   it has anoth element  which i   m a bit sensit to  that there is critic that we are too academ here becaus some of us have worn tweed coat    laughter   so that you know  the chairman use to come to the new york fed meet and would wear those patch on the outsid of his coat   i actual like that look and have my assist professor corduroy suit   but here we are tri to think veri practic in a creativ way   it also has an advantag for this institut at this junctur becaus we are think about market issu and deal with veri specif detail in the market   i think that   s someth that we   ve gotten across to some extent  we   re readi  and i think this would help   so i   m not say absolut that we definit should use this  but i think governor   talk about this exact right   if we   re see that there   s some stall  that these spread are not improv  then this is an option that will have benefit   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
just a few quick thing   first  i should say that the concern and question you all put on the tabl are the right set of concern and question   some of them can be resolv by tweak the design of thing  but some of them we will not be abl to resolv with chang in design  and we   ll have to decid whether or not we want to live with those thing   i think it   s import to recogn that  even though we   ve had ten day of pretti steadi improv in the willing and abil of financ to differenti across differ set of institut and differ set of instrument  et cetera  and the process is encourag  we should not take too much comfort from that yet   this process could go on for some  e  we are still in a quit fragil situat  and the situat could get more fragil again easili and quit quick   we may need at that point to escal in term of the rang of thing that we   re prepar to do in that context   we need to be veri open to think about practic  creativ way to address some of the limit not just in our tool and the relat stigma attach to them but in the tool of the other central bank in the major financi center   we now exist with a veri complic set of limit and asymmetri in those limit  and i think that mix togeth   not leav us op  posit or with the flexibl to deal with the kind of thing we   re face in these market   so it   s go to requir that we be open  practic  and creativ in think through the op  way to navig through those kind of thing   it would be veri hard to know outsid the circumst what hierarchi of choic is go to look most appeal to us   whether in the event the swap alon would be ideal or feasibl  whether someth at the discount window alon would be ideal or feasibl  or some other thing would be   it   s just hard to know  but i think you have to recogn that we   re all go to be in a world of second  third  or fourth best just becaus noth look terrif now relat to those problem   we are not go to be abl to clarifi for ourselv fulli what the effect might be and whether we can manag some of the risk of unintend consequ  not just in term of futur incent but also in term of signal effect   i   m sure we all know that   but some of the thing that you rais today we would face in the moment and would not be abl to resolv definit   it is also true that we may need to move veri quick   we may not have a lot of  e  and we may need to do someth multilater just becaus  even though this has a lot of manifest in dollar fund market  it   s not sole a dollar issu and it   s obvious not sole and mayb not even princip a fund issu around u s  financi institut   so we may need to be open to do someth togeth   that will  of cours  mean we may need to compromis in term of what may be op  for our optic or for our design of the econom of the thing   so i think those of you who welcom the fact that you would have more  e to think through this shouldn   t take too much  e   this may be a situat in which you will have to resolv your ambival quick   you may not be abl to resolv it
so thank you veri much   i appreci this discuss a great deal   i did not hear a great deal of opposit to the principl that the feder reserv at  e should help market function when they are in a state of panic or otherwis in serious dysfunct  so in that respect  i think that this is the kind of tool that under some circumst might prove quit use   you did rais a larg number of practic issu  polit issu  optic issu  and so on   you all said that you want to think about it  and i   m go to take you up on that   pleas think about it   pleas consult with your staff  and then let me to pleas ask our staff in new york and washington to see if some of these issu can be address  and let us continu to think about under what circumst this might be use   you know  just becaus you have a hammer  sn   t mean that everi problem is a nail  right    laughter   so we do need to think further about the circumst under which this kind of intervent would improv market function and reduc financi stress in an appropri way   fortun  it   not appear that we need to act today   but as vice chairman   point out  market are fragil and the possibl that we might come back to you in three day or a week or two week or whatev should not be discount   so thank you veri much for your comment  the next meet is octob    and     a two day meet  and we will also have cathi     s farewel lunch at that meet   thank you again   the meet is adjourn   end of meet
