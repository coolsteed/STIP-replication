without object  that is approv   the next item on the agenda is the select of a feder reserv bank to execut transact for the system open market account   my note indic to me  and i quot     new york is the odd on favorit      laughter   in that event  not wish to go against the odd  i will entertain ani motion which is restrict to nomin the feder reserv bank of new york
well  consist with the odd and tradit  i will nomin the feder reserv bank of new york
the nomin is approv without object   sinc we have done that  let   s move to a decis that may be far more import  which is to select the manag of the system open market account   i understand that there   s onli one name on this ballot  and it   s dino kos   unless anyon has an object  i will presum that there was a nomin  a second  and a unanim vote in the affirm   hear no object to that  i presum that that select is now approv  now i   d like to call on dino in his renew offici posit
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two subject on which i   ll need a vote from the committe   the first one is on the foreign currenc direct  the author for foreign currenc oper  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper  i recommend that they be approv with no amend
question   object   if not  they are approv
the second item is the author for domest open market oper  which i propos be approv with one amend as describ in the memo date januari            that amend would elimin the so call leeway provis   the limit on the amount by which hold of secur in the system open market account can chang between meet   given that the committe has mani other way to overse the activ of soma  system open market account
ani question   approv without object  we have receiv document on propos revis to the committe   s rule  statement  and resolut  and i presum you have read them   i need a vote to approv the propos revis  but  obvious  if there are comment  we will discuss them prior to that   hear none  they are approv without object  incident  becaus of the  e  we need to determin offici as a committe that public notic and comment on these amend would be unnecessari or contrari to the public interest   i would accept a motion to that effect  speaker      so move
approv without object  we have an annual review of the committe   s program for the secur of fomc inform   i   d like to emphas a point cover on page    which is that individu who have access to confidenti inform may provid it to or discuss it onli with those feder reserv employe who are author to have access to such inform  i rais these issu everi year   we all vote upon these rule and agre to bind ourselv to them  and invari we slip period   i trust that at some point we   ll do better than we have done  especi fair recent   i understand that presid   would like to say a few word on this
mr  chairman  i think the leak of the topic for today   s discuss  which was the subject of an articl that appear in the wall street journal  was veri disappoint and     troubl   i   ve been with the feder reserv for   year  and we pride ourselv on be an organ with veri high integr   when we have a leak like that  i think it   s realli an embarrass to the feder reserv and to each of us individu   leak such as this have happen on rare occas in the period that i   ve been here   but i think it is import that we emphas everi year  in line with the integr of this organ  how crucial it is to maintain the confidenti of what we discuss
i   m at a loss to understand the motiv of communic obvious confidenti inform that could compromis the natur of our deliber here  what is to be gain   i don   t get it   all i can do is to reiter  as we vote on this  that we take it veri serious   i will assum everyon is in the affirm on this  we will now move on to a rather larg topic  price object for monetari polici   i   d like to   call on      doug elmendorf  and   reinhart to make their present
thank you  mr  chairman   we   ll be refer to the packag of materi entitl    consider pertain to the establish of a specif  numer  price relat object for monetari polici      as a prelud to your discuss this afternoon  doug elmendorf and i will briefli summar some of the main point made in the r s  research and statist  staff paper that was distribut to the committe   then   will address the issu relat to communic and govern that would aris were you to defin a numer object   as can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit  inflat as measur by ani of the major index has been both low and stabl by histor standard for the last sever year   with the economi now oper in the neighborhood of price stabil  some analyst have press for more clariti and precis about your ul  object with respect to the price relat piec of your dual mandat  other  howev  have express serious reserv about move away from what they perceiv to be a success status quo   the background paper discuss the major issu the committe would need to consid in determin whether to adopt a specif  numer  price relat object   we view the key characterist of such an object  list in the middl panel  as the follow   first  it would be numer rather than qualit   second       the materi use by messr     elmendorf  and reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix        it would be state in term of a particular publish index   and third  it would involv a commit to either inflat control or price level control   to give mean to such an object  the committe would presum aim to achiev it on averag over some extend period of  e   as note in the lower panel  a premis of the paper is that a price object should be chosen to minim the cost of deviat from price stabil   if you share that premis  then you might conclud  as we did  that the object should be defin with respect to the price index most close relat to such cost   such an index need not be the best short run indic of under price trend   for exampl  an overal price index might be a better gaug of the cost incur as a result of deviat from price stabil   and therefor a better point of refer for a medium term price object   even though a core index might be a better real  e indic of under inflat   one counterargu to this view is that a smoother measur of inflat would breach a band of ani given width less frequent and so would present the committe with fewer communic challeng   this is true enough  we would simpli note that the width of ani band would be a choic avail to the committe   in the paper  we underscor that we see the question of whether the committe should adopt a specif  numer  price relat object as distinct from the question of whether it should adopt an inflat target regim   howev  even the more limit step of establish an explicit price object presum would involv import chang in the feder reserv   s relationship with the public and the congress   issu that will be address by   in his remark   your second exhibit summar some of the potenti benefit and cost of adopt a specif  numer price object   on the benefit side  advoc believ that public announc such an explicit price goal could help preserv the present commit to price stabil by rais an impedi to backslid on the part of some futur fomc   second  announc an explicit price object could better anchor long run inflat expect   in turn  better anchor expect about futur inflat might reduc the volatil of current inflat through it effect on price set and might reduc the volatil of real activ by give the feder reserv greater scope to offset shock   third  a specif object could improv public understand of monetari polici  as the committe took yet anoth step to increas the transpar of the polici process   and last  agre on an explicit price object could help focus polici debat within the fomc by ensur that everyon is aim to accomplish a common object      all that said  skeptic of a specif  numer price object argu that the burden of proof should be on those who would disturb the status quo  and they see sever sourc of potenti harm   for one thing  if the committe meant to preserv the current balanc of emphasi between price stabil and activ stabil  then adopt an explicit object for price   but not for unemploy or output   might mislead the public into believ that your emphasi had shift toward the price object   second  pursu such a cours could  in fact  caus the committe inadvert to place more emphasi on the price object   a third potenti cost could aris if your credibl were seen to be diminish when inflat differ from the state object   final  a commit to an explicit price object could constrain futur action of the fomc in an unhelp manner   for exampl  the committe might feel inhibit in respond as aggress as it would like to a financi crisi if inflat were alreadi to the high side of the committe s object   unfortun  empir evid on these potenti cost and benefit is quit limit  as summar in the bottom panel   littl to no evid exist regard the like influenc of a specif price object on fomc decisionmak or the qualiti of communic with the public   evid is also limit on whether an explicit price object would improv macroeconom perform   as document in the background paper from the divis of intern financ and note in the second bullet  there are some hint from the foreign experi that specif price object have help anchor long term inflat expect   howev  survey base expect measur have been quit stabl in the unit state of late  so expect gain from adopt a specif price object are not guarante and probabl would be modest if they did occur   moreov  the foreign experi   not speak clear as to whether better anchor expect have yield better macroeconom perform   a key question on the empir front is whether an explicit price object would chang the way that privat agent form their expect   insight into this question might be gain by investig whether the profound chang in the conduct of monetari polici over  e in the unit state has induc chang in the format of inflat expect   unfortun  the evid on this point is disput  as note in the third bullet   some analyst attribut the reduc volatil of inflat and real output in recent decad to the chang in monetari polici  but other analyst point to differ factor   face with such limit empir evid  some research have turn to model simul for help in gaug the possibl consequ of chang in monetari polici   simul of the frb us model  among other  indic that better anchor inflat expect would reduc the volatil of inflat and    real output   howev  this result is admit sensit to the assumpt under the specif of these model   in summari  then  we concur with our colleagu in the intern financ divis in read the evid as suggest that adopt of a numer price object probabl would not yield either larg benefit or larg cost  relat to the conduct of monetari polici in recent year   unfortun  we also see that evid as incap of resolv the question of whether such a step would generat net benefit or cost on a more modest scale   that leav us believ that the most relev and import issu for the committe to discuss may be one that onli you can adequ assess   on the plus side  the extent to which an explicit object may aid your intern dynam by ensur that everyon is pull toward a common object and may facilit your communic with financi market  and  on the minus side  the extent to which such an object may skew the prioriti you assign to the two leg of your mandat
if the committe chose to specifi a numer price relat object  it would need to resolv a number of oper issu   the subject of your next exhibit   the top left panel of the exhibit present a checklist of these issu   the first item is the choic of a price index   we favor consum price on sever ground shown in the top right panel   on the practic front  index of consum price are probabl the most familiar to the public and the best measur  from a theoret perspect  the cost of inflat relat to mani differ sort of price   but becaus inflat rate general move togeth in the long run  anchor some measur of consum price inflat would  for the most part  pin down other broad measur of inflat as well    the second item on the checklist is the choic between inflat control  where    bygon are bygon    with respect to inflat surpris  and price level control  where such surpris are eventu offset   i will not review the pros and con of these approach here  but simpli repeat our conclus in the paper that  if the committe were to go down this road  an inflat base strategi probabl make the most sens at this point   the chief factor bear on the third decis on the checklist   the averag inflat rate   are highlight in the middl panel   one consider is measur bias   the board   s staff es  that the cpi overst chang in the cost of live near   percentag point per year and that the chang in pce  person consumpt expenditur  price is bias upward about    percentag point per year   in frame your object in term of a publish index  you will want to take this bias into account   turn to true inflat  the rational for aim for zero are simpli the tradit cost of inflat  includ money illus  relat price confus  and imperfect index of the tax code   the chief rational for posit  true inflat are downward nomin wage rigid and the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate      analys of microeconom wage data suggest that individu have a special distast for nomin wage cut  rais the possibl that lower inflat could lead  to a higher equilibrium rate of unemploy   yet  such downward rigid has left littl imprint on macroeconom outcom  at least so far  as low inflat over the past    year has not been associ with elev unemploy   howev  this phenomenon might matter more in the futur if product growth slow or inflat move even lower  becaus either of those develop would push a larger share of equilibrium nomin wage chang below zero   anoth cost of veri low inflat is that the equilibrium nomin interest rate could declin to a level that would limit the committe   s scope for cut rate  the tabl in the bottom panel present illustr es  of the effect of the zero bound base on stochast simul of the frb us model   for these es   we assum that monetari polici follow an updat taylor rule with a larger coeffici on the output gap that better match the respons of the fund rate to output movement sinc the late     s   if  as shown in the rightmost column  the bias adjust inflat object is   percent  the fund rate equal zero just   percent of the  e  and the standard deviat of the output gap is     percentag point   as the inflat object fall  the fund rate is constrain at zero an increas percentag of the  e  caus econom perform to deterior at an increas rate   for exampl  with a bias adjust object of zero   in the left column   the fund rate is pin at zero    percent of the  e  and the standard deviat of the output gap rise to     percentag point   to be sure  there are altern way to implement monetari polici if the fund rate becom stuck at zero   but these altern are much less familiar than tradit polici action and therefor less predict in their effect   to sum up our analysi of the op  long run inflat rate  we read the admit scant evid as suggest that a cushion of   percentag point on true inflat would provid suffici insur against the cost associ with the zero lower bound and downward nomin wage rigid without impos a high cost through the other effect of inflat   howev  the result from the literatur are not so precis as to rule out other figur in the neighborhood of   percent as repres a sensibl balanc between these compet consider   the last item on the checklist is the choic between a point object and a rang   one virtu of a point object would be it simplic  there could be littl confus about where the committe prefer the inflat rate ul  to be head   on the other hand  the committe might prefer a rang for sever reason  to communic the variabl of inflat  to allow for uncertainti about the appropri numer valu  to encompass diverg view among committe member  or to express a    zone of indiffer    about the inflat rate   as we note in the paper  the econom consequ of announc a rang rather than a point    object would depend on whi the committe chose a rang and how it explain that rang to the public   your fourth exhibit consid the accuraci with which the fomc could achiev an inflat object   becaus inflat is volatil and becaus monetari polici influenc it onli indirect and with a lag  the committe could not hit a point object precis or guarante to keep inflat within a narrow rang   to assess the like accuraci with which inflat could be control  we use stochast simul of the frb us model   the tabl in the middl panel show result for a varieti of altern assumpt   the first row use the shock that are es  to have occur between      and        under these condit  total pce inflat averag over four quarter could be held within plus or minus   percentag point of the desir rate    percent of the  e  and core pce inflat could be held in the same interv    percent of the  e   if the volatil of econom shock were lower   in line with the      to      experi   the committe would be abl to control inflat somewhat more precis  as shown in the second row   inde  total pce inflat on a four quarter basi has been within   percentag point of it averag level almost    percent of the  e sinc the mid     s and near all of the  e sinc the mid      s   a key uncertainti about the inflat process  and thus an import risk to these figur  is the natur of expect format   the first two row of the tabl assum that expect follow a simpl vector autoregress  var  in which the public   s long run forecast of inflat respond gradual to actual inflat and is not influenc by fomc announc   row   just repeat the result from row    with the label emphas that expect are var base with imperfect credibl surround ani announc of a long run inflat object   in row    we continu to assum that near term expect are form use a var  but we assum that long term expect are perfect pin down by the fomc   s announc object   in this case  four quarter total pce inflat stay within a   percentag point band    percent of the  e   the committe could tighten it control of inflat  relat to the result discuss so far  by respond more aggress to movement in inflat and output   howev  as shown in the paper  this effect is fair small   all told  as note in the bottom panel  the committe could like keep four quarter total pce inflat within a plus or minus   percentag point band about two third to three quarter of the  e
the committe   s discuss of the relat merit of an explicit quantif of it price object is like to be complic by consider of how to govern the process of choos an object and how to communic it to the public and the congress   i believ that the decis tree    provid in exhibit   can help to shape this discuss  howev unlik that may seem to you at the outset    the key question befor you is list in the box in the top row  would an explicit  numer specif of price stabil be help in further the achiev of your goal of maximum employ  price stabil  and moder long term interest rate   weigh the argument that   and doug just pose  you might be of the view that the committe   s behavior over the past two decad has reveal enough to the public and to each other about your inflat prefer to make the margin benefit of this addit step small relat to the addit cost   if that is the case  you would presum prefer the status quo as repres in the left branch of the tree   even so  there might be scope for increment improv while preserv the current structur   at the margin  the committe could encourag particip to be more specif about prefer about inflat  both within this room by period have discuss like this and in public through speech and interview   the committe could use the minut  tes oni  and monetari polici report to provid addit guidanc to the public  so as  in effect  to signal the shape of the zone surround your work definit of price stabil   as the memo from the divis of research and statist note  in the summer and fall of       comment from various policymak and mention in the polici announc and minut of    unwelcom disinfl    sent a clear messag to the public that inflat had fallen about as low as you would toler   this meet provid anoth such opportun   you could  for instanc  indic in the minut that  after  consid the issu relat to the inflat rate most like to achiev maximum employ and price stabil in the long run  the committe view the current rate of under inflat as consist with it goal   some of you  howev  might view this approach as relat obliqu and as make the polici discuss needless imprecis   you might also be concern that you would miss an opportun to anchor better the public   s inflat expect   if you choos to quantifi an explicit price object  as in the right part of the schemat  you then have to decid whether or not to make that object public  lead to the possibl in the third row   in principl  you could decid to be specif about your numer goal but keep a close hold on that inform  the possibl outlin at the left   to be sure  privat agreement on a specif object would facilit intern communic  in that you   d agre on an end and be abl to focus your discuss on the most effect mean to that end   from a narrow staff perspect  our job would be easier if we knew your inflat object  as it is an import variabl on the right hand side of interest rate polici prescript and the fix point toward which econometr model simul gravit over  e   but i cannot conceiv how the committe could justifi keep an agre upon inflat object secret nor how  as a practic matter  it could be kept secret  a consider so central to your polici decis would have to be report in the    minut for them to remain an accur depict of your discuss   and  besid  the world would learn of  and like littl appreci  your secret pact five year later when the transcript were releas   thus  the odd that you would settl at the end of this branch of the decis tree seem remot  which is whi the box has a thick red band around it   thus  if you want to settl on a numer definit of price stabil amongst yourselv  i believ that it almost sure has to be a decis announc to the public in some form or other  introduc the question in the right box of row three   should the inflat goal be decid by the congress  presum though the  process of amend the feder reserv act  or by the committe   the choic of an inflat object that best achiev the multipl goal that the congress has assign might be view as a technic decis most  appropri deleg to specialist   the member of this committe   the left branch   but if you see the major benefit of state an inflat object as anchor longer term expect  then you presum would want to commit to it in a fair bind way   that might inclin you to prefer legisl action  the right branch  as it is less like to be revers at some futur date   such a rout through the legislatur  howev  may well lead to the issu list in the box direct below in the fourth row   in particular  is the committe comfort in seek amend to the feder reserv act   reopen the act could lead to other chang that the committe might not welcom  and success in obtain guidanc on an inflat object is by no mean assur   inde  on two occas in recent memori  propos legisl to make the goal of price stabil more explicit never made it out of committe   moreov  if you request consider of an inflat goal by the  congress  are you confid that it would pick a target you view as appropri  there are good reason  ground in the econom theori of  e inconsist  that a decis about an inflat target should be deleg to a conserv central banker   that seem to have been the compromis work out over  e  and you might not want to perturb that equilibrium now   i should also add that  onc a dialogu is open  you will sure be ask by  some to specifi an object for the other of your dual object   maximum employ   there is a convinc answer to that question  in that  given the feder reserv   s ul  control of the inflat rate  it may be view as appropri to have a long run goal for price growth   but if monetari polici is neutral   that is  real econom outcom are virtual independ of your action in the long run   then event outsid your control determin the sustain level of employ and output growth   howev  that there is a good answer   not guarante good legisl  which is whi this box  too  has a red border      but if a numer quantif of price stabil were to be exclus an fomc decis  you will have to ask  as in the box at the left  how will the fomc  choos that object   the bottom row offer two possibl   as at the left  the committe might view a quantif of it price stabil goal as a group decis  similar to choos rang for the monetari aggreg from the late     s to the mid     s  period  the chairman could propos and the committe vote on a singl number or a rang for the growth of a specif price index or index repres the long run inflat outcom consist with best achiev your dual mandat of price stabil and maximum sustain employ   structur the propos in this manner underscor that you are not undercut congression intent but rather provid numer guidanc on how best to achiev your legisl instruct   some of you  howev  could view this as an excess rigid procedur at odd with the committe   s tradit of divers   you are not ask to share a common econom framework or agre on the outlook for the economi  so might it not be appropri to allow room for differ in opinion about your definit of price stabil   in addit  you may harbor the concern that a formal vote might lead the public to believ mistaken that the price object is your sole focus   one way of captur this divers  the right branch  would be to poll particip period as to their prefer specif of the committe   s price object   for exampl  this could be done direct by ad such a question to your semiannu survey of particip    econom forecast   or it could be done indirect by ad a few year to that forecast  on the logic that a longer ahead forecast like implicit reveal your inflat object   on the same logic  further ahead forecast of real gdp growth and the unemploy rate would also convey your view  respect  of the rate of growth of potenti output and the natur rate of unemploy   inde  such specif  particular if it were offer more frequent than the semiannu schedul of your current survey of econom forecast  may make it possibl to trim back on the polici statement releas after each meet   there are a lot of issu to cover today and i suggest  as list in your final exhibit  one possibl strategi for organ the discuss   the primari question to address is   how do you defin price stabil   is it known onli by infer about behavior  when busi and household are not distract by changeabl price  or by a numer specif   if it is the latter  what price index or index do you prefer   is it state in term of a path for it level or as a rate of chang  and what are the desir point es  or rang for their rate of  growth      have share those view about your inflat object  you may next want to consid what role that object play in the committe   s regular busi  there are three chief possibl list in the lower panel  which correspond to the branch of the decis tree that did not seem to be dead end   the first altern is to maintain the status quo in which the committe defin price stabil in term of behavior attitud   resist strict quantif   not mean be silent  howev  and you might choos to provid more inform to the public over  e as to your attitud toward prevail and prospect inflat  so expect can be more firm anchor   as a second altern  you may choos the formal apparatus of vote on an inflat object   explain as the best mean to achiev your dual mandat   at some regular frequenc   if you do not view this as consist with the divers of the committe process  the third altern is to use the semiannu survey of econom forecast to summar the central tendenc of your individu indic of the inflat object   while these issu are no doubt interrel  separ discuss of the appropri inflat goal from discuss of how the committe should incorpor that knowledg in the policymak process might aid progress today   that conclud our present
thank you   let   s just open the floor to general question and see where our convers lead us   who would like to rais the first issu   governor bernank
thank you  mr  chairman   i know i   m not the median voter on this issu  so most i   d like to listen today   but i have just a coupl of comment  the staff did an excel job of lay out the cost and benefit of a specif numer object for inflat   they note quit care that the empir evid is far from decis on the issu that they rais   i think the same argument could appli  for exampl  to whether or not low inflat is good in the first place   it   s just veri difficult to get precis empir evid on these issu  and  therefor  i think we all have to take a priori reason as be part of the argument here   i won   t repeat those argument  but i think we all have to introspect on these issu  the question was rais as to how we defin price stabil   in my public remark  i have occasion refer to price stabil as defin in term of the core pce deflat in a   to   percent    rang   there are two principl here that i believ are somewhat import   the first is that the bottom level of that rang not be zero   i think maintain some space between the zero lower bound and our interest rate is import  and i would be uncomfort with a lower rang that bring us to zero too frequent  the second principl is whether to use a core or a total measur  and i think that should depend to a larg extent on the  e horizon   if we   re look at a relat short horizon  in my  view the core measur is right becaus it is less variabl and it better measur the under trend  if we   re look at a long run object  then i think a total measur is perfect fine   other than those two comment  person  i would put a lot of weight on tri to achiev consensus  and i don   t take a dogmat view on this measur  let me make just a coupl of comment about how i person would view this innov if we were to go down this rout   first  as the staff point out  adopt an explicit numer object would not  of cours  be a full fledg inflat target regim of the form undertaken by the unit kingdom  sweden  canada  and other countri   let me say that i think have a long run inflat object that is defin first of all not as price stabil per se  but rather as the long run inflat rate that best achiev our dual mandat  would be a major step forward   and if we were to take that step   that is  if we were to establish a true north on the compass  so to speak  for long run monetari polici   i would not push for ani further step in the direct of a short term inflat target regim  the second observ i   d like to make is that i think one benefit of this approach ul  would be to provid a stabl and quantit method of communic our intent and our plan to the public   specif  if ul  we went down this rout  i think we   d want to combin an inflat object with perhap more frequent forecast that would help the public assess whether or not the economi was on a path that would eventu get us back to the stabl equilibrium  so to speak   so i do think this approach would be use eventu in term of  communic   in light of that  again speak for myself  if we were to go down this rout  i think    i would be quit comfort with remov the forward look languag that current is in the statement and move toward a more quantit type of communic over  e   thank you
i think you   re rais a veri import first question   are we  in fact  all in agreement that low inflat is a desir goal   if we don   t come to an agreement on that  the rest of the convers  in my judgment  is moot   so it might not be a bad idea to put that question on the tabl   i have alway presum  judg from the experi especi of recent year  that we have all conclud that low inflat   have creat a certain degre of lower risk and greater stabil   has enhanc the real economi in a manner which our experi with high inflat did not   if that conclus is not generic around this tabl  then we have a much broader question to be discuss among this committe   so i   d just like to put that on the tabl to be sure that we don   t end up with a major vote on the other side of this question   if there is anyon here who feel even modest in this direct  pleas take the floor and make your case   governor bie  pleas
mr  chairman  i would just add one perspect on that  which relat to how busi react when the fed realli start to bring inflat down in               and         one of the challeng that a lot of compani face in that period was that they had gotten so accustom to be abl to rais price automat   becaus the climat was such that everybodi was rais them   that the busi process around inflat anticip were veri differ than what we have today  so to answer the question of whether low inflat is a desir goal  one would have to look at it base on where we are today   today i think compani understand that a major challeng in this veri competit environ is to find way to enhanc product   they realiz that it   s a veri tough world to oper in compar to the period of easi price increas that they might have experienc in the earli      s   i think compani have learn that   so in today   s environ  sinc low inflat lower the cost of capit and forc them to focus on servic qualiti and their process and control  overal i think busi would agre that low inflat is a desir    object   but i think we would have heard a differ answer from them if we had ask that in
well  i think the origin purpos of the action that were taken in octob      was to break the back of that general structur   at the  e  the evalu of the evolv inflationari forc was   and i think quit accur   that we were get veri close to a high unstabl system   the assess was that if the general view of the busi communiti about the capac to pass on cost increas didn   t chang radic  we were in for a veri serious problem   and rememb  what has happen in the period sinc is that we have effect creat an environ in which the level of price is presum to be general stabl and  therefor  profit can onli come from true effici   clear  from a macroeconom point of view  that   s the ideal model   and for better or wors  i think we have arriv there  so i would say that the first principl we ought to agre with around this tabl is that the evid  as best we can judg  conclus indic that a low inflat environ has the highest probabl of creat maximum sustain long term growth   we don   t know that as an unquest fact  but it   s about as close to a generic macroeconom principl that we can have  whatev els we do  i think we should not take that for grant   one of the question i would have with respect to the proposit of even some soft form of inflat target   which is not what we are discuss today  as governor bernank point out   is this   what could be the effect of chang the focus of the way we look at the world to emphas a special view of price inflat  as distinct from a broad process in which a lot of forc are involv   i think do so could veri well skew our view away from an op um analyt procedur  if  howev  the evid were quit clear   even half as good as the evid on price inflat be conduc to long term econom growth   then we have to go with where the evid lead us   my own view is that i haven   t seen particular valu in a specif numer target  though there is no question that price stabil is a critic variabl that anchor the system     now  whether it   s necessari to defin price stabil in term of a specif index i think is less import than the broader question we   ve play with over the year  which is  are we deal sole with the price of good and servic  or do asset price enter into the evalu   in other word  is macroeconom stabil  and specif financi stabil  a factor that must be taken into account as part of the overal process of our polici decisionmak   if we decid  as i have a suspicion that futur fomc will eventu come to decid  that asset price are a relev consider   not necessarili to captur bubbl or what have you  but to tri to mold a level of financi stabil that cannot be achiev without advert to asset price   i suspect that that particular process will be come onstream  so in the convers  tri to think about   or answer  if you can   the question of how you view that possibl in the context of a macroeconom environ that is chang continu befor our eye everi week and everi month   we all look at it differ   we restructur  and we have a differ model  i think the import issu here is to recogn that we   ve had it relat easi in recent year   we   ve somehow been abl to captur an understand of the key under forc that have driven inflat  unemploy  and product  and we knew as a consequ of that where monetari polici ought to go   i fear that this recent period may be a special case   i have never seen anyth like this  as i mention to the vice chair and mani other  sinc the middl of         which is about how long i   ve been watch the economi on a day by day basi   i don   t recal our have the slightest clue about what is like to happen in the way that we feel quit confid about it today   unless human natur has chang beyond my expect  i believ it   s extraordinarili unlik that we will be as fortun as we   ve been in recent year   and in the context of chang our procedur to the extent that we are talk about  i think we ought to keep that in mind  that   s all i have to say for the moment   will somebodi els pleas take the floor    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i am a firm believ that low and stabl inflat is of paramount import for an economi to have long term health   i   ve held that view for a long  e  have experienc some of the effect in our region of an inflationari cycl and the washout that come with that  let me say that i thought these paper on whether we should adopt an explicit price target were good and veri help   as i read through them  i came to the conclus that there wasn   t  as you said  a lot of evid suggest that explicit price object have a negat effect and that there was some perhap weak evid that they may have help to anchor long term inflat expect   base on that  i   d be inclin  depend on how the rest of today   s discuss goe  to support use a rang for consum price inflat as an object   given it general accept by the public  i would choos cpi inflat becaus it   s better known   and i would have an object somewher in the rang of   to   percent or     to     percent   i also think the horizon should be the medium term and that  therefor  the object should be total cpi   if the horizon were short  i would agre with governor bernank that the object should be state in term of the core cpi   while somewhat vagu  i think a medium term period would provid the inform that would be import for anchor long term inflat expect   i would also monitor veri close core inflat and use it to explain deviat of inflat from the target rang   i think it can be veri help that way  i also agre with the point that an explicit inflat object might be perceiv as unduli emphas one compon of our dual mandat  and i think that   s a legi  concern   i would think we could avoid this percept by ensur that we alway talk about both object in discuss monetari polici strategi and oper   although we can   t put a target on the growth side   that   s someth we need to think about and work through   but i don   t think it should necessarili inhibit us from go down this path     final  let me mention onli briefli how we might go about introduc an explicit numer goal   i do not think we need congression approv  but i   m not the expert on that   i defer on that to someon who is an expert  but i   d prefer not to go that way  i could accept have the committe vote each year on a medium term inflat object  that would allow us to take into account a chang environ  a chang economi  and chang dynam   while this would allow for the possibl that the object could chang  depend on develop  i doubt that we would chang it veri signific or often   i assum that we   d probabl reaffirm the previous year   s object or modifi it slight base on chang circumst   and i think have such an object would serv us well in term of keep us focus on a primari goal of long term price stabil   i   ll stop with that  mr  chairman   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to confin my remark at this  e to the point that you rais a few moment ago   the import of the long term nomin anchor is great  and i think it has a lot to do with enhanc product and the other thing that governor bie was talk about   but i think it   s veri import for stabil in the short run that expect be close tie to that long term anchor   that is  expect about long run inflat   and that those expect not be push one way or anoth by current event  one of the thing that was so clear in the     s was that short term monetari polici action or inact led to a destabil of the longer term expect environ   when that happen  it put sever constraint on the short run polici option avail to the committe   one of the great benefit of veri solid establish long term expect is that they provid the committe with a lot more freedom to react to short run disturb of all differ sort without upset the expect environ   i think that   s a veri great benefit in term of short run stabil   to me  one of the advantag of an explicit fomc inflat object is that it would    assist in anchor long run expect and make them less reactiv or potenti reactiv to short term event  includ polici decis that are made for purpos of short term stabil
may i ask what evid there is that that is inde the case  do you have ani evid that knowledg of a central bank committe   s specif numer judgment as to the appropri rang for inflat    in fact  anchor longer term expect   obvious  if it    it   s tremend import   is there evid that you find persuas
no  i agre with ben bernank that evid in this area is veri  veri hard to come by   but i   m say that is one of the benefit i would see  base my view main on
if it were to happen  it would be an obvious benefit  but
one thing that i do know  and i can speak to evid in this sens  is that sinc the korean war  meet of this committe have often focus at particular  e on a concern that polici action would be view by the market as upset the inflationari environ   when you go back and look at the minut of these meet   particular around busi cycl peak  when the economi was alreadi begin to turn down   the committe was typic slow to eas polici even though there was an understand that the busi cycl peak was at hand or at risk or had even pass   the reason  and you see this again and again in the discuss around this tabl  was concern that a prematur eas   what the fomc particip would call a prematur eas   of polici would affect expect in the market and would  therefor  aggrav the inflat problem that the committe had been deal with
i rememb say exact that
so i can point to evid that that happen numer  e around this tabl
well  no   the reason   and i rememb it at these meet   was that  inde  we were look at the question of inflationari imbal build up  the point is that we knew in retrospect that the economi was tilt downward  but there were innumer occas when inflationari imbal were build up and the economi didn   t turn    down   we have an anti inflat bias in this committe  which is as it should be   and our judgment on polici has alway involv a cost benefit analysi   with particular concern about the cost of be wrong and go back to the      experi   but i don   t consid that evid   how   that control long term expect
it is not evid that an announc target would help to anchor expect  i   m make that judgment on the basi of what i think i understand about the process
well  you obvious have opinion or els you wouldn   t be make the statement
but i do think that well befor        in the whole period sinc the korean war   one see over and over again at busi cycl peak that this committe was veri concern that it would upset the inflat expect environ by act prematur  if you   re ask for evid  i think there is one case  strang enough  on the other side  that was when we were get the fund rate down to   percent   the inflat rate was low and there was uncertainti in the marketplac about what the committe   s inflat object were   and it was at that point that the languag came into the statement regard an    unwelcom further declin    in inflat  and
that   s qualit
that was qualit   that   s correct
i don   t think anybodi disagre on the notion of make our convict of price stabil on both side clear
the issu is whether there is a critic advantag of a specif number rather than a rang or probabilist view or some qualit view   that   s what we   re discuss   i think we have agre that low inflat is superior  and i think we all have a general view of where low inflat is with respect to the index   the question is   do we get an    increment advantag by specif wherebi it alter expect in a way that clear would be favor   that   s the real question
i think in that case that if we had previous announc a rang  the market    well befor inflat got close to or below the bottom of the rang   would have been say that the fomc will be respond   the market would have been expect us to move the fund rate down becaus inflat was get down to or below the bottom of the announc rang  the one other case is not a u s  case but japan   i think the japanes have also suffer from  not be veri clear that they do not want deflat  particular as the situat develop in the earli     s   the market were left quit at sea in tri to figur out where japanes monetari polici was go to go
i think they still are
yes  they probabl still are

thank you  mr  chairman   let me make just a few broad comment  normal  when i start think about these kind of issu  i ask myself what is broken that we   re tri to fix   here i ask myself  do we want to be more explicit about a price or inflat object  my answer to that is    yes     but it   s not becaus i   m tri to fix someth   i view it as the next logic step in more or less formal what we realli have been do over the past decad or more   what i would call tri to lock in past success   so to me that   s the most compel rational for serious consid take this step  as i said  i   ve alreadi come down pretti favor on it  but i have two reserv that give me some paus   let me just mention them   they   ve alreadi come up   one is  will we send the wrong signal about our dual mandat   i think tom hoenig alreadi address that in suggest that we can clarifi that through communic   mani of us alreadi address that when we   re out in public by emphas the signific of price stabil or low inflat  but indic that the under reason for our commit to price stabil is how it affect econom perform     the second concern that give me a bit of paus is  would this inappropri tie our hand under certain circumst   there i conclud that  first of all  if there were a legi  crisi  we wouldn   t have ani difficulti explain whi we were deviat from whatev inflat object we had announc   if we were concern about deflat  i don   t see ani conflict becaus peopl would see what we were do and the reason for it would line up   so it seem to me that would be a concern onli if we had a strang confluenc of circumst where inflat was an issu but simultan we were experienc subpar growth or someth like that   in such a case  i think bill pool   s comment about the     s are relev   first of all  i don   t know what the probabl is of the confluenc of those kind of event   it   s probabl go to be low   but second  i think it is worthwhil to have our hand tie at a  e such as that
thank you  mr  chairman   i believ that it is import for the fomc to defin inflat goal and to do so numer   i further believ that we can gain the full benefit of our reput from recent histori by commit to a specif definit of price stabil go forward  as some of you may know  i recent gave a speech on this  and i advanc a propos that was intend to promot discuss regard way to implement a program of continu price stabil   my prefer  as articul at that  e  were a target band of   to   percent on annual inflat as measur by a    month move averag rate of chang in the core pce deflat   now  i   m not necessarili wed to ani of those three compon   there are numer way of success design an inflat target framework   nevertheless  this propos cover the three key attribut that i believ ani inflat target framework must address  name  the question of a rang versus a singl number  the  e interv over which the target is set  and the measur of inflat that will be target  i won   t repeat here my reason for the particular featur i propos   i would  howev  like to point out that i believ there are key benefit to be precis regard our goal of price stabil     in my view  the inflat target regim would improv discuss  help the fomc communic it intent to the public  and give the public a clear criterion for judg polici   these are basic the point that were list in the introductori comment by the staff  the public would also expect us  except in rare circumst  to take the necessari action to keep inflat within the target band   and an inflat target framework  onc it is institution  would align public expect with fomc intent   in short  i think an explicit inflat target in one of the form list   i don   t want to be too exact on whether or not we   re talk about a regim or a certain way of look at the inflat number becaus to me those are second order issu   would build public confid that price would remain stabl over the long horizon  iron  i also believ that move to a regim of this type would increas flexibl and enhanc our abil to achiev our other econom object   it is onli becaus we had achiev a good deal of credibl over the year that we were abl to lower the fed fund rate to   percent recent without ignit fear of inflat   and i would argu that this flexibl was import in contribut to the shallow of the last recess   an inflat target regim would allow us to pass this credibl on into the futur to other committe so that they  too  could benefit from the success of the past action that the committe has taken to bring an end to the period of great inflat and to produc    year of virtual price stabil  by contrast  i found the argument against inflat target less compel   for starter
you   re use the term    inflat target    to mean
well  this broad notion of say that we have a numer target and here   s what the number or the rang is
but you   re go beyond what   s in the text   are you use the term interchang or are you talk
yes  i am use it to mean this broad notion of our say that we as a group have in mind a number that we want for inflat
i ask becaus inflat target has a veri specif oper mean
i understand your point   that   s whi i think  quit frank  that by argu about the detail we lose sight of what we   re tri to do   what we have done up to this point is to agre on a rather open notion that we think the economi oper most effect in a stabl  low inflat environ  and we have made that clear to the public   in my view  the next step is to say     this is what we think we   re look for in term of price stabil      and as i said at the outset  i think the way to do this is by set a rang for an inflat object over a period of  e  that add inform   it is not so strict in the purest sens of an inflat target  but rather an inflat target framework or regim   those are the word i would use  i   d like to talk for just a moment or two about the argument that we shouldn   t move toward inflat target   for starter  i believ inflat target is total consist with the fomc   s mandat   i agre with the view express by other around this tabl that we don   t need congress to set a definit of price stabil   it is a technic aspect of what our mandat is  some of the discuss concern the cost of inflat target to me actual serv to highlight the problem of discretionari polici   there will be  e when the commit to inflat target in my sens of the term will be constrain   if this were not the case  there would be no need for institution our commit  becaus discret and the commit would yield the same polici   therefor  an explicit inflat target environ will give the fomc stronger incent to act as it say it intend   recogn this  the public will consid the commit to low and stabl inflat more credibl so that the full benefit of a stabl price environ can be realiz  but will inflat target in this sens be too constrain   i don   t believ so   i recogn that all conting for ani situat cannot be pre specifi   in special circumst  the fomc must be abl to act appropri   ani miss in the inflat target becaus of extraordinari event that occur could easili be communic to the public and  therefor  would not result in an    inappropri monetari polici or loss of credibl  the experi of other countri and the fact that we are alreadi implicit target inflat without hinder econom perform indic to me that it   s not a major challeng to adopt an inflat target framework
has ask each one of us to consid whether an explicit numer specif of price stabil would be help to us in further the achiev of our goal for price stabil and maximum sustain employ and in our communic either extern or intern   my own answer to that question is    no  i don   t think so      this is not a knee jerk reaction to the idea of inflat target or goal set   howev one want to defin the regim  i think set an inflat target or goal   and i am use those term interchang   can be veri help in some case   in particular  when countri have experienc veri high rate of inflat or are just emerg as market economi  state inflat goal can be use in communic with market   do that can be use in demonstr serious polici intent on the part of a new govern or central bank regim and in build general credibl   brazil and mexico come to mind when i think of countri where an inflat target or goal has been use  at least over  e  particular in the face of polit and other uncertainti  but the unit state is not in that kind of situat nor is it particular similar to the other countri or monetari union that use inflat target or goal   except perhap the european union and the u k   both of which i would argu start at veri differ point with a new or newli independ central bank   we in the feder reserv have spent    or more year under two chairmen first curb inflat and then achiev a workabl sens of price stabil that   s built not on a specif number but on the absenc of rise price as a major consider in everyday busi and consum decis   person i   m comfort with that definit   and i think it has been quit success if you look at the way inflat expect are anchor  at the volatil of econom output  and at our achiev of low inflat over the year     what we do in set polici   how we actual conduct polici over the year   seem to me far more import and a far greater element of our credibl than what we say we are go to do  and  in fact  what we say could actual frustrat polici   now  i know some of you are react the same way i think some of my colleagu in boston do when i state this posit   i can hear them   laughter   they would say     now  come on  cathi  how much harm could it do to state a goal in term of a rang of inflat within which you as a policymak would feel comfort   wouldn   t that have the advantag of be more transpar in your polici set and more forthright about your toler for inflat  both on the high and the low side      there have been volum written about this subject  and i   ve done some read of that materi in addit to work by the staff  which i think was extrem well done   in the end  howev  i have to come at this with a more or less commonsens perspect that   s the result of my  experi on the committe and in the feder reserv system   i understand the argument for an inflat goal  but  to me  anyway  there   s at least a possibl that set a numer goal or even a rang of accept inflat could present the risk of either be less transpar or  arguabl wors  make a bad polici decis  if a particular goal for inflat is to be credibl  then it would seem to me that market would have to have some confid that the feder reserv would react in predict way each  e that goal is either met or miss   but inflat is not the onli goal  as we   ve all said  sustain employ  or howev you want to character the other part of our mandat  is a goal as well   so my polici prefer for a given level or path of inflat would not be ident all the  e   it would depend on what is happen in the real economi  just as in the first half of      we toler rather rapid price growth on the basi of our calcul of the degre of excess capac in the real economi and the temporari natur of the energi price increas   i know that over the long run there   s no tradeoff between growth and inflat and that price stabil  howev defin  is the best contribut monetari polici can make to econom prospect   but in the short run  when suppli shock can domin  there can be tradeoff     there need to be flexibl to set polici with some sens of balanc between the two goal  so if i commit to an inflat goal but don   t alway adher to that goal becaus of the need to be concern about the real economi  how is state the goal a form of better communic   or altern  if i don   t balanc the goal and make polici choic base on that balanc  then i may be adher to the inflat target but make bad overal polici  now  i realiz that the staff present option allow for all kind of flexibl in set and administ an inflat goal   the goal could be focus on the long run  it could be measur flexibl  the number could be chang  et cetera   but if it   s go to be all that flexibl  how could it possibl make a differ in either how we   re view or how we actual oper   frank  i   m  not sure i want to chang how we   re view or how we oper   i think it has been pretti success  inflat goal or target strike me as not unlik the perform metric that are use to judg the effect of oper   anyon who use such metric know that  while they   re use  they can be veri t i   that   s becaus you actual get the perform you measur  focus hard on cost  and innov and qualiti go out the door   if you give peopl incent to increas profit and make the share price go up  account ethic can be at risk   perform metric need to be multidimension and surround by robust control system if they   re to work in a way that both achiev the object and balanc how the overal organ function  i don   t worri about this committe   s ongo commit to price stabil  no matter how mani of the face around the tabl chang   what i do think could be at risk  if onli margin  is the balanc and  yes  discret that is vital to policymak   in sum  i look at inflat target or goal  howev unthreaten they may appear  as a solut both in search of a problem and with a potenti to caus one   i   m not in favor of go forward with an inflat goal  in case anybodi is uncertain about that    laughter   but if  in the full of  e  we decid to do it  i have some thought on how we could do it   i   ll share them with you later if that is necessari    laughter
i want to start by commend the staff for the background paper that in my view were quit thorough and balanc  the question today is whether the fomc should or should not adopt an explicit numer price relat object and  if so  how   my feel is that this is a rather narrow question as it has been present to us today in the sens that  given our current practic  announc such an object would not requir veri much chang in fed policymak   and yet i think it   s an extraordinarili import step for us to take  regard the oper issu rais in the memo by   and compani  i agre with the recommend that the object should be a consum price index   either the cpi with a   percent midpoint or the pce price index with a     percent midpoint   these midpoint would allow for a known upward measur bias and provid an addit   percent cushion against the zero bound   my prefer would be to target the pce index sinc that measur has some  methodolog advantag and it   s what we focus on intern   i also have a prefer for target the core measur becaus that would be suffici to anchor headlin inflat over  e  but it would afford us the latitud to allow the relat price of food and energi to fluctuat without necessarili requir a respons   i would also favor a   percentag point rang  from   to   percent  rather than a point target  so as to give us a reason safe harbor within which we would not be press to explain fluctuat in inflat   a relat narrow safe harbor  howev  would disciplin us to explain whi there are fluctuat in inflat and how we expect to revers them  over  e   and i   d expect that our inflat object would be revis onli infrequ  main in respons to improv in measur  with regard to the issu cover by     s memo  i think we should announc our object to the public   when we do it  we should emphas that it   s an increment step and   not impli a dramat departur from how we have been conduct monetari polici   we should also emphas that we believ   base on central bank experi both here and abroad and a priori reason  perhap   that it will enhanc the oper power of monetari polici to stabil    both employ and inflat   and we should explain that it will do so by better anchor long term inflat expect and thus improv our abil to communic in the short run  admit  monetari polici  as mani peopl have remark here today  has been work relat well late  and we   re alreadi wide credit with make low inflat a prioriti   so the question aris of whi we should take the addit step now of announc an explicit long run inflat object   for me the argument boil down to three thing   first  we all agre that we want inflat to remain fair close to where it is now   i took that as a consensus  mr  chairman  that the cost of fail to keep inflat this low are well understood   and on net  there are no good reason to want inflat higher or lower than where it is today  second  by announc a specif long run object  we would not be give up much flexibl that we haven   t alreadi given up or that we shouldn   t be happi to give up   in the process of establish the reput that we have now for our commit to price stabil  we alreadi have given up the flexibl to let inflat expect get out of control   an announc object would be meant to guid our action in the long run   it would not hinder us  in my view  from take the kind of polici action we take today to stabil employ and output in the short run  it would help disciplin us  howev  to undo and to explain how we intend to undo ani short run departur from our long run object   more to the point  it would forc us to respond when measur of expect inflat move veri much outsid our target rang   there are no circumst  i submit  in which we would want expect inflat outsid of a narrow band around our object for veri long   thus  the narrow scope of flexibl that   s at stake here is someth i think we   d be better off without  third  establish an inflat object within the committe would facilit discuss  and announc it  i think  would lead to better public understand of how we intend to conduct monetari polici go forward   the valu of ambigu about our long run intent has outliv it use in my view  and i don   t see ani reason to retain that ambigu   moreov  i think better clariti about our long run object would help us be more transpar about the short run    polici process  i agre with presid pool about that   ul   i think this is the onli way to secur good monetari polici in the futur
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to begin by compliment the staff on their excel and balanc paper and present  when i first particip in this committe back in       i believ that inflat by ani measur exceed the comfort level of everi fomc particip   the goal of lower inflat over  e was a univers share and well articul goal   at that  e  a qualit definit of price stabil arguabl suffic to communic the committe   s object to the public   now that under inflat has reced to a level that mani of us consid op   though  the transit cost of lower inflat have becom moot  and there are potenti benefit of enunci a numer long run inflat object  i think the articul of such an object would facilit coher intern polici discuss   to the extent it help anchor the public   s inflat expect  it would enhanc our abil to avoid deflat in the vicin of the zero bound on interest rate   a numer object might also reduc the potenti for destabil inflat scare follow advers suppli shock  enhanc the scope for monetari polici to respond to their real effect   the public enunci of a long run inflat object i think also enhanc account and transpar  and those are desir goal that we should pursu  now  of cours  i worri about the possibl cost and unintend consequ from take such a step   in this regard i   m veri sympathet to the argument that presid   has express   and governor kohn has articul these same concern on a number of previous occas   such a polici might be the first step along a slipperi slope that ul  undermin the committe   s mandat for maximum employ  as well as broader financi stabil   so for that reason  i think enunci of a numer inflat goal simpli must be in the context of a clear and    effect communic of our multipl object and the polici that we follow to achiev them  i   d like to come back to that point in a minut  i recent reread the transcript of the      fomc meet at which the committe i think last discuss a numer object for inflat   at that meet there was actual a consider consensus among particip  includ myself  for a   percent long run object for cpi inflat  sinc then  of cours  there have been sever import develop relev to this choic   back in       i argu that the inflat object should contain a cushion suffici to greas the wheel of the labor market   the potenti negat impact of downward nomin wage rigid on real econom perform diminish  howev  as product and henc averag wage growth rise  and as doug mention  it turn out that high product growth over the past decad made downward wage rigid a nonissu   but for me  this shift has been offset by the experi of veri low inflat both here and abroad  which has certain heighten my concern relat to the zero lower bound   so  on balanc  take a number of other factor into account  i find myself still pretti comfort with the numer object we discuss almost a decad ago  instead of adopt an object base on the cpi  i would now enunci an object base on the core pce   this seem sensibl given the methodolog advantag of that index and the committe   s recent emphasi on it   take measur bias between the two index into account  my prefer would now be for a long run inflat object of     percent for core pce inflat  i want to discuss a coupl of detail relat to that object   first  i prefer a core measur of inflat even if total inflat is more close relat to societ welfar   as a communic devic  i think we should focus our attent on under inflat and not on movement that we view as transitori   second  on balanc  i find myself prefer a point es  rather than a rang   specifi a rang is help and common what is use   it   s help in emphas the fomc   s imperfect control of inflat  but it might wrong suggest that the committe is equal comfort anywher insid that rang   in addit  it might suggest that we    would react in some nonlinear fashion if inflat move outsid the rang   moreov  the staff paper show that  view as a formal confid interv  a reason rang that we could actual hit  say     percent of the  e  might stretch from zero to   percent  which is simpli too wide to be help  let me briefli turn to     s second question  which concern how we might communic a long run inflat object to the public   my answer would be to take the poll and survey element of     s altern   and combin them with the communic strategi of his altern     to elabor  i would hope that by the end of this discuss we might obtain some consensus on a numer long run object  possibl through a poll or survey of particip   if a consensus on a numer object were reach by this group  it could then   and probabl must be   express in the minut  in tri to formul what that descript might look like  i found myself attract to the veri care craft languag propos by governor bernank in his present at the st  loui fed   s      confer on inflat target   his suggest languag state that    the fomc believ that the state inflat rate is the one that best promot it output  employ  and price stabil goal in the long run      he also propos state that    the fomc regard this inflat rate as a long run object onli and set no fix  e frame for reach it   in particular  in decid how quick to move toward the long run inflat object  the fomc will alway take into account the implic for near term econom and financi stabil      i think these proviso are import in explain to the public whi the committe endors an inflat object that actual differ from true price stabil   and  by emphas the potenti for conflict between price stabil and real econom perform  it highlight the committe   s commit to pursu not just one but both part of the dual mandat   i think the minut should also note that the issu of an appropri numer long run object would be revisit from  e to  e and that it might be appropri for the committe to reapprais   although typic reaffirm  i expect   the inflat    object annual   i view these step as augment the status quo  but with a much clearer express of our view on op  inflat
as if on cue    laughter   thank you  mr  chairman   let me begin by comment on a coupl of the thing that you said at the begin   i think there   s a consensus   i know that there   s a consensus   around this tabl that price stabil  approxim by veri low  stabl inflat  is the appropri long run goal of this committe   and we agre that it is the way  for the reason you state  mr  chairman  as did governor bie  that we promot maximum  sustain growth   by take inflat out of the decis pictur   i think that consensus actual give me a littl more confid than i hear from some of my colleagu that our goal would not be vulner to the passag of  e or chang personnel around the tabl   i think it   s just so wide agre that i   m actual not concern about those two thing  so this idea of cement in the past perform to me carri a littl less weight in argument that we ought to defin price stabil or to have an inflat target than i think some other are give it   i think it   s alreadi there   i   d be veri  veri surpris to see it go away  i think in practic there   s a rang of measur inflat rate that fit the general criteria of  promot effici and not play a materi role in privat decis   the polici reaction to a forecast of a given rate probabl depend on what els is go on at the same  e   your point  mr  chairman  about the dynam of the price process  and then particular on the suppli side of the economi  as a number of you note in      when we were worri about inflat get too low  the steadi   percent inflat look a lot less worrisom when product and demand are strong than when they are weak   in the former case  potenti constraint of the zero bound on interest rate and sticki of wage would be much less threaten  i   d also guess that the prospect of inflat of   percent or even a bit north of   percent would look a lot less advers in the presenc of persist advers suppli shock that were also    depress demand and product   and as you mention  mr  chairman  the particular attitud toward an inflat goal could be affect by our percept of financi stabil and what is requir to keep the financi system stabl  to me this suggest a zone of price stabil encompass a rang of inflat outcom  with the edg of even that zone be soft or changeabl  in the sens that our polici reaction to inflat project to approach or even violat some notion zone would depend on the circumst   in my view  this is the way we have been conduct polici   it has been veri success in produc price stabil and stabil econom cycl   presid   said that we wouldn   t be give up much flexibl if we adopt this definit   i   m not sure whi we should give up ani  it seem to me that this type of think argu veri strong against a point definit of price stabil or against a rang where the center has a good deal of gravit pull   in that regard  i look at the ecb  european central bank   which has defin a point for it price stabil object   in my view  that definit has constrain the polici choic of the ecb in way that are not in the best interest of the euro area economi  now  by toler a rang of outcom  we do incur a cost in term of variat in inflat expect   you ask  mr  chairman  whether there was ani evid that inflat target or an inflat definit could tie down those expect   a veri excel paper that we had from  the staff suggest that evid was begin to accumul that inflat expect are better tie down in inflat target countri   what is surpris is how weak and recent that evid is  and i think the weak and recent of the evid is a testament to the fact that price expect have been veri stabl in the unit state   and i doubt that the welfar cost of the variat we   ve experienc outweigh the welfar gain of the flexibl in polici reaction that i think we   ve retain by not have a target for inflat and not have our hand tie in ani way by a numer object      that said  my first choic would be to enhanc the status quo  as   was talk about  i think there are some thing we can do within the status quo  broad defin  to reduc uncertainti about our price stabil object   in my view  we   ve alreadi taken one step by extend our februari project for a year   as i thought about my      inflat project  i couldn   t see ani reason that it would differ materi from an inflat rate that i thought would be accept in the long run   i suspect the rest of you went through the same thought process   i don   t know what the result are  we   ll see them tomorrow   but i think the result could tell the public a good deal about the rang of outcom that the committe consid accept  it   appear that one uncertainti now is about how high an inflat rate we would find accept   i think we could address this point  as   note  by indic in our individu speech and your tes oni  mr  chairman  and in the monetari polici report the sort of inflat situat that would concern us  now  if we do find that that   s not enough and that an explicit numer rang from the fomc as a committe would be help in anchor expect  i would urg a coupl of thing  one  i would specifi the object in term of total pce inflat   not a price level and not just core inflat   i think chang in core inflat are better indic of under inflat pressur and may even help to predict futur total inflat   but to me the argument for price stabil suggest a broad measur  and i don   t think we should ignor trend movement in food and energi price that may be contribut to overal inflat   after all  this definit  if we were to adopt it  is a long term definit   not someth we would hit year by year  i would have a fair wide rang on the definit   somebodi mention   to   percent   i don   t think it would be possibl to make good argument within that rang that welfar is a lot higher or lower at one point or anoth   i would clarifi that it   s a long term definit   inflat rate could be out of the rang for a while  depend on the circumst  but they   d be expect to get back in it eventu   i would think that inflat anywher in the rang would be accept  though we might take action to chang the rate within that rang under certain circumst   and i    would emphas  as other have note  that choos ani rang or choos a definit in no way connot a downgrad of our output stabil goal   that   s a step that congress has refus to take on sever occas  that bring me to a final point   if we were to take this step of enunci a numer definit  i think we would need to consult extens with the administr and the congress to explain what we   re do  whi  and what it   or   not mean for the conduct of polici in the futur   as near as i could tell from the intern financ write up  in all the inflat target countri   switzerland might be an except   the govern outsid the central bank was involv in some way in the adopt of their regim or their definit   we   re not talk about inflat target here  but it would be an import chang in the way we communic  and we should have the understand and the support of our elect repres if we   re go to make such a chang  thank you
thank you   let   s take a break now for mayb    or    minut   we   ll come back and see if we can get fulli around the tabl by the end of the day

thank you  mr  chairman   i would also like to start by thank the staff for the great materi on this subject  i found it veri help   and i   d like to be on record as state that i do regard price stabil as the most import contribut that we can make to the nation   s long term econom welfar   i also believ the fomc has done a remark job over the past    year in achiev and then maintain price stabil   nevertheless  i think there are some modif to our current practic that are worth consid   in my view  be more numer explicit about our inflat object can help us to be success in maintain price stabil   i don   t regard an explicit numer price object as a panacea  but i think it could help us   we might gain some addit credibl with the public by simpli be clearer than we are today   after all  what is report in the press is that the public alreadi most like believ that a    major of us have someth like a   to   percent cpi rang in mind   but some peopl might suspect that we are intent tri to creat some wiggl room so that we can avoid account   so  greater clariti  i think  would enabl us to project a more credibl imag  and it might engend some extra self disciplin when we realli need it  more import  i think that be more explicit will give us a greater capac to communic both intern as well as extern   by that  i mean that now i some  can   t tell whether i   m differ with anoth particip   s posit becaus we have differ price project or becaus we have differ price object   so  i think it would be construct for us to be a littl more explicit with one anoth about each of these factor  my price stabil object is for price expect to be consist with the pce index increas at an averag rate of     percent per year  which i expect to achiev by have the pce index itself increas at that averag rate over period of five to ten year   now  i   m state my definit in term of pce becaus we   ve gravit to that measur in this committe  but i don   t have a strong prefer for it over the cpi   either would be fine with me   if we were to use the cpi  though  i would have my object in the   percent rang  sinc inflat is certain to vari around ani singl numer object in the short run  even when we achiev the averag object over  e  i think put a rang around the object can indic a kind of toler zone   my toler zone is a   percentag point spread abov and below my     percent pce inflat object   i don   t view this necessarili as a boundari trigger polici action  but when inflat fall outsid of that rang  i think some extra public communic about the situat would be help  turn to the question of what role the price object should play in the committe   s polici process  i   m open to consid the idea of a committe object and rang  as describ in     s altern    although i don   t think it   s necessari to jump to such a posit in one leap  in fact  i think it would be more prudent to take a small step in that direct and gain some experi   i think we would gain a lot by modifi our semiannu econom project  as laid    out in     s altern     more specif  i like the idea of individu submit project for each of the next two year  as we did for this meet  plus an addit set of project for the averag of the next three to five year   these project  as don kohn mention  would be base on each particip   s work definit of price stabil and the polici that support it   the rang and the central tendenc of these project would becom public  perhap in the context of an expand discuss of them in the monetari polici report  and then polici action could be explain in the context of these more explicit object   i wouldn   t be surpris to discov that our three  to five year inflat project converg to a fair narrow rang   moreov  this adjust to our current practic would be embed in a process that   s alreadi quit familiar to the public and shouldn   t be regard as radic   import  i think this modif to our current practic would be perfect consist with the congression mandat under which we oper today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i also thank the staff for the help paper   my own view are closest to cathi     s and don kohn   s   like almost everyon who has spoken  i would remind all of us that we have been veri success in help to achiev a long period of stabl and low inflat   i think we have also achiev signific transpar in term of our inflat prefer   i believ that each of us around this tabl has a general sens of what we think our target is   i believ that outsid  includ financi market  get it as well   so  i don   t think there   s ani great addit transpar to be achiev by announc a specif numer object  i think there   s also consider risk at this point in go down the path of choos a more formal object   we have a larg group around this tabl  and i think it   s go to be veri difficult   though perhap not   and mayb even counterproduct to agre on a singl price measur on a more formal basi and with a less flexibl adjust process   i think we could even lose some of the rich of the discuss that we   ve had in the past   i   m remind of the period of     e when we were so worri about deflat that we perhap didn   t do as much as we could have in dissect and decompos some of the measur of inflat to see some of the thing that were go on under the surfac   if we focus on a singl price measur  we may in fact miss that kind of opportun to look at what realli is go on   although i agre with presid  n that have a specif object would not tie our hand  liter  i think it would  in fact  caus us to give up at least some of the flexibl that we current enjoy   and i see no reason to do that  there hasn   t been a lot of discuss of one of the item that   mention in his paper  and that is the reaction of congress to our attempt to set a price relat object   i agre with other that we probabl  in our way of govern  have an oblig at least to consult with the congress   i think there   s a clear risk that the congress  with all good intent  could want to substitut it judgment for our regard what would be an appropri object   and mayb  as     s paper suggest  congress would even attempt to give us multipl object that could be intern inconsist or  in fact  beyond the central bank   s abil to materi affect  i won   t repeat the argument other have made about some of the new communic problem that we could creat with a formal object   i actual think what we need to do is to allow ourselv and other to celebr an approach and oper process that has work and work veri well in not onli achiev low inflat but anchor inflat expect   i certain agre with the suggest in     s present that we should continu to work on other opportun to explain our inflat prefer and intent   but  to use the word that other use  i don   t think our current process is    broken      i have much more confid than some other that the peopl around this tabl and other who will follow us are not like to break it  mr  chairman  i think we should stay where we are for the moment  although this issu certain merit continu discuss   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   on your specif question about low and stabl inflat  i  too  believ it is veri import   i had similar experi to those susan bie had in privat industri in the late      s and the      s  and i share her view complet  i also had some experi in govern in the late      s and earli      s   in       when we had wage and price control  i head a littl group call the council on wage and price stabil  which was monitor inflat after control were put in place   this was a terribl period   it was bad in privat industri  and it was bad in govern  too   we want to do everyth we can to avoid go through anoth period like that or have to face those problem again  in answer to     s question  i come out for altern     let me explain how i got there  but first i would add my compliment on the staff   s work   the paper the staff prepar were excel  in term of defin price stabil  in principl i think behavior   reveal the cost associ with inflat   in the definit that we   ve all been use  we look at the way peopl are behav in term of devot resourc to deal with inflat cost and risk   if behavior suggest that the cost are low  then that is price stabil   that   s the definit we   ve all been use  this mean  of cours  that inflat not onli need to be low  it also need to be stabl  so  would it be help to defin that as a number or a rang  beyond the behavior side   i guess  in practic  it would be use within this committe to have an explicit number to judg where we are and where we   re go   and to answer     s question  if we were to do that  i think we ought to use what is technic the best index  which is the pce   it   s less familiar to the public than the cpi  but the more we use it public  the more peopl will catch on to it  and certain peopl would learn a lot more about it if it becam the focal point of our discuss about inflat   i tend to focus on the core inflat number  and i person think that     percent is a reason assess of what might be best   but i would say that anyth between   and   percent would be about the same for econom perform   anyth lower and the zero bound becom an issu     i did want to make a coupl of comment about the discuss of a rang versus a point es  for our object   we   ve heard argument on both side  and i guess i would put in a caveat about a wide rang   peopl have talk about   to   percent   i think we would need some greater clarif about the accept outcom within that rang   for exampl  let   s say the rang was   to   percent and we had    percent inflat for four or five year in a row   i don   t think ani of us would realli feel comfort say that   s price stabil     mention that have ani rang give the impress of a zone of indiffer  and i think that   s an import point   i share some of her concern about that  so i think it would be an import issu to address if we ever were to set a rang  in term of the role of the price object in the polici process  as i said  at this  e i prefer altern    the status quo   i would augment it with some of the step that   mention in his memo to give more inform to the public   in a sens  this is a further evolut of our effort to improv transpar   we   ve taken an increment approach to improv transpar  and i think it has serv us veri well   go further than those increment step i don   t think is necessari  now  the staff paper discuss the intern experi  which i found veri interest  but our situat is realli quit differ from the two group of countri that were mention   as cathi note  we don   t have a crisi to deal with  as was the situat in brazil or in mexico   we have low inflat and a good deal of credibl   we   re also the largest economi in the world  so the format of inflat expect here is like to proceed differ than it   in smaller economi and one that are much more open than our that appear to have benefit from inflat target  so  i don   t think we   re readi to proceed on this yet   i believ it would be best to take small step   i can see a number of possibl problem that could aris   i think we have to be veri care in discuss with the congress and with the public over how to address this issu in view of our dual    mandat   as don kohn suggest  we ought to move veri care here   that conclud my comment  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   a lot of point have been put on the tabl alreadi  so i feel a bit like i   m take an oral exam  but here goe  first question  is low inflat desir   yes  i definit think it is
that   s one right answer    laughter
i   m go to get to meatier thing    laughter   is it desir to have an anchor   i think it is  and i think bill pool gave the reason   that we actual have more flexibl to move against unemploy if we have a well understood anchor   on the other side  i   m  gratifi that nobodi is realli in favor of a full  formal inflat target routin  such as was describ in the document by the intern financ divis   the system is not broken   we have somehow or other manag to convey that the committe care a lot about low inflat  and mani of us in our talk have even use the word    anchor      there may be some increment step we could take  but i agre with what   just said   that sinc it is not broken  we should be veri  veri care  mr  chairman  you rais the question of asset price  and i notic that nobodi has comment on that  so let me   it strike me that asset price are a fundament differ breed of cat here   asset price   stock price  exchang rate  even hous price   i see as part of the monetari transmiss mechan   we should  as we say  take them into account in make our forecast and do our analysi of the economi  but i think we have to leav them out of the index  if we go to target some index or anoth  i don   t want that index to includ anyth about asset price   i think that   s a fundament differ notion  the staff  i think  gave us good inform   as for me  i favor a core index on the ground of the number shown here   if we have an index and want to keep it in a zone  i   d like to have that index be more stabl so it is out of the zone less and so we have to explain less frequent whi it is    out of the zone   and to me  it   s almost self evid that we would want to use consum price and the rate of inflat  on the question of what is our target  everybodi seem to be for   percent on the bottom   and that   s fine   i am  too  there   s littl disagr about that   but i think some of you are be a littl too hawkish on the top side   there   s an old experi that i learn about in graduat school from   ruggl  who use to be a professor at yale   offer somebodi         and the choic of order from a catalog of all good and servic made this year or five year ago  and take a poll on which option they vote for   tri it   you all give talk to chamber of commerc and so forth  i   ve been do it for year  and peopl will consist vote for the current menu   obvious  this experi has to be done at a much higher level of scientif rigor   but i think in the util sens  even core pce rate as high as   percent may be more or less consist with price stabil  given the great difficulti we have in deal with technolog chang in price index  on the rang or point issu  i think   rais a good point about the point  and this is the way i take her point    laughter   let   s say the point is   percent  and the inflat rate goe from     to     to     to     percent   that won   t be a huge issu and we might not have to explain that   but i have to come back to the fact that when i think about inflat  i actual do think in term of rang  i   m prepar to believ that inflat will fluctuat within a zone  and i   m not go to worri in that rang   so i   m a littl more comfort with set a rang or zone than i am a point  it will requir occasion explan when inflat get out of the zone  but i think that we ought to be prepar to do that   if it   get out of the zone  we ought to be abl   think among ourselv   to say whi that is   so  i guess i don   t find that too cost  in term of how we do this  i would definit take a low key approach   i think we   d want to be clear that this is part of a broader agenda   we have our dual mandat  and we feel that if we make it clear what our inflationari anchor is  we can actual fight unemploy better   this wouldn   t come with lot of discuss and i wouldn   t make a big deal of it   it would be about as babyish a    step as we could possibl imagin   i actual like the paragraph that ben wrote  so someth like that might be a good start  should we consult with congress   yes  we would have to consult with congress   and there is a risk in consult with congress becaus their first question is go to be     well  are you go to set a rang for unemploy      the staff dealt with that issu in their document and found that do so actual risk make fundament macroeconom mistak   so  i would not want to be forc to set a rang for unemploy   and we would face that risk   at the same  e  if we   re go to do someth like this  i think we do have to tell congress about it   but open up the feder reserv act   no way   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   to start  as i   ve told a few of you  i   m struck by how easili one move in this committe from be a brash    young turk    to be part of the    old guard      so  as a former young turk and now a member of the old guard  i will speak for the status quo  you   ve rais a number of question  and other have too   the first one  obvious  is     one believ in the core mission of price stabil   by definit  i take the easi answer of    yes      i would note that we   ve gone around this tabl and  as you and other have point out  there is no one who  after mani year of experi  would say anyth other than    yes      to me that   s extraordinarili import  becaus one of the reason that peopl get excit about this question of inflat target   or what has now been redefin by our staff as adopt a quantit price object   is some anxieti that peopl in this room will    use or lose    some of their histor memori   but i am firm of the belief that whatev may happen go forward  and whoever may sit in whichev chair in this room  the experi that we   ve had in the past    plus year has creat on this committe a strong sens of price stabil as a key element of our respons  and that  i think  is a bedrock that we shouldn   t ignor     now let me turn to some of the question that have been put on the tabl   first  how   one defin price stabil   the staff has done a veri  veri good job in mani way  but i think they   ve given us a littl fals dilemma on how to defin price stabil   i actual tri to defin it both way   both qualit and quantit   the qualit definit is  it  sn   t seem to be affect the way household behav   you put that definit on the tabl  mr  chairman  and i think that is not irrelev to us   second  like everyon els  i   ve learn in the  e that i   ve been here that perhap the core pce at this stage is the better index  but that   s not to say that in five year we won   t go offici to a chain cpi and that may becom the better index   so  at this stage  core pce seem to me slight better in term of how one think about inflat  should the object be in term of the rate of inflat   i think the argument there is pretti clear   on the point es  versus rang  i think    as alway  with her background  has note a number of reason whi a point es  might be use   on the other hand   again  learn from  experi   i end up where ned   was  in that i believ it   s probabl wiser to think of this in a rang   now  have said that  then we get to the staff   s point that if we announc a rang as a zone of indiffer  in some sens there   s a question of what we have ad to what the public alreadi know  that bring me to my third point  which is  do we need to have  in addit to this intern discuss  a broad extern discuss   and here i start where gari  n start but end up in a differ place   gari ask the question  in some sens     is it broken      and my answer is     no  it   s not broken      i think most observ of this committe would recogn the bottom end of our rang as   percent becaus we   ve been veri clear about it   i believ mani would say that they   re not sure where the upper end is but that it   s probabl in the   to     percent area   as i listen to our discuss  i think that is  in fact  not far off   so  in term of anchor expect or communic our view  somehow or anoth we   ve manag to do that  broad speak   so  i don   t think we need to push further on this element     now  let me proceed to the question of announc a target   i   ve notic that a number of peopl did think that we   d want to announc somehow this veri soft price object   and i  in my  role now as a member of the old guard would rais a number of cautionari question that i believ we should consid at some point   if not today  mayb later   first  if we do proceed and we announc that the committe defin price stabil on  let   s say  core pce in a veri tight rang  i   d view that as the begin of a soft inflat target regim   and i believ it would be unwis for us to think that we can stop there   i believ it would be the begin of a slipperi slope   there would then be a number of question we   d have to answer  go forward  that i haven   t heard fulli flesh out today  though some have come up   so let me just put them forward  one  obvious  is the numer object for maximum sustain growth   i think we actual have in this room right now a soft view of what we believ potenti is   i   m not sure that we   ll agre on that same number a few year from now   we have been quit cautious about give an es  of potenti   give at most a soft rang   know the uncertainti involv in measur maximum sustain growth and  therefor  measur the output gap   we   ve also learn from the work of athanasio orphanid how danger it could be to tri to use real  e es  of the output gap as a guid toward inflat or toward policymak   so there   s anoth reason whi we   ve been a littl cautious in that regard   but if we decid that we want to announc even a general quantit target for inflat or a quantit rang   i prefer not to use the word    target      i think we would be forc to explain how that view about inflat is or is not consist with achiev maximum econom growth  i   d say the same thing about unemploy   yes  there are a number of reason that   has talk about that would explain whi it would be unwis for us to tri to be too explicit about what we consid to be full employ   on the other hand  the concept of the nairu  non  acceler inflat rate of unemploy  is veri much out there   there are peopl in this room  who  in the period sinc i   ve been here  swore that the nairu was     percent   those peopl  two month later  also would have sworn that it was     percent   so  i think the evid suggest that if    we   re go to tri to quantifi one element of our mandat  we   ve got to be veri  veri firm in our abil to explain whi we haven   t quantifi the other element  the second question that would emerg  if we go down this path of quiet whisper a numer goal or object  is  what are we go to do if inflat is outsid the rang   and i think on that point we   d face a number of question   how quick are we go to move   are the edg around that rang hard or soft   what exact   it mean when we say that   s how we defin price stabil   are we go to move aggress if we   re outsid the rang   we will give that famous economist   s answer     it depend      are we then go to get the third question      whi don   t you give a forecast of inflat that realli mean someth  as oppos to what you do now      well  then we   d have to explain that  don kohn  i think  rais a veri import issu   i don   t think we can quiet do this without go to congress and the administr   as i read the inform from countri oversea  in almost everi case the govern had a role in establish an inflat object   and i agre with what other have said  as soon as we go down this path  we are go to be confront with question from the more astut member of congress  and then  final  i think the question will come up     what is the problem      it   s a littl hard to say exact what the problem is right now   i think cathi appropri point out what a number of us have said mani  e  which is that inflat target is not inher a bad concept  it has work veri well in a number of economi   it just happen that it may not be the right concept here  so i would be proud in defens of the status quo   i do think there are some thing we can do to improv our communic   a number of us have suggest that look at the committe   s behavior give a general sens of what we find to be accept   we can augment that by talk about our individu view   and i hope it  sn   t occur  but there may be  e when we will need to talk about an unaccept pickup in inflat  along the line of what we did in anchor the    bottom end   so  i think some opportun to explain our intent have present themselv and we   ve shown that we can use them  final  be part of the old guard  let me just leav  for the consider of those who want to make chang  this thought   you may end up be right in the long term  but i would be veri cautious about move too quick today unless you   ve answer at least half of the question that i and other peopl have rais   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   on this issu  while my tenur is much shorter than your and other around the tabl  i   m go to argu that i   m realli in the    status quo improv    camp today   some of my reason are similar to those alreadi mention  but i want to throw a coupl of other reason on the tabl for come to this perspect  first  when i look overal at the question of be public about some kind of inflat object  i felt veri strong about a point that presid   mention  too  name  that when you announc a target  veri often you are tri to chang expect   so that announc effect  in and of itself  is most use in the extrem   whether inflat is too low or too high   becaus you want to disanchor expect   that   s what happen in the late      s   the anchor expect was for build inflat  so it was import to come in with the shock effect  as the fed did in       to say     look  we   re go to wake you up   we don   t want the status quo  we want to chang thing      but we   re not in that posit today   we   re in a posit where inflat is in a rang that most of us around the tabl are veri comfort with  when i think further about how we would use this approach  i get into the issu of how to defin the object i would set and the issu of a point es  versus a rang   on the latter  i come down to a point es   but from a differ perspect from some other   first of all  as a central bank we have to be care about our credibl   if we set an object  the market expect us to meet that object   and if we use a rang  we   re sort of caught   if the rang is too wide   and i think   percentag point is too wide   we get into this issu of whether it is a rang of    indiffer   i think   percent inflat and   percent inflat   which are the extrem i   ve heard   would provok a differ respons  depend on the economi at that point   on the other hand  if we narrow that band  then there   s a much higher risk of fall outsid of it  and that affect our credibl   so we   d have to amplifi our announc by various qualifi statement  and that make me uncomfort  but the other reason i   m uncomfort about set a rang for this object   i   m put on my risk manag hat  base on some of the debat we   ve had as we look at risk manag at bank and basel ii and rate agenc   relat to the issu of whether this is the inflat object for today or through the cycl   in other word  if we were sit in a period like             when the economi was slow and we   d just had a terrorist attack  i think my object in term of inflat would be veri differ from   to use the exampl michael gave   a period when inflat was run   percent for three year in a row and unemploy was sit at     percent  that   s an import distinct  and it get to our dual mandat and think about the tradeoff between the two goal   quantifi one leg of this mandat and not the other creat difficulti   to me  if we went to a point es   at least we could say  for exampl  that given the slack in the economi  we are comfort below that object at this point in  e   or  if we were worri about pressur build up becaus of the scarciti of resourc  we could say that we would not be comfort if inflat were abov that object   it give us an abil to express our opinion a littl differ   so  i think that is someth that we realli need to discuss a littl bit  i also am veri troubl by a coupl of suggest   i thought the staff paper was great becaus it got me think about these issu   about communic too mani object  too mani index  and too mani  e frame   i don   t have confid that i can sit here today and say where inflat is go to be three year out  or what the object should be  for the reason i   ve mention   i don   t know what the tradeoff will be at that point in  e   so  if we   re go to do    someth  an intermedi  e frame of a coupl year i think is suffici  that   s how long monetari polici is lag   go beyond that would make me veri  veri uncomfort  the last point i would make is that when we look at the way the staff laid out the issu  there are a lot of way we can improv exist communic   mayb we should be pursu these avenu while we flesh out some of these issu that mani of you around the tabl have rais  at the end of the day  speak in plain english about what   s go on today and let the market know where we   re go is what matter   it   s not just the price object that the market is look for but inform about what our action are like to be   i think they go hand in hand   so i think we need to consid this as part of a communic strategi and not in isol
thank you  mr  chairman   if i may speak initi to the first question regard my attitud toward inflat in general   and i learn about the ravag of inflat as a banker when i saw peopl   s net worth disappear and collater valu disappear   i have a strong anti inflat bias   and i came into this job believ that i would be an inflat hawk   when i got here  i discov that i was pretti much in the center   not becaus my view had chang but becaus the center of graviti was more hawkish on inflat than i thought it might be   and that was both befor and after presid broaddus was a member of the fomc    laughter  come back to ben   s open  i believ i may be around the median on this   i have describ myself as both open and skeptic on this question of inflat target  but i   d like to speak to the skeptic part becaus it relat more to my background and experi in look at public polici issu   as for the congression mandat that we have  sever of you have comment about the need to go back and talk to the congress  and i agre with that   but i also agre that we could probabl identifi a numer target consist with today   s law  let me give this perspect   the mandat that we have in the law of achiev both maximum econom perform over  e and price stabil is a veri concis goal   first  it is veri clear state and  second  it is appropri public polici   a uniqu combin   third  it is also    respect both by the capit market and the general public   and that import symbiot relationship among those three group cannot  in my view  be underes    there is no way  i think  that we could add a price compon   a specif articul to ani one of those part    without invit a debat as to the appropri of that number  to illustr  let me just repeat a coupl of experi that i had  and that susan share with me  when we went through our confirm process   at that  e  at least one member of the senat inform us that if they open up the feder reserv act  he would want a mandat that zero inflat ought to be in the law   this was the year       and at least one member   and mayb two   of the fomc at that point would have agre with him that the mandat should be zero inflat   and it could have been in the law   dure our hear  which was light repres by member of the senat  one of the veri import and influenti member nonetheless went out of his way to remind us of the import of the second part of the mandat   maximum econom perform over  e   so  i think if we tinker with ani element of the congression mandat  we would do so at our potenti peril   there ought to be an import reason for move that way  if we choos to do so  furthermor  in ani of our communic  becaus of the fact that we are watch so care  i can   t imagin that we could express ourselv or express the view of this committe without make refer everi singl  e to the target  whether it was a long term or a short term  target   and i think it would invit perhap more question than it would provid answer for  now  that   s the skeptic part   i am open on the issu becaus  as i hear repres of other central bank around the world speak to it  they speak in veri posit term   so  i think there   s good reason to be open   the second reason i   m open is becaus i have great respect for the judgment of mani of you who have spoken in favor of inflat target and for the scholarship that you   ve put into examin this issu   but  at the moment  if we simpli look at our congression mandat  i don   t think there is a unit within the feder govern that enjoy the accept that    we have of our mandat   and i think that goe a long way toward provid us with the independ that we   ve enjoy   thank you
thank you   i think anybodi who look at u s  monetari polici today and in the recent past would have to be impress with what this committe has achiev   and i can   t realli imagin ani other regim under which i   d rather live and have to make polici   there are two aspect of our current regim that give me some discomfort   one is that i   m a littl troubl by the concern that exist  not just around this tabl but more broad  that there is an undesir degre of ambigu in our communic to the public regard our object for and our definit of price stabil   i am uncomfort with the extent to which the peopl who actual think about and make polici believ there is some ambigu in how we defin our price stabil object   the other piec of our regim that give me a littl discomfort is how we think about the forecast and how we explain at each meet the basi for our decis  i think it is worth invest  e and effort in think through those two attribut of our regim   which are the two thing that in my view distinguish us from most other credibl central bank in serious countri   in term of whether we can do somewhat better than we do now and how to do that   and i  for one  would prefer to invest  e think this through while this chairman sit in that chair than i would defer further consider of these question until some more remot  e in the futur  i do think that the issu on the tabl  even though it   s present in a veri qualifi soft form  would amount to a chang in the regim   i don   t realli think one can think about the merit   and in my view most of you address the merit appropri   without a chang in regim   to me this would be   just to invok an awkward metaphor   a regim chang of choic  not a regim chang of necess   and  as in the case of war  those are the kind of decis that we should make cautious and onli after consid veri care the full implic of the chang and how we would live within and oper in that regim   and i don   t believ we   re in a posit at the moment    to make that kind of judgment about a regim chang  despit the fact that there   s a fair degre of consensus around the committe on mani of the question that were rais  i am uncomfort with ani chang that would requir us to seek the consent or explicit approv of the administr or the congress  even if it didn   t requir a chang in legisl   my gut feel is that there are huge risk for us in that process and that it would be damag to our credibl and damag to the independ of this institut   so i would take that step with great reluct  i would also want to consid veri care the implic of this chang in regim for how we communic about monetari polici  and i do not believ that our communic polici  as it now stand  is up to that challeng   we would have to adjust our communic in some way  and i think it would take a lot of care work to decid how we should talk about monetari polici in this new world   we should discuss fulli the attribut of the communic process we would use in connect with this chang befor we actual do it  i would want to be veri comfort that there is a veri strong consensus   it may requir unanim   of the committe about all of the import attribut of this basic regim and what they mean   on all the question rais by   i think we   d want to have a veri high degre of consensus   befor we launch a new approach  we   d want to know that we agre on what is a credibl or op  way to proceed   i   m not sure we know what that is   but if there is an op  way to do this  i   d want to know that the consensus is go to be close to that befor i move  the question that have been rais   how we talk about the  e horizon  how we resolv the debat about zone versus point  how we think about where to set the upper end of the zone if it is a zone  and what our toler is for deviat from the upper or the lower end of the zone for long period of  e   are the sort of question that we have to think through care and about which we need a fair degre of comfort that we have a common understand of what our answer mean for monetari polici befor we launch a new regim     let me just end with a somewhat awkward point  which relat to the success process  we are go to have a new chairman in the not too distant futur   even if there were unanim around this tabl that we should go this rout  i don   t think it is a decis we should make at this  e   i do not believ it would be fair to the chairman   s successor to bequeath to him or her this chang in regim   i say that in part becaus it   s appropri defer to the successor  but also becaus oper within this regim   which i think is the equival of a soft  flexibl  inflat target regim   may be difficult to do   it will put a much greater burden on communic   the challeng of how to explain monetari polici in this context will increas   let   s ask ourselv whether we would be take a step that would be benefici to the chairman   s successor in forc that person to oper at the begin with a much greater burden of communic   in that context  i think move forward at this  e may not actual help the credibl of monetari polici and may hurt it   i think it would be a challeng that would test the compet of ani plausibl successor  and it would take a fair amount of  e for anybodi to be comfort oper in that regim  so  i   m in a slight awkward posit  in the sens that i think there is a lot of merit in explor an evolut in the u s  monetari polici regim and our communic regim around these two dimens which now distinguish us from other model out there   i think the argument in favor of move in this direct are reason compel and have a lot of merit   but i don   t believ that it would be prudent to move in that direct now  without a much more care and thought deliber   so i would encourag us to use the next six month  year  or perhap eighteen month to think through the implic of live within a regim like the one be consid  rather than put this in a littl box and come back to it a decad from now  which is in some sens what we   ve done sinc        thank you  mr  chairman
presid pool want to say a final word
thank you  mr  chairman   i spoke veri briefli earlier and made just a few short comment   i have three point i want to make   vice chairman   has rais one of    them   i believ this issu about success   which i think you can argu either way  but i don   t intend to argu it one way or the other   is import   the new chairman might want to put his or her stamp on this issu of inflat target and communic   so that   s someth we should be clear about  as for point versus rang  i think in principl the long run averag should be a point or a veri narrow rang   there should be a broader rang for the year by year number on the short run   it   make a differ in the long run  howev  whether the averag inflat rate is     or      that   s     basi point and that is quantit signific   if there were ani quick transit of expect from one to the other  it would be a sourc of disturb   so i think that rang ought to be narrow   there are various way we could narrow it  but i think a rang of     basi point is troublesom  last  i think there   s a way of show proper defer to the congress on this and make some progress   we could note the fact that the cbo   s  congression budget offic  econom assumpt  which underli the budget  includ a cpi forecast of     percent in the out year   i think it has just been reduc to     percent  it had been at       i think we could say that our expect and our polici direct are intend to be fulli consist with that long term outlook  we could say that without get ourselv tangl up into precis what price index we   re talk about   so  we could note that the congression budget offic  an agenc of congress  has this rate of inflat under all of the long term budget project
thank you  everybodi   this has been an extraordinarili interest convers   let me tell you where i come out on this issu   i   ve been veri surpris and extraordinarili pleas with our abil over the past sever year to get accept of the notion that price stabil is a necessari condit for maximum sustain econom growth   this is not the way the congress think  this is not the way the media think   i don   t think this is the way the congress and the media are go to think in the futur     i   m quit fear  as a number of you have been  about rais an issu here which is latent  so long as we   ve kept it somewhat academ and not threaten  i think it has turn out to be all right   if we rais this issu about a numer  price relat object  i think we have to go up to the congress   and befor we do  peopl ought to go back and read the feder reserv act  which is what congress is go to look at in term of the mandat they place on us   we have to go back up to the congress  and we will subject ourselv to lose this soft agreement that we now have regard our price stabil object becaus everyon is go to want to get into the act  michell smith just gave me a press releas from the offic of jim saxton  a republican from new jersey   it say     the feder reserv report will address the issu of inflat target in it discuss on monetari polici  which will be held today      mr  saxton is support of construct inflat target   if we open this up in the hous of repres in the financi servic committe  i am tell you the reaction will be noisi   and i   m fear that we will open ourselv up to all sort of recommend   i don   t know whether we   ll succeed or fail  i   m  mere say that the gain we can get from move in the direct a number of you would like to move  i think  are modest  at best   but i don   t know that   i don   t think anyon can realli know the answer to the question of how good inflat target is  has been  or is go to be  until we actual get a test with inflat go up and we observ the differ between economi that have inflat target and those that don   t  now  all of us around the tabl have opinion on this issu   regrett  none of us has irrefut fact   and the reason is that there just haven   t been ani fact that give us the cut edg of a conclus   but that has not subdu the statement that we make   for exampl  bill pool was make statement and i was question where is the evid   obvious  bill has been around for a long period of  e and he has veri well consid view   if we were to dismemb his intellect  we would find the reason whi he said what he said   but with all of us  this has to be a veri complex process     my real concern is more technic than polit  although the polit issu bother me a great deal   i don   t see how we can defin a specif number for price stabil  without be in a posit where somebodi will say when that number is not be adher to     well  what are you go to do about it      and i believ we will have a consider problem with that  and the reason is that inflat target presuppos an abil to forecast  which i don   t think ani of us has  or can have   take the spring of       when we were sit there with a signific acceler in core inflat   with a target rang for inflat  conceiv we would have breach one of the limit of the target rang   and the question would have automat arisen     well  what are we go to do about this      my answer would have been   and inde at the  e was      noth      the reason was that i view the rise in price as wholli the consequ of a rise in profit margin   but that rise in profit margin was suffici quick to result in a project of core final good price that would be abov ani reason target we   ve been discuss today  the point is this   that was a particular case where we knew that unit cost were not move and that the rise in inflat was wholli a mechan result of a one shot event  which couldn   t continu unless unit cost start to acceler   we luck out   that was a veri rare event where the data were veri clear   the vast major of exampl we   re go to run into  if we go to inflat target  will be case where sudden price inflat is at the outer edg of the target   or inde  has actual breach it   and other evid on the under trend in inflat is not clear   we might have evid that vagu suggest that the labor market are eas   let   s say that initi claim have also gone up a bit   and there are contradictori notion in retail market  now  one of the thing that we alway forget  look back  is how littl we knew at the  e thing were occur or about to occur   when i read the transcript of earlier meet  i am  surpris  becaus i thought we were realli knowledg about what was go to happen  someth happen and i say to myself     well  we got that right  our forecast were terrif and our insight were great      when i go back and read the transcript  i find that it just isn   t so   there   s a great degre of vagu   go back and read the octob      transcript   in retrospect  we saw    that as a  e when an extraordinarili courag feder reserv was come to grip with a veri difficult problem  with great and unequivoc foresight   i found read those transcript terribl discourag   my view of the extraordinari institut of which we are all a part fell about    percent becaus some of the comment be utter around this tabl were nonsens   the chang in polici undertaken at that  e turn out to be  in retrospect  one of the most extraordinarili import thing the feder reserv has ever done   if you go from octob      and read the transcript from that  e on  you will see how littl everybodi knew or thought they knew  and it would chang your opinion about a lot of thing   i don   t wish to downgrad the import of the action taken   they were veri tough and they were the right action   but to presum that there was great intellectu control over what was go on is complet undercut by read the contemporan transcript   that   s just the way we are   we have a recollect of what we did which is  unfortun  fiction  i   ve been in this busi for too long   in      i had a forecast for the steel product rate  i had pick up  analyt  a big inventori accumul in steel  which nobodi els had  and that seem to be a harbing for the      crash in the steel market   i thought that i was just terrif  and i said to everyon i talk to     you know  we realli got it just right      then one day i went back and took a look at the actual steel forecast that my firm had made in the spring of        inde  we had the inventori accumul   inde  we had the liquid   but wherea the ingot rate went from     to    in the real world  our forecast was      that   s what happen to you  the reason i want to make this point is that i believ it is veri tough to implement an inflat target system without far greater knowledg than we have   i don   t see how we can be veri explicit in go with this type of approach without go to the next step   i don   t know how we stop by just make an offici target   i think we   re do fine when we all talk the way we have been talk   we all give our own individu opinion  which are turn out to be fair close   i don   t know a singl person around this room whose inflat rang i would disagre with  and i think we   re do just fine     let me suggest  howev  that befor we move on step one we go to the final step   let   s go around this room and discuss how we are go to implement inflat target under various potenti scenario   not where polici is  but what will we do   i suggest that becaus for this type of discuss what we need is for the staff to set in front of us the actual fact at a point when the inflat rate is right on our target  and then give us about    exampl of the data we might have at that  e   includ the anecdot report and inform about whether previous publish data were revis or not   and tri to simul the real world   i will tell you that we   re not go to know whether to move the fund rate up or down in a good number of these case   we know the appropri polici respons onli in retrospect  i think it   s import to move forward on examin this issu becaus we are liter split       on whether to move toward adopt a numer price relat object or not   we cannot have a       split  as far as i   m concern  without carri the discuss further   therefor  i think we ought to set up anoth meet in which to pursu this discuss   the subject matter will essenti involv the staff provid various scenario  as i describ   let   s assum that we are on a slope and that we announc that we are go to inflat target   i will bet polit that there is a veri high probabl that that will happen   i don   t see how we can avoid it   and when somebodi say to us     you have a target rang of   to   percent  and inflat is now at     percent  whi aren   t you move     we won   t have an answer for that   but we have to have an answer   i think the answer is the same one we would give if we had no offici inflat target   so  what i would suggest  unless i hear reaction to the contrari  is to have anoth roundtabl   let   s have anoth session on this whole issu   we have plenti of  e   as the vice chair say  noth is run away from us   we   re not go to chang polici in the short run   we have a lot of  e to make judgment  i   m wholli in favor of do the best we can for my successor becaus i must say that paul volcker gave me a platform which made my job veri easi   i didn   t have to come in  as he did  with the chao of        he had broken the back of inflat  irrespect of the fact that the fomc    member didn   t necessarili know what they were do    laughter   the polici chang paul propos when he came back   i think it was from hungari   and organ a special meet of the fomc  was the right one   the meet may have been incoher  but what they did at that meet was right  and they stuck with it   they didn   t back down  i rememb a meet in       when i came down here to washington   i was in the privat sector   and the mexican situat was begin to brew at that  e   i   ve forgotten exact what the date were  but paul was be pillori for hang on   he did  and it was the right thing to do  but it took an extraordinari amount of forecast capabl  which neither he nor i had   he just had more gut than i did at that particular  e   there   s a lot more to this busi  i think  than just the number we   re look at   so i suggest that we tri to creat the real world befor we step off into a differ approach to our object of achiev price stabil  unless somebodi has object  is it okay to go ahead in this direct   okay  good   we   ll work on the schedul   but what i think we need from the staff are some real life exampl  i   m  will to help out becaus i can rememb a number of occas when what actual happen in the real world would not have been deem a like outcom base on the data we had in hand  that includ a wonder experi i had in the fall of      when i came here to washington and said that there was no inventori accumul and  therefor  we would not be subject to a sever contract in        two week later the depart of commerc revis all of it number  laughter   and we had a huge inventori problem  let   s turn to dino for his report

view     and i will both have more to say about oil price   and  as   will discuss  the staff expect the foreign exchang valu of the dollar to drift down   as for asset valu  stock price are assum to rise     percent this year and next  which would rough maintain risk adjust pariti with the yield on long term bond  while the rate of increas in hous price is expect to slow consider from last year   s torrid pace   as shown in the bottom panel  real gdp is project to rise at a    percent rate  on averag  over the project period  about half a percentag point fa  than our es  of potenti gdp growth

howev  the downdrift in household net worth relat to incom that we project in the baselin forecast  and depict by the black line in the middl left panel  impart a slight drag on spend  in addit  the strength of consum spend last year push the save rate  not shown  to an unusu low level  and  as a consequ  consum spend also is expect to be restrain a bit dure the forecast period by a desir on the part of household to rebuild save   one risk to the forecast that we discuss in the  book is the possibl of a real estat slump   in the  book altern simul  depict by the red line in the middl right panel  we assum that hous price fall a littl more than    percent cumul over the next two year  leav the level    percent below the baselin   such an outcom  especi if accompani by a drop in consum

sourc of growth in this sector  reflect an ongo need by firm to replac and upgrad their equip and softwar   spend on non high tech equip  the blue bar  grew brisk in       spur  in part  we think by partial expens   after the anticip    pothol    in the first quarter of this year  we expect that real outlay for non high tech equip will increas at around a     percent rate   rough in line with their    longer run averag   demand is support  in part  by a shrink margin of unus capac over the next two year  as depict in the panel to the right   howev  as shown in the middl left panel  the rate of return on capit is project to ebb over the next two year  which temper our forecast slight   we interpret the result of the special question on capit spend ask by the staff at the reserv bank   summar in the tabl to the right   as be broad consist with our view that this will be a pretti good year  on balanc  for busi equip invest  although probabl not quit as brisk as in        the usual acceler effect were the primari reason given by survey respond for boost capit spend this year  addit  a sizabl fraction of respond point to replac need as an import consider   the remaind of the chart highlight two of the risk to the forecast for equip spend   an upsid risk that we highlight in the  book is the possibl that we have been wrong about the effect of partial expens   if so  the altern simul of frb us  shown by the blue bar in the lower left panel  suggest that equip and softwar spend could increas consider fa  than in the baselin   one downsid risk to the forecast for high tech equip  which governor   note in a speech recent  is the possibl that the pace of technic advanc in comput is slow   as you know  the speed at which qualiti adjust comput price fall is a rough indic of the pace of technolog progress for that equip   the constant qualiti price index for desktop comput that we use for construct industri product is shown in the lower right panel  the price

  for instanc  intel design better chip to go insid the box   as you can see from the red portion of the bar  this decomposit suggest that the rate of technolog improv for comput has slow appreci   a further slow in the pace of innov go forward would impli less spend for upgrad than is implicit in our forecast   howev  recent announc by intel and amd regard introduct schedul for their next generat chip give a hint that a return to a fa  pace of technolog improv may be in train   if this speed up in plan improv to semiconductor is  in fact  realiz  that should translat into fa  technolog progress for comput   sandi will now continu our present
your next chart present the outlook for the labor market   with real gdp project to grow at slight abov it potenti pace  we expect nonfarm payrol  the upper left panel  to expand at an averag pace of about         per month through        as you can see  that pace is a bit abov the rate of    job creation last year   busi report have becom convinc that the econom expans is on a solid foot  and we

attract worker back into the labor forc   as shown in the middl right panel  the labor forc particip rate is project to move up over the project period after the larg declin of recent year   howev  the progress here is onli modest  and the particip rate remain below it es  trend   the combin of abov trend econom growth and rise particip rate is suffici in our forecast to keep the unemploy rate

although we have heard anecdot of shortag of some type of skill worker  suffici slack evid remain in the labor market to put downward pressur on the growth of compens in the aggreg   given these new data  we would be inclin to shave a coupl of tenth off of our compens forecast   we expect the growth in compens to remain at about it      rate  the line in the upper panel    one year ahead inflat expect  shown in the    middl left  have drift upward slight in respons to the increas in energi price  and we expect this to be reflect in wage demand this year   in addit  the lag effect of the acceler in structur labor product also should result in somewhat larger gain in compens   moreov  the depress effect of labor market slack  shown in the middl right panel  is project to diminish over the project period   these forc are manifest in our project of a somewhat fa  rate of increas in the growth of wage  shown on the lower left   but this is offset by slower growth in benefit   this

core good  line    should slow near   percentag point  in part the result of the expir of the partial expens tax provis  which had creat an incent to import capit good in        past dollar depreci lessen growth of core import volum as well   real import growth should rebound somewhat in       as growth of core import respond to the subdu pace of project inflat in import price   the bar in the middl left panel translat export and import growth into contribut to u s  gdp growth   the posit contribut from export is expect to outweigh temporarili the negat one from import dure the first half of this year  thereaft  on balanc  import will subtract about one third percentag point more from gdp growth than is contribut by export growth   the u s  nomin trade and current account balanc are shown to the right  despit the sizabl declin in the dollar sinc it peak in earli       the u s  nomin trade deficit widen by slight more than      billion from the first quarter of      through the fourth quarter of last year  as deficit enhanc factor more than offset the benefici effect of dollar depreci   to be sure  had the dollar not depreci  the deficit would have widen even more   in the  book baselin forecast  we project veri limit further dollar depreci and an addit     billion increas in the trade deficit through the fourth quarter of        unfortun  i have to report that  by the standard of a reduc trade deficit  u s  extern    adjust will not even have start by the end of the forecast period if the  book forecast is realiz   in      and      the project current account

for the trade deficit in the fourth quarter of      to be about unchang from that es  for the fourth quarter of last year   the dollar path need to produc that outcom  shown in red in the bottom left panel  is one that declin at an averag annual rate of    percent   the panel to the right report consequ of the weaker dollar path for the trade balanc and the current account balanc   by construct  in the altern of a weaker dollar  the chang in the trade balanc over the forecast period is about zero   howev  the current account balanc nonetheless continu to deterior   in fact  the weaker dollar improv the current account deficit by less than the improv in the trade balanc  primarili becaus higher interest rate  which the model generat as it use a taylor rule to guid monetari polici  result in even greater declin in net invest incom   this simul suggest that even were the dollar to depreci quit sharpli  it is like that over the forecast period the trade deficit would remain near it current size and the current account deficit would widen further   sandi will now conclud our present
the final chart present your econom project for      and        as shown in the upper panel  the central tendenc of your forecast for real gdp this year is    to   percent   the unemploy rate is project to be    percent  while the central tendenc for core pce inflat is     to    percent   as indic in the lower panel  you expect real gdp growth to slow to     percent in      and the unemploy rate to fall to between   percent and    percent   for core inflat in       the central tendenc remain at     to    percent   mr  chairman  that complet our present
do you have a forecast of current account balanc for the  world  includ the discrep
i do   do you want me to give you some figur
i   d actual like to see the whole tabl     it have data for  individu countri
we have sever tabl that cover all of the countri we forecast and then we have the global
could somebodi just bring it around to me rather than have you read it   other question for our colleagu   presid
i was a littl surpris at the forecast of no declin in the valu of the dollar   your altern simul seem as though it   s relat close to what we   ve experienc sinc        you had mention that the dollar is down    percent sinc the peak in        that   s rough three year  and that   s not terribl differ from    percent at an annual pace  which is what i understood you to say in talk about the simul   mayb i understood you wrong
no  no   you might think of our  book forecast for the dollar as a technic assumpt   we have adopt a    random walk    frame of mind when it come to forecast the dollar  base on two thing   first of all  the research that we ourselv have done in the articl that member of the board staff have written show that a random walk assumpt outperform ani structur model over long period of  e   moreov  the profess has engag for year in tri to forecast the dollar   and the random walk   that is  no chang from today   in a statist sens outperform on averag ani of the altern that have been suggest   one possibl  an altern assumpt  might be to go with the impli futur rate that come out of trade   but those rate have been shown to be particular bad forecast   so there   s no real empir support for make that altern choic   we use to attempt to infer the consequ of what we knew   the    maintain    assumpt of the feder fund rate  so to speak   that was base on the view that we knew someth about the futur cours of polici that the market didn   t know  that is  we were condit the forecast on someth that the market didn   t necessarili know  and we thought we would sens other forc  if you will  at work   so we had a somewhat more activist forecast for mani year until we were wrong for such a long  e that we gave up  basic   it troubl me in some sens that our forecast suggest that import inflat will drop from  be a fair signific number to virtual noth   tomorrow   and will continu that way throughout the forecast period   that result is veri much affect by this maintain assumpt that    the dollar isn   t go to chang much more   so my explan is simpli that we tri to make that assumpt veri explicit to you   you understand that we have not taken a posit on chang in the valu of the dollar  which veri much determin our import price forecast   and we let it go at that  we do not take a posit on the dollar becaus our actual abil to tell you when the dollar is go to go up and when it is go to go down is just nonexist
so  depend on how one feel about the like path of the dollar  there is some definit sens of risk to the forecast associ with that
yes   but i would say that over ani short  e horizon  like the next two year  there   s as much upsid risk as downsid risk   the dollar rose substanti in the first half of        it rose in the earli part of this year   even though mani of us have argu at great length that there are reason to think that over  e the dollar has to go down  for ani period you care to name   for a year or even as long as two or three year   it could well go up befor it goe down
i have one further question   i   ve been surpris to read in some of the market public   the newslett from j p  morgan and so forth   that a number of market particip appear to be get more convinc  base on their read of the polit tea leav  that a move on the chines currenc is go to occur sooner rather than later   have we thought about the implic for this forecast if someth like that happen
we haven   t taken the step of  say  put that into an altern simul in the  book  which mayb we should do   but we have been think about the issu and what altern might be good   that is  effect and product   and what altern might be counterproduct   there was a  e about three week ago when the amount of chatter about the chines regim was veri elev   and there were some remark that came out of the meet in davo  just five day ago  that made it seem as if someth was immin   and then the talk would subsid and it would go quiet  do i think that noth is go to happen in this regard between now and the end of        person  my answer would be    no  i don   t      i think someth will happen befor that   but we    would have a veri hard  e specifi exact what will be done or when and put it in the baselin forecast
do you have a bigger than a bread box feel about how that will work
i could make it bigger than a bread box  depend on whether the rest of asia react in some explicit manner   i say that becaus the peg to the dollar is a devic for stabil exchang rate among the asian trade partner   so if china move in certain way  that might trigger a reaction on the part of it trade partner   but i could imagin some step that china might take that wouldn   t do that  now  i think we can  and probabl should  take a chanc and commit to write what we think those relationship are and what the implic might be   if all of the asian currenc move  i think you would see some consequ   if china revalu by   percent and peg again and nobodi els   anyth  i think it will be almost inconsequenti   it will be polit help to a varieti of peopl  but econom i don   t believ it will mean a lot   if china not onli move but also float   if it defin a band in which the currenc will fluctuat or goe to a weight averag or  in other word  introduc the potenti of movement go forward   and that trigger a compar decis on the part of other asian countri  it   s a differ stori   if the currenc of asian countri that now in one way or anoth stabil their exchang rate with china   s becom more flexibl vis  vis their bilater rate with the dollar  i think the implic could be greater
i guess i will commit to tri to do some sort of analysi of this issu or an altern simul in the next  book   i think that would be a help thing to do
mayb not on my say so alon
just as a deriv question  relat to chart         you were comment on the disappoint perform of export  and one of your stori was the rather    sharp downturn in export to    other asia      could you elabor on that a littl bit   is that  in your view  import or unimport affect by the chines peg to the dollar
i don   t know that i would link it to that particular   i think it is in part  but i can   t tell you how much  a result of the integr of trade   or reintegr of trade   that   s go on in asia  so that export that previous came to us from japan now pass through china for some final stage of process   there   s a sens in which the gain that china is make are come at the expens of other asian trade partner and are not of much signific   on the other hand  if the china and hong kong line had gone up at the same  e that this    other asia    line went down  i think i would have had to say that i shouldn   t show them separ but should add them  togeth or someth   but it did not  i   d point more to the high tech sector as a factor   in term of the risk to this global forecast  we have oil price  our basic standard risk   but the issu of whether the high tech sector is go through a temporari inventori lull and is go to rebound or not is the biggest question mark for the asian emerg market countri   i think that account for the falloff in trade at the end of last year   that is  the falloff in export more broad and in ip  industri product    i think that   s all wrap up in the high tech question
your simul of the effect of the    percent declin in the dollar includ the effect on foreign countri    incom from face a more appreci exchang rate
yes  we did that in our global model   and those countri   given that price in their currenc for the good they sell to the unit state go up becaus the dollar is depreci   actual earn some incom  which is then spent on u s  export   so in that sens it account for all the money that is spent on trade   it goe somewher  it feed back to the model
it also affect their import demand
yes  that   s what i   m say
that   s from the incom effect
yes   now  the model has the usual houthakk and mage asymmetri in it  but the move down of the dollar is veri s ul   in our model it would be a veri s ul shock to the unit state  and it would be a contractionari shock to almost all of our trade partner
the reason i ask is becaus your simul rais the question of whether the deriv is the right sign on the current account with respect to the dollar   given the effect that the fall dollar has on our interest rate and  therefor  on our capit incom payment  there seem to be so veri littl effect on the current account from the weaken dollar
right  but becaus of the interest rate effect   now  it   s possibl that the model  sn   t fulli captur valuat effect   in the direct invest account  the fact that the dollar is depreci mean that everi euro earn by a u s  subsidiari is now worth more dollar rather than the same number of dollar   so this current account effect may be too conserv   it   s possibl that the current account would improv more via that valuat effect than the model is fulli abl to captur
whi can   t you captur it   it seem like a straightforward
well  our peopl do their best  but the financi flow part of the model is less fulli articul than is the real side of the model
it   s not that you don   t have the data   you do
yes   it   s just a question of how mani equat   or how mani independ variabl   you can actual manag
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the stori from the seventh district is much the same as last  e   we   re see a broad base improv in busi condit   i would character it as solid growth  but not spectacular   most of the sector that were strong last year continu to do veri well and expect good result for        these includ steel  heavi truck     construct machineri  and commerci print   a number of firm in these industri have been abl to rais price without see a reduct in their order backlog   we   ve also heard some upbeat forward look report on commerci aircraft   and agricultur has been veri strong   farm  incom were up sharpli last year  and that has been support big gain in the sale of agricultur equip   we also saw the largest annual increas in district farmland valu in    year   on the other hand  the outlook for the big three automak  whose oper and those of their supplier are heavili concentr in our district  is not so good   most analyst expect light vehicl sale to be similar to last year  but the big three are concern about lose even more market share   and their profit outlook is not good  we continu to hear that they have signific cost disadvantag relat to the transplant   moreov  foreign namepl have built out their product line to the point where the big three face stiff competit in just about everi market segment   one result of the relat poor perform of the big three is that michigan now has the highest unemploy rate in the nation
you got to be first in someth    laughter
actual  illinoi is lead the big ten in basketbal    laughter   they are undef so far   on the price front  there   s more talk that higher cost for plastic and other energi relat input are work their way downstream  but we   re certain not hear widespread report of major price increas   with regard to labor market  the two larg temporari staf firm that we speak with regular continu to report rough    percent overal growth relat to a year ago  with demand for skill worker rise fastest   like us  they have been expect a period of more robust employ growth   but the further we get from the recess  the more they are becom resign to the idea that the growth rate we   ve seen over the last year may be as high as we   ll get in this cycl   the presid of one of the temp firm made an interest observ about the reluct of busi to hire   he said     everybodi still has a reason to be cautious  but late the    reason are industri specif      this is an improv from a year or so ago when mani firm report be worri about the strength of the overal economi   his observ pretti much match my impress   thing aren   t exact roar  but few busi regard the expans as fragil   turn to the nation outlook  onc again the data we   ve receiv sinc the last meet have not materi chang our outlook for        we continu to expect that output will expand at a rate somewhat abov potenti and that there will be littl chang in core inflat   i think the altern simul in the  book did a good job of lay out a number of the risk to the forecast   overal  i think these risk are balanc  the    higher long term interest rate    simul did give me some paus  especi becaus of the talk that foreign investor may be revis their think about u s  secur   but i remain concern about anoth risk that we talk about last  e  name  that  instead of some appreci slack remain in the economi  we may alreadi be essenti at potenti or approach potenti   this view was rais by some of the particip  albeit a minor  in the meet we had last week of our academ advisor and chicago area busi economist   when ask about the cours of polici go forward  there was a rough even split between those who thought that the path implicit in futur market was about right and those who thought we should be rais rate at a fa  pace   my own view is that we will probabl have to rais rate this year to level that are higher than those expect by futur market   as we all know  we will face communic challeng as the year proceed   it   s probabl not critic today  but it will becom more so as we move through the year
thank you  mr  chairman   the twelfth district economi continu to expand  post growth in line with that of the nation   consum spend remain strong  led by gain in travel  servic  retail good  and especi hous   busi have also been spend  and our contact expect to increas invest in come month      the weaker dollar continu to benefit district export who report boom demand for their product   although intern trade volum remain high  increas hire and around the  clock work schedul have clear out the backlog of ship at our port   some bottleneck remain in the ground transport network as a result of storm  mudslid  and infrastructur problem but these  too  are wane   turn to the nation economi  recent econom data have been encourag  rais my  confid that the expans has found a secur foot   the decemb employ report was by no mean spectacular  but it strengthen the impress that the labor market has firm establish a pattern of moder improv   in term of the outlook for the real economi  i   m general in agreement with the  book   but i think it   s import to emphas that this forecast  which call for growth onli moder abov potenti with a veri gradual diminut of the remain labor market slack  depend on a veri gradual pace of monetari tighten   the  book incorpor onli three more    basi point increas in the fund rate this year   moreov  even with this modest tighten  i consid the  book op ist in expect longer term interest rate to remain at their present level   in my judgment  the risk with respect to longer term yield is asymmetr   should longer term yield increas  growth could fall well short of the  book project  as shown in an altern simul   turn to inflat  the data receiv sinc our decemb meet  particular the cpi and the eci  have been favor   the forecast for a rise of about     percent in the core pce price index in      strike me as veri reason   we   re all awar of the sourc of risk in this outlook  includ the futur path of the dollar and oil price  the current high markup of price over unit labor cost  trend product growth  and  of cours  the degre of slack left in the economi   in decemb i argu that the risk to inflat from product develop were reason well balanc   i hold rough the same view on the risk eman from labor market slack and would like to focus the remaind of my comment on this issu      a consider bodi of research   most conduct within the feder reserv system   has examin the possibl that the last recess and recoveri were character by unusu larg structur shift  result in an except degre of mismatch in the labor market   if an unusu small fraction of the current unemploy are qualifi for exist or emerg job vacanc  the true degre of slack in the labor market is overst by measur unemploy   in effect  the nairu has risen   this possibl motiv one of the altern simul in the  book   at the aea  american econom associ  meet in philadelphia last month  i chair a session in which four team of fed economist subject this structur shift hypothesi to close scrutini   i emerg from this session a skeptic   i see this recent research as cast consider doubt on the hypothesi that the jobless recoveri was a period of pronounc econom restructur   in fact  the consensus of the session was that sector realloc has probabl been run at rough normal level for our dynam economi   the find of unusu larg sector shift is base on the behavior of sever nontradit measur of restructur   in contrast  such tradit measur as the dispers in industri employ growth rate reveal the last recess and jobless recoveri that follow to be a period of low  not high  sector realloc   the problem with tradit measur is that they may confound cyclic with sector chang   the altern restructur measur  howev  turn out not to be robust to minor chang in the  e period studi and the methodolog use   one sign that mismatch is not unusu high  at least dure the recoveri period  come from data on job creation and job destruct   in       for exampl  total job realloc   defin as the sum of job creation and destruct   stood at it lowest level in the last decad for which data are avail   anoth sign that mismatch is not especi high come from the beveridg curv relat unemploy and job vacanc   a shift out of the beveridg curv  signal higher level of vacanc coexist with ani given level of unemploy  would provid evid of increas mismatch   use a new measur of job vacanc that adjust for well known bias in help want advertis  staff at our bank  howev  found no evid of such an outward shift      if skill mismatch had intensifi  we might also expect to see diverg unemploy rate and compens path for worker of differ skill   howev  analysi by our staff show that sinc the onset of the recess  the unemploy path of less  and more educ worker have been similar  and the chang in compens growth for lower skill occup has been at least as rapid as for occup requir higher skill   these find align with report from our contact who tell us that for the most part they   re abl to hire worker at all skill level   even in market where worker are harder to find  our contact report littl differ in hire difficulti or compens growth by skill   with respect to the introduct of labor save technolog  our sens is that such innov are affect the entir skill distribut   for exampl  report from two of our contact  a lawyer and a farmer  illustr this point   we were told that the law firm had replac skill legal worker with softwar design to search for crimin evid in e mail file   the farm introduc machineri that reduc the number of field worker need to harvest row crop from     to     so  my bottom line is that i do not think the evid support the case that nairu has increas due to an unusu degre of mismatch in the job market   turn final to polici  i think it make sens to remov a bit more accommod at this meet  but i do think we   re reach a point where relat soon we will need to begin to slow this process down
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district continu to expand at a moder pace  but there is some variat across the three state of our district   lead indic are signal continu solid growth in new jersey and delawar but more modest growth in pennsylvania   payrol employ in our state grew at a    percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year  down from an unsustain strong pace earlier in the year  pennsylvania continu to have the slowest job growth and the highest unemploy rate among the three state in our district      our busi outlook survey indic a consider slower pace of expans in region manufactur in januari   the general activ  new order  and shipment index all fell to their lowest level in    month   this is someth to watch   the deterior is not just local in philadelphia   i note that new york   s manufactur survey also weaken in januari   at the same   e  it   s import to rememb that these are just one month read  and other indic in the januari survey are less negat   for exampl  current and futur employ index in our survey are near their highest level in the current expans   turn to futur capit spend in the district  we particip  as did the other district  in the board staff   s survey   our result are quit similar to the result for the nation as report in larri     s memo   on a relat topic  all of these result   in addit to the comment from  firm in our district over the past sever month   suggest that the expir of the partial  expens provis had a smaller impact on firm than is assum in the baselin  book forecast   turn to our econom intellig on other sector  there appear to be littl chang  consum continu to spend at a moder pace   holiday sale in the region general met expect for a good  if not spectacular  show   as was true in the nation  sale of luxuri item show the strongest perform  with year over year current dollar gain greater than    percent  most of the other retail report year over year increas of around   percent   as i report last month  nonresidenti construct in our region remain soft   the offic vacanc rate in the philadelphia metropolitan region has remain at about      percent sinc the end of       although we are see some net absorpt over the past year   the construct of two new offic tower will increas avail space signific  by about   percent   meanwhil  residenti construct has remain healthi  but it is down from it peak   hous appreci continu  especi on the new jersey shore  where price were up over    percent in the past year   in summari  the econom expans continu at a moder pace in the third district  and the outlook among busi contact in our region remain posit      my outlook for the nation is similar to that of the  book  with real growth averag about    percent over the next two year   like the  book  we expect consum spend to expand at about that pace as well   this consumpt forecast reflect our view that the current person save rate  despit it low level  is not like to lead to a reduct in household spend  as we all know and as was mention here today  the person save rate averag   percent last year   that compar to an averag sinc      of over   percent  there has been some concern express that consum will hold back on their spend as we withdraw monetari s ulus  but a philadelphia staff analysi cast consider doubt on this outcom   that studi point out sever factor that warrant our attent   first  measur person save exclud some invest  such as invest in human capit and capit gain  therefor underes  the true save rate   second  our real  e data seri show that person save rate have been revis upward systemat  tend to wipe out low measur save rate in the past   sinc       the mean revis has been about     percentag point   third  the perman incom hypothesi suggest that a low save rate may signal expect of fa  futur growth in labor incom   moreov  there is no signific empir evid that a low save rate forecast slower consumpt growth  while our forecast are similar to the  book   s with respect to consum spend and total gdp  there are some key differ   as i   ve alreadi mention  we expect less of an effect from the expir tax incent on busi invest   so we see stronger growth there  and our pattern of growth is smoother than in the baselin forecast in the  book   we also anticip a larg depreci in the dollar for reason we talk about today  that discuss was help to me in understand the  book forecast   thus  real net export do not make much of a negat or posit contribut to growth over the next year in our forecast   our larger depreci of the dollar  coupl with less slack than in the  book baselin  leav us to project a slow rise in core pce inflat over the forecast horizon to    percent for      and   percent for        this contrast with the  book   s forecast of a slight deceler in inflat   both the  book   s    and our forecast are predic on maintain our strategi of gradual remov polici accommod to bring polici back to a more neutral stanc   noth in the current condit or in the econom outlook suggest that it   s  e to revis that strategi   we are at a point in the cycl where i think it is particular import that we remain vigil and forward look with respect to inflat   the recent acceler in core cpi inflat mean that it is no longer in the lower part of the accept rang  in my view   this acceler has not been larg  and it has not yet shown up in the core pce inflat   nonetheless  both oil price and the dollar pose an upsid inflat risk   thus  it seem prudent for us to remain vigil and to continu on our upward path for the fund rate
thank you  mr  chairman   the new england economi seem to be grow at a slow but steadi pace and weather what so far has been a pretti snowi winter   the basic data are pretti good   in all state of our region  except massachusett  employ has been grow steadili at about the pace of the nation as a whole   consum and busi confid and spend are up   manufactur have a posit  though i wouldn   t say excit  perspect on       and coincid and lead econom index suggest econom activ is expand and will continu to grow over the next six month   over the longer term  there are a coupl of concern i think are worth mention   the first of these involv energi price   not surpris  given the weather and oil price  fuel and util cost in the boston cpi region have risen at a rate of about    percent on an annual basi   this  howev  look like it might not be just a short run effect but could involv higher energi cost over the longer term   inde  the feder energi regulatori commiss in a recent report highlight new england as at risk of energi shortag if extend and serious weather problem occur even this winter  or if they don   t  with some normal growth pattern over the next coupl of year  appar  constraint relat to natur gas   both the suppli of and the abil to move natur gas   combin with the increas relianc of the region on gas power electr generat  have    made new england vulner to perman higher energi cost or debilit power outag  neither of these would bode well for continu rapid rate of growth in the region   second  while job in massachusett declin in novemb and decemb and the rest of the region grew moder  the unemploy rate fell to     percent  the lowest of all the census region   the number of unemploy actual fell by    percent   this is becaus new england was also the onli part of the nation to experi a declin in the size of it labor forc over the past year  worker either are leav new england and migrat to other part of the countri or drop out of the work forc  or both   again  this won   t bode well as firm begin to look for peopl to hire on a broader scale than they may be do now   anecdot  all of my contact see caus for op  in the current economi   last year was a good year and  for some industri  a great one   so  mani expect      to show some  moder   contact remain concern about the geopolit situat   they   re concern about fiscal and trade deficit  but it   s the impact of their continu effort to implement sarban oxley financi control that realli worri at least some businesspeopl   appar  the intens effort to implement all that is requir and the cost in term of fee paid to account and other consult have been a matter of major concern   on the nation economi  our forecast and that of the  book continu to look veri similar  in fact  the differ are so small now it   s not realli worth talk about them   as i see it  incom data sinc the last meet all suggest that the economi has a reason amount of forward momentum   i   d like to see further confirm of employ growth  but busi invest  consum spend  homebuild  and motor vehicl product all indic that the first part of      could be even a littl stronger than we anticip  assum the novemb trade deficit was a bit of an anomali   inflat seem to have edg off  at least when you look at the core cpi   it is a percentag point higher on a year over year basi than it was a year ago  but that pace of chang seem to be slow  and certain the core pce has level off at     percent or so  the current year is shape up to be one in which resourc util gradual increas  wage growth    becom a bigger factor in support consum spend  and busi product  invest  and profit all remain pretti solid   so where are the risk   well  rise inflat could be one risk  as mani comment at our last meet   there are good reason  i think  to expect inflat and expect of inflat to remain well behav over the next year or so  but they are all base on the varieti of way we have of assess what is not direct observ  and that   s the amount of slack in the economi   these measur are credibl and reliabl  but it   s also wise to be cautious about how accur they can be in an environ of expect solid growth   excess capac could be use fa  than we expect  or we could be start with less of it   it   s hard to see evid of this as yet   so i view the  book altern that combin rise compens cost and a flat markup as provid good food for thought on what the mechan of an inflat surpris might look like   i also remain concern about an increas risk of financi fragil   the countri   s trade deficit is alarm larg  and over expans domest econom condit will onli make that wors   fiscal deficit that show sign of grow under reason es  of near term tax and spend initi could add to the mix   financi market  as well  are veri accommod  despit some bounci in equiti market  with narrow credit spread and abund liquid to bankrol larg merger and spur the ever expand hedg fund industri   low interest rate all by themselv certain are not a problem   but if you combin those rate with lot of liquid  low risk premium  and what consum  investor  and busi are incent to do as they reach for return  there could be a problem   in my view  these risk all suggest that the process of return polici to a less accommod place is exact right   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as was the case at the  e of our last meet  i think we should be pleas with the way thing are unfold   output continu to expand at a good and sustain pace  we   re get solid invest spend to complement sustain consum    spend  we   re get suffici job creation to at least gradual push unemploy lower  and inflat remain at a low level   what we   re see in our southeast region certain confirm and help to explain the favor pictur we see at the nation level   most of the key sector of our region economi  includ consum spend  hous  manufactur  retail  tourism  and auto sale  remain posit   we found it encourag that a larg share of invest spend by busi was report to be attribut to the anticip of increas sale   other plan invest spend  is be attribut to a desir to upgrad technolog and to continu to improv competit and cost effici   consum spend in our region continu to be strong   tourism has been especi posit   florida theme park are onc again full to capac  hotel book are up  and hotel room tax collect are   percent ahead of year ago level   hous growth in our region has eas a bit  though it still remain at a high level  the good pace of overal activ has contribut to new region job creation   while have slow somewhat in decemb  job creation has been suffici to move ahead of the peak experienc just befor the onset of the recess   our district ad some         job last year  an increas of     percent   florida led the district  creat         new job   sinc the end of the recess  florida has account for    percent of the net new job creat in the entir countri  the district unemploy rate  at     percent as of the end of decemb  remain below that of the nation   final  i continu to be watch for imbal and their implic for inflat   at our last board meet  our director provid addit report of continu sharp run up in hous price in select area  especi in some florida real estat market   one director who manag a larg truck firm note that equip shortag in truck are lead to frequent price increas   she report that fuel surcharg are also be readili pass on and that ration of transport servic is becom more widespread   other director who are larg shipper    comment that railroad are begin to declin to renew some contract to ship certain bulk chemic  which are less profit than contain and piggyback load   as for polici  noth in the data from either our region or at the nation level suggest to me that we need to chang the path that current polici is on in term of either speed up or slow down the pace with which we   re remov the substanti accommod that remain  market are expect further move   and our model are suggest that even with sever more increas in our fed fund target rate  the real economi should expand between     to almost   percent next year   that model work suggest that unemploy should continu to edg down and that the cpi should averag between     and   percent   of cours  the risk to these forecast that peopl have alreadi talk about are not insignific   but i   m comfort with the path we   re on  at least for now   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   my district report will balanc out presid guynn   s report  becaus econom condit in the fourth district have not chang veri much sinc decemb   as suggest by our beig book report  it appear that our region   s economi is still not advanc at quit the pace as the rest of the countri   that said  most of my busi contact are cautious op ist that the countri   s economi will see solid growth in        in what might be a good sign for job creation  for the first  e sinc i   ve been in this job i   m hear less emphasi on product gain as an explan for limit hire   i am final hear some mention of staff addit  although they are focus in particular industri and are not widespread   these comment are consist with gdp expans in the     to   percent rang  modest gain in employ  and relat robust capit spend  as contempl in the  book baselin project   my director and my other busi contact continu to comment on high input price  especi price of raw materi  and they comment on the desir  or even necess  of  maintain their margin   they seem to be have success in pass on some of the price    increas to their custom  although it remain difficult to quantifi how much of this talk is feed into retail price   nonetheless  from my perspect  the flat markup scenario that is report in the  book is a veri import risk  even though i do believ that the baselin project is the more like scenario   we   ve just end a year in which the realiz rate of headlin inflat was higher than i think is accept go forward   of cours  as has been mention  there were special pressur from the energi sector that contribut to that  and i share the opinion that those problem are probabl behind us   and i am hearten that we have manag to emerg from the year without deterior in the privat sector   s inflat expect   nonetheless  when ask what will turn out to be the biggest econom surpris in       the blue chip forecast put higher than expect inflat at the top of their list  i   d like to be sure that we don   t contribut to a continu of last year   s price level perform by unintent set the fed fund rate at a level that   s too low   i do like the fact that we   ve been abl to remov our accommod at a measur pace in move the fed fund rate back toward a more comfort zone   if we stop short in adjust the fed fund rate now  we could find ourselv lose the abil to continu with the moder step that we   ve had the luxuri of implement so far   over the past few month  mani of us have note that what we ul  want is to move the fed fund rate somewher back to a neutral neighborhood   given the imprecis of this neutral concept  it   s a pretti big neighborhood  and i   d prefer not to be at the lower end of that rang   thank you  mr  chairman

i think luck has a lot to do with it  follow a paus in upward momentum last autumn  which may have reflect energi develop or elect relat uncertainti  most econom indic have firm over the last few month   month job gain were healthi dure the fourth quarter   durabl good order show good gain in novemb and decemb  and retail sale end the year on a decid posit note   and despit the fomc   s five success hike in the feder fund rate  long term     mortgag and corpor bond rate have edg lower  perhap ad to the financi tailwind drive the economi   with this inform as a backdrop  i sat down with sever dalla fed economist to prepar our set of econom project for the come two year   all of us were confid that real gdp growth would fall in the     to   percent rang   inde  the point es  that we sent in were extrem close to the  book forecast   the dalla staff   s project for the unemploy rate were also quit close to the board staff   s outlook   where we differ was on the trajectori for the core inflat outlook   the dalla econom staff suggest that core pce inflat will rise to     percent this year and hold at that level in       a few factor account for the differ   first  the  book incorpor sever assumpt that give rise to the benign inflat project  name  that domest profit margin will continu to narrow  that foreign firm won   t tri to rebuild their squeez profit margin  and that benefit cost increas will remain moder   if we relax ani of these assumpt  the risk are tilt toward higher inflat and more rapid output growth   when we consid the result of the special beig book survey on capit invest plan  which confirm that mani compani are plan to increas their spend becaus of strong demand and emerg capac constraint  the question aris of whether the capac will come on line in  e to reliev the inflationari pressur that have emerg in the last year   it seem that too mani assumpt must work out just right to get the low inflat envis in the  book   as i said earlier  prior to ye day i had onli particip in two fomc meet   as a high interest observ as well as a particip  i observ a notabl differ in these two meet   in novemb  the committe was still focus on headwind confront the economi  while in decemb the discuss had shift to tailwind   i note this becaus basic the same thing has happen at the dalla fed   s board of director meet   in novemb  the director    econom report were uniform downbeat   in decemb  the director were decid and    uniform upbeat  at our januari board meet  the posit tone of the econom report underscor and reinforc our view that a turnaround had occur in mid novemb  as of yet  howev  most of the data avail for the eleventh district haven   t quit caught up with the anecdot   texa employ growth has strengthen but remain below that of the nation  the texa unemploy rate tick up in novemb and decemb and remain abov the nation rate   almost all sector of the texa economi are gain employ and the sluggish recoveri is broad base   follow a record break year in            turn out to be the best year ever for new and exist home sale in texa   despit this good news  the texa hous market like has peak but at a high level   price remain flat   high inventori of exist home and rise inventori of new home caus builder to pull back on start in the final month of        on a brighter note  offic vacanc rate have final begun to declin in the last few month  therebi confirm the anecdot about an improv offic leas pictur that we began to hear last summer   hope  the econom statist for the district will soon begin to reflect the recent report from our director  which note an increas willing to hire and to make capit invest for bad need capac   these report also note some increas in price power   in think about polici option  it seem that most of the inflat risk are on the upsid  the    tech wreck    and geopolit headwind have die down   over the last coupl of month  the expans has gain consider momentum   core inflat rate have turn up  main reflect that good price have stop fall and are now on the rise   the committe has rais the fund rate by     basi point sinc last june   these rate hike have not push up real  let alon nomin  yield on corpor bond and fix rate mortgag   and there are risk that the dollar could fall further  ad to inflationari pressur   as i mention befor  price power seem to be increas   all of these factor suggest that the expect cours of polici is on the right track  with anoth    basi point increas in the fund rate at this meet and expect of continu tighten over the year   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for the economi  growth current remain abov trend and  as we all know  is like to remain abov trend sever quarter forward   as a result  we are systemat approach long run potenti gdp for the economi   i expect growth will be near   percent this year   abov trend   there are obvious reason for this  monetari polici remain accommod  consum spend on good and hous is strong  and busi equip spend is strong   while fourth quarter growth was below expect  final sale to domest purchas were at a robust     percent pace   and i think the labor market continu to improv   evid from our district is veri much in line with this outlook   most retail we contact said that holiday sale were moder higher than a year ago  and mani said that sale were abov their plan   in addit  mani ski resort in our region report sharp increas in hotel occup and a near record volum of ski visit  mani from foreign   job growth pick up in decemb   hire announc sinc the last fomc meet exceed layoff announc by a margin of two to one  and a substanti fraction of small and midsiz manufactur said that they plan to increas employ in the come month   district manufactur continu to expand at a brisk pace  product  new order  and employ all rose in decemb  and firm remain upbeat about futur activ   capit spend plan for      are report strong   we all know where the price index are right now but  look to the futur  i would expect to see further increas in core inflat   with the feder fund rate below the lower bound of most es  for the neutral rate  i remain alert to the greater or increas risk of inflat   in addit  there are sever other reason to think that this upsid risk may be rise   first of all  as other have said here today  we are hear more about the return to price power   further  a greater pass through of higher commod price seem to be occur   the possibl of continu dollar depreci is strong  as is a greater pass through of higher import price   and slow product growth  lead to higher unit labor cost  is on the horizon      evid from the district support these observ   for exampl  the fraction of busi report labor shortag was    percent in januari  up signific from last quarter and last year   as a result  wage pressur in the district have also increas   about    percent of the employ contact in januari said that they had to boost wage more than normal as compar to    percent last quarter and    percent a year ago   in addit  our manufactur survey show evid of greater price power   for exampl  among respond report higher input price  the share who also report higher output price has risen mark  from    percent in the fourth quarter of      to    percent in the fourth quarter of       the same as befor the recess  similar  among those who expect to pay higher input price go forward  those who also expect to charg higher output price has risen mark from    to    percent  in summari  the outlook for the nation and our region is certain good   growth is robust  and we are hear increas that there is a lot of money look for opportun   i would submit that the risk of higher inflat  therefor  is now larg enough that we should at least be think about rais rate more aggress toward neutral than we have in the past   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom recoveri seem well entrench  and domest final demand continu strong  foreshadow healthi growth in        i don   t see inflat risk as have chang materi in recent month   in particular  labor cost have been remark subdu   howev  with the recoveri no longer fragil  continu withdraw of monetari accommod at a measur pace remain the appropri polici  in my  view   some have cite a possibl slowdown in labor product growth as an upsid risk for inflat on the ground that slower product growth impli a more rapid rise in unit labor cost  while lower product    of cours  lead to higher unit labor cost  all els equal  the link between product growth and inflat  as well as the implic for polici  are actual quit subtl   i   d like to use the remaind of my  e to discuss this issu briefli     first  it   s import to note that an assumpt of slower product growth is alreadi incorpor into the  book forecast   the staff project output per hour in the nonfarm busi sector to rise at about a     percent annual rate in       less than recent experi and about a percentag point below the profess   s consensus es  of the long run trend   the project slowdown reflect both cyclic factor and the assumpt that there will be some giveback of the extraordinari recent gain   as product growth has surpris repeat on the upsid for almost a decad now  i think the risk for the  book product project should be view as well balanc  at worst   the staff project that the deceler in the cyclic compon of output per hour should have littl effect on inflat but will instead lower profit margin   and even though the expect slowdown in structur product growth will put upward pressur on price  the staff expect the impact on inflat of that product slowdown to be offset by other factor like declin energi price and a stabil of the dollar   to summar  the  book   s baselin forecast show that some slow of product growth  at least  is not inconsist with continu stabl inflat   the interest question is  what will happen if product growth in      come in even lower than the     percent project by the staff   if firm view the result increas in the rate of growth of unit labor cost as more or less perman  then histor experi suggest that these cost will be pass on to consum fair quick  therebi boost inflat in the short run   howev  it   not follow that polici should therefor be tighten more aggress   the appropri respons depend also on the reaction of aggreg demand to this chang in product growth   if a slow in product growth occur that is both perceiv as perman and is also larg unexpect by household and firm  then stock price should fall and household should mark down their es  of perman incom   the result declin in aggreg demand will tend to offset the inflationari impact of the product slowdown   also  becaus firm will expect a lower long run return to capit  the neutral real fed fund rate will fall   as a consequ  as    illustr in chart   of the bluebook  the op  polici respons to a perman slowdown in product growth may well involv a slower pace of tighten rather than a fa  one  despit a possibl short run bump in inflat   this scenario is just a mirror imag of the post      experi in which a perceiv increas in secular product growth spark a stock market boom and rapid growth in spend  and henc was not disinflationari  despit the fact that unit labor cost declin   what if product growth slow substanti but aggreg demand   not respond   in that instanc  unfortun  we might be call upon to make a judgment about whether the slowdown is like to prove temporari or perman   if it is temporari  then neither inflat nor polici should respond veri much   if the slowdown is judg to be perman  howev  the failur of aggreg demand to adjust would suggest that household and firm anticip the slowdown  while the staff was too op ist   in this case  the slowdown in product should inde be met with a tighten of polici in the short run   howev  the fund rate should be lower in the long run  reflect the fact that the neutral fed fund rate will also be lower   this scenario is the mirror imag of the           period in which product gain creat disinflationari pressur that did requir aggress eas in the short run   to summar  slower product growth   not necessarili requir a tighter polici  first  some slow is alreadi anticip and incorpor into the  book forecast   second  if a signific slow occur  the key issu is the extent to which aggreg demand respond to the slowdown   a suffici larg declin in aggreg demand might well revers the presumpt that tighter polici is need when unit labor cost rise   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth in the fifth district has been a littl stronger in recent week   retail revenu seem to have pick up   accord to our survey  season adjust shopper traffic was stronger in januari than in decemb  and big ticket sale firm after have been weak in the previous month   in the servic sector  revenu growth    continu to be brisk   district manufactur activ general firm in januari  follow some soft in decemb   and although our survey show manufactur shipment down somewhat recent  new order strengthen and factori hire was higher   in labor market  we   re see some indic of a pickup in job growth in recent week  data for decemb had shown onli modest gain in our area   busi contact report that price rose at a somewhat quicker pace in januari than in decemb  though increas for final good and servic were general less than   percent   we continu to hear of sharp increas in price for some categori of raw materi   some district manufactur indic that higher cost are squeez their margin  but an increas number of produc indic that they are pass through cost increas by rais their price   pass through are easier  some say  becaus raw materi price are affect their competitor as well  though it isn   t clear whi this wasn   t true with the earlier cost increas   other contact note that the stronger econom outlook make their custom less resist to higher price  and this sound a bit more persuas to us   turn to the nation pictur  the data we   ve receiv sinc the decemb fomc meet suggest that the recoveri is on track   the forecast for inflat and econom activ in this  book is littl chang from decemb  and i haven   t seen anyth that contradict that view  in particular  core pce inflat is project to remain around     percent  inflat expect appear to be contain  and the  book continu to project a healthi real gdp growth of between     to   percent over the next two year as the output gap gradual close   to my mind  the most intrigu develop sinc decemb is the flatten of the yield curv   despit a    basi point increas in the two year treasuri rate sinc the decemb fomc meet  the    year rate bare move and the    year rate actual declin by    basi point  this was clear in dino   s chart ye day   the behavior of the term structur is just what one would expect if the public has confid that we   re go to conduct monetari polici in a way to keep inflat premium stabl and  thus  keep long term interest rate low over the long run   the fact that the tip  treasuri inflat protect secur  spread have been relat stabl of late also    support this interpret   i read these fact as evid of the credibl of our low inflat commit  as was comment on at length ye day   of cours  as we go forward  i think we   re go to have to watch the term structur care for evid of emerg market concern about either inflat or deflat   for now  howev  the yield curv evid  togeth with overal econom condit  suggest that the polici path we are assum for this outlook is nice balanc the upsid and the downsid risk
thank you   let   s break for coffe   we could extend this for a littl longer than usual  sinc we do have a lot of  e   so let   s break for    minut
governor kohn   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   my forecast for econom activ in      and         like the rest of your  was for growth a littl fa  than the trend rate of growth in potenti  that reflect my judgment that the forc that had been hold back the economi in recent year have larg dissip  allow the effect of relat s ul financi condit to continu to show through and rais the level of product relat to potenti   my project for growth in      and      is in line with the rate of growth in        yet energi price  whose rise must have damp growth to some degre in       are expect to be flat or somewhat lower   in addit  financi condit have eas sinc the middl of the year  with bond rate and the exchang rate lower and stock price a littl higher   so  as i thought about my  project  the logic question seem to be whether we were on the verg of a much stronger pace of econom growth   although that   s a possibl  i see sever factor that should keep growth to a moder pace   monetari polici and fiscal polici are at the top of the list   on the fiscal side  the partial expens provis probabl brought forward some capit expenditur from      to        for monetari polici  i assum a continu gradual withdraw of monetari s ulus along the line built into the staff   s forecast or the market   s   that should lead to rise real intermedi  and long term interest rate   a rise in real rate will damp the growth of consumpt and    invest spend direct  take someth off the increas in hous and equiti price   hold down gain in wealth   and support the dollar   of cours  that hasn   t been the experi over the last six month or so  as presid   just point out   but longer term real rate have fallen to such a low level that i find it difficult to believ they won   t rise from here  provid moder growth is sustain   inde  i see an import downsid risk to the forecast from the possibl of a sizabl jump  in longer term real interest rate  which could have a pretti serious effect on hous price and consumpt if it result from an unwind of special factor or from a revis of unreason low expect rather than from an unexpect fa  pace of econom activ   until those rate ratchet higher  howev  their low level  along with the basic sideway movement of equiti price sinc late last year  would seem to suggest that caution among saver and spender has not dissip entir   at the veri least  the behavior of bond yield and stock price seem inconsist to me with a new more ebulli attitud that would presag boom like condit   in addit  the behavior of the trade deficit is like to be damp the growth of demand on u s  resourc for a while   the staff forecast  which has net export make a modest net negat contribut on averag over the next two year  is itself premis on a pickup in foreign demand   a pickup we don   t yet see in the data   this suggest to me anoth sourc of downsid risk   over the long haul  as peopl becom more reluct to send us grow proport of their save  the deficit will have to fall   that will put consider pressur on product capac in the unit state  but it   s not at all clear when that will begin to happen   final  in make my forecast of real growth  i took account of my serial forecast error  i   ve been overpredict growth sinc i got on the committe  so i use a sophist algorithm to compens for this propens   i decid what i realli want to forecast and i took a littl off   laughter      my project for core pce inflat for      and      that goe with this path of output is slight higher than the staff forecast   i gave some weight to the market base core pce number  which have been run higher than the total core pce  but that forecast remain below   percent  and it is stabl at that level   for inflat  the question i wrestl with was   whi not further increas this year after the acceler of        in that regard  the recent data from the last part of      have been support  i think  of a stabl inflat forecast   with these data  everi broad index of core inflat   from gdp price to the cpi to pce   grew less rapid in the second half of last year than in the first    and signific less rapid  by at least    percentag point   this pattern is not consist with acceler price   it reinforc the hypothesi that a good portion of the pickup in core inflat in the first half of      was attribut to special factor  a revers of the unexplain undershoot in inflat in      and the pass through of higher energi  commod  and other import price from late      and earli        at least in term of energi price   not import  which are a big question mark   i think these upward pressur should not be a factor in        in labor market  increas in measur of compens also slow from the first half of the year to the second   now  this is particular noteworthi in that one might have expect the previous run up in energi price and the strength in product increas in recent year to put upward pressur on compens gain   as a consequ  i think i   m a littl less concern than some other of you that slack has alreadi been absorb   i can onli explain the recent pace of compens data if appreci slack is persist in labor market to balanc these other upsid pressur   in this environ  continu intens competit condit are like to limit labor cost increas and the abil or willing of firm to pass through shorter term increas in unit labor cost into price and thus risk market share   final  inflat came in lower in the second half of      than i had expect   my project was at the low end of our collect central tendenc  so most of you were a littl higher than i was   part  this might have reflect a shortfal in growth from the project and a smaller    declin in the unemploy rate   but energi and import price rose more than i had anticip  consequ  i also wonder whether at midyear i had given enough weight to the factor restrain inflat   slack  elev markup  and stabl inflat expect   to be sure  slack should be diminish  busi will tri to resist ani squeez on markup  and the economi may be closer to potenti than it appear right now   if the dollar declin substanti  import price will increas  reduc foreign competit pressur   or if trend product slow more than project  firm could be more insist and more success in pass through cost than is consist with keep inflat in check   still  for now  i think low  stabl inflat is the most like outcom for the next few year  provid polici continu gradual to firm  as slack slowli diminish and output grow at a moder pace   as for the balanc of risk  i   ve alway thought that that phrase appli primarili  or first and foremost  to the most like path for inflat and output relat to our object at the assum path for polici   and  in that context  the risk still seem to me to be balanc   the fact that i found myself ask these particular question about the outlook suggest  perhap  a slight skew to the distribut around these modal outcom   but i think we should await further develop to assess whether those skew will becom larg enough to influenc the central tendenc  the balanc of risk  and the path on which we remov polici accommod  or whether  as the market and the staff expect  we actual will need to slow the pace of tighten in the futur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   when i talk to my busi contact  i tri to let them  first of all  tell me what   s bother them   sarban oxley and health care cost rise to the top of the hit parad there  that   s about all they realli want to talk about   certain  sarban oxley is caus a signific increas in account and audit budget  and a lot of senior execut  e is be devot to it   nevertheless  the cost associ with that legisl are not go to show up in unit labor cost   it involv a big increas in the audit budget  but that   s a tini  tini fraction of    total outlay   so it   s a divers and a nuisanc   a pain in the neck for mani peopl  includ ourselv   when i tri to extract view by ask contact if they were concern about certain issu   for exampl  labor avail   the answer was typic    no      they feel labor is readili avail except for occasion specialti  like audit    laughter   the onli group for which they realli see a bit of tighten  i think  is it  inform technolog  profession   but concern about labor avail is not general  it   s spotti   so if you   re open a new retail store  you   d probabl find sever  e over the applic for the number of associ posit you have   i got the same kind of repli about concern regard wage and labor cost general   the one thing i have seen is a modest upward revis among my contact in expect for their compani   a contact from a comput firm with a larg intern busi report that his compani has revis upward somewhat their expect for global growth   from contact in the packag deliveri busi we heard report of some order for new aircraft   they see continu strong growth in the volum of traffic from asia  so that   s lead to some expans there   the overal impress i get is that thing are veri  veri well balanc   there are modest upward revis in plan and expect  i think the expans is proceed and is  in fact  unusu free of signific bottleneck  thing seem to be work out in an extrem order way   i don   t even have ani minor quibbl with the staff outlook  but i would like to emphas the follow point  which come from the fan chart depict the forecast confid interv   i think the staff   s forecast is a veri  veri sound central tendenc   but when i look at the tabl show the confid interv around the  book forecast for real gdp this year  i see a point es  of     percent and a confid interv of     to     percent   our life is go to look quit differ if gdp growth is either     or     percent   but that is the sort of confid interv that come from the histori of  book forecast error   so  i think it   s extrem import that we keep our mind open to various shock   symmetr on both side   this is not an asymmetr world  shock could come on    either side   moreov  i think it   s import that we provid that messag to the market so that the market don   t assum that we are lock into a particular path   the path that we   re on make a whole lot of sens given what we know now   but we don   t want to condit the market to think that we   re lock into that path independ of shock and disturb   i   ve written down a list of  various potenti shock and disturb   we can all do that   we   ve talk about some of them  the one that will come and bite us probabl will not be ani of those that are on the list   they   re probabl go to be total surpris  thank you
we haven   t chang our view of the nation outlook signific sinc the last meet   our forecast is quit close to the  book in all compon  and quit close  i think  to the central tendenc of the rest of your forecast   i don   t have anyth materi to report about the economi of the second district that i think has relev to the nation outlook   on the assumpt that monetari polici follow a path close to that now price into market  we expect growth to be abov potenti over the forecast period  at slight abov     percent  with core pce inflat stay around     percent   we think the distribut of probabl around that forecast is rough balanc  and we have somewhat more confid in our forecast this  e than we did at the last fomc meet   at the margin  we see less downsid risk to the growth forecast than we have over the past few meet   the resili of the expans in the face of recent shock  the breadth of under strength in the main compon of gdp except net export  the fundament sourc that seem  like to underpin a continu of recent strong consum spend and invest  the survey base measur of consum and busi confid  the anecdot report of somewhat diminish busi caution  and the moder pace of the expans so far all seem to add to the argument in favor of a forecast for solid growth slight abov trend     there is some talk among peopl who run major global corpor in new york about fragil remain in the outlook  about a world of lower growth and higher volatil  about more lurch in the outlook for econom activ and asset price   but i think the overal tone is a bit more posit  it has becom progress more posit over the last few month   on the inflat outlook  we face diminish risk of a signific declin in inflat from  current level and somewhat higher risk of some acceler of inflat from these moder level  although the recent news  of cours  has been reassur   as product growth slow  resourc util increas  and unit labor cost acceler  we lose some of the cushion that has support what has been a veri benign perform of inflat recent   profit margin are substanti enough to absorb signific acceler in labor cost and other cost  but firm seem to be report increas price power still   with the market appar confid that we will continu to move the fed fund rate closer to equilibrium   whatev that is   we   ve been success in keep inflat expect stabl at relat low level   this forecast  of cours  look implaus benign   it   s hard to imagin that the path of the economi between now and the end of      will materi as the consensus not just around this tabl but among privat forecast seem to envis   the confid around this view  which is evid in low credit spread   low risk premia general   and low expect volatil  leav one  i think  somewhat uneasi   the general reduct in fear and uncertainti that now prevail has the effect of make everyth look better   but  of  cours it also may increas our vulner to some advers shock and could magnifi the effect of some type of shock   the greatest risk to the forecast  i believ  involv this combin of veri low risk premia with our larg grow extern imbal  uncertainti about the prospect for a meaning improv in the fiscal baselin  and uncertainti about the sustain of high structur product growth   togeth  these factor increas the probabl of some unwelcom surpris    some unwelcom shock to asset price which  of cours  could feed into a substanti slowdown in consum spend      obvious  it would not make sens for us to use our monetari polici signal to reintroduc more cautious risk premia and greater uncertainti   but we probabl need to be care over  e  to the extent that it is possibl  to avoid do thing that reinforc an unhealthi degre of confid in the futur path of the fed fund rate or leav that path less respons to chang in the data and the outlook   monetari polici should  in my view  continu to be direct at move the fed fund rate higher toward a level more comfort in the rang of equilibrium and at convinc market that we will continu to move the fund rate higher at a pace determin by our evolv view of the outlook   that is  suffici fast to keep inflat expect stabl at low level   i don   t know whether that path will end up be steeper or softer than what is now price into market   as we move today  i think the signal in our statement should tri to be neutral to the expect now prevail about the near term path of monetari polici   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i would like to reflect briefli on one of the chart in the chart show   the chart on e s  equip and softwar  expenditur   and the possibl of the    no invest pothol    scenario   it strike me that at this point in earli februari  if we are not yet certain as to the impact of the partial expens provis  there   s a strong indic that there is no pothol   i say that for this reason   in my experi  incent attract capit  and signific incent   such as the kind that would generat this sort of behavior chang   attract capit noisili   that mean that we would pick up  either from the e s manufactur or from the lender  some indic of the impact of the partial expens incent  the fact that we have not suggest that we may not see a deceler in e s spend as a result of the expir of the partial expens provis   that may be a risk to the forecast  but it is a risk onli to the accuraci of the forecast  it would not be an unwelcom develop   if you look at the    no invest pothol    scenario in the altern simul  the impact on real gdp and on    unemploy are veri posit  yet the impact on pce price is neutral   so it seem to me that that is a veri realist altern   second  in follow the comment by banker in januari after the releas of fourth quarter earn report  two theme came through   one was that asset qualiti has peak and can onli declin  and the other was the highlight of addit provis for loan loss both in the fourth quarter and potenti in        so there was a suggest of cyclic to these develop that would at least merit a look at the relationship between asset qualiti and the impact it might have on the economi   the question is whether or not there is anyth go on that would jeopard our forecast of growth abov potenti through        bill treaci pull togeth some inform for me  and i   ve hand it out in a set of three chart show nonperform asset  net charg off  and loan loss provis as compar to real gdp growth sinc         the loan data have been season adjust to comport with gdp data  for two of the three   nonperform asset and net charg off   asset qualiti is a veri reliabl lag indic   the peak of nonperform asset and charg off follow the trough of gdp by sever month   the same is not necessarili true with loan loss provis   howev  the opposit is not true   those data did not indic that at an inflect point we had reach a  e in the cycl that would suggest the economi was readi for a downturn   in fact  loan loss provis  in mani case  will increas at the start of the cycl of loan growth again  for reason that are known onli to auditor and the sec  secur and exchang commiss     laughter   so the question is   is there anyth in the current analysi of asset qualiti that would suggest a risk to our current forecast   it seem that there is not   a third point that i would like to make that has not been discuss yet is the longer term  fiscal polici issu call social secur reform   in washington  d c   the decibel level on social secur is strong   it   s about to get stronger  particular after this even when the presid discuss it again in his state of the union speech   the washington post this morn indic that    the materi refer to by mr  olson are append to this transcript  appendix        even though the administr   s posit is not yet out  the democrat have alreadi line up suffici vote in the senat to keep the privat account   or person account  as they are now be call   from happen   the question would be whether the person privat account will continu to be the focus or whether can we move to a more ration  thought consider of option such as those outlin in the wall street journal articl featur governor   earlier in the week   it is unlik that we are go to get that latter scenario   the person invest account will continu to be the focus for an import reason   the republican who are in favor see the person account as transform   transform both in the role of govern and in term of what govern can do for the wealth build of individu privat citizen   they see the adjust that can be made as pain   and  as one of them told me recent     we   re not in it just for the pain       laughter   in other word  if the packag of propos chang has no person privat account  there will be no social secur reform   also  there   s a veri short window   if it  sn   t happen in       it   s like that it will not happen   so  i think the presid is stake a signific part of his reput on achiev social secur reform  and the focus will be on that issu   so  i think we should expect that to be a veri high profil issu for the next sever month   in summari  there   s certain noth  even with the    no pothol    altern  that would suggest to me that we in ani way should alter our current path of remov accommod in the measur manner we have been do   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the economi  to me at least  seem to be safe at what i would describ as a mid cycl sweet spot  with inflat general contain and growth at about potenti   the staff   s outlook and the consensus forecast   the  book baselin and the central tendenc on chart      were all consist with that kind of benign outlook go forward      while fourth quarter gdp may have been mild below expect   due to the vagari of nation statist author in other countri perhap   the under growth of domest demand in the most recent releas was  i would say  relat encourag   final sale to domest purchas  the broadest measur of domest demand exclud inventori invest  grew at a solid     percent pace  which i think tom hoenig alreadi point out   both pce expenditur and e s expenditur contribut   import  the privat sector contribut almost all of the growth  as govern consumpt rose less than   percent and contribut less than     percentag point to the gdp growth  accord to the most recent report   this growth was support by a number of under factor  all of which i think are consist with the veri posit outlook   real dispos incom manag an impress     percent increas  even exclud the microsoft dividend   i   m  surpris that from the twelfth district we didn   t hear more about the dividend  sinc most of the recipi appar live in washington state   order and shipment of durabl good exclud aircraft rose brisk in decemb  perhap undercut to some degre the staff   s pothol outlook but reinforc a general sens of balanc growth   week jobless claim edg up most recent but still remain below the recent trend  consum confid and busi confid survey are all off a bit  but  again  for the most part the gain in the last few month are be maintain   and our own survey of capit spend plan reinforc the notion of gradual busi expans   so  against this relat benign mid cycl backdrop and the number of data sourc that suggest a continu of this outlook  should we adopt a    what  me worri     attitud   here is what differenti us  perhap  from some of governor olson   s contact   we  inde  are in it main for the pain    laughter   but what are the thing that should be caus us some pain as we look forward   first and foremost  the drag from net export appear like to continu and  i would say  is disturb stubborn   even after the glitch in the statist from canada has been taken into consider  the trade deficit hit a record in novemb and averag       billion in the first two month of q  last    year  well abov the q  averag of       billion   given the amount of dollar depreci that we   ve alreadi experienc  whi have we not seen a more balanc net export pictur   i think we fulli understand that this is a phenomenon that is due to a number of factor   one is the relat strength of the growth in the u s  economi versus the rest of the world   the houthakk mage effect   the initi imbal between import and export  as   has point out  mean that export have an aw long way to run just to catch up with import   and there is the rise in oil price   anoth reason that import appear to be relat exchang rate inelast may be the limit pass through  which fell from about     in the decad of the     s to about     in the decad of the     s   some also believ the fact that the recent dollar depreci has been against some currenc and not other may explain the size of the trade deficit   but i suspect our staff is not in sympathi with that particular argument   in focus on chart     though  what stand out is the degre of dollar depreci that is call for just to get a veri  veri small chang in the baselin   to tri to offset even a littl bit of the trade imbal   i think that is realli quit disturb for a number of reason   one is that i don   t have as much confid perhap as other do that domest demand oversea is go to be s ul   the japanes have a veri sever problem to deal with   the european  as i meet with them  continu to discuss a veri low potenti growth rate and the need for structur chang   the ecb  for a varieti of perhap legi  reason  i think feel quit constrain about tri to s ul domest demand   so  i think the domest demand situat extern is not particular attract   we   ve alreadi talk about  in     s respons to governor    issu relat to the high tech sector  where i at least see some question  as larri allud to in his remark   so  i sens that the posit with respect to the drag from export is like to be with us for a long  e  is unlik to chang veri quick  and will probabl requir much more dollar depreci than is built into the staff forecast  even in the altern simul   therefor  i think that   s an issu that is go to be peril for the countri and perhap for us      the other risk that i think one should be focus on is an upsid risk have to do with the pace of growth in unit labor cost   that has quicken recent  rise at a progress fa  rate over the four quarter of last year and lead to a slow in the growth of unit profit   should busi tri to reassert the more rapid growth in unit profit that we saw earlier  they will need to attempt to rais price   the    flat markup and higher compens inflat    scenario has  to my  mind  a small but nonzero probabl of happen   the ratio of nonfinanci corpor profit to gdp has risen about   percentag point and now stand at about    percent   the staff forecast that the profit share will fall off a bit  and  i must say  histori   support that forecast   in five of the previous seven cycl sinc       the profit share also rose abov   percentag point   as it has now   and then did come off  as the staff has forecast for the current cycl   howev  there is a littl worri in all this  becaus in the last cycl the profit share reach about    percent of gdp befor fall   if busi now condit their expect on that most recent experi  then the scatter stori of the exercis of price power that we   ve heard around the tabl could potenti becom more widespread   whether or not that actual will occur depend on a number of factor that have been discuss alreadi  have to do with competit forc both in labor market and in output market   issu have to do with slack and with import price clear come into play here   at this stage  i   d say that all of this is clear worth watch   these are the worri of central banker  if not politician   whether ani of these risk or some other one not name will come to pass obvious will be the subject of this year   s meet   until that  e  i think we should continu to execut our plan strategi of a gradual remov of polici accommod  but review it realli quit serious at each meet   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   to me  the forecast present in the  book and the consensus forecast of those from the privat sector paint a sound econom pictur for         one of solid econom growth and an unemploy rate continu it slow downward trend   and    i   m comfort that the remov of polici accommod at a measur pace that we   ve announc and have been implement is support of this growth go forward   as some of you have mention  given such a good forecast  the question that aris is  what should we be worri about in this pictur   i   d like to mention two concern that i   ve been focus on late   the first is the risk around inflat   this is not a huge risk  but when i look at the  book project compar to various privat sector forecast  the  book   s inflat forecast is at the lower end of the rang of the blue chip forecast   hope  the  book will be the right forecast on this  but the inflat number have shown a lot of volatil in the last two year   so in light of the recent volatil  even in the core measur of inflat  i think it   s import that we look care at incom data everi month and keep on top of what is happen to tri to get a better understand   the second concern has also been mention by a coupl of you around the tabl  and that is the my i of whi long term interest rate aren   t ani higher than they are   my person forecast a year ago would never have had long term interest rate at the level at which they   ve been sit  if i look at various aspect of this  in tri to understand it  i can explain some thing   for exampl  we know that corpor have been see record profit margin and  as a result  have been generat tremend cash flow   that mean that corpor have been abl to fund a larg part of their invest in inventori buildup through intern fund  as oppos to go to bank or to the market   we also have seen fewer account scandal  which generat a lot of the uncertainti that widen credit spread in        those spread have realli come back down again as we   ve had relat fewer shock to market confid   we   ve also seen rate agenc worldwid reduc the number of downgrad relat to upgrad  so that has turn around  which is anoth good sign   and as governor olson mention  the banker are veri posit about current credit qualiti  but i would say again that we should recogn that we are probabl at the sweet spot in that credit cycl      on the other hand  consum have been borrow like crazi  and they   ve been borrow at the long end of the curv   in larg part  this is a reflect of the fact that interest rate are histor low  and peopl are be veri ration by lock in at long term rate and borrow all that they can   on net  though  we   ve seen that there   s been plenti of liquid in the long market  so what could happen here if long rate do move up as we go forward   i guess i worri primarili about what that could do in term of busi invest   we know that there may be a narrow in profit margin   and cash flow has chang to some degre  in that compani are begin to look more to the outsid for credit  especi as merger activ pick up  and that could affect the relat demand for credit from corpor   on the household side  we   re see that consum have use these low rate to support consumpt   they   ve done it through equiti extract as they refin   they   ve also had the benefit of tremend innov mortgag product be offer by banker and other lender  for tax reason  peopl want to borrow as much of their debt against their hous as they can  and lender have accommod them by innov in arm  adjust rate mortgag  where borrow can lock in a low rate for a period on the short end of the curv   but lender have also offer interest onli loan and mortgag with veri high loan to valu ratio to provid more credit that is elig for tax deduct   if interest rate rise  will consum begin to slow their use of  credit and  if so  what   that mean for consumpt in the forecast   this is the issu i realli want to focus on becaus  to me  consum have been the mainstay of this whole econom cycl   to the extent that there is a wealth effect of hous  this could be a concern if peopl begin to purchas hous at a slower pace or even if hous construct stay at a high level but  sn   t grow  we   ve seen sever privat sector forecast of flat hous price next year   if sudden the equiti buildup and the net worth of household were to slow  that could have an impact for consum   when we look at whi the save rate is so low today  we also have to look at the fact that the ratio of net worth to incom is at record level   consum have not had to save out of current incom in order to attain the net worth goal they have set  so they   ve been appli their current    incom almost entir to current consumpt   but if net worth begin to stabil and consum are not abl to increas cash flow through refinanc or home equiti line  that could slow the pace of consum spend and result in less gdp growth than in the  book forecast   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   this has been a quiet month in lake wobegon   the growth of aggreg demand has been good and the growth of output reason good  though we would all feel better with more growth in export and in import compet sector  core inflat keep bounc along well within at least my target rang   and i am  in general  in sympathi with those who have been argu for nairu on the lower side   our measur pace of chang polici has work well in get rate off the floor without seem to hurt the expans  and there is no appar reason to chang that polici at this meet   to me  the real problem is the one that i spoke about last  e  and the one that mani other committe member have mention today in differ way   low nation save   the u s  nation save rate is now at a post world war ii low  the combin of steadili fall person save rate and the recent budget deficit   the staff think  and i believ presid santomero    too  that person save rate will rise  and the chairman think that budget deficit will fall   i   m a bit skeptic about both claim  but we will see   this week  the cbo ad some new and sober inform on the budget deficit forecast   assum that there is ad spend for iraq  that the tax cut are extend  and that the amt  altern minimum tax  is index impli the continu of larg scale deficit through       with the debt gdp ratio climb back to about    percent by that  e   close to as high as it was at it local peak in the earli     s  though not at the all  e peak that was achiev back in world war ii   we   re not careen out of control in these forecast  but we could certain do better in this window befor the babi boom generat start retir in forc      low nation save mean either that invest will fall or that intern borrow must continu   problem with fall invest are well known  and we have discuss them  often   problem with the continu borrow are much less well understood   the staff recent wrote us a memo about adjust to prolong intern borrow in other countri   the data under the report indic no instanc of more than four or five year of continu borrow on the trade account  the trade account is the deficit that should  and in their data almost alway    determin the ratio of intern liabil to u s  gdp   our trade account borrow has alreadi gone on three  e as long as ani other borrow episod for high incom countri and  in     s forecast  keep roll right along   there can be both a bad and a good explan for the phenomenon   the bad one is the well known codepend thesi   we are over consum and other countri are inappropri support their export industri by interven to strengthen the dollar   the good explan is that other countri have popul age even more rapid than our and need a good place to invest their save   given our strong product advanc  we   re the place   this benign explan may well be correct  but it   have limit durat   when the older worker in these countri actual retir  they will start to run down their save and pull their fund back   at that point  our invest rate would seem to have to fall   how long this intern borrow can go on is a deep dark my i  but one thing is clear   as a nation  we would be better off if we could manag to save more and financ our own capit invest   we could do that by gradual tighten our budget while other countri expand their economi  back to monetari polici  we usual analyz it in a taylor rule type of framework  compar inflat and unemploy   we could also go back to an earlier is lm framework  which is appropri when price are stabl  as i think they are at least rough   when and if we get my desir fiscal tighten  i   d be glad either to slide down or shift down the lm curv and move to lower fund rate as may be appropri and necessari to keep the u s  economi near full employ   but anoth aspect of the quiet month in lake wobegon is that i see no more prospect    of ani real fiscal au  on the horizon than i did at the last meet   henc  for one more month  i   m on the    measur pace    bandwagon
thank you  mr  chairman   at least from the perspect of most investor  your polici decis today seem foreordain   the univers belief in the market hold that the committe will rais it target for the feder fund rate   point  to     percent and issu virtual the same announc as was releas after it decemb    meet   presum  this settl opinion result from market particip    read of your recent statement   includ the minut from the decemb meet  which i can assur you did not escap the world   s attent   as well as incom econom data that seem to present no obstacl to deflect the committe from it path of continu to remov polici accommod   in other word  the case for a   point tighten at this meet  which is laid out in your first exhibit  is expect by peopl outsid this room to be compel to you   in particular  the committe may be inclin toward such action   what we dub altern b in the bluebook   if it believ that market particip have peg the desir pace of tighten just about right   as can be seen in the upper left panel  the path of money market futur rate can be read as indic the expect of a success of   point move until the summer  follow by a slower pace of firm that put the fund rate at around    percent by the end of       a littl abov the staff assumpt in the  book   the staff view such a trajectori for polici as like to be consist with work down resourc slack  which is shown in term of the unemploy rate at the upper right  and with about steadi inflat  as measur by the core pce inflat rate shown just below   you might find some appeal in those outcom and seek a decis that preserv the path of expect thought consist with them   in that case  you should probabl direct michell smith to take the statement from your last meet and substitut februari   for decemb        for    and be done for the day   you might  howev  harbor some concern that those favor macro  econom outcom are predic upon liquid condit  includ low long term interest rate  that could be encourag excess risk take in a wide rang of asset market   indicia of a relax attitud toward and lessen percept of risk on the part of investor may includ the narrow spread in the market for corpor and sovereign debt  as shown in the middl left panel   as well as low level of impli volatil of financi price  and high and rise home valu  not shown   but perceiv excess in financi market have not trigger action by this committe in the past   in that regard  policymak have tend to follow the logic outlin in the middl right panel   to be sure  some asset price import influenc econom behavior   howev  becaus the determin of asset price are difficult to know      the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix        with precis  it is neither obvious that asset price bubbl can be identifi in real  e nor clear what policymak should do if they were confid that some price were misalign   moreov  there may be other instrument of polici better suit to deal with such problem  includ supervisori restraint   as a result  you might conclud that asset price should influenc monetari polici decis onli to the extent that they have a materi effect on the outlook for the thing you care about    output and inflat   ani sen ent to shade toward a firmer polici than in altern b becaus of concern about potenti asset market imbal might well be temper by the rang of polici prescript base sole on these macroeconom object shown in the bottom panel   you alreadi have move the polici rate toward the high end of the rang of standard recommend   the   shade area   and are anticip in futur market to move even higher relat to that rang in the quarter to come   i earlier describ prevail market expect as consist with a string of   point move follow by a more gradual pace of tighten   with the aid of exhibit    i   d like you to consid an altern character that also fit the data and that may be more appropri if market particip have taken the word    measur    to mean regular and method  like a metronom   the key identifi assumpt is list in the upper left panel   in particular  suppos market particip expect you to firm   point at everi meet until you stop this tighten cycl for good   the unknown in market  then  is when you will end the current firm cycl   we can use futur quot   which repres the market   s averag of the possibl of continu to tighten and of stop   to back out the probabl attach to action at each upcom meet be your last   this interpret of the path for the expect feder fund rate is given at the right   current futur rate are consist with a median probabl that you will have halt polici firm by the septemb meet   such an eventu would deliv the path for the nomin fund rate given at the middl left   along that path  five more hike  includ one at this meet  will cumul to put the feder fund rate at     percent by august   assum that inflat hold around it recent pace and that short run measur of the equilibrium real rate don   t move  that nomin rate would accord with a real feder fund rate that is about one half of the way up the red river of es  of it equilibrium in the familiar bluebook chart plot in the bottom panel   those rang in the bottom panel also map into the seem eccentr shade scheme of the stop  e distribut in the upper right   if you want the real rate to remain in the blue region   below the rang of model base es  of it equilibrium   you should be prepar to stop tighten at this or one of the next three meet   if you   re shoot for the red region of model base es   then you should expect to stop this firm phase anywher from august to decemb   but if you anticip want a cushion abov those model es        say  in the higher blue region   you might not stop firm until the winter or spring of        accord to the frequenc distribut  it seem that investor put the probabl at about two in three that you would be done befor that   there are three reason whi i have walk you through this altern explan of futur rate   first  it underscor that our understand of financi price is suffici imprecis that there can be sever plausibl interpret that are observ equival   second  if you would prefer that market particip not anticip an unbroken string of polici move  you could reiter that    measur    mean tighten that is care calibr  not action that are routin and mechan  and is consist with a paus if that prove necessari  mention of that sen ent in the minut of this meet may prove help in align market expect with your own   as it seem to be the case when similar notion were publish previous   third  the current structur of futur rate is consist with a notic probabl mass place on the bet that this firm cycl will soon come to a close  with the median guess be that you will be  done after the august meet   if that market expect   not seem unreason  then you are go to have to come to grip relat soon with various aspect of your statement  includ the character of the degre of polici accommod and the risk assess   the communic challeng diplomat refer to by presid     the next exhibit focus on the risk assess  with the top panel repeat the last paragraph of the statement releas after your decemb meet  histor  this paragraph and it predecessor have been design to provid some guidanc about the futur direct of interest rate   the statement has evolv to a point such that either of two part of this paragraph could convey such a messag   it can be done obliqu by describ the risk to your macroeconom object  as in the sentenc type in   that is the successor to the balanc of risk languag  or it can be done more direct by state the direct of rate and the pace with which you anticip act  the sentenc in blue type that are the successor to the    consider period    languag of         in both place  there is the opportun to convey that these judgment are condit in natur   not everi branch of an evolutionari tree end in success  which is wit by the fact that each of you start life with an appendix   the equival to the vestigi appendix in the current statement is the first part of the paragraph   it hint about the direct of rate through it character of the risk to your object have been trump by the more explicit natur of the final two sentenc  and the fact that the committe has tighten five  e while depict the risk as balanc must have been read in market as implicit reveal that the assess was base on a polici path you view as appropri  not the assumpt of an unchang polici that was employ when the balanc of risk formul was introduc in        if the risk assess  inde  is condit on your expect to do the right thing  you would presum alway choos a balanc assess unless you    thought you were behind the curv and expect to stay that way or thought that the possibl outcom had a decid skew   thus  this formul will general not be inform about the direct of rate   as the  e approach when you are no longer confid there is ani more polici accommod left to remov  you will face the three choic list in the bottom panel   first  the committe could get out of the busi of hint   either obliqu or direct   about it futur action   while this has been advoc previous by some on the committe  you would be give up an opportun to help to keep market interest rate expect align with your own   opportun you took over the past     year and which appar paid off   even if you are not sure where rate are head  there may be some merit in reveal your tentat assess so as to make it less like that investor come to a differ and inappropri conclus   second  the committe could tri to reviv the risk assess   one way  as i suggest back in august  would be to base it on the explicit assumpt of an unchang stanc of polici for the next few quarter and couch it in term of probabl rather than risk   you might find it appeal to introduc such languag when potenti outcom realli seem even side at the prevail feder fund rate   a possibl not necessarili that distant in  e   such languag need not be formula  as histori suggest that agre on a formula is neither a happi experi nor one that result in a durabl solut   third  you could feel that the balanc of risk assess in the first part of the paragraph is no longer necessari and instead reli on the gradual evolut of the latter part to convey your sens of the futur path of interest rate   as a govern issu  though  it will be harder to be inclus in draft when there is less of a structur foundat agre upon in advanc   these may be worri for the futur which you do not feel as palpabl as   your secretari  but  e is pass by   your final exhibit repeat tabl   from the bluebook without chang   i draw your attent to altern b  which basic repeat the statement that you issu in decemb
in exhibit    this is a measur of the point on the calendar where the market expect us to stop
to stop tighten  yes
mean it   s the point where the futur path of the fed fund rate from that point on is perfect flat   so it   s not the probabl of when we will first paus
right   this is an altern explan that say you will not paus but will stop   this view the expect feder fund futur curv as a weight averag of a success of move follow by a flat fund rate
i interpret you as say that an identifi assumpt more or less built in is that we move  move  move  move  move and then stop   that we don   t paus and then continu move again
right   but i would point out that our understand of expect format is such that you could also direct it to mean that you   ll do a   point move everi other meet and fit the probabl of those event   it   s just what identifi assumpt you use
this use option at all
no  this just use the futur rate   but  actual  that has been an extens we   re look at to see what this model   impli about the distribut  the pdf  probabl densiti function  from option price
well  with enough pdf you wouldn   t need the identifi assumpt
again  i   m sorri to ask this  i should know the answer  but are you project forward the rang of es  equilibrium real rate
i   m assum that those    river    just move sideway
that they move sideway     that make sens
probabl not   a number of you have articul over the cours of this meet reason whi they   d probabl drift up over  e  one of which is that as the output gap close  you have less room to go and you presum would have a higher real rate
wouldn   t that signific alter the path in the upper panel if that were true
if you follow the staff forecast  the answer is    not realli      it could shift these color over a bar or two but it would not materi influenc the stori
have you draft a sentenc to see what altern   would look like on exhibit   use probabl
yes  i circul that to the committe back in august  i think  essenti it say that the committe judg that if the current level of the feder fund rate were to be maintain  the probabl of output growth be abov it sustain pace about equal the probabl that it would be below   also  the probabl that inflat would be abov that consist with price stabil is about equal to that of it be below   that is  you essenti call out a point on the fan chart and character where you think the outcom are relat to that   and that sentenc would character it in term of the next few quarter   it said    if the current amount of polici accommod were maintain over the next few quarter  then the committe assess that        it was state in those term
thank you   i have a question      my memori may not serv me  well  but i recal our go through the communic process step by step   one of the reason    though mayb not the onli reason   we got into the discuss of risk for the futur had to do with the fact that we had previous use a bias formul  in part  to get consensus around the tabl  and that was thought to be inform that ought to be communic to the market and  in fact  it was communic  as i recal  inadvert or advert   anyway  we end up move into the more formula approach to talk about the balanc of risk   what is your impress about whether we realli have the option to do altern     has this long period we   ve had of specul on probabl gotten us into a bind   communic is a veri t i thing   is this one of those case where after we   ve done it  we can   t take it back without look as if we   re return to the dark age of nontranspar   do we realli have the    option of say onli what we did and whi we did it  even recogn that the explan of whi we did it would alway have some forward look aspect to it becaus  of cours  monetari polici work with a lag  and so forth   is altern   realli someth we can do
i would say that there are tradeoff possibl   that is  if all you did was cut out the last paragraph  it would be seen and interpret by market as cut back on the degre of transpar in a retrograd step   but if you want to  you could expand your character of the outlook in the previous paragraph  implicit provid some sort of forecast and  therefor  hint at the futur direct of rate   you could be more numer in your character of the outlook  say  by releas your central tendenc survey more frequent   so  there are some possibl   but i think that just drop it outright would probabl not be well receiv
i   ve sens from  e to  e that a coupl of peopl around the tabl have agre with the general premis that tri to tell the market where polici is go   except when we realli need to do it  which is how i would character the situat in      and         isn   t someth they   re necessarili comfort with   i know i   m not comfort with it
but tell peopl you   re not sure of the futur direct of rate is give them inform  and it may be superior to be silent about that and leav them to form  potenti inappropri expect
should we infer from your present that you would not chang the structur of this paragraph until we reach the point where the probabl of a move up equal the probabl of a move down   would you say that the point at which the desir path of the fed fund rate is flat is the op   e for evolut or would it be ahead of that point
i think there are go to be a coupl of speed bump in the process along the way   the first is earlier in the rational portion of the paragraph in your character of the degre of polici accommod   one could imagin a success of step  as you continu to move the fund rate up  that will get you to a point where you can no longer confid assert that    polici is accommod   you   d therefor have to make that a qualifi statement rather than an explicit statement
you   d say that would be an obvious intermedi chang
that   s the first speed bump that you think about if you tri to walk through the chang that might need to be made in the statement go forward given  say  the  book outlook   if you want to introduc new languag  an opportun to do so would come  when you   re just not quit sure of the direct of rate   when the fund rate is in a zone where the committe can no longer be confid that it can remov polici accommod at a measur pace  when you reach the point where that is no longer true  you   re go to have to drop that sentenc  you   re go to have to ask the question  should we tri to chang the risk assess or tri to write anoth sentenc that character the committe   s view that it is not sure of the futur direct of rate
i have one more question   should one also infer from  your present that you think the op  path of monetari polici in the period ahead is to get behind us all the move necessari to get the fund rate closer to the midpoint of the rang of it equilibrium   are you say that we should steadili get those move done  so we get more quick to the point where one could expect a flatter path go forward  or are you not suggest that
i don   t think there was advocaci in the two differ interpret of the feder fund curv  onli a suggest that if you are not of the view that the path will involv a   point move at everi meet  it would be help to defin    measur    onc again   i say that becaus there is a real risk that market particip  have extrapol from six polici firm by the end of today  are go to say that you are on a path to do so   inde  it may have come to the point where they wouldn   t expect a paus unless you signal a paus   that is  that you wouldn   t feel that you could keep polici unchang with the exist statement
and yet if you repeat that languag in the minut again  as you suggest  reason peopl might interpret that as a conscious decis to tri to signal in    some sens that a paus is approach   that   s a littl awkward to justifi  given that we   re in a period of  e where i think the probabl the market is attribut to the next three move is higher than it has been over the last six to nine month
but you could make it a symmetr statement   you could say that the measur pace languag is not inconsist with a paus in the polici of    basi point move at each meet nor with a larger move   there was at least one member who indic a sen ent for a firmer polici
we origin rais the issu of accommod when we hit      on the fund rate on the way down   at what point do we begin to get respons   i haven   t heard anybodi rais the question as to a seem asymmetri in our judgment of where accommod is  unless it   s perceiv as a signific move target   one could argu that up to now there is no necessari inconsist  one answer is that we forgot to mention that our polici was accommod earlier on the way down   but we have to have some way of approach this question becaus it   s go to come up with the first speed bump that you were refer to   i think we have to address it  and hope we   ll do so somewhat in advanc  further question for     if not  let me get start   i   ll be veri short becaus i don   t have veri much more to say that i haven   t said previous   there is one issu  howev  that i think   requir continu awar   and that is that  as mani of you have mention  the chanc of our get through to the end of      with the econom outcom have the benign aspect of the forecast that we see has to have a veri low probabl   there   s someth built in to both our econometr structur and  inde  in the way market function  that is give us this continu  smooth path come off of governor     s sweet spot   the reason we get that is  in part  becaus as an economi continu to grow in a seem balanc way  the ration project includ an increas probabl that growth will continu that way in the subsequ six month   that is  if you   re in the earli stage of an econom recoveri  you   re never quit sure that in fact you   re in a recoveri   so your es  of the chanc    that the next six month will continu to be favor is lower than it is when you   re much further into the cycl   the latter point is when you begin to have a project that the recoveri will continu   you think of it in term of   well  econom activ has been go up for the last two year  or three or four year  and what is the probabl that it will continu to do so   and that get built in to the decisionmak process   you begin to see a quicken of capit invest   you see order that begin to be a littl forward look   the degre of confid continu to be buoy  stock market rise  and yield spread fall to except low level   the problem with that scenario is twofold   one  histori suggest that it will come to an end  and  two  arithmet in a way produc an end  larg becaus  when you get risk premium down at veri low level  they can onli go in one direct   it is the invers of where you can go when you   re at the top of the mountain   so this will break down at some point   someth is go to happen becaus it alway has   and human natur never seem to have veer veri far from this type of model   sinc the earli     s  we seem to have been abl to take these adjust veri smooth  the imbal occur  but there   s suffici flexibl in the system that the correct seem to occur in a manner which essenti  at least in the past    year  has given us a busi cycl of extraordinarili shallow dimens   there   s no question that it   s not onli the experi of this most recent period that is drive risk premium down but also the fact that noth materi has happen in the past    year   in other word  yes  stock price have fallen  and yes  interest rate have gone up  but they   ve alway revers   and over the longer run  the rate of return in the past    year have been perceiv as quit benefic   so  what concern me about the outlook is that while i can   t give you a better altern than the  book forecast   becaus that is  inde  the presum most like outcom   it has built in to it the seed of it own imbal  and we don   t know where they are   i   m not even talk about exogen shock   i   m talk about an endogen system that creat a problem  becaus human natur is such that peopl ration tend to becom increas confid that    stabil will continu the longer stabil is what they have perceiv   we can   t get that into our econometr model becaus there isn   t an endogen or even exogen variabl that would essenti be    human natur     and yet we know it   s go to happen  so  we have to be care becaus someth is go to go wrong here  and i think the most probabl thing is that we   re underes  the potenti inflat pickup   i   m not say that the probabl is for an inflat pickup  i   m just say that our forecast of the probabl of a pickup is too low   and that will chang the dynam of this whole situat   the sweet spot will turn sour  and until then  i suggest that we just sit around and enjoy what we have    laughter   it   s not go to get ani better and it   s not go to continu indefinit   so  my bottom line conclus is what everyon around this tabl  i presum  would prefer    name  anoth    basi point on the fund rate and the same statement except for one word   i think when we look back  we will find that what we have been abl to do   and are still abl to do    realli has been quit success   but that will stop   and when it stop  we   re go to have a lot of the problem we   ve just been discuss with regard to how the statement should be modifi   i suggest to you that when it stop  our abil to forecast what   s go to happen next will fall veri dramat  becaus we   re not go to anticip the stop   i was look at the weak figur in januari  and they were sort of build up   so i was say to myself over the last coupl of week that there   s someth a littl disturb about the number that are come in   now that has stop   we are begin to get countervail posit forc again   presum  we will look back at januari as someth of a paus  with retail sale not do all that well  motor vehicl sale fall  and the purchas manag    data in new york  philadelphia  and for the countri as a whole general start to look a bit less formid   in other word  there   s been the feel of an unreal signific slowdown and chang   but that has been the way this whole cycl has evolv   it has had a pattern of paus un paus  paus un paus  it  sn   t go flat   and this is the process by which the recoveri has been move forward   at some point  there   s go to be a paus un paus  paus  paus  paus  paus  and then we   ll know we   re in the    soup   someth will happen   so  i mere put forward that veri tight analyt    laughter     empir model of the outlook and make the recommend i   ve been make for quit a while  name  an increas in the fund rate of    basi point   and  in this case  the statement i   m  propos is liter almost wholli unchang from the previous statement   comment   presid guynn
i support your recommend  mr  chairman

i support it
i support your recommend
i support your recommend  but i do want to make a coupl of brief comment   while we   re sit around enjoy this  as you put it  i think it would be help to flesh out these three altern   probabl within the bluebook   i think that would be the appropri way to start look at this
i   ve been impress with what   has been do here  i think this has been veri help   and i think it   s a use way of come at the problem    anticip inevit chang and be suffici ahead of the curv so that we can all come to an agreement as to what we will do  when we have to do it  becaus we may not have all that much lead  e
so  flesh them out in the bluebook would be my suggest   also  with regard to the microsoft dividend  i do want to assur governor   that we   re hope to move it to michigan    laughter
i support the recommend
i support the recommend and the reason    laughter
i support the recommend
i support the recommend  and i promis to tri to be happi   laughter
i support the recommend and i am happi    laughter
i support your recommend
i support your recommend  but i must say you leav us all feel like a frog in water    laughter    with the temperatur of the water gradual rise   the water get hotter but it   s not so hot that it   s boil   you have to let us know when it realli start to get too hot
i would say that that econometr model rival the one that the staff has built up over the year
i support your recommend
i support your recommend
i   ll read the direct and the risk assess languag from page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around     percent         the committe perceiv the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil for the next few quarter to be rough equal   with under inflat expect to be relat low  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be    measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil

befor we close    has a few remark he   d like to                make
over the intermeet period  i survey you about whether the summari of your econom project should be expedit   that is  releas next week rather than three week later when the chairman deliv the monetari polici report in tes oni to the congress   my experi in survey you has been that if i ask the    of you    what is the color of an orang      i couldn   t be sure of get a major on a singl answer    laughter   this most recent survey was no except   almost as mani of you strong endors an expedit releas of your project as strong oppos it   an equal number of you endors it as oppos it  and there were two lone peopl who were indiffer    laughter   thus  sinc expedit the releas of the forecast is a decis that cannot be revers  it  sn   t seem appropri to move forward with a discuss of it today   but let me add that one argument in favor of expedit the releas of the forecast seem particular pertin at this  e  there   s a risk that if those forecast are particular stale when the  e come for the releas of the monetari polici report  it will be harder to convey    a consist messag to the public   this is pertin now becaus the employ report will be releas this friday  rais the possibl that materi chang in your econom project will be necessari   it seem appropri  then  to give you a littl more  e than usual to revis your project   so i would ask that you get your final forecast to dave   by the close of busi next monday
we get an extra day
you get the weekend   feel free to use it all
the next meet of this committe is march      befor we close this meet  let   s take a brief recess while the feder reserv board deliber on the request we have for discount rate chang   we shall return   recess
i wish to announc that in record  e the feder reserv board act expediti to chang the discount rate  and you all know the direct and the amount   as a consequ  i now adjourn this meet and suggest that we go to lunch          end of meet
