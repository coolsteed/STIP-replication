without object  they are approv   dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the chart that were distribut at your place earlier this morn  the first chart depict the standard   month cash and forward deposit rate from earli april through last friday   as you can see  u s  short term rate continu to declin over the recent intermeet interv   weak corpor earn  layoff announc  and a beig book that was perceiv as downbeat were among mani other factor that affect sen ent dure the period   three month cash and forward rate declin by about    basi point over the period   nine month forward rate rose immedi after the june fomc meet but then declin quick and on balanc fell about    basi point for the period as a whole   while the   month forward rate may suggest that the market is build toward a tighten later in       as perhap   the eurodollar futur strip  other indic such as the     year note are more ambigu  a subject i   ll talk about later  in the euro area  cash rate have been stabl sinc the last meet  but   month and   month forward rate have continu to be pull lower  by    and    basi point respect   forecast for the euro area economi have been trim and the market is cautious build in some addit eas  with mani market particip expect    basi point of eas at the end of this month   the largest chang in rate occur on august  th and  th after the beig book was releas here and the ecb   s month report  which was view as pave the way for an eas in polici  was releas in europ  the bottom panel show the japanes govern yield curv from   month out to    year   i   ve highlight three snapshot coincid with the last two fomc meet date and this past friday  ahead of the current meet   the short end of the curv is below    basi point    the chart use by mr  kos are append to this transcript            out to   year  but the longer end of the curv has prove more resist to further prod by the bank of japan   the announc by the bank of japan on august   th that it would increas it current account balanc target from   trillion to   trillion and also rais the pace of jgb purchas has not notic affect the yield curv   in fact  the longer end of the curv is actual higher than it was on june   th  turn to page    i   ve provid a snapshot of asset price in u s  market   all three market  the fix incom  equiti  and foreign exchang market  reflect a continu shift sen ent and are discount a weaker outlook   the top panel show the          and    year yield along with the fed fund target sinc april  st   the entir curv has shift lower and the    to    year spread has steepen by anoth    basi point  from about     basi point at the  e of the last meet to about     basi point at the close ye day  i would make two point   first  benchmark long term rate have come down quit a bit in the last seven week   the    year is down about    basi point and the    year is down somewhat less  by about    basi point   second  the   year note trade as low as      percent dure this period  the lowest rate sinc the   year note began to be regular auction in        by way of comparison  dure      and       when the fund rate was at   percent for an extend period of  e  the   year rate never fell below      percent   given the sensit of the   year note to the fund rate  if the market were build toward a tighten at some point  as suggest by the eurodollar futur and the forward rate agreement  then one might have expect the   year note yield to be higher than it is now   so  it behavior at least rais question about the signal be given by some of those other indic  in the middl panel i   ve plot the major u s  stock indic index to     on april  st  which also coincid rough with their low for        as reflect in the chart  those indic rose through much of the spring but have been come down  and have continu to come down in the intermeet period  as the market has adjust to the weaker outlook  the bottom panel show chang in the trade weight valu of the dollar against other major currenc   the dollar has declin modest on a trade weight basi  but that mask sharper declin against some of the major currenc  especi the yen  the euro  the swiss franc  and even some other currenc such as the singapor dollar that have been use as fund currenc in so call carri trade   in part the declin is probabl due to percept about the recoveri  in part it may reflect some risk avers   as econom activ seem to be slow          global  a littl risk avers may lead to a close out of some carri trade   and final  some of the ongo chatter in market about the administr   s postur toward the dollar may also be a contribut factor  turn to the third page  the top panel depict the major european equiti indic  also go back to earli april   they show a similar pattern to that in u s  market except that the declin has been more dramat for european equiti  especi over the intermeet period  in that interv most of these major indic fell between       and    percent  in part reflect revis in forecast for growth as well as weak earn   interest  though  the euro actual had one of it sharpest ralli sinc it launch  move from about    cent to almost    cent dure this period for reason that are not fulli clear  given some of the news that was come out of europ   one explan might be that interest rate differenti are final bite   those interest rate have been narrow for almost two year in favor of the euro  the bottom panel show the differenti between dollar and euro swap rate   these spread continu to declin modest but are still slight in favor of the dollar  turn to the next page  the top panel depict the dollar yen exchang rate   a coupl of noteworthi event have taken place in japan sinc the last fomc meet   first  the upper hous elect were held and the ldp and prime minist koizumi did quit well  an outcom that is expect to acceler structur reform in japan  second  on august   th the boj announc chang in it oper target  as i note earlier   that combin would have been expect to produc a weaken in the yen and a lift to the equiti market   in the event  the yen actual has appreci from about     to below     this morn and equiti price have continu their declin  as reflect in the middl panel   the reason for the yen   s appreci are not fulli obvious   repatri and the approach of the end of the fiscal half year have been mention yet again   anoth possibl is that there may be some risk avers kick in that is caus some of the short yen trade to be unwound   but it   s not immedi appar whi the yen would be appreci in this kind of environ  as i mention  japanes equiti have continu to declin with onli a brief interrupt after the upper hous elect and the boj   s oper chang   the nikkei  which was over        at the  e of the last fomc meet is now below        and at it lowest level sinc        the topix bank sub index has also been fall again  reflect renew doubt about the health of the japanes bank system   as the bottom panel show  that sub index is actual lower now than it was dure the      bank crisi in japan           turn to the last page  the chart show month growth rate  season adjust  for currenc dure        as you can see  we   ve had elev currenc growth in juli and also in august   most of that is attribut to cash shipment oversea  primarili to argentina   the growth of currenc has been run at rough doubl the rate observ earlier this year  translat into deepen reserv need over the past intermeet period   those deeper need were met primarili by an expans of the perman soma portfolio and by a modest increas in the amount of long term rps outstand  mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper dure the intermeet period  but i will need a vote to ratifi the domest oper   and i will be happi to take ani question
question for dino   if not
move approv of domest oper
without object  they are approv   now we   ll go on to     and vinc reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   a reader of this meet   s  book could be forgiven  i think  for contract at least a mild case of sticker shock   after all  we revis down our es  of growth for the current year  alreadi half complet  by     percentag point  and for next year by twice that much  to cut       percentag point from the level of gdp by the end of next year   but rather than cast this forecast as a big chang from it predecessor  i would like to begin today by make the case that this can larg be seen as a status quo forecast  without a doubt  there has been consider buzz in the last few week about the revis to the nation incom account and how dramat those revis have chang percept of macroeconom realiti   in a way  of cours  that is correct   the revis figur suggest that firm invest much less than previous es  dure the past three year   accord  capit deepen occur at a slower pace  and that has import implic  of cours  for growth prospect   as my colleagu fleischman  sichel  and struckmey outlin in their memo to you last week  we have trim our es  of potenti gdp growth by four tenth this year and six tenth next year   obvious  a revis of this magnitud is of enorm consequ for some issu  includ assess of the           trend rate of growth in the standard of live  the long term outlook for the feder budget  and the solvenc of the social secur system  but the implic of the nipa revis for the conduct of monetari polici could easili be overdon   to a first approxim  the recent histori of inflat remain essenti as previous es    from that  we infer to a first approxim that the pressur on product resourc probabl were about as we had es  base on the previous number   in particular  the gap between actual and potenti gdp probabl was about as we had it  albeit with lower level of both actual and potenti output  previous  we had been attribut a good portion of the outstand inflat perform of the late     s to the acceler in structur product   now  with the product boom downgrad a notch  it can obvious do less of the work for us in term of explain whi inflat has stay so low dure the last five or six year   so what explain the extraordinarili good inflat perform of the late     s   the short answer is that we don   t know for sure  but someth els must have been caus inflat to behav so well despit the low unemploy rate   often cite candid includ the rise of temporari help suppli firm  better job match facilit by the internet  welfar reform  and reduc price power due to more intens foreign competit   befor  we were in the slight awkward posit of have no room for ani of these entir plausibl explan to play a role   now  there is scope for these possibl chang in the behavior of labor and product market to be part of the stori   while we are uncertain about the precis magnitud of the various individu effect  we are assum they will persist  with the consequ be essenti equival to a reduct in the long run nairu from       percent to       percent  thus  when all the dust has settl  our assess is that you are oper in an environ that in some way look veri similar to the one we saw in june   inflat is about the same and the pressur on resourc util look similar   as a result  the stanc of monetari polici  as gaug by the gap between r and r   also look about the same  that said  let me now turn up the microscop and point out some of the adjust that we have made to our outlook in the context of that broad similar framework   by far the most import of these adjust is a further mark down of our outlook for busi invest   as you know  the data on order for june were extraordinarili weak  headlin by a    percent declin in order for communic equip  not at an annual rate   as we could find          littl solac either in the beig book or in our own inform contact with member of the busi communiti  we are now assum that this quarter   s declin in real spend for equip and softwar will be essenti as steep as last quarter   s   we   re also assum that the fourth quarter will show no great improv either   in addit  we have turn much more bearish on the outlook for nonresidenti structur   while the commerci real estat sector seem to have avoid repeat the excess of the late     s  vacanc rate have been rise sharpli of late and we forese sever more quarter of declin spend on nonresidenti structur   this  too  seem to be support by the report summar in the beig book and elsewher  in contrast  we continu to be surpris to the upsid by the strength of consum spend   the advanc es  of retail sale for juli was notic stronger than we had been expect  and with the tax rebat arriv in most household    mailbox this month and next  we still anticip that household spend will provid import support to activ in the month ahead  the onli other notabl modif to our near term outlook is most just a matter of  e   by our assess  automak have been in the process of build more vehicl  especi truck  this quarter than we think they can reason expect to sell   as a consequ  we think they will need to cut product signific in the fourth quarter   the result swing in product  on our assumpt  add about     percentag point to gdp growth this quarter and take away about       percentag point next quarter   we may be off on our  e one way or the other but unless sale pick up substanti  a sharp cutback in product from current plan some  in the next few month seem high like   and ford   s announc last week  which is alreadi built into our number  is probabl onli the begin  so from a larger perspect  how should you  as the princip in this process  audit the reason of our project   as a start point  i suggest that you consid three basic question   first  do you find our revis to potenti gdp growth plausibl   we now have the growth of potenti gdp slow from       percent last year to   percent this year and to       percent next year  reflect a slower pace of capit deepen   i should note  for those who are tri to gaug the long term growth potenti of the economi  that on our current outlook for busi invest we would have the growth of potenti edg back up perhap to about   percent after       second  do you find it plausibl that we have adjust our forecast for actual gdp rough in line with the revis to potenti  leav           asid some issu of lag   our theori in make this adjust is that household and firm should not be complet oblivi to the chang in the outlook   inde  household and firm were like on to this even befor we were   in particular  we know that for the most part household tie their spend to the trend in their incom   and if the trend in their incom slow  then we should have a good deal of confid that their spend will slow as well  even if with a short lag   we also know that busi gaug their need for product plant and equip to the pace of their current and expect activ  and if they sens that activ is not live up to prior bill  they can be count on to trim their invest spend accord  i should hasten to say that not everyon is as glum as we are about the near term prospect for real activ  for exampl  the most recent blue chip consensus is at       percent for growth in the second half  but in the face of a notic weaker foreign outlook  unremit gloom from the industri sector  continu bad news from the tech sector  and a steadi drumbeat of negat earn and layoff announc  i am a bit hard press to share their op   third  do you find our cautious op  about the outlook for inflat plausibl   to be sure  as we highlight in the    altern simul    section of the  book  the substanti downward revis to the markup in the nipa account appear to take away a cushion we thought firm had to absorb futur cost pressur   if firm move to restor that cushion  the consequ could be sever more tenth of inflat as earli as next year   howev  the environ we see is one of low capac util  increas slack in labor market  and earlier retrench in energi price than we had previous been expect   moreov  we believ the revis data on compens per hour for the year      may be import distort by the treatment of option grant by employ  so we have been inclin to discount these data   while margin clear cannot be suppress without limit  we are inclin to believ that the plausibl limit has not been reach yet  and so we anticip continu relat good inflat perform over the forecast period let me conclud by focus on one of the risk to the outlook that we highlight in the    altern simul    section of the  book  name  the risk of a major stock market correct  contrari to my general stori line that the nipa revis did not affect much of interest  i don   t think that   s the case here   as you know  there were downward revis over the last sever year to nipa dividend and earn   moreov  our analysi lead us to be consider more guard in our assess of the outlook for the trend in these seri base on the downward revis growth in potenti output   that          impli that today   s level of equiti price is be carri on a shakier foundat of fundament   i should add parenthet that i think this morn   s stori in the wall street journa reinforc this view  although it  sn   t alter the valid of the nipa account becaus  for all their shortcom  the nipa account happen to get this aspect of earn report correct   on the whole  this lead us to conclud that whatev our level of apprehens about the market befor the releas of the nipa data  it probabl ought to be move up a notch in light of the new inform
perhap the hardest challeng confront the  staff as we sort through the incom data over the intermeet period to prepar a forecast for the global economi was to avoid fall into a self reinforc spiral of pessim   as the forecast process unfold  we mark down the outlook for econom growth abroad in part becaus of weaker prospect at home   but this translat into the expect of both lower u s  net export and a weaker global market for technolog product  trim the project for u s  gdp and creat obvious implic for oversea activ   this iter process converg at a signific weaken project for foreign econom growth relat to what you saw eight week ago   still  we think forc are in place that will fo  a reviv in growth  albeit a littl more delay and to a somewhat slower pace than thought at the  e of the june meet  as for the near term outlook  real gdp in the foreign industri countri is expect to expand at just over a   percent annual rate in the second half of       about     percentag point slower than forecast in june   we have also pencil in onli modest expans in the develop economi of asia and latin america over the remaind of the year that put the level of their output at the end of this year       percent  on averag  below our project in the last  book   three factor most account for our more pessimist take on the pace of global econom activ this year  first  incom data on spend  product  and employ have almost invari disappoint   output contract in germani and itali in the second quarter  and more forward look indic of household confid and busi purchas intent do not bode well for growth go forward in the euro area   while domest spend in canada has held up well thus far  employ is begin to sag   and japan appear to have slip into anoth recess   real gdp is also declin in the develop countri of asia that direct much of their export to the global electron market and in those countri in latin america with trade tight link to the unit state   meanwhil  the price of mani intern trade          commod have continu to tumbl  which is probabl a sign of fall contemporan demand  that lead natur to the second sourc of downward revis to foreign growth  the mark lower of the near term u s  outlook  we   ve pull down our project of activ abroad both becaus some of the advers effect of more slowli grow demand in the unit state fall on foreign market and becaus an import drag on our own economi  reduc demand for capit attend to the re evalu of the prospect for the tech sector  is also play out in mani other countri  third  it has becom pain clear that the financi crisi in argentina has alreadi extract a heavi econom toll there   output is contract  unemploy is rise  and price are declin  meanwhil  risk spread remain elev and deposit in the bank sector are run off rapid   inde  the most obvious vote of    no confid    in the current situat is what dino alreadi relat  that an es     billion of u s  currenc was ship to argentina last month   perhap it evid our lack of imagin  but we find it hard to pictur how the govern of argentina can extric itself from this situat in a manner that stanch output loss any  soon   and without econom growth  it poor fiscal posit stem from it high debt burden will onli look more unsustain than it   today  and the threat of spillov to argentina   s neighbor will be that much more palpabl  after the forecast was put to bed  we receiv data on u s  intern trade for june that would not lead us to alter the top line number we wrote down in the  book but that did serv to underscor our sens of ongo weak in global econom activ  the u s  trade deficit on good and servic  at         billion  was about what we were expect and close to the number the bea assum in construct it preliminari es  of second quarter gdp   what surpris us  howev  was that this deficit was arriv at by shrink the valu of both export and import   particular of note was the fact that the dollar valu of capit good cross our border in either direct was smaller in june than in may  extend the trend of the past few month  while i   ve emphas the downward revis of foreign econom growth in the near term  perhap the most import featur of the outlook is unchang   we still believ that econom growth abroad will pick up next year to a rate not veri much below that of it potenti   this growth reviv may be a bit more attenu than in the prior few  book  but it still reli on the same four forc             first and foremost  as   has alreadi describ  the expans of u s  econom activ is expect to step up in        we think that will be associ with a larg posit swing in the growth of u s  real import that will benefit activ in our trade partner   moreov  given that the u s  growth pickup includ a turnaround in invest  greater demand for capit here will brighten the outlook for the tech sector worldwid  second  while data on inventori abroad are spotti and unreli  we believ that part of the dynam of the slow of the past few quarter in mani foreign countri has includ a product adjust in respons to some stockbuild that develop as demand weaken unexpect   as inventori stop fall next year  that drag on real gdp growth will be lift  third  monetari polici in mani industri countri has alreadi weigh in to support aggreg demand go forward   we think that most of those central bank will continu to eas and that some other central bank will join in   in the case of the bank of japan  howev  it remain to be seen whether an elev provis of liquid  which was announc last week  will bol  spend given that the polici rate is alreadi at it zero floor   the issu are more convent when it come to europ   in common with the net judgment of particip price money market futur  we believ that the european central bank will eas    basi point by year end  as their task is made easier by declin in headlin inflat induc by fall energi price  fourth  with regard to energi more general  the price of west texa intermedi oil has fallen about    per barrel over the past three quarter  and our forecast  follow oil futur market  hold that anoth    per barrel price drop is in store by year end        we anticip that this price declin has been and will be shift incom to those resid of the global economi who are more like to spend it  bol  consumpt in mani countri  although we   re relat confid about the exist of these forc help to shape a rebound in spend in       their magnitud   e  and whether other sourc of restraint will more than offset their impetus are far from certain   two promin risk eman from global financi market  for one  we assum in our project that the real foreign exchang valu of the dollar would follow a track tilt slight downward   but the fact is that the dollar   s valu fell more in the past week than the declin stretch out over the next six quarter in our            project   this recent downdraft might be the first sign of a risk factor that we   ve fret about for some  e  that foreign investor    appetit for ad to their hold of u s  oblig will wane   but the foreign exchang market has given us fals signal befor  so we have treat this latest stepdown as evid of greater odd on a downsid risk rather than as a reason to pull down our baselin forecast   to get a sens of how event may unfold should that risk materi  we includ an altern simul in the  book in which the dollar   s broad real valu drop near one quarter by earli next year  from a u s  perspect  the result ratchet higher of foreign relat to domest price encourag export and pull down import to add about     percentag point to gdp growth in the first half of next year and twice that amount in the second half   the impetus to inflat is even more strike  with core inflat run       percentag point fa  by the end of next year   the chief risk to the global economi is that this relat price chang off load some of our ongo weak to our trade partner   with the nomin interest rate alreadi at zero in japan and the fiscal deficit a sourc of concern  japanes policymak may be poor posit to counter such import weak and  unless the stronger euro embolden the ecb  european policymak may not be will to do so  as anoth risk  our latin american outlook assum that the fallout from problem in argentina will be relat contain to that nation   s immedi trade partner and other latin countri reliant on intern capit market   that assumpt was base on the logic that global investor have seen this come and that the imf   s stand by arrang with brazil will ring fenc that countri   but part of argentin offici    bargain strategi of late has appar been to elev expect in the market of the size of a packag in order to put pressur on the intern financi institut   if either less new money is forthcom than those encourag expect or what come fail to cover argentina   s subsequ reserv loss  then the scope and sever of contagion may be more than we   ve built into the  book   i don   t have a simul to point to main becaus it didn   t seem like a product use of our larg scale macro model  as it would be high nonlinear and especi depend on market sen ent   that conclud our present  mr  chairman
question for our colleagu   presid parri
you mention three consider that we might want to take into account as we look at the forecast   the second was that the variabl in aggreg suppli get translat pretti much on a one for one basi into the variabl in aggreg demand   i            must admit i was a littl surpris by that in the sens that although current short term prospect for earn and for incom are like to affect demand  i believ that perman incom also play some role   if that   s the case  if there are more perman influenc  in term of aggreg demand  wouldn   t there be less of a respons than a one for one chang
let me make two comment on that   first of all  i made an obliqu refer to the issu of lag   we translat a downward shift in the trend in incom to consum spend with a lag respons of a coupl of quarter   we think it take household a littl while to catch on to this chang   we brought down potenti gdp growth by     percentag point this year   we think about half of that lower potenti growth this year translat into a reduct in actual gdp growth   for next year we took potenti down by     percentag point  and by that  e we believ the adjust process is far enough along so that household will begin to recogn a soften in their incom prospect  and inde in their perman incom  and that will be incorpor into their spend   so we feel that over that kind of  e horizon it   s realist to build chang in the fundament tenor of incom into the growth of consum spend

thank you  mr  chairman   the overal econom pictur in our district has not chang mark over the last sever week   manufactur activ continu to declin  although perhap at a bit slower pace than earlier   the key issu  of cours  as            highlight in the beig book summari  is whether the weak in the manufactur sector is go to spill over into other sector of the economi   i don   t think we have ani veri conclus evid regard that in our district   i read a book recent that talk about a tourist at fort sumter ask a guid whi so mani civil war battl were fought at nation park  laughter  so i   m veri skittish  even more so than usual  about ascrib causal   howev  retail sale have weaken in our area in recent week  in contrast to the nation data  and it seem reason to me to specul that at least some of this weak reflect the soft in manufactur   and the problem from high tech manufactur and relat industri clear are contribut to what appear to be a grow weak in commerci real estat and commerci construct activ in part of our district where high tech activ is concentr  such as northern virginia and the raleigh durham area in north  ina  we don   t see in our region ani definit indic that manufactur is bottom out yet  but there are at least a few straw in the wind   i have a contact in a sizabl truck compani that is base in richmond but   a lot of busi with the furnitur manufactur and other in the  ina   his firm   a larg volum of busi and it   s broad spread  and i think he   s a reliabl sourc of inform   he tell me that his custom    shipment have been stabil most recent and that sever manufactur oper in the  ina are tell him that condit are at least not get ani wors   elsewher  revenu in district servic industri other than retail continu to grow at a healthi pace  accord to the month servic sector survey we do   and residenti sale and construct activ are hold at their recent high level  so to summar on the district  we have not seen a lot of chang except perhap some negat spillov from manufactur to other sector of the economi   but there is a glimmer            of an inflect point in manufactur  to use a phrase that     coin the other day  the  book forecast for the nation economi has an inflect point of it own  the forecast call for the declin in the rate of real gdp growth to end in the second quarter and for growth to reacceler gradual this year and next year   there are obvious signific downsid risk in this forecast  and   has note a number of them   one is the project return of busi invest to at least a moder upward trajectori next spring  it could take longer   consum spend could be signific weaker than project for ani number of reason  and all the downsid risk in the domest outlook obvious are compound by the cumul weak in the intern economi  but in my view there are also some modest sign of improv   the retail sale report for the month of juli  releas recent  got my attent   i think it   s quit posit when one dig down into the detail   it   s onli one month report to be sure  but it is at least consist with the idea that the reduct in energi price  or the anticip of declin energi price  and the signific monetari s ulus alreadi in the pipelin may be shore up household spend   elsewher  manufactur activ as measur in the industri product index was flat last month after a long seri of month declin   even when one abstract from the strong motor vehicl product  what is left is a declin but a smaller declin than we   ve seen for a number of month   job market are still soften but overal the juli report suggest that they may not be soften quit as rapid as had been fear earlier   and all of these develop are reinforc by the continu strength in residenti construct  the current view in financi market  as report in the media at least  seem to be that a bottom out in the economi is now further out in the futur than most peopl had thought sever week ago   the recent inform i just cite suggest that the gradual upturn            in the economi  as project in the  book  is actual a littl more plausibl now than it might have been at the  e of our last meet  or at least it seem that way to me   the implic of this for polici  in my view  is that the economi could turn up sooner rather than later  although that   s certain not a sure thing   and if it    with unemploy still relat low and the real fund rate quit low  we may need to revers cours prompt and remov some of the s ulus that is current in the pipelin   histor  this has alway been a veri difficult thing for the fed to do   so i think we need to begin to prepar ourselv as well as the public for this possibl  in the absenc of a mark further weaken in the econom outlook   thank you
at each of our recent meet i   ve expect better news next  e  and each  e the news has been disappoint   the slowdown is now a year old and show few sign of come to an end   monetari polici eas began almost eight month ago   fiscal polici has now eas and tax rebat check are in the mail   more recent  we seem to have escap a worsen of the energi crunch   these three major factor  monetari s ulus in the pipelin  check in the mail  and improv in the energi outlook  should help to produc a turnaround but there is scant evid that they have start to do so yet   monetari polici probabl has help to cushion the declin  which has proven to be wors than expect  three special sourc of strength in the eleventh district use to be high tech manufactur  trade with a boom mexico  and energi   high tech manufactur is in a serious recess   the mexican economi is declin   and the energi boost seem to have peak out  luckili   texa employ growth  which had exceed the nation averag in nine of the past ten year  has weaken sharpli in everi region and sector of the state  but most            sharpli in the technolog center of austin and north dalla   becaus of energi there is continu moder growth in the houston area  howev   the declin in mexican manufactur  especi along the border in the maquiladora plant  is be felt in texa border town  in the energi area  rig count both in texa and the nation are below their juli peak  about    percent of drill is for natur gas  for which the price has declin below    per thousand to around    now   that is still somewhat high by recent histor standard but it is back close to it more usual relationship to the price of crude oil   the mood remain dark in most technolog sector  but some anecdot comment are begin to be more posit in the semiconductor industri   the u s  semiconductor equip book to bill ratio has risen modest sinc hit an all  e low of      in april  at the nation level  the  book forecast and the gdp revis tell us that not onli is the current economi get wors but so has the past   neither the past nor the futur is what it use to be    laughter   and the risk to the forecast seem most to be on the downsid  the main posit in the  book was the slight improv outlook for inflat over the forecast period  and i   m not veri confid about that   one way to look at the situat is that more slack in the economi will produc less pressur on price   but anoth way to look at it includ the possibl that suppli may be cut back fa  than demand  a revers of the disinflationari consequ of rapid output growth in the late     s  base onli on the state of the economi and it near term prospect  a larg polici action is call for today   but it   s a closer call when we consid the lag and the degre of s ulus alreadi in the pipelin   as for the direct and the bias statement  i don   t know whether it   s better to speak soft and carri a big stick or to be more diplomat and say    nice            doggi    while look for an even bigger stick   if the bias statement and the press releas weren   t alreadi written  i   d say it   s go to be difficult to write them this  e    laughter

thank you  mr  chairman   on balanc the seventh district economi has not chang signific sinc my report in june  but most report now seem somewhat more pessimist than befor  at least about the near futur   overal activ has remain quit sluggish and that has been disappoint for mani busi that had expect  or at least hope  that some evid of an upturn would be visibl by now   the expect improv in the economi seem further in the futur than when we met in june   in fact  most busi peopl we talk to do not expect a signific recoveri in manufactur befor next spring   there are few sign that capit spend is about to pick up and there   s grow concern about how long consum can continu to prop up the economi  manufactur has been our weakest link for about a year now   while some key manufactur industri have made substanti progress in work down excess inventori  overal product remain veri weak   the light vehicl industri is somewhat of an except  on averag inventori are now in good shape   product nation has been trend up somewhat sinc januari and capac util is up to    percent  about as good as it get in the auto industri   of cours  even this industri is not out of the wood  as     mention earlier   so far this year  substanti incent have been need to keep light vehicl sale at high level  and industri contact indic that sale have been soft so far in august  and more general  they expect sale to be lower in the second half than in the first half of the year   in addit  incent spend is not expect to chang much  and that mean profit will continu to be squeez            most firm are still attempt to reduc cost and are be veri cautious about capit spend   inde  the outlook for capit spend is poor in a larg number of industri  for exampl  no recoveri is in sight for heavi truck sale   the steel industri has littl incent to increas capit spend  given the signific excess capac and the lack of price power  the gypsum wallboard industri is also plagu with over capac despit the fact that the robust hous market has help keep shipment strong   and high tech remain an area of special weak  with most observ indic that it will be some  e befor the overhang can be work off  one piec of good news came from the paper industri where demand for cardboard box improv in the last few week   but our contact emphas that the improv realli has not last long enough to discern a turn   consum spend and hous activ are still hold up reason well in our district  although mani retail have becom less op ist about the futur   report indic softer consum spend in the midwest than elsewher in the countri  amid sign that individu are becom more price conscious   discount and valu orient retail seem to be the most aggress in tri to captur the tax refund busi   while sale result are still rather sketchi  it appear that those retail are the one that are benefit the most   even as the tax rebat check t l into the economi  mani retail continu to lower their sale expect for the fall and for the winter  our hous market remain relat robust  although some contact are skeptic about how long such resili will continu   we   ve had scatter report of reduct in ask price for some higher price home in chicago  although these price are still abov year ago level   and i   ve becom increas concern about potenti overbuild in this sector  given the tremend amount of residenti construct near and around downtown            chicago   so far  howev  the hous number have remain at high level and home that are price right continu to sell quick  often with multipl bidder  thing are not quit so rosi on the nonresidenti construct side   offic vacanc rate have continu to increas in mani area as demand has slow   the reit tell us that larg firm with leas come up for renew are consist cut back their offic space requir   with these trend visibl nationwid as well  there has been a signific advers impact on the offic furnitur industri that is concentr in we n michigan   this industri expect to see the sharpest drop in shipment sinc record were first talli in the earli      s  sinc the slowdown began  our labor market have eas somewhat more than they have in the nation as a whole   district employ are still report that it   s less difficult to hire and retain worker in most area and that wage pressur have subsid further   total payrol employ in our five state area has been below year ago level for two month now  someth we haven   t experienc sinc the end of        howev  the latest manpow survey  which will be releas public next monday  august   th  show a small pickup in the hire intent of midwe n employ for the fourth quarter  which may indic that the worst is over for our region   the nation index declin slight further  howev  take it to it lowest level sinc the end of       turn to the nation outlook  like mani of our busi contact we think the pickup in econom growth will be delay further   we still believ the second quarter will be the worst of this cycl  but growth this quarter look to be quit anem as well   in particular  anoth substanti declin in capit spend should larg offset the posit effect of the tax rebat and consum spend   we continu to think the most like scenario has growth return to it potenti by the second half of next year but we certain can   t rule out a wors            scenario   as our busi contact keep repeat  consum spend and hous activ may falter befor the inventori and capit spend adjust are complet   the outlook for world growth has deterior  sign of econom instabl are evid in part of latin america and asia  and the intern situat

mr  chairman  the econom climat in the twelfth district has turn negat as the high tech downturn has intensifi and spill over into other sector   dure the three month end in juli  district employ contract     percent at an annual rate for a net loss of about        job   downsiz among technolog firm was especi pronounc  between may and juli  employ at high tech manufactur and busi servic firm combin fell by about   percent at an annual rate  substanti abov the pace of contract dure the first four month of the year   the intens of the cutback among district technolog firm has begun to drag down employ growth in other sector   employ contract in construct and also fell in ship  truck  and wareh dure the three month end in juli   and job gain in retail and wholesal trade have slow to an anem pace   the general impact of the technolog driven downturn is evid in the district   s high tech center   for exampl  the san francisco bay area has lost almost        job in the past four month  as both tech and non tech employ have scale back   employ in portland and phoenix also has contract in recent month and job growth in seattl has slow substanti   in general  the technolog driven downturn has dramat alter the region pattern of growth in the district this year  with last year   s fast grow area either contract or move later            turn to energi market  cooler temperatur  sluggish econom activ  and continu conserv have reduc electr usag in california in recent week  eas the demand and suppli imbal that has plagu the state for most of the year   better market condit and lower natur gas price have result in wholesal spot electr price of around     per megawatt hour in mid august  well below the      averag record for may  while lower wholesal price general are good news for california  the declin are not like to revers the trend in retail rate hike that took effect in june   a number of factor will keep those rate up   the california depart of water resourc  which current is purchas electr for california   s major util  need the revenu to cover past cost and what have turn out to be relat high price on long term contract   and the public util want assur that retail rate will allow them to recoup past loss in addit to cover cost go forward   right now concern on the part of util over the adequaci of the current rate structur is hold up the issuanc of       billion in revenu bond meant to repay the state for the billion of dollar the depart of water resourc has spent on electr this year   at this point  it look as if the bond will not be issu befor octob or even novemb   given the delay in issuanc  cash flow constraint like will lead the state to issu revenu anticip bond   the state control has indic that these bond  which would be issu after labor day  could amount to      billion  turn to the nation economi  the industri output and retail sale report for juli may rais a glimmer of hope that the economi is begin to turn around   howev  it seem fair to say that the recent data taken togeth show few  if ani  sign of a pickup in activ   our best guess is for growth of around   percent in the current quarter   after that  sever factor should oper at about the same  e to s ul fa  growth  includ the s ulus from            monetari polici and a tax cut that has turn out to be  e almost perfect   we should have a better idea of how much of an effect it is have on consum spend by our next meet   in addit  the substanti turnaround in energi price this year should help to promot a pickup in activ  for next year our forecast  which like the  book assum no further chang in the fund rate  show real gdp growth increas to more accept rate of around   percent   of cours  there are some notabl downsid risk in the economi  have to do especi with consum spend and develop abroad   overal  our forecast would leav labor and product market about in line with their averag long run util level and there would be littl upward or downward pressur on inflat next year   we are look for inflat in the core pce price index of just below   percent both this year and next   while it   s obvious good that we don   t appear to be face rise inflationari pressur  i think it   s also worth note that the current period of slow growth could be complet without the kind of reduct in inflat that often accompani such period   this outcom would be disappoint sinc i certain would like to see a further modest declin in inflat over  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   well  what a differ six week make   or mayb i should say what a differ one addit month of data and some revis of past data make   you will recal that new england   s headlin econom data had been a bit better than those for the nation as a whole  though anecdot from region busi had been turn increas gloomi   that gloom seem now to be justifi   with the state and region employ data that were releas last friday  the region look consider differ  with level of employ declin month to month and year over year growth at a fraction of it            long term trend   the unemploy rate also tip up from month to month by     percentag point   add to that the escal cost in the boston metropolitan area and the fact that the anecdot have turn from gloomi to almost ugli and we have a region that no longer appear to be teflon coat   where is the downturn occur   in the usual place  primarili manufactur  particular high tech manufactur  though retail also describ consum activ as anem  sever theme run through our discuss with manufactur   first  most in the high tech arena are convinc now that the turnaround is not like to come any  soon   some firm don t expect a resumpt of  normal  activ  howev that is defin right now  until the second half of        in the face of weak demand and no sign of a pickup  the emphasi is on reduc cost   even the unusu firm that continu to do well is be much more cautious on the cost side   busi of all size are put enorm pressur on their suppli chain  we ve heard this befor but demand for price concess report have acceler  the second theme has to do with it spend   almost all high tech manufactur note that one major reason it spend will pick up onli veri slowli is that mani compani are quit a way from grow into the infrastructur they alreadi own   also  obsolesc is be care manag   desktop  onc obsolet in two year  can be left in place for five year   one of the bank s director refer to this as a lack of    killer app      that is  in the face of slow demand  consider it invest alreadi in place  as well as cost pressur  the new technolog that will drive new spend has yet to surfac and may well be greet with some skeptic when it    final  among both larg and small firm the avail of bank credit has becom a concern   even when firm have found financ in the bond market not much of a problem             they   ve seen credit market difficulti impact partner compani and joint ventur and have experienc difficulti in renew their own revolv credit arrang   big firm with lower credit rate are report shut out of credit market and smaller healthi firm are face higher rate  there are a few brighter spot in the region   residenti construct and real estat market have held up well  albeit with some deterior at the high end of the market   in addit  labor market tight has eas   this seem to be help area firm keep cost in check  as there is much less upward pressur on compens   firm that are still hire say they are abl to be much more select  it is easier to get new hire  and the recruit are of better calib  turn to the nation  i think it is possibl to read the current economi in two way  first  some data may be in the process of plateau   employ level seem to be declin at a slower rate   and perhap some comfort can be taken in the singl month of flat  not declin  industri product   consum sen ent is hang in there  as are residenti invest and consum spend   busi are continu to work on increas product larg by reduc cost  and they have react to profit pressur by dig in  not by rais price  inde  at least one sourc of cost pressur  energi price  has provid some relief alreadi and should continu to do so go forward   no one know when high tech spend will pick up  but one get the sens that a huge premium is be put on use exist capit to it fullest  which augur well for futur product  look back over the postwar period  it s unusu to find two or more quarter of gdp growth at more than   percentag point below potenti without a recess occur either immedi or one or two quarter later   arguabl  one of the onli  e such a period of slow            growth was follow by an endur pickup was in the         period  the so call    soft land      with the monetari eas now in place and whatev more is need and the tax cut as well  this period may turn out to be a similar land  perhap not so soft  prior to the takeoff of busi invest   it may be that the economi  and particular the consum  will continu to muddl through until then  certain that s what the  book expect  as   the boston fed   s forecast   our forecast dynam may be a littl differ in regard to the stabil of structur product and the level of the nairu  but the overal forecast is remark similar   we anticip slower growth this year than we had expect earlier  a gradual return to growth near potenti  growth at   percent or mayb a bit lower by year end       with an uptick in unemploy not as larg as in the  book project  and eas inflat   this isn t a bad outcom   in fact  again histor speak  it would be unusu posit   but such a forecast   requir some confid in the more posit read of the situat that i just delin  obvious  the other way to read the current situat is to focus on the worsen profit situat   unless reliev by slower compens growth and damp energi cost  profit pressur do not bode well for the stock market  busi invest  or job growth   if consum are hit by rapid rise jobless  all bet are off on hous  auto sale  and consumpt of servic  as a slowdown of manufactur spread and becom a wider slowdown  and econom histori repeat itself   moreov  the other dark cloud  the extern situat  with slow growth and region crisi condit  cannot help matter   as i said  the issu is how much credibl one give to the muddl through hypothesi   i come out on that side  but i think it s a close call   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   as i   ve comment befor  and it continu to be the case  the district economi for the most part is move in lockstep with the nation economi   the district   s economi has slow further  i would judg  but the slow hasn t been sharp   as for labor market condit  report job vacanc are still consider but they are shrink  and meanwhil layoff are increas   the weak is most visibl concentr in the manufactur and mine sector  and particip in those sector are not expect ani materi improv until some  next year  both hous and nonresidenti construct activ in our district remain healthi and posit at the moment  although i think the seed of some slow are clear visibl now  vacanc rate in commerci space are rise   so while there is a lot of current activ  the rise vacanc will weigh on prospect for futur project   and while homebuild activ and sale also remain healthi  at the upper end of the market the pace of sale is clear slow  as has been the case for sever month now  consum spend and tourism activ are at best mediocr   one except  where thing are a littl better  is apparel sale   whi that s the case  i   ve been unabl to determin   but peopl in that busi seem to be pleasant surpris with the sale they ve been experienc  one of the two bright spot in the district is the energi sector which  of cours  has benefit from price chang   the other is agricultur  where  in part of the district that have not been plagu by drought  farmer clear are go to get both good crop and better price than they had earlier expect   and we are hear some scatter report about spend on durabl good by produc in those sector for which prospect are look up  as far as the nation economi is concern  i don t know that i would use the term glum  but i find myself in substanti agreement with the  book forecast   i believ that real            improv in the pace of econom activ is still some  e off and i think the improv is like to be anem  at least initi  when it occur   i m hard press to identifi ani signific posit surpris in the latest batch of macroeconom data that we have receiv  and the intern situat is wors than i had anticip earlier both becaus growth abroad seem more sluggish than i had expect and becaus the recent declin in the dollar rais at least a yellow flag in my mind   i agre that it s too earli to reach ani firm conclus about what that might portend but it   suggest to me that we should be pay at least some attent to develop on the intern front  i ve comment befor and i think it s still the case that the inventori correct process has a way to go   as best i can judg with the benefit of hindsight  we clear had a capit spend bubbl that has now collaps   and that s not someth that monetari polici is inher well posit to deal with  if i want to be a bit more posit  and i think there s someth to this  there may be reason to believ that consum spend will hold up as long as the rise in unemploy from this point is not too drastic   in that regard  i take some comfort in what s go on in the hous market   sale of both new and exist home have been quit healthi for a long period of  e and  after all  the purchas of a hous is a long term commit that peopl are will to make   now  this may involv some asset realloc  and obvious interest rate are favor   nevertheless  the fact that peopl are will to undertak those kind of long term commit at the pace that has prevail in recent month is a develop i view as posit  final  i am comfort with the  book s relat favor inflat outlook  but in my view  what we now know about both product and compens suggest that the profit outlook is clear negat
thank you  mr  chairman   last  e i report that the head of my region econom group had suggest that it look as if it was go to be a    bummer of a summer      unless you   re a homebuild in our region  he was about right   i m find it harder and harder to find just the right adject to describ the degre of slow that we are observ in our area   while i had hope to be see at least a few more posit sign by now  the overal situat is not materi differ than at the  e of our last meet  let me highlight a few recent develop   one strike common stori now emerg to explain what is keep sale growth at least modest posit can be sum up in one word  discount   all the anecdot report on retail sale  auto sale  tourism  hotel occup  cruis book  and airlin traffic indic that deep discount is be use to bol  sale  with obvious implic for price and profit   let me cite just a coupl of exampl to underscor that point   hotel room in orlando near disney world can now be book for     a day   delta airlin senior execut tell me that while deep discount leisur travel is hold up well  there is a substanti drop off in busi travel  which combin with higher energi price compar with      and      is caus their negat return  truck firm are report engag in cutthroat competit  slash mileag charg to get freight busi   and concern is now be express that a signific number of truck compani failur seem all but certain   of cours  retail and auto dealer have been resort to sale discount program and rebat to liquid excess inventori  we are also get more and more report that compani are cut perk and other discretionari expens to protect profit   cut are even hit execut entertain   some of you may know that bird hunt is one of the long  favorit sport of good old boy execut            in the south  it   s a favorit execut ritual when it come to entertain   one of the prefer place to go quail hunt is a plantat in florida that cater to execut of fortun     compani   occup rate at that plantat typic run    or    percent and reserv are book a year in advanc   cancel rate for repeat custom usual are less than   percent   but this year i m told that cancel have near doubl to    percent and are report come from cutback by steel and chemic industri execut and their guest   of cours  those two segment have been among the poorest perform and those industri have been particular advers affect by the appreci of the dollar  while it s true that growth has slow  it   s also true that growth is decid more uneven across industri and among differ state in our region   florida s economi is both the largest and strongest and georgia is hold it own  while tennesse  mississippi  alabama  and louisiana are suffer   tennesse is experienc anoth year of veri serious budget problem and the governor and the legislatur can t agre on a budget again this year   someon recent remark in frustrat that tennesse is fast becom the argentina of the unit state  the district continu to see contract in technolog job   this has result in addit commerci leas space come back on the market  ad to an alreadi excess suppli   manufactur firm continu to cut job  and this is especi hurt mississippi  whose economi is more manufactur depend than other state in the district  final  there are indic that our aggress polici eas move have had veri littl impact on busi invest spend   at the same  e  compani such as delta airlin and some of our truck contact indic that they have not curtail their invest plan signific in term of cancel order for new plane or vehicl   in fact they say they            are use this period of slow sale to acceler the retir of older equip  which suggest to me that the exist stock is becom more effici   a similar stori hold for util in the southeast  whose invest plan have not been affect so much by rate  howev  they have acceler the phase out of older plant   more util capac is be brought into place than is warrant by prospect new demand  report becaus regulatori constraint are less than in the west  not all is bad  howev   besid the relat strength in singl famili hous  we   re begin to pick up some hint  and i emphas that these are onli hint  that the declin in activ may have begun to bottom out   some banker  for exampl  are report that their older and more tradit custom are begin to consid new spend and are make inquiri at least about the possibl for addit fund  on the nation front  it s easi to becom impati wait for our previous polici move to have their desir effect   one has to be concern about the uncertainti regard where the forecast rebound in gdp  which as other have said is be push back to the first and second quarter of next year  will actual come from   clear  with capac util continu to fall  invest  except perhap invest in new power generat  is unlik to make a sharp rebound   nor   a rebound in inventori invest seem immin   it   s also hard to imagin a sudden spurt in consum spend  which is alreadi reason healthi relat to the under fundament   final  given the slowdown abroad  much of which is itself a fallout from the paus in our own economi  we can   t expect much help from the foreign sector   my conclus is that the risk remain on the downsid   the recoveri appear to be more gradual than we had hope and is not like to be led by ani one particular sector  this bring me to my polici concern   the near term outlook is still not pretti and a            good case can  and i   m sure will  be made for further eas   at the same  e  i think a good case can be made for patienc and caution   i remain bother by the rapid growth in the monetari aggreg  which is not fulli explain   and i believ that we have alreadi put suffici liquid into the system to support sustain consum demand and to bring the economi back to a desir growth rate without too much inflat risk   but my fear is that we   ll get trap into follow an implicit polici rule that say we   ll keep cut rate until the real economi turn around  that is not what i believ we should do for two reason   first  as we have all remind ourselv as well as other  monetari polici is a blunt instrument   accord  succumb to the temptat to tri to adjust problem in one segment of the economi  in this case high tech and other busi invest  may in fact over s ul other sector  caus addit imbal to appear   i interpret the surg in home price over the last year as an indic that consum    liquid fund have been shift toward that sector  second  i   m also concern that a lower feder fund rate and consider liquid in the bank system have ad to the high proport of loan leverag by hous collater  this lend has been s ul by the perceiv high valu of home and the lower rate on home equiti loan   lower rate further may simpli encourag more home equiti lend and more sub prime lend to margin borrow most at risk to lose their job should the downsid risk in the economi materi   in short  i believ there is real risk of put too much eas in the system   and i fear  as other have alreadi suggest  that circumst may make it difficult to revers cours quick   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   as the economi transit from a            period of unaccept slow growth to a more reason pace of activ  we should expect to see the data shift from predomin bad news to a mixtur of some posit and some negat observ on the state of the economi   this ought to be true at both the region and the nation level   i can report that this is what has character our district over the last coupl of month   but the ratio of good news to bad news is not improv as quick as i had hope  when we met in may  i was abl to report a slowli improv condit in the third district  sinc then the news has been decid mix and inde less posit than expect   our june indic of econom activ remain flat in pennsylvania and turn down in new jersey and delawar   our busi outlook survey of manufactur in our region  which had improv in june  retreat in both juli and august   the indic of new order  employ  and the averag workweek all took a turn for the wors this month  while the index of shipment show onli a slight improv but remain negat  our manufactur continu to pare inventori and they do not see the inventori correct end soon   they expect to continu cut inventori over the next six month   in contrast  our survey of retail and other non manufactur firm show that they have success work off ani inventori overhang   yet they remain vigil in their order to avoid a return to excess inventori   in a special question  we ask our respond to what extent the high valu of the dollar had affect their busi   almost half of the firm report that they had been hurt by the dollar   s strength  and    percent said signific so  labor market condit in the region have weaken somewhat   payrol employ edg down in the second quarter in the three state in our district   the unemploy rate move up but remain below that for the nation   retail sale  exclud auto  were flat in juli  residenti real estat market remain activ  although the sale of both new and exist            home have been run below last year   s pace   our banker report that residenti mortgag refinanc activ remain at a fair high level and that they are activ seek new busi borrow among well capit firm   loan qualiti remain relat good  the mix news has caus peopl to re evalu their expect about the futur  op  about the outlook has turn down a bit  with busi contact anticip slow improv at best dure the rest of the year   our staff   s view continu to be that region econom growth will pick up somewhat toward the end of the year but that the pickup might come later than previous thought  our view on the nation economi is similar   manufactur remain weak as   the broad technolog sector   neither situat is like to improv soon   by contrast  the hous market remain robust and consum spend remain moder to good   and there are sign that labor market condit have stabil   the recent data revis help reconcil some of what we see in the economi   the substanti fa  growth of labor compens than previous thought help to explain the abil of consum to continu spend  and the downward revis of profit help to explain the retrench in invest  on the downsid  the econom situat abroad has deterior sinc our last meet   in mani place in the world  econom condit are prove to be more problemat than expect and clear less conduc to a world recoveri than i would like   given the interdepend natur of our economi  we must remain cogniz of these extern factor and their possibl implic for u s  econom activ go forward  we know that we should onli now be feel the first     basi point of eas we put in place in januari  given the lag in the effect of monetari polici   it   s too soon to see the effect of the addit     basi point that came later in the year   likewis  the fiscal s ulus            is onli now begin to come on line   tax rebat check start arriv in juli  with further tax cut to come later   this plus the fact that the data come in with a lag suggest that it   s not unreason that the indic are give us a mix view of the economi at this point   that said  i must admit that midway through the third quarter i would feel more comfort if i could point to some definit posit sign that a turnaround in the economi is under way
mr  chairman  the tenth district   s economi continu weak  manufactur remain in a slump in our area   accord to our bank   s most recent manufactur survey  activ declin again in juli  move well below year ago level  inventori were also down substanti and a signific fraction of firm said they plan to continu reduc inventori over the next six month   one bright spot is that the capit spend project did not deterior further  consum spend held steadi in most of our district  as it has elsewher in the nation   i continu to hear that consum are becom increas valu conscious  though  so discount store are enjoy the stronger sale at the expens of other retail   residenti construct remain stabl   home sale are solid in most of our citi  although inventori of unsold home are creep up   throughout the district there is weak in the demand for high price home  though  and that is tell in some area  particular denver   commerci real estat is show sign of soften further   offic vacanc rate continu to rise in both denver and kansa citi  as busi in both citi cut back on their expans plan   there is still a substanti amount of construct in the pipelin but the surg in vacanc is caus develop to have some second thought  the energi sector remain a bright spot in our district   even with the recent eas in            oil and gas price  the rig count grew again in juli   labor market have eas further   layoff announc remain high  although they have come down a bit from earlier in the year  reflect the sluggish economi  inflationari pressur continu to subsid in our area   onli one of the employ we contact said that it had grant abov normal wage increas recent  as mention earlier by presid  n  condit in the farm economi have improv   that sector has been help not onli by some price increas but also by the recent packag that was approv for aid to the farm industri   our project now show that farm incom on the nation level will increas about   percent this year  so some spend should accompani that  let me turn to my view on the nation outlook   it is noteworthi that while we continu to adjust our outlook  both the valu and the  e horizon  our staff as well as the  book staff still see as the most like outcom that the economi should strengthen toward potenti over the next few quarter   therefor  it strike me that the issu is   do we continu with the current easi polici or do we eas further at this  e   i say polici is easi as we might measur it  use monetari growth and the real fed fund rate compar to the equilibrium natur rate that has been es    i would add that from what i can tell  our last generat of experi suggest that it take about four to five quarter from the start of an eas period for the eas to have an impact that we can see in term of gdp growth  this suggest that we are probabl on track toward elimin the cyclic weak that now exist   but in our view of the outlook  we obvious have some rather serious risk   the incom data are clear mix and it   s hard to do noth when the data are mix   i would add that the foreign sector is weaker  and weaker than mani had anticip             and that most certain add to the downsid risk for us to consid   i think all this is complic to a degre by the difficulti of separ out the structur factor in our economi that are weak  and will stay weak regardless of our short term monetari polici  from the cyclic factor   so in some way our difficulti today is to determin whether we are be  if i may use this term  cyclic correct    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   first  a note on agricultur   corn crop in the region are come in veri strong  as evidenc in the last coupl of week by roadsid sign offer a dozen ear of fresh pick corn for    cent   i thought that was a real bargain until i went across lake eri to ontario and saw outsid a store larg crate of corn with a sign that said    free fresh pick corn   take all you want       laughter   i don   t know what the purchas power pariti of this mean  a year ago at this  e we were hear more quick about weak in the area that we serv than i think was the case in other part of the countri   that may have been a reflect of the rise energi price  we are veri energi intens in mani way in a lot of our sector and industri   and other factor were at work  certain in the case of metal   i didn   t go back to check but i don   t recal that our beig book descript of condit in the district was as negat as what i was hear from director and advisori council member at that  e   but this  e i did look at our beig book to compar it with the report i was get from our director and advisori council  and it seem a bit out of sync   so at the begin of august i sent a letter to all current small busi advisori council member and to about    or so former member who are in manufactur compani and nonresidenti construct to tri to get a sens of their view   all of the respons were come in last week and we also met then            with our director   the assess of condit in the district by these contact was not as negat as our beig book report   certain  portion of manufactur in the district are still weak   some of the big compani like  ken and diebold are still report weak   but a lot of the smaller firm are not   outsid of metal  the tone was much more upbeat than what i had been hear  we contact everi motor vehicl assembl plant in the district  includ those for truck  as well as everi part supplier and ask      how   it look  come into the second half      ford is veri weak  ford kept sever plant idl  main those produc commerci van and minivan  but the rest are strong   toyota and honda are run flat out  well abov last year  and both gm and chrysler are oper at level abov last year and they remain op ist   so at least from our district   s perspect  the motor vehicl sector  sn   t look as negat as the board staff is assum in it forecast  becaus of the articl i mention last  e about the corrug box industri be a lead indic  we also contact    corrug box supplier in the district and ask how thing look   those that suppli main consum product compani in the district  such as proctor and gambl  are do quit well   those that suppli motor vehicl or metal relat industri or tech firm are not do near as well  and certain not as well as last year  construct is still strong in our region   residenti construct  of cours  is veri strong everywher  but our contact in the nonresidenti sector say that public work and util also are continu to expand   in kentucki our contact report about a   percent increas for the first half of the year versus a year ago   in we n ohio and indiana  nonresidenti construct is up    percent from a year ago   our contact note that multi famili hous  well  that   get into residenti  was especi strong  up    percent   but            they say it s the health care sector that is provid them with a lot of new contract   as for other nonresidenti construct  such as highway and bridg construct  sever compani say that their problem is just a matter of get labor to fulfil their contract   most their complaint are about the lack of skill labor to oper the type of construct equip that they are now employ  a produc of air curtain in we n pennsylvania inform us that juli was the best month in the compani s histori by a big margin  both domest and foreign demand has been strong   we also contact a compani that produc control for industri motor and suppli to firm throughout the unit state as well as around the world   their stori may be more a comment on technolog and what s in store for futur capit spend rather than just general busi   our contact said that for the first half of the year their busi was up over    percent versus a year ago   they attribut that to the fact that they implement an e busi on line order system that has allow them to increas their product sinc the begin of      by about    to    percent across all product line   they say that    percent of their oper now involv order that are come in on line for just in  e deliveri   they have been abl to decreas their price across product line by   to    percent while increas their profit margin and they have been expand their workforc becaus of the strength of their busi   their expect is that they won t be abl to sustain all of this becaus they expect their competitor to implement these same kind of technolog and close the gap that they believ they now enjoy  compani that suppli equip for the health care sector say they are do veri well  as are those that are involv in larg  high autom  and veri expens coal mine equip   the problem for the latter is get labor to work the veri sophist coal mine            machineri  some of which cost    million per machin   busi for a compani that produc titanium part for the aerospac industri is up    percent versus last year   and their sale of part to the medic industri  knee joint and that sort of thing  are up    percent   that firm has five open for machinist but no qualifi applic   pittsburgh plate glass sale to the aerospac and hous sector are strong but sale to the motor vehicl industri are weak  the retail sector had been veri negat but turn better in earli august   some of our director  especi from feder and other retail compani  were veri bearish   they are hope now that the back to school sale are go to be better than they had plan for come into the second half of the year  repres from the school district in north ohio in particular said that they have a lot of unfil teacher posit as the back to school period arriv  school start last week in our area of the countri  and they cite aggress recruit of ohio teacher by california school as one reason   in respons  ohio school are go to recruit in india    laughter  on the inflat front  tuition is up   to    percent at almost all of the public colleg and univers in the district   we might be abl to justifi some of the increas in medic care cost as qualiti improv  but i doubt that   s true in higher educ    laughter  on the nation economi  midway through this third quarter it now appear that from a broad gdp perspect  the second half is go to be slower than had been hope at the begin of the year   but it   s notabl that two veri import sector of the economi  hous and motor vehicl  have been consider stronger than had been expect at the start of the year   moreov  employ has held up better than expect   the unemploy rate is lower than had been fear   and what appear to be a danger destabil situat in natur gas and electr power six or seven month ago has eas dramat   even the current account            deficit in the first half came in much smaller than expect   now  it is true that inventori plung much more dramat than had been expect  but that s not necessarili a bad thing  we were told that steel inventori are down dramat becaus of a    percent drop in import  the biggest miss in most forecast was in busi fix invest  the same categori that account for the tendenc of forecast to underes  the strength in the prior expans   risk outsid the unit state seem to have intensifi  argentina  japan  and even the euro area are all consider risk   and there is no doubt that event will occur to which we will have to respond   but the solut to those develop in advanc of their occurr are not go to be influenc by whether the u s  overnight interbank rate is a littl higher or a littl lower   there must come a  e when we have to demonstr confid that with patienc the magic of the marketplac will again produc bigger gdp number   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district economi has weaken further recent  while both finish good inflat and input cost pressur have continu to reced   much of the weak is still concentr in manufactur  but other sector have shown sign of slow as well   in juli  privat sector payrol employ was virtual unchang in new york state but fell at rough a   percent pace in new jersey   we can t realli alloc that between toni santomero   s part of new jersey and my part of new jersey  so i think we tend to doubl cover it  but that s the fifth straight drop  while manufactur has sustain the steepest job loss over the past year  weak in both june and juli was fair broad base across industri   even the construct industri  which had been an engin of job growth  has shed job at an annual rate of rough   percent sinc            peak in march   disconcert  employ in new york citi s critic financi servic sector has now declin for four consecut month  with virtual daili headlin of veri larg scale reduct in staff  retail sale were describ as sluggish in june and juli  though the heat wave in earli august boost sale of air condition  swimwear  and other hot weather merchandis  retail continu to report a weak price environ  with most of our respond indic that both sell price and merchandis cost are flat to lower   while retail wage pressur report remain subdu  contact continu to note fair brisk escal in health benefit and util cost   the buffalo area in new york state is particular weak   and siena colleg   s survey of new york state resid  which tend to be reason accur  report that consum confid fell sharpli in juli both upstat and in the new york citi area  more than eras the gain in may and june   juli   s level is the lowest in the survey   s       year histori  construct and real estat activ have been mix   the commerci sector remain sluggish and pocket of weak have emerg in the residenti segment  but the tone remain rather posit  consid that   manufactur and purchas manag report that busi condit weaken in juli  while price pressur reced   new york citi hotel occup rate and room rate fell signific in the second quarter from a year ago   a lot of tourist continu to come to new york citi but they don t seem to be spend as much or stay as long as previous   inflat in the area reced in juli  main due to a downturn in energi price  and it is about on a par with the nation averag   banker report steadi loan demand  rise delinqu rate  and tighter credit standard   condit appear to be somewhat more favor in the residenti mortgag segment of their busi  on the nation level  we think the near term outlook is for sluggish growth at best             we expect that third quarter growth could be about   percent  but that s put a lot of faith in the monetari polici eas in the pipelin and in the check come from the u s  treasuri  with littl data so far for the quarter  there is certain a veri great deal of uncertainti about this short term growth outlook  longer term we expect  as   the  book  that the outlook will brighten some  with gdp growth rebound to over       percent in q  and in        we have taken a first look at      and it look as if growth will remain at about the same pace into that year   that will put growth below what we believ is potenti  so the unemploy rate will rise   we think it will go up to about   percent by the end of        we have a rather benign forecast for inflat  we expect the pce deflat to be about       per cent in      and to drop down to about   percent in        so those who are look for a minor improv in inflat may just have their wish fulfil  in the short term we think that the downsid risk are quit sever and that there realli is a signific risk of a recess   weak household consumpt and aggreg demand rais the possibl that the inventori correct will last longer and that busi invest will declin even more than we current expect   moreov  weak in foreign economi could exacerb that situat   we could have a vicious circl that produc a recess in the near term and in the longer term a continu of the sluggish economi we ve seen over the past year   on the other hand  the combin of monetari eas and fiscal polici could have a greater than expect impact  result in a surg in aggreg demand   howev  we think that prospect is veri much less like  let me talk briefli about the intern situat  particular about two area  asia and argentina   you may have notic in this morn s paper that chines premier zhu was            make a tour of southern china   you may rememb that deng xiaop announc a major chang in polici in china by a tour of southern china   i think the most signific thing that premier zhu said is that the chines should do anyth to improv their export   now  if true  and he tend not to say thing that he  sn t mean  that could veri well be the last thing that is need for non japan  non china countri of asia   china   not realli compet veri much with the rest of asia on tech export  but tech export in that area are alreadi decim  howev  the chines can clean everybodi s clock in everi other area of export becaus the fact is that they can bring their price down to wherev they want them to be and are abl to compet at ani price level   they simpli have to move a factori     mile farther into interior china and pay close to noth for the cost of labor   so that plan  if carri forward  is a rather frighten prospect for the alreadi weaken economi of asia  the former    tiger     on argentina  by chanc in my state depart year in the mid     s i was in the offic of region econom polici and one of the countri i was suppos to look out for was argentina   so it s a place i ve known reason well for almost    year   i think a crisi in argentina is like to be signific differ from most crise   if it would remind us of anyth  it would be closer to what we   ve seen in indonesia   the reason is this   the currenc board was not brought in by presid menem becaus some econom professor told him that it was an import piec of econom theori   he brought it in becaus he inherit about       percent annual inflat   his predecessor had to leav offic earli as soon as menem   s elect was certifi   so menem brought in the currenc board becaus he realiz  as a brilliant politician  that he had to import disciplin in order to get argentina function   but he engag in a kind of wish think in hope that at some stage the econom star would align themselv so that argentina could get out of the convert arrang and the peso would            strengthen   well  that never quit happen   my concern is that if the present regim collaps  which it well might  we re not go to see a brazilian type situat where the currenc undergo a signific devalu and the social situat manag itself reason well   i fear that we will see someth that is truli chaotic  with riot in the street and a veri unpredict outcom in the congression elect in octob  now  one of the thing that argentina is extraordinarili good at is blame other peopl for it problem   in the cours of the last week they   ve alreadi set the stage for that  accord to the econom minist  peopl in washington have been espous default and devalu for argentina   the fact that that isn t true is not enorm relev   and if we have a realli good size problem in argentina  i think it is like to have a much bigger effect on the world economi than the size of the argentin economi would indic  rather as russia  with a gdp the size of norway  did in        to me the real downsid risk is that  despit the greatest possibl intent of everybodi involv to help argentina yet again  if it is deem not to have work there will be question  in this background of a veri weak economi  about the qualiti of the financi econom leadership in the world   now onc again  that would probabl be a bad assess   there s noth wrong with the qualiti of econom manag in the world   but with this veri weak econom climat  if that percept were real  i think we could have some veri chaotic financi market   of cours  that is not someth we can anticip through monetari polici   howev  i think what we ought to do with monetari polici today is rather clear   and in the veri short period ahead  i believ we could have some veri serious damag control requir come our way   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the committe is face with            the question of whether or not to accept and adopt the  book s baselin forecast  which frank  given where we are start is a relat attract forecast   it point to a return of the economi to it downward revis potenti growth for the forecast horizon  with pce inflat remain contain   op ist  inde some peopl at this tabl  have alreadi point to some tentat sign that the economi has bottom   one of those relat posit sign is the trend in first  e claim for unemploy benefit  which have fallen below         for four consecut week   other have point to homebuild  which as measur by hous start rose at the fastest pace in    month   it is true also that retail sale came in surpris strong when adjust for fall gasolin price   and our own ip data can be and have been read by some as indic that industri product has begun to stabil  unfortun  i do not think ani of these data  particular given the fact that they are onli one month   s worth  have been suffici strong to be indic of a bottom much less a like return to more robust growth   they are certain not strong enough to give us much comfort or to support the view that we should do noth at this meet   an outcom such as the baselin is actual more hope than realiti at this stage  and in make polici i think we would be well advis to put signific odd on an advers outcom for aggreg demand  particular capit spend   some of the evid in that direct includ our own beig book  which indic ongo weak  as well as the staff   s forecast  which was again revis down in the face of weaker than expect incom data   though consum spend has been a bastion of strength  as other have note  mount job loss and a declin stock market perform could inde threaten to weaken consum behavior   the profit outlook is certain not yet firm  which indic that busi invest is unlik to return to robust growth in the near to intermedi term and inde may weaken further   while busi have            opportunist liquefi their balanc sheet  the demand for loan is off  again suggest that busi sens no need to invest for an upturn in futur demand   and our earlier concern about weak oversea are clear start to materi  in part due to weak here and in part due to the general high tech retrench that is influenc a larg number of economi  in my view the forecast of a turnaround oversea is again base more on a question of what should be as oppos to what appear like  in the face of all this weak and the sens that the risk  at least in my mind  are to the downsid  some have argu that we should probabl do noth   there could be a number of reason adduc for not respond to the recent data  which have been weaker than we expect  or for not respond to the downward adjust in the forecast   one of those reason is that polici work with long lag and we might be stoke the fire of futur inflat  we cannot be complac here  but for the risk of futur inflat to becom an immedi and overrid polici concern today we must believ that one of two state is go to emerg  the first of those state is that the economi is go to rebound so quick that we   ll be unabl to adjust polici  which would impli either that we won   t be abl to read the incom data or that we won t have the fortitud to respond to them   i think both of those thing are unlik   the second state that would warrant favor no polici action today is that we are worri that the labor market tight we have seen is not like to abat and we believ that inflat is go to rise even in the face of below trend growth   now the extrem version of this view is so call stagflat   i think we ve had onli one case of stagflat  and that one case was driven by a surpris increas in oil price   so it seem that we are unlik to face great stagflat risk becaus i believ we   re unlik to get a surpris on the oil price front or ani other shock that would throw the economi way off in term of creat pressur for a sudden            uptick in inflat   a third risk is that inflat might pick up gradual over  e   at this stage that seem to me far less of a polici concern than that weak itself will becom more widespread and longer last  now  there is a second school of argument against respond to the incom data and the downward revis in the forecast   that second school of argument say that frequent rate chang add to uncertainti and that our accompani statement creat a negat psycholog  in fact  i think market have built in an expect of a fed eas today and i believ the uncertainti would be greater if we didn t respond to the incom data than if we move forward and reduc rate   i would also say that  rather than ad to consum malais  honest statement of a central bank  even if they are not reassur  build credibl far more than would a fals sens of op    so i think it s quit import that our statement reflect realiti as we see it and the risk as we understand them  a third argument that has been adduc against lower rate at this meet is that reduc rate over s ul a few sector   again  this is plausibl  in fact  it s true   it reflect the fact that interest rate adjust clear work through their impact on interest sensit sector   when we rais rate  hous is hurt  when we lower rate  hous is help   by influenc asset price and activ in interest sensit sector  we influenc the entir economi   we should not refus to act becaus we do not like the transmiss mechan of monetari polici   if we were to follow that approach  we would obvious be tie both hand behind our back  i believ the final argument against adjust rate at this meet is that we may in fact find that rate are too s ul and thus that we are over s ul the economi   in that regard we should recogn  as we think about the rang of the es  equilibrium real rate             that the actual equilibrium real rate would gradual go down as the economi weaken   so the degre of s ulus actual start to decreas if we keep rate unchang in the face of a weaken economi  let me conclud by say that in my judgment the baselin forecast is a hope more than a realiti  the risk are certain to the downsid  and the argument against move rate down at this polici meet strike me as far weaker than the argument in favor of move them
thank you  mr  chairman   i m go to offer a few bit of anecdot inform that complement thing that have alreadi been said  but i will tri not to duplic what is alreadi on the tabl   my up and fedex contact both report that much of the world is not do veri well  though they were both fair op ist about europ   my up contact said that from januari to june up busi in europ had grown at doubl digit rate   growth was slow down a bit now  but they still expect it to be posit   my fedex contact report that europ was the one area where growth continu  he also report doubl digit growth in export out of europ and busi within europ   and he was veri op ist that growth in fedex busi was go to continu at an   to    percent rate in europ   both compani are trim capit spend somewhat   my up contact said that major cutback are take place in the airlin industri in general and that cargo segment were be cut   from taiwan to the unit state and from japan to the unit state  capac is be cut   both compani report a signific amount of substitut away from the premium express busi into the more standard ship busi  which would be consist with effort all around to econom  my contact at wal mart said that his compani   s preliminari experi with the tax            rebat was that about    to    percent of the check cash at wal mart  wal mart is cash those check at no charg  are be spent on the spot at the store   he also note that wal mart find labor market condit still tight for sale associ   obvious  that is a minimum wage or slight abov minim wage posit  and appar the eas of the labor market in the higher paid occup is not show up at all in the market for sale associ   he said it s just as difficult as it was a year ago to hire peopl   retent is up  but they still have problem fill vacant posit   i thought that was rather interest   he also emphas the pressur that wal mart see from health care cost  those cost are go to be up    to    percent this year and the increas may be wors next year   he note that one develop in that area is the spread of legisl restrict that make it more and more difficult for firm to appli restrict on pre exist condit   so the compani that have relat generous health care benefit are find what i guess might be call    advers select    against them   peopl who know they have pre exist condit will tri to gain employ in those firm  on a more general note  for me the issu today is not whether substanti monetari s ulus is in place   i m convinc that it is   the question is not whether that s ulus is go to have an effect  but when   i think it s a  e issu   i ve been interest in the fact that longer term interest rate have not come down  or have come down onli in the last week or two  the ten year rate is still essenti where it was in decemb   it   s veri easi  use the ten year strip  to decompos that rate into various matur   so i put togeth a tabl show the   to   year part of it  the    to   year forward rate  and the    to    year forward rate   let me just read you a few number   in august of last year  the    to    year forward rate extract from the strip was     percent   at the end of decemb  it was     percent   as of friday  it was     percent   the    to    year matur has been hang up there fair high   what has happen is            that the declin we   ve seen in the    year rate is due almost entir to declin in the   to   year part and mayb somewhat to declin in the    to   year part  now  what   one make of a situat where the    to    year forward rate is unaffect by all that has gone on in the last year   incident  befor i tri to speak to that question  let me say that a lot of our idea about the lag come from experi where the longer rate do follow the short rate to a veri signific extent   look at the histor data  over a six month period everi percentag point drop in the feder fund rate general will be accompani by a drop in the    year rate of about    or    basi point  that s the averag experi   so one of the reason whi we   re perhap not see as much result as we might expect is that a lot of the effect typic is come out of hous   hous remain on a high plateau and mortgag interest rate realli haven t come down sinc decemb   there was a substanti declin last year but not much this year  i interpret the maintain level of the    to    year forward rate  whether it s high or not is a differ matter  as reflect a market convict that the longer run growth potenti for the economi has not been affect by the event of the last year   the market view is that we are go through a period of adjust   and after all  this is a posit that mani peopl around this tabl have state   we have help to reinforc that convict   whether it s right or not  we don t realli know   but i think there are lot of reason to be op ist about that  if that view is correct  i think it s logic to expect that the demand for the technolog equip that is necessari for achiev product gain is go to have to resum   that demand is go to resum becaus otherwis we   re not go to get the product that is impli by this outlook for the economi   there was over expans in that industri and there are some backlog to be work off   but most of that equip has a rather            short use life   a normal depreci period for a pc is three year or someth like that   so the backlog is go to be work off and that demand will be come back  suppos that view  our outlook and my interpret of the market   s outlook and whi the    to    year forward rate remain as high as it is  is not correct and potenti growth in fact goe back more toward the dreari level that we had from  say       to        if that happen  then we   re go to end up with a lot more inflationari pressur than we current anticip  the reason is that we   re not go to be get the product growth and there   s a lot of inertia in compens and wage process  i just offer those idea   but i will emphas that the recent behavior of the long end of the market relat to the short end is a veri  veri unusu experi   if you look at the data from the korean war on  just put some column on a spread sheet  you will convinc yourself that this is a veri  veri unusu period   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   a few meet ago i made the comment that the economi was suscept to chronic and acut risk  the chronic risk of rise inflat and the acut risk of recess   the comment drew some chuckl and peopl told me afterward that they like the analog   the onli problem is that now  with the wisdom of hindsight  my statement  sn   t look so good becaus the recess risk are also prove to be chronic   for some month now both offici and privat forecast have been project that a turnaround in demand growth is immin  that the economi will recov  and that econom growth will get back on track   while there have bright spot this year  for the most part that turnaround just has not materi   overal condit seem rough as weak now as they did earlier in the year  despit signific expansionari dose of both monetari and fiscal polici and            a cut in energi price   the forecast recoveri has been push back and push back again  it alway seem to be just around the corner but never quit here   no doubt at some point there realli will be a turnaround  but our patienc is be sever test  we   ve talk about these point of weak for sever meet now and there   s no need to belabor the issu   probabl the most serious question is the profit outlook   until profit expect recov  it   s hard to see a strong turnaround in busi invest   inde  the staff show ye day that the profit outlook for technolog share in the s p index has drop so rapid that that portion of the s p is again show high price earn ratio  possibl foreshadow more declin in stock price  the intern sector is also grow increas worrisom   there seem to be no demand growth driver anywher in the world   the standard intern forecast   show a recoveri   but the main sourc of futur strength  if we can call it that  in the world economi seem to be that the unit state has such a high incom elast for import that if our economi recov  it will pull up demand for our trade partner   one can be forgiven for consid this a rather weak reed  the steadi beat of disappoint news is take it toll on expect  so much so that the beig book got lot of play in the press a coupl of week ago  with report that econom malais was begin to spread from manufactur to sector such as offic space  truck  and ship servic   in some sens these report were not all that remark  after all  slowdown would be expect to spread   but the negat expect have becom so pervas after these report that the beig book had much more impact than it normal    even the gdp revis had an impact   as     point out earlier  the gdp revis did not chang inflat or the output gap  so there was no first order impact on monetari            polici   but the bea did write down growth in recent year  take a big slice out of both capit invest and profit   the profit chang could indirect caus problem on the demand side  given the prevail weak in profit expect   the invest chang hurt on the suppli side  lower the capit deepen compon of product chang and es  of potenti growth over the next few year   this is not  to be sure  a true structur product chang becaus the alter was due to capit put in place  which we alreadi knew was cyclic weak   but it   s still disappoint to see this product growth spurt that we all took such pride in be part undon with new data  let me say a word about lag  a few of you have mention those   lag for monetari polici are long   they are also variabl   it strike me that at this  e in this cycl it becom veri difficult to read exact where we are in the process of monetari lag   long rate  and this is similar to what bill pool just said  actual went down last fall befor we start lower short rate   so if the drop in long rate was go to have some effect  it should be work through the system alreadi   anoth channel through which monetari polici work is the dollar  and as was report earlier  the dollar hadn   t realli gone down until a coupl of week ago   the third channel is equiti market   if anybodi know how to interpret the equiti market  pleas come forward and say your piec   so i think that the question of exact where we are in this monetari lag cycl is after all rather complic   i think the notion of just say    well  we start lower rate eight month ago  so the effect ought to be come through now    is at best oversimplifi   on the fiscal side  we have talk a lot about the tax cut   but there is an offset factor involv becaus a lot of state have gotten into fiscal difficulti as a result of the develop that are go on throughout the countri and some state are actual rais tax  offset the feder tax cut            there are still bright spot   hous has been consist strong   price earn ratio on most stock have been reason stabl   consumpt  as has been note  has held up well   the turnaround could still be right around the corner   moreov  in my view this has not been a  e of polici mistak   monetari polici  as i think most of us would agre  has follow rough the proper path  get rate down earli and signific   but given the prolong slowdown  which ani day we might begin to call chronic  there   seem to be a need for a monetari boo  shot   thank you
the previous  book project some strengthen in growth in the fourth quarter and a recoveri to growth near trend and to a level of output near potenti in        and i believ there was a sens of agreement that if the forecast stabil  that forecast provid a strong case for hold polici unchang after last meet   s move   on the other hand  the pattern this year has been a continu seri of downward revis to the forecast  follow by addit eas move in an effort to restor the earlier forecast for        so the first question i ask myself as i prepar for today   s meet were     has the forecast stabil     and    is the forecast for      still line up to a reason approxim on trend growth and full employ      the answer will help me to assess both the need for further eas and the room to maneuv  or the threat of overshoot in eas further  this assess  howev  is complic  as     note in his present  by the nipa and product revis   the outlook context for monetari polici decis in my view is best view in term of growth in actual output relat to potenti and in term of util rate   from this perspect  the growth rate for      and      in the  book forecast were mark down just about in line with the staff   s downward revis to trend growth             therebi virtual replic the previous  book   s project for the unemploy rate and inflat   so if the stori is still that forc are in train that will move the economi to recoveri and that the recoveri will put the economi near full employ and trend growth next year  it   s hard to see the need for further eas or the room to maneuv  but to tell the truth  the stori  sn   t feel entir right   there remain a tension between the evid of persist weak in the incom data and the stori of recoveri   the question we face in each forecast round is how mani quarter lie between the data and the stori  and what we end up do again and again is insert one more quarter that look more like the previous weak quarter  in this case it   s the fourth quarter of this year  befor we get a transit quarter or two on the way to trend growth   at the veri least this pattern suggest that there are signific asymmetr risk on the downsid  in assess how much eas is appropri and whether we have done enough  anoth consider is import   declin in the feder fund rate have littl or no direct effect on aggreg demand but are an instrument for encourag a more accommod overal set of financi condit  as the lower short term rate pass through to lower longer term rate  to equiti price  and the dollar   in fact  and this is an issu that presid pool and governor   have just comment on  long term rate did not fall from their level at the  e we began to eas  at least until veri recent   furthermor  equiti price are signific lower and the dollar is higher  i ask the staff to run some simul with the frb us model to assess the effect of the cumul eas on overal financi condit   first  they began the simul in the first quarter of      and they held the real feder fund rate constant in the baselin forecast   in the altern scenario  they impos the path of the fund rate in the  book through                  they ran the altern scenario under two assumpt   in the first case  they assum the histor regular for pass through to longer term interest rate  equiti price  and the dollar  in the second  they constrain the latter variabl to follow their actual path through the last eas   the result indic that  assum histor regular  there would have been virtual no effect on real gdp through the second quarter   but real gdp would have been a percentag point higher by the end of this year and more than   percentag point higher by the end of        howev  given the actual path of financi variabl  the level of real gdp would be onli     percentag point higher at the end of this year and     percentag point higher by the end of        that is  instead of provid a power s ulus  the eas onli about offset the restraint come from declin equiti price and the appreci of the dollar  leav littl net s ulus from overal financi condit  the problem with this simul experi is that it fail to give the fed ani credit for the declin in interest rate in the second half of      in anticip of fed eas in       so the staff then redid the simul begin in the third quarter of last year   by august of last year  the feder fund futur indic the absenc of expect of ani chang in the fund rate over the next year   the declin in long term rate that follow reflect expect of subsequ fed eas   this approach count the declin in long term rate in the second half as part of the s ulus from the cumul eas   but the benefit of the lower long term rate were more than offset by the effect of the declin in equiti price in the second half of last year  so in somewhat of a surpris  to me at least  on net financi condit have actual becom more restrict rather than more s ul if we begin the account from mid       from the standpoint of monetari polici strategi  this rais the question of whether and how monetari polici should be adjust for variat in the pass through from the fund            rate to broader financi condit  episod by episod   if we make our polici judgment on the basi of the forecast  this adjust would natur occur   but it   rais a caution note about guidanc from outcom base polici rule that in effect are calibr off averag pass through  at ani rate  this analysi suggest some tension in the forecast   we all point to monetari polici as one of the forc promot recoveri and yet the analysi show that at best we may be run in place   to be sure  it also suggest that our aggress eas has prevent what otherwis might have been a slide into recess   howev  the recoveri in the  book must be base not on improv financi condit but on other forc in play  for exampl  the effect of lower energi price  more s ul fiscal polici  or perhap more import the natur forc for recoveri that follow the end of the inventori correct and the end of the retrench in high tech invest  while i worri  therefor  whether we are on the path to recoveri  i also worri about overshoot as well   it seem to me that the dynam of expans suggest an upward instabl to growth   in the dynam of cyclic swing in growth  it   s not that the economi return to trend growth after a slowdown or recess and stay there  but it natur move to abov trend growth   therefor  onc a recoveri is under way we may face the twin challeng of move monetari polici back to neutral in a  e fashion and contend with abov trend growth at a  e when inflat is a bit abov at least my long run target and the economi is alreadi oper at close to capac   further eas today will undoubt complic that adjust   but the failur to see traction from our move to date and the result downsid risk encourag take some risk of overshoot today and leav to tomorrow the task of return to neutral and avoid the inflationari consequ of ani overshoot
thank you  mr  chairman   as usual  by this  e our discuss has thorough dissect and evalu the economi  and littl remain to be ad   so pleas indulg a short  er for a few conclud rumin  first of all  it   s necessari to acknowledg  as almost everyon here has  signific disappoint in the data that have come in over the intermeet period   the main driver of this slowdown  capit overhang dri up capit expenditur  look no better   the inventori correct  to my great surpris  drag on still   the world econom outlook look even more bleak  with polit and financi tension threaten to exacerb the situat further  although hous somehow continu to levit  recent auto sale may be hint that the consum is tire  which could becom a serious concern  not everyth is negat  of cours   industri product and labor market condit may be stabil   the tax rebat check are flow  fed eas should be kick in  inventori balanc is come into view  and energi price are fall   nevertheless  on balanc one must be concern   at the last meet  there was specul that the balanc of risk might be move toward symmetri   at that  e  i expect to be firm in that camp by today   while i am inde edg in that direct  i   m not readi yet to drive down the tent peg and settl in   i   d like to  but i just can   t  shift the subject a bit  two strain of recent media comment strike me as wronghead   first there has been the suggest that monetari polici isn   t work   have these peopl given ani thought to what this economi might look like today if polici had not chang this year   if anyth  i   d suggest that polici has work more quick than usual and precis where it was need most  shore up consum and stock market confid   and            now the tradit lag impact of polici should start to be felt  second  one is alreadi start to hear complaint that a recoveri will be weak when it come   here again i wonder if our critic have ponder the implic of a strong rebound  given the veri high absolut level of activ that we have even today  i hope and expect that the recoveri will be moder   an earli boom begin from here would lead quick to major new problem  mr  chairman  in my view monetari polici is not part of the economi   s problem today   and go forward  i see monetari polici as have onli a margin role in the solut  at the first of this year a strong polici respons was critic and i   m proud of the way this committe respond at that  e   but now i feel that if we visibl but modest support the natur forc of recoveri and remain patient  we can be most effect  let me conclud where i began   obvious  on balanc thing are still weak   but i continu to believ in the mantra of recoveri initi by tax and interest rate cut and rebalanc inventori posit  aid by lower energi cost and now  perhap  a somewhat lower dollar  but we cannot ignor our serious invest collaps  a veri danger world situat  and the possibl of a tire consum   what realli concern me most of all is that we must remain concern at a  e when we expect to be relax a bit   it   s just possibl that we may have problem ahead of us that we do not yet see   at ani rate  we   re not out of the wood yet
thank you   coffe is avail   coffe break
let   s turn now to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you remark at the committe   s june meet and again today  the special characterist of the current slowdown are shape the appropri cours of monetari polici and it like effect             in particular  the major driver in this slowdown seem to have been a re evalu of the profit of new capit equip  especi high tech equip   in these circumst  lower interest rate are like to cushion the result declin in invest demand onli veri partial   import  though  polici eas work through the household sector  with lower interest rate bol  asset price and wealth and give more direct incent to spend by reduc the cost of acquir hous and household durabl good   polici action may also help to maintain consum confid   judg from the price of hous and from activ in hous market  and from the well maintain pace of consum durabl purchas  in this regard to date your eas action are inde have much of their predict and intend effect   and lower interest rate undoubt are keep equiti price from fall much more as earn disappoint   by bol  household spend  polici is lay the foundat for a recoveri in capit and inventori invest  work indirect through multipli and acceler mechan  but some of the characterist of the current episod do suggest that the     basi point of polici eas so far may not produc the same degre of strengthen in aggreg demand  at least for a  e  as a movement of similar size might have in the past   it is not that polici has been ineffect  that you are    push on a string      rather  declin in interest rate have been oper against some power and unusu forc of restraint   the  re evalu of capit profit seem to be produc a larger and more persist decreas in invest spend than in most busi cycl   and the larg revis to expect profit are reduc equiti price despit lower interest rate   moreov  becaus high tech product is spread wide around the world  so too has been the drop off in demand  output  and equiti wealth   with other economi also threaten  the dollar has not depreci in respons to polici eas so that foreign economi have not absorb ani of the weaken in demand in the unit state through the exchang rate channel   final  becaus household spend was never substanti depress  stock of hous and consum durabl probabl have not drop below desir level   this impli that the recoveri in spend onc the economi start to firm may be less ebulli than usual  sinc it will lack the extra push from the so call pent up demand from household often seen in the past  in these circumst  the feder fund rate may need to be lower for longer than you might have anticip to produc a return to sustain growth at around the economi   s potenti  these unusu restrain forc are part impound in our           measur of the equilibrium real feder fund rate  which as a result have declin appreci over the last year   henc  a portion of the decreas in the feder fund rate has been necessari just to keep polici from tighten relat to this yardstick   but our measur of r  in general do not reflect the full extent of these restraint on spend  the equilibrium rate we have been es  is a medium term concept  the real feder fund rate at which the economi eventu will produc at it potenti after temporari shock have worn off  thus  temporari shock  such as atyp asset price movement or weak invest relat to it longer term trend  tend not to be embodi in some or all of the measur we use   if those shock are larg or persist  as they seem to be at this  e  real rate will need to be held appreci below the rang of es  equilibrium rate for a while to fo  satisfactori econom perform   moreov  you may have reason to believ that the true rang for r  is lower than that given in the bluebook   most of those es  reli on the staff   s judgment about the nairu   if unemploy rate appreci below       percent are suffici to contain inflat  the equilibrium rate will be lower and the gap between it and the current real fund rate correspond smaller  a polici that eas substanti and leav the fund rate well below the es  equilibrium is not without potenti risk and drawback that a number of you also note at the last meet   some of you regret the degre and frequenc of variat in the feder fund rate adjust  you were concern  in part  that wide swing in the polici instrument would themselv creat uncertainti and unsettl market   but  appropri calibr  chang in the fund rate act as shock absorb  cushion the effect of real side disturb on aggreg output and price   and the larger the shock  the larger the necessari movement in your polici instrument   to be sure  polici can be excess activist  accentu busi cycl by react to perceiv shock that in practic ebb quick or by be insuffici forward look   but the most serious problem have occur when polici has been too sluggish  destabil the economi and financi market by allow inflationari or deflationari tendenc to cumul becaus the central bank act too littl   this is a major lesson that your predecessor took from their experi in the     s and that mani observ have drawn from the tepid respons of the bank of japan in the earli     s to the burst of the asset bubbl  a potenti more troublesom concern rais by have the real feder fund rate well below it equilibrium level is whether polici can be tighten in a  e enough manner to forestal the emerg of higher inflat   in the current circumst  inflat pressur that might be difficult to head off could aris were demand to strengthen            veri consider befor long or cost begin to push up price even in a relat weak economi   other thing equal  the wider the feder fund rate gap  the greater this risk would seem to be   and balanc this possibl against the possibl that the weak in the economi could be deeper or more prolong than anticip or than need to keep inflat in check would seem to be at the nub of your decis today  the staff forecast could be seen as describ a rough balanc between these two possibl  at an unchang stanc of polici   in that forecast  polici is accommod enough to get growth in gdp back to the rate of increas in it potenti by next year  with the help of fiscal s ulus  lower energi price  and the inher tendenc of aggreg demand to expand at it longer term growth rate   as dave   emphas  though project growth of actual output has been revis down appreci in the forecast  so too has been the growth of potenti  leav the output gap and the inflat outlook not much differ than in the june  book   while the result is a small margin of excess capac in the labor market in the second half of next year  with unit labor cost alreadi have pick up  some slack may be need insur to counter the price pressur associ with the more rapid trend in compens  the recent slow of structur product growth  and the consequ narrow of profit margin  core pce inflat is held about constant in the staff forecast  at a rate a littl abov that of      and        in your own forecast last month for the semiannu monetari polici report  committe member saw much stronger growth and lower unemploy rate than did the staff  especi if that differenti continu to prevail  the committe may see further eas as incur enough addit risk of build inflat pressur toward the end of      to offset the ad assur it would give of a reason rebound in growth earlier next year  howev  keep rate unchang may requir more confid in the forecast  your own or the staff   s  than the committe has at this point   you eas at your last meet  part on the assess that more weight should be put on the realiti of near term weak than on the project of longer term strength   continu and persist shortfal in actual growth  even relat to downward revis forecast  may have reinforc that assess  argu for anoth    basi point of eas at this meet   in effect  the anticip pickup in the economi is start from a lower base   moreov  a number of element in the current situat could be seen as suggest that the risk of further shortfal in econom activ in the next few quarter are greater than the risk of higher inflat later next year   data and anecdot on capit spend have yet to indic ani abat in the pace of weaken in this sector or to allow a confid project of           just how far the declin in invest will go   as vinc point out  revis to growth in foreign economi  like those for the unit state  have been one side   and consumpt is threaten by the effect of soften job prospect on confid and by the possibl of a further drop in equiti price if earn expect continu to be pare   inde  late last week  announc of disappoint earn and sale caus a further appreci declin in equiti price and a widen of risk spread in credit market  in light of near term weak  the committe may see ani potenti inflat pressur as suffici far into the futur to allow it to detect earli sign that growth was acceler or price pick up and take  e step  even after further eas   this seem consist with market assess of your like action and their outcom  market particip have built further near term eas into the structur of interest rate but also tighten next year   that turnaround appar is seen as occur soon enough to keep inflat low  judg from the result of survey of inflat expect or from the relat modest level of longer term inflat expect deriv from treasuri secur  which in fact have been declin of late   in that regard  both market particip and econom forecast appear to have mark down their outlook for growth and inflat in the last month  larg in respons to the unexpect weak in demand and more moder inflat   the result drop in interest rate and the exchang rate should help to cushion the effect of lower equiti price on econom activ   keep the stanc of polici unchang at this meet would tend to lower equiti price further and rais bond yield  a result the committe might not want to see unless it were of the view that market particip had react inappropri to the develop econom situat  given the tenor of the incom inform  with econom activ fall short of expect and project of growth revis downward  the bluebook writer assum that you would judg the balanc of risk as still tilt toward econom weak  even if you left polici unchang at this meet   at some point in the futur  when the committe see the risk of near term weak as balanc by the risk of higher inflat over the longer term  it would presum want to shift it balanc of risk statement and explain it reason in the announc   one path to that point would be a final eas that was perceiv to put polici in a suffici accommod postur to throw the risk into balanc   altern  the committe might retain it assess of unbalanc risk for a littl while even after it stop eas becaus it was not yet confid that threat of ad weak had abat suffici   this latter sequenc would be consist with your behavior in      when you were concern about inflat   in            effect  by the summer of last year  you still saw the risk as point to higher inflat  but not by enough to warrant chang the stanc of polici   thank you  mr  chairman
question for don   if not  let me get start  i think it s fair evid  certain in retrospect  that we are see an absorpt of veri larg capit loss throughout the econom system   i don t know whether one would call this a structur adjust  but it certain is not what we have embodi in our standard post world war ii econometr model   it s a differ sort of phenomenon and it   s clear be engend by a set of forc that are larg without histor preced in the post world war ii period   this   not mean that we re look at the type of sever busi cycl contract that the economi experienc on occas in the pre world war ii period  but in mani respect the process of adjust is similar to that in the earlier contract   as a number of you have indic  the current weak is obvious concentr in the capit good market and to a veri substanti extent it stem from a downward adjust of long term earn expect  i suspect that the declin in those expect are realli quit modest   what i believ has happen  as i think i indic at the last meet  is that the uncertainti with respect to the chang in the outlook have fo  a signific rise in risk premium in the capit good market   this essenti mean that the hurdl rate that is requir to induc a capit expenditur has increas   inde  one can talk in term of a firm   s refus to invest it cash flow unless the return is realiz in  say     month or to chang it pcs everi year when the latter can obvious remain function for three or four year   noth has happen in the last year to alter under condit except a chang in judgment   the pcs haven t chang  the technolog under the infrastructur of expand inform system haven t chang   and inde all the evid that we have today suggest that our previous conclus            about the outlook for capit invest are still basic true  name that firm have a long way to go in exploit the total avail capit invest that offer signific abov hurdl rate of return   what has happen is simpli a fundament shift in the general degre of confid   in the same sens that expect were veri clear overdon on the upsid  they are be underdon  if i may put it that way  on the downsid  and that will continu to be so until the normal cycl  not of the busi environ but of human psycholog  run it cours  one could argu with some obvious evid  and inde a number of you have so argu  that econom condit have deterior sinc our last meet  and i think that assess is accur   but the economi clear has not collaps   the fundament evalu of the behavior of the economi is still basic the same  and as in the earli spring the concern about a fals dawn remain   inde  we are look at aspect of that even today  as you may recal  i indic at the june meet that corpor earn were go to be a particular difficult technic issu in the nearer term   the problem is relat to the fact that in june secur analyst were es  a doubl digit increas in third quarter per share earn  season adjust not at an annual rate  and that es  was just not credibl   the onli question was the mechan by which a downward adjust would start to emerg  frank  it emerg a littl differ from what i had expect   i thought that the second quarter was pretti much lock in   after all  by the end of the month  with the inform technolog system that firm now have in place  they knew pretti much what their earn would be with one except   it s call end of quarter adjust for which there is veri consider discret   look out into the third quarter and see less than enjoy prospect for earn  firm decid to move some of the bad news into the second quarter   as a result  they report a veri fair dramat declin in second quarter earn stem from            downward revis at the veri end of the quarter that were not credibl base on real event  after all  it s not as though we are still in the old quill pen day where busi firm were three week behind in their bookkeep  there has been  of cours  a veri dramat downward revis in expect third quarter earn   but becaus second quarter earn were revis down  we still have a signific season adjust increas in expect earn per share as es  by the analyst for the third quarter   those earn forecast still have some distanc to go on the downsid   what is presum to be a lead indic of near term earn  the so call profit warn come out of the compani  is show fair signific evid that further sizabl downward revis are in the mix   i think one of the key reason whi  i believ quit appropri  the  book project capit invest to continu soft in the second half is that  as histori tell us  the chanc that invest spend will turn around quick are fair remot until we get a turnaround in cash flow   it s not an issu of take out the overhang in capit invest   i think busi firm are in the process of do that  they may even have done it to a veri larg extent by now   but we have to project that capit spend will fall below sustain level  and inde in a sens build up some backlog   market never go from over extens back to normal   i can   t recal ani case where that has happen  yet our forecast alway tend to project that it will happen   and when we get close to where we think it is about to happen we realiz that it s not turn around becaus the over adjust on the downsid has not yet occur   in a sens this is not a busi cycl issu  it s a human cycl issu  the data  of cours  are not as bad as the psycholog   inde  look at the profit data  a part of the problem in the nation incom and product account number  which are a lot weaker than the data in the s p      is the fact that those data are reflect of what compani            must report to the ir   this mean that the valu of exercis option is report as compens of employe and a reduct in pretax profit   in standard fasb account  that s not the way they do it  and by that account standard  firm have higher earn number   the ir number  by includ the veri larg dollar valu of exercis option  have ad a big chunk to the report compens of employe and have taken out a big chunk of profit in recent year   obvious  the valu of option is now a rapid depreci number   in that sens we are go to see compens per hour slow down signific  and we will also see some modest buoyanc start to occur in the under earn figur  for no matter what compani say  they know that stock option are a game that s be play   and they know that they can t hedg the stock option exercis effect becaus the cost of a deriv to hedg against an option grant is usual a fair hefti sum of money   so what they have been do in effect is go short on the valu of their stock option  and do that has been veri expens for a lot of compani   but implicit it is go to help them or has help them in this cycl   in sum  i think the profit figur probabl are unduli depress at this point  moreov  with the energi cost come down but the contract cost of energi still somewhat higher than the spot price  there is a delay effect in the impact of high energi cost on profit  now  i m not about to say that we will soon get a recoveri in profit   i find that prospect except unlik and the reason is that there is no price power in market across the nation   i would suspect that when this whole episod is over we will have a lower rate of inflat  even in the pce consumpt deflat   as i look at the price structur  i see veri littl evid that discount is come to an end  as other member have point out  and perhap that is help in the sens that it has been a factor buoy household consumpt  it is household consumpt or household demand more general that clear is the            sourc of strength hold this economi togeth   in this regard i think the evid is increas persuas that the capit gain realiz on the sale of home are insert a fair signific amount of purchas power into the economi   inde  such gain appear to have been enough to signific offset the negat effect of the declin in equiti price on consumpt expenditur   the more i look at the data  the more i am persuad that the deflationari effect of lower equiti price is concentr in the capit good market   and the lower implicit rate of return that those price captur are reflect somewhat less than i think we would have anticip in the household sector   and  as best i can judg  that is wholli a reflect of the fact that the propens to consum out of realiz capit gain on home appear to be signific higher than it is on both unreal capit gain on home and capit gain in general on equiti   this strike me as a reason for view as import the support that hous is provid to the expans   i suspect that without that support we would be observ much lower level of econom activ  the liquid of inventori continu apac   the rate of liquid has not slow appreci   it   fluctuat from month to month  the book valu data are question  but altern way of es  inventori chang essenti confirm that the rate of liquid is signific   howev  inventori sale ratio are hold up becaus the rate of declin in the consumpt of industri product is about in line with the rate of declin in inventori  in sum  with foreign economi clear weaken signific  we are in a situat as best i can judg where the economi is be held up by household demand  which fortun is run somewhat better than i think mani of us would have anticip   the press reaction to the juli retail sale figur i thought was quit startl   when we take out sale of gasolin and motor vehicl  those retail sale figur were realli strong  yet the press play them as            tepid   with person consumpt expenditur higher in juli  third quarter expenditur should rise even if they do not go anywher in august and septemb   so  insofar as i can judg  the key sourc of support for the economi is come from the spillov out of hous into household demand   of cours  strength in new construct of home is help  but i believ the more power forc on total gdp at this stage is the turnov of exist home that engend realiz capit gain  i believ we have some distanc to go befor we get out of this period of weak   i think our forecast at this stage essenti reflect hope   we do not yet see ani evid of the begin of a turnaround   it s not that the economi is fall apart  it is not   but econom condit are continu erod and we get that sens in anecdot report from around the countri   a possibl except is jerri jordan   s select sampl   clear  if gdp is still grow at a   percent rate  we inevit will find that a larg number of compani are do veri well and that would not be the case were we experienc a minus   percent rate of declin in activ  the widespread anecdot report that i am expos to do not contain veri mani straw suggest of an upturn  but that is the way the economi look at a cyclic bottom   in fact  if we go back and look at previous bottom  we will find peopl say exact what i have just said  inde  a necessari condit for a bottom is the exhaust of negat psycholog that set the stage for an upturn in op   i believ we will eventu get the project upturn   i don t think that the  book forecast is wrong by ani mean   for exampl  the week chain store sale data look quit impress   the data that we got this morn do suggest that the tax rebat are be spent  and if they are be spent  and we know there are     billion of rebat  then they   ve got to have a posit impact   even so  the recoveri is like to be a long process  and the presumpt            that the upturn will occur veri quick is in my view just a total misread of the under adjust to capit loss that are occur   they are by no mean complet  and i don t think we can get a vibrant respons out of this economi until these capit loss are reason fulli absorb   and becaus activ in mani sector of the economi is alreadi at relat high level  the extent of the recoveri cannot be larg   rememb  the motor vehicl and hous sector are still experienc well abov normal level of activ  certain for this stage of the cycl   so i think the process of adjust still has a long way to go  while the outlook remain subject to a good deal of uncertainti  i do think as mani of you have suggest  that the appropri polici at this stage is to move the feder fund rate a notch lower   a    basi point reduct strike me as appropri   if we were to go    basi point  our action would alarm everyon to an extent that i don   t think we can fulli appreci at this point  i thought the reaction to the latest beig book was veri interest   ordinarili  the market tend to view the beig book in term of it implic for polici  whether the fed is go to move rate one way or the other  and that s it   this  e it was differ   the market took this beig book as evid that the fed is a credibl institut   our sourc were say that the economi was soften and there was some spillov from the weak in manufactur to other sector   we accept what they said  and the market in turn believ what we have been say   for the first  e in quit a while  that credibl is base on what we have done   the credibl of our organ is crucial  and as i said were we to go to    basi point today i think we would alarm everyon  i do think that the risk remain obvious weight toward econom weak  but at some point we are go to have to stop our eas process   as i said at the last meet  my            suspicion is that we will be stop when the market in effect are tell us to stop   that will show up  for exampl  when the  book forecast of a recoveri actual begin to materi   when we distinguish between a forecast and realiti   what we need is some real evid that the capit good market are bottom  that profit eros has stabil  that we are see sign of an upturn instead of still further negat whenev we evalu what individu compani are do   instead of get that  we would start to get report that say the result this week are mix   i haven t seen a mix report in a veri long  e   i   m refer incident to survey that the staff make period of about   to    compani on a rotat sampl basi   the day that such a report come in and indic that these result are mix will be the first sign i would take that someth is happen   but i would say at this point that the real  e surveil of the economi  especi with what is clear an acceler in the deterior abroad  is one that say we have not as yet complet our eas process   so  i would put on the tabl a reduct of    basi point with the risk weight toward econom weak   vice chair
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  for me the polici choic is a close call   while i can support the propos eas  i do think there are some reason argument for leav the fund rate unchang at this  e   first  there appear to be a consensus  support by our outlook  the  book  and even the lower    percent of the blue chip panel of forecast  that there alreadi is enough s ulus in the pipelin to produc a signific pickup in activ in the next year or so   second  although i certain hope you are correct in your expect that            the inflat figur may turn out a bit better than most forecast indic  there is a chanc that the current period of slow growth will end with littl or no reduct in inflat   so we might be miss a chanc for a littl opportunist progress on inflat   third  we will know quit a bit more by our octob meet  especi about the effect of the tax rebat   so an argument can be made that we should wait for more inform   while i   m concern about these consider  i do support a    basi point cut in the fund rate as some insur against addit downsid surpris for econom activ   i also would prefer to retain the balanc of risk statement weight toward econom weak
mr  chairman  i agre with both part of your recommend  for a    basi point cut and the balanc of risk toward econom weak   you mention that if we did a    basi point cut  it would scare peopl   i would add that if we did zero  i think it would have the same impact   in my view this is a  e when consum confid and busi confid are extrem import to the economi
presid  n
thank you   my interpret of the cours of polici is consist with what don kohn said at the outset   that is  as best i can judg the situat  we   re tri to prop up compon of aggreg demand that are interest rate sensit until the inventori correct process run it cours and until condit and attitud chang in a favor way for capit spend   i don   t think that   s an unreason polici and it   s probabl the best avail polici  as i   ve indic befor  i   m concern about the lag and what they mean for our futur cours of action   but let me add that i   m not oppos to a quarter point reduct in the fund rate at this stage   i won   t get into the lag issu at ani great length except to say that i            believ we are go to have to chang cours and adopt at least a polici of stabil befor there   s total persuas evid that the economi is reacceler in a major way   i say that not becaus i think we   re go to be reluct to chang cours when it   s appropri but becaus of what i would call the recognit lag   it   s veri unlik that the evid will accumul in such a way that it will be entir convinc that it   s  e to stop eas polici  my experi with these situat in the past is that the evid come in mix for an extend period of  e  so we   re go to have to make the best judgment we can as that happen   in addit  if we think about the  e of the publish data  the anecdot  of cours  may help  we won   t know if the economi has rebound until well after the fact   let   s suppos  just for illustr purpos  that the economi realli start to reacceler in the first quarter   well  we won   t get all that much data on the first quarter until well into the second quarter and the data are unlik to be convinc until well into the third quarter   so i   m concern about that recognit lag go forward
i just want to say that i think our techniqu of know where we are have improv a great deal
well  i sincer hope you   re right but the proof is in the pud
well said   presid pool
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend
i think your propos is just right
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i have had concern similar to presid  n   s and possibl other around the tabl that we won   t quick recogn when the economi has turn around and that polici will be too easi too long   but given where we are  it seem to me that polici need to be a littl easier in order to provid the appropri level of support   i was struck by your comment that virtual the whole world economi is support by consum spend and the residenti hous market in the unit state   it   s a power thought and one that occur to me as well   so i am in favor of this move but i think we need to be veri care go forward for all the reason that presid  n mention
mr  chairman  if you   ll forgiv a person note  let me make a coupl of comment here   after our meet in june  where i support a quarter point reduct in the fund rate  one of my fomc colleagu came up to me and said    gee  you   re realli chang stripe   where is the old inflat hawk i use to know
that was actual me
and that   s a fair question   but the answer i would give to the question is that i can rememb when the committe did not have full credibl   a lot of us were say then that if we could ever achiev credibl  that would give us greater flexibl to move the fund rate in the short run in conjunct with chang in econom condit  and  of cours  now i think we do have consider credibl   and with the downsid risk still quit substanti  as you and other have mention  i think we need to take advantag of that credibl   to say the same thing a bit differ   unlik the situat in a number of earlier postwar episod  we don   t need a recess to contain inflat or inflat expect            at this point   we may have a recess ul  or we may not   but if we do  i think it   s import that the fed not be perceiv as contribut to it  or wors  actual caus it   so i   m not readi to disappoint market expect today   therefor  i agre with you and i favor go ahead with the expect quarter point reduct   if we don   t  i think it would be a big surpris and quit disrupt  have said that  there isn   t ani doubt  though  that the real fund rate is not veri far abov zero   and if the economi is near a bottom  and here is where i might disagre with you a bit becaus it seem to me that there   s at least some mild evid that it could be  i think we need to be prepar to revers cours if necessari and to begin to tighten polici  but more to the point  and this is realli the main point i would make  i think we need to prepar the market and the general public for that possibl  which i don   t think we   ve done adequ to this point   there are lot of way to do it   one way would be to go ahead and drop the rate a quarter of a point at this meet and go to a symmetr direct   howev  i agre that that would be push it   nevertheless  i do believ that our statement  which is now an increas import signal of what we may be do down the road  should indic clear that there   s at least a possibl that the eas cycl may now be approach an end   our object ought to be to tri to preempt as much as we can the quick develop of market expect of yet anoth rate cut at the next meet  so that we   ll have greater flexibl at that meet   so i would hope that our statement this  e might have some languag like that
well  at this stage the preliminarili statement   two thing  both of which it did the last  e   one  it mention how much we have reduc the rate sinc the begin of the year  and two  it elimin ani notion of an intermeet move  but also rememb that what we did most import last  e was that we cut the fund rate by               basi point and not      and i think that set the pace   clear  at the point we see the pictur becom mix  when the data ceas to indic weak almost across the board  that   s the first sign that the bottom is be hit   we   re at least a meet away from that  mayb two  we realli don   t know yet   but i do think that we have to be clear that there is a bottom to this   i agre with that
mr  chairman  if i could comment   i think by say that we   ve reduc the fund rate by a total of     basi point and by continu to take out ani notion of an intermeet move  the financi market will interpret the statement in exact the way you want
i think that help  bill   but given the level of the fund rate now  i think an addit phrase might be prudent   i   m not sure i   m sell this to anybodi here   laughter
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i agre with those who think that down the road  in a few quarter or mayb a year  have move the fund rate down today might complic our problem   but i think we have to do it   i would also underlin someth don said  name that right now we   re in a posit where both r and r  are drop   so we   re realli not get as far out of balanc as it might seem
thank you  mr  chairman   given my view of the econom outlook and the risk that we observ  i think both part of your recommend polici are correct  so i support your propos
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend   i think the argument for anoth modest eas move have been made around the tabl   i would say that i   and i suspect other who have offer some argument on the other side at the june meet  had revis those argument come in today   s meet   i want to make the same point  though  that gari  n  cathi    and al broaddus made   and that is that i   m not comfort yet  even with your respons to al  that we have quit figur out our exit strategi  we need a way to convey that  not onli intern but extern  befor we have to do too much explain   al  you made a sale with me   i don   t know whether the answer is a phrase in the statement or what   but if we continu to eas and continu to have the balanc of risk statement the way it has been  i   m not sure how we will get off that treadmil as quick as i suspect we   re go to want to
i think the market is go to take us off the treadmil
i hope that   s the way it   s done
in fact  if we could actual arrang it  that would be the ideal way   in other word  the ideal way would be that we don   t shock the market but that sudden we get the feder fund futur rate flatten out becaus the data are begin to look better   and at the moment i see noth to prevent us from do that   goverrnor
mr  chairman  like some other  i do worri a bit about the adjust that will becom necessari as the economi begin to recov on the other side of our current problem   but i support your recommend   i think it   s right for today
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
thank you   first  i   ll make sure that befor the next meet we do get not onli some mix report but also some strong report    laughter   some of my bank   s director have turn from be veri bearish two or three month ago to say     wait a minut  thing are start to improv      so i   ll make sure you hear some of those report  too  i associ myself with some of the comment of jack guynn  al broaddus  and gari  n   i  too  worri about the concern they mention   but i also believ the risk is high that an extern event will materi that will requir us to respond   we   re go to have to respond to it from wherev we are  and we may have to respond veri aggress   so i   d rather have some more dri powder to be use becaus there   s noth that a littl adjust in our domest polici can do to allevi the situat extern to the unit state that we view as most threaten   and i don   t see that small adjust in our polici stanc are like to be veri help in turn around the psycholog within the unit state   i think your analysi is right about capit spend  it will start to improv onc the risk start to narrow   so how do we get from where we are to that process where the risk premium start to narrow and we return to busi as usual   i don   t know  so i too worri about an exit strategi
mr  chairman  i think the propos you put on the tabl is quit reason and i would support it   let me make a coupl of comment   i do think our polici is accommod right now and it will becom more accommod with this move   but in my view it   s not just the market that are nervous and uneasi   main street is also nervous and uneasi   your propos action serv to address that to an import degre and  therefor  i am support of it   i do agre with those who are concern about the lag and about our abil to revers cours at the appropri  e  that isn   t a scienc but in part it involv our recogn            when to do so   we have to trust that we   ll be abl to do that at that  e   so i   m veri support of your recommend at this point  one thing i have to say  with due defer to al broaddus  is that i do not want an expand statement   i argu hard for the statement to be shorter and i think it should stay that way   in my view the market has to recogn our stanc by our action and by what is happen in the economi  that is the best way to get the messag across  and to react to that inform at the appropri  e
befor we take a vote  sinc the press statement is a relev part of the decis here  i would ask the secretari to distribut copi of the draft   let me just say that what was done is as close to a de minimi chang from the previous statement as we could come up with   michell  did you provid the word of the last statement as well
yes  the propos languag is shown  with strike out indic chang from the previous statement
okay  so we can actual see the chang from the previous press releas   we took presid hoenig   s advic  as you can see
he   s a veri import fellow
i   m flatter
okay  then we can vote on the    basi point cut and the risk toward econom weak   will you read the direct languag  pleas
this languag is on page    of the bluebook   it   s a littl hard to            find but it come after chart    which has the blue shade section in it      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around       percent      the balanc of risk statement for the press releas read      against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
call the roll  pleas
chairman  span vice chairman   governor   governor   presid hoeni governor   governor   presid mineha presid   presid pool   yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
we will recess briefli so the feder reserv board can meet on the discount rate   the reason we   re go into recess  as you know  is that this press statement presuppos a discount rate action that has not been taken   so until that   s assur we cannot adjourn   may i ask the board member to go into my offic   hope we   ll be back short to confirm an action on the discount rate   recess
the board of governor accept discount rate request            from seven bank   this meet then is adjourn upon confirm of the date of our next meet  which is
octob  nd
octob  nd   as you are awar  that is an interest day  which may or may not be devoid of conflict for other than monetari polici reason   we are monitor the situat fair close and if we need to make ani adjust in the meet date or locat we  of cours  will be in contact with all of you immedi
mr  chairman  you said meet date and locat   i presum the date would stay the same but the locat might chang if circumst warrant
yes  i would assum that   i amend my remark accord   shall we go to lunch  end of meet
