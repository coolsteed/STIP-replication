certain   thank you  mr  chairman   the financi market environ has improv mark sinc mid march   howev  concern about the circumst that led to the demis of bear stearn may have provid ad impetus to the ongo deleverag process   the result has been improv in the broader equiti and fix incom market but heighten term fund pressur within the financi system   turn first to the broader market  improv is evid across most broad asset class both in the unit state and abroad   as shown in exhibit   of the handout in front of you  the broad u s  equiti index have recov much of their earlier loss   although the financi sector still lag behind  financi share price have  in the aggreg  recov more than    percent off their mid march trough  credit market have also improv   as shown in exhibit    corpor credit spread in both the invest grade and the high yield sector have narrow somewhat  moreov  global credit default swap spread   as shown in exhibit     have fallen signific   as shown in exhibit    measur of impli volatil in the treasuri  equiti  and foreign exchang market have declin   sign of a recoveri in risk appetit can be seen veri clear in the subprim mortgag back secur market and the municip secur market  both which    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     april                of     had earlier experienc signific distress   exhibit   show the price perform of the aaa rate tranch of the last four abx subprim vintag   as can be seen  the aaa rate tranch have recov even though hous activ and home price have continu to declin at least as fast as anticip   in the municip market  crossov buyer have enter  attract by municip bond yield that exceed those avail on treasuri of compar matur   as seen in exhibit    although the ratio of tax exempt to treasuri yield of compar matur remain elev  there has been consider improv dure the past two month   this improv has occur even though the outlook for the monolin financi guarantor remain poor   ambac   s announc last week of a      billion loss in the first quarter made   thus far   bare a rippl in the broader market   the introduct of the primari dealer credit facil  pdcf  seem to have help to stabil the repo market   that improv  in turn  has caus the equiti price of the four remain larg invest bank to recov somewhat and their credit default swap spread to fall sharpli  exhibit   and      the pdcf backstop facil also appear to have help break the negat dynam of higher haircut  forc asset sale  lower price  higher volatil  and still higher haircut that was in place in the week lead up to the bear stearn liquid crisi  although the collater haircut set by the major dealer for their hedg fund client in our april   survey   shown in exhibit     are consider higher than in the previous month  our contact indic that this rise occur most around the  e of bear stearn   s demis   over the past few week  haircut have stabil   despit the improv in the broad market index and in the equiti price and credit default swap spread of most major financi firm  term fund pressur have intensifi rather than subsid   as shown in exhibit    and     the pressur have been evid at both the one month and the three month tenur in the unit state  the euro area  and the unit kingdom   the addit deleverag by the invest bank follow the demis of bear stearn may have intensifi the pressur on commerci bank balanc sheet or the urg for bank to delev   the libor index took a jump upward follow a wall street journal articl that alleg that some of the    libor panelist were underst the rate at which they could obtain fund   the british banker associ react by threaten to throw out ani panelist that was not wholli honest in it daili post of it cost of obtain fund at differ matur horizon   the bba announc appear to have provok an outbreak of verac among at least some of the panelist   as shown in exhibit     the libor fix rose near    basi point in the few day immedi after the articl   the dispers in offer rate between the highest and lowest post bank also increas   there is consider evid that the offici libor fix underst the rate paid by mani bank for fund   for exampl  as shown in exhibit     the all in cost of fx swap financ into dollar out of euro has recent climb to more than    basi point abov the cost of libor fund   april                of     the term fund pressur appear to be main the consequ of the deleverag process that is still firm under way   balanc sheet capac has becom strain in three way   first  pressur to carri more asset on the balanc sheet have increas in a number of way   for exampl  some type of asset can no longer be securit  and balanc sheet asset are creat when line of credit are drawn upon   second  loan loss provis and mark to market loss have cut into capit  at least until recent  fa  than bank have been abl to rais new capit  third  desir capit ratio have undoubt risen as financi market have becom more volatil and the macroeconom outlook has worsen   these pressur have sharpli push up the shadow price of balanc sheet capac  and term fund spread undoubt reflect that pressur   as evid  note how the spread between jumbo and conform fix rate mortgag yield in exhibit    has most track the trajectori of term fund spread shown in exhibit      becaus bank can securit conform mortgag but not jumbo mortgag  this widen spread like reflect the rise in the shadow price of balanc sheet capac   the term fund pressur have also been evid in the strong demand exhibit in our biweek taf auction  as shown in exhibit     the spread between the stop out rate and the minimum bid rate has risen sharpli sinc late januari  despit the larg rise in the size of the taf auction over this period   in contrast  the demand by primari dealer to borrow treasuri secur in our term secur lend facil  tslf  has been less intens   it is unclear whether this reflect the larg and immedi scale of these auction       billion offer over four week  or less need by primari dealer  who reli heavili on secur repo borrow for their short term fund need   as shown in exhibit     two of the five auction have not been fulli cover   besid provid liquid to the primari dealer  the tslf auction have help to generat a dramat improv in treasuri market function   as shown in exhibit     befor the first tslf auction  overnight treasuri repo rate were unusu low  and the treasuri market was distort by a grow number of secur failur  that is  dealer were unabl to deliv promis secur  and a larg number of secur trade special  that is  with a repo rate below the rate on general treasuri collater    so have the taf and tslf auction been help in improv market function  although it is imposs to know what the counterfactu would have been without the auction  most evid suggest that these auction have improv market function   although a recent studi by   taylor and     found no statist evid that the taf auction have had an effect on term fund  the choic in term of econometr design made it veri difficult for this studi to have found an effect   interest  minor chang in the specif use by taylor and   produc statist signific result with the expect sign   in other word  the taf auction reduc the spread   they say that a pictur is worth a thousand word   exhibit    document the feder reserv   s major initi over the past eight month relat to the libor   oi spread   note that virtual all the feder reserv initi aim at improv april                of     market function have been associ with a declin in the libor   oi spread  perhap this just repres an announc or placebo effect   more studi is obvious need   howev  it is interest that those market particip who are the patient have been clamor for more medicin in the form of both an increas in the size of the taf auction and auction with longer matur   as the equiti and credit market have improv  market particip have reduc their expect of the magnitud of further monetari polici eas   as shown in exhibit     the feder fund rate futur curv has shift upward and is virtual flat around   percent from may though septemb   impli that market particip expect that tomorrow will like be the last eas in this cycl   the eurodollar futur curv  which is shown in exhibit     has shift up even more sharpli sinc the last fomc meet   in part  this reflect the rise in term fund spread and  most import  the view that these spread are like to remain elev relat to the target feder fund rate for the forese futur   our survey of primari dealer undertaken about ten day befor each fomc meet show more stabil in dealer expect  exhibit    and       note that the dealer forecast now anticip somewhat greater eas than impli by the feder fund rate futur market and the eurodollar futur market   this is quit differ from the pattern in previous month   the averag of the dealer modal forecast has a trough in yield of about      percent  about    percentag point below the market forecast   in term of this week   s meet  there is littl disagr between the dealer survey and market particip   all    of the primari dealer that respond to our survey anticip a rate cut at this meet  with near all in the    basi point rate cut camp   as shown in exhibit     this is slight more aggress than the expect embodi in feder fund rate option  which are price in a probabl of a    basi point eas of almost    percent   the shift in interest rate expect cannot be explain easili by develop on the inflat front  although the continu surg in crude oil price has push aggreg commod index  such as the gsci  higher  agricultur and industri metal price have been much more stabl in recent week  exhibit       despit the rise in energi price  market base measur of long term inflat compens have fallen in recent week   for exampl  as shown in exhibit     both the board   s and barclay    five year  five year forward measur have declin about    basi point from the peak reach in earli march   turn to the desk   s oper  we get mix grade over the intermeet period   on the one hand  we have done a pretti good job of hit the target on averag  through ye day  the daili effect rate sinc the last fomc meet was a miracul      percent    on the other hand  this averag conceal consider intraday and day to day volatil   this can be seen in exhibit     which chart the daili feder fund rate rang and the daili averag effect rate   notic how wide the daili rang of trade has been   this reflect three factor       the demand by european bank for feder fund  which has often caus the feder fund rate to be elev earli in the day befor europ close      stigma associ with primari april                of     credit facil  pcf  borrow   the pcf rate is not a firm cap on feder fund rate trade  and     larg unanticip shift in the autonom factor that affect the level of reserv in the bank system   especi shift in the level of pcf and pdcf borrow   note the big rise in pcf and pdcf borrow sinc mid march and the larg daili shift in the level of this borrow shown in exhibit      we have littl abil to forecast these daili shift in borrow   thus  these shift are most unexpect and do increas the volatil of the feder fund rate   final  let me briefli outlin a number of polici recommend for which we seek your approv   first  i will need approv for domest oper   there were no foreign oper   second  as note in the memo that was circul to you last week  we are recommend that the outstand swap line with canada and mexico be renew for anoth year   third  the staff is recommend approv of an increas in the size of the foreign exchang swap facil with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank   this recommend is discuss in more detail in a memo that was distribut to the fomc last friday   for the ecb  the recommend is to increas the size of the swap line to     billion from     billion  and for the snb  to     billion from    billion  with maximum draw on these facil of     billion and    billion  respect   we also recommend extend the term of these swap facil to januari           from septemb            as befor  these swap line will be use in conjunct with our taf auction to increas the amount of    day term dollar fund avail to bank with oper in the euro area and in switzerland   at the same  e  we understand that chairman bernank intend to use his deleg author from the board to increas the size of the taf to      billion from      billion   fourth  we recommend that elig collater for the tslf be broaden to includ aaa rate asset back secur  ab    current  as you know  this facil accept onli aaa rate residenti mortgag back secur and commerci mortgag back secur   we believ that broaden the elig to aaa rate ab will help support the avail of consum credit  includ credit card  auto  and student loan credit   spread in aaa rate ab back by auto loan and credit card receiv have risen sharpli over the past six month even though the deterior in the under perform of the asset in term of delinqu and loss has been well within the bound of past cycl   we do not recommend increas the collater elig by greater breadth than this   as we note in last friday   s memo  includ addit class of secur could increas oper cost to an extent that is not like to be warrant by the margin benefit   it could also expos the system to the risk associ with a rang of complex structur financ product and  in the case of aaa rate corpor secur  would not provid much benefit becaus the amount of such secur outstand are relat small   under this propos  the maximum size of the tslf would remain unchang   at      billion   as would the other term of the facil   i also want to inform the committe of a small technic chang that the staff plan to make in the tslf program   we plan to elimin the requir that april                of     elig aaa rate secur not be on watch for downgrad   we plan to make this chang becaus we have found that enforc this rule has been veri difficult oper becaus the two clear bank that manag the triparti repo system have a limit abil to perform this monitor function on our behalf   in addit  i would point out that the ad risk from this chang are veri small   if secur were downgrad  the primari dealer would have to substitut new elig collater  also  it should be point out that the pdcf accept most invest grade secur   thus  we alreadi have a broader collater regim in place for our other primari dealer facil
thank you   let   s have question for bill on financi market  and then we will come back to a full discuss of the propos action   question for bill   no question   that is unusu   yes  presid
about consum loan back secur  spread have widen and delinqu and default have increas  but not out of line with past experi   you seem to have infer that spread have widen more than is warrant by the return on those secur  i would be interest in what comput exercis or what other analyt you and your staff have undertaken to document the hypothesi that these spread are not warrant by the fundament
i am not so much say that they are not warrant   i am say that the spread have widen a lot relat to the actual experi  given that we are in a period of weaker econom growth   the stress seem to be more on the spread that the market is demand for these asset as oppos to a deterior in the under credit card loan or auto loan that back those asset
other question   if not  let me just say a word or two about the propos liquid measur   first  as bill note  the interbank and short term fund market remain under some stress   in particular  as you know from the pictur  the spread in the dollar interbank market have gone abov the u k  and ecb market   although it is certain april                of     difficult to identifi precis the size and the signific of the effect of our liquid facil  not just the bank and the market particip have been in favor of them   we have receiv veri good review from intern agenc such as the imf  the oecd  and other  and i do think that it is worth continu these effort to tri to strengthen liquid avail  therefor  with respect to interbank market  first  as mention  i propos to use my deleg author to increas the size of the term auction facil   second  i would like to ask the fomc to approv increas in our swap line and an extens of the durat of the swap line with the european central bank and the swiss nation bank   as now  they would be auction money at the same  e that we do in our taf   the swap with canada and mexico are routin   we have done these for a number of year   as i promis you at an earlier meet  i check with the treasuri  and they are all in favor of maintain these facil   i think it would be rather odd to end them at this particular junctur  so i ask for renew of those swap line as well  on the tslf  the auction that we have had have been undersubscrib  which may be good news   on the other hand  it may have someth to do with narrow of the collater that is accept   the tslf is intend to help the function of the treasuri market becaus it put more treasuri into circul   we do have some evid that treasuri are trade at lower spread and with less volatil sinc we began these activ   in addit  there is some support for the collater that is taken and general liquid support for the market  although  again  it is realli both side of this equat that we are look at   the current collater that is accept at the tslf is basic rmbs and cmbs   the propos is to increas the rang of collater to includ aaa asset back secur  which includ credit card  auto loan  and student loan   basic most consum orient credit   i think it make a lot of sens in the april                 of     context of what we have been do   it would make the rang of collater more similar to that in our other facil   it also would reduc the credit alloc aspect by broaden the rang of collater that we accept   on the other hand  as bill mention  unless the situat becom radic differ  we probabl don   t want to extend beyond this becaus of difficulti in assess the credit qualiti of other asset  i put this item on the meet agenda for your discuss becaus there are some polit and public relat complic  and i want just to be up front and let you know what they are and get your respons and your view   as you know  the student loan market has been dysfunct  and we have receiv request   perhap you have as well   to do    someth    about this problem   we receiv letter  probabl about a month ago  from some hous member  includ congressman kanjorski  who ask us to extend our lend author beyond the current institut to other   i assum salli mae  for exampl  would have been a possibl   we wrote back a veri clear letter say that we could not do that  that our       author was reserv for unusu and exig circumst  which we interpret as be system relev circumst  that the bar was veri high for the use of that author  and that  although we certain want to strengthen the liquid in the general market  we didn   t see this as be a possibl  we receiv a second set of letter a coupl of week ago  realli one letter sign by a number of senat  most from the senat bank committe  ask specif that we expand the collater in the tslf to includ student loan   now we have the problem that this would do that  along with other much more signific  in term of size  consum loan   we wrote back to senat dodd and his colleagu last week and told them that  although we of cours are alway look to improv the liquid of market and  in particular  we think student april                 of     loan are a veri worthi type of credit  we didn   t see the argument   first  student loan are alreadi accept as collater in our other three facil   the taf  the window  and the pdcf  second  we argu that the real problem with the student loan situat is on the legisl side  in particular  recent legisl chang have reduc the spread that privat sector lender can get from student loan   given the increas in fund cost  they have becom unprofit  and so mani lender have withdrawn from that market   so we didn   t give ani encourag in that letter  that be said  if we take this action   which was suggest by the staff and which is  i believ  fulli justifi on it own merit   it would be part of a broader packag  and i think we would get two differ reaction   on the one hand  we would get  i would call it for short  a wall street journal editori that the feder reserv is onc again the craven cur and the spineless   boy  i am get good at this    laughter  lackey of the congress by accommod this request   i take that serious   i   m sure we all take serious even the percept that we are cater to this request   on the other side  i suppos that there would be what i could call the usa today editori  which is     whi won   t the fed  which is bail out wall street left and right  includ asset back paper in their facil  even though it is consist with all of their other practic and they take it in all of their other facil     and so on   so i think there are pr and polit risk on both side of this   i am not go to tri to downplay those  but i do think that on the substanc this is a good move  and i will just put this on the tabl for your question or comment   if a signific number of member of the committe are uncomfort with proceed   and what we would do if we proceed is to put this all togeth in a packag to be announc with the european and the swiss on friday morn   then i would certain be will to tabl this last item   so let me open the floor for ani comment   presid
i think the polit concern you rais and describ is a veri  veri serious one for this institut   even if we thought of this ourselv befor senat dodd and other wrote to us   and appar it is true that we did   we are never go to be abl to convinc a broad array of observ that this was not a direct respons to a senatori request  given that  i think the percept that we includ this and mayb ad some other secur as a fig leaf set just a disastr preced   it would be the use of our balanc sheet to circumv the check and balanc of the constitut process for legisl about fiscal matter   i think that the integr of our independ as an institut reli  to a substanti degre  on our lack of entangl or our distanc from the polit fray  i would also question the valu of this on the substanc   what we are do with the tslf  as bill   s chart show  look as though it has had a big effect on the gc repo rate   it is hard to see how some addit amount of treasuri in the market  given the size of the treasuri market  is go to have a gigant effect   it is also hard to see that there is much strain or disloc caus by the most recent observ in his graph on the gap between the fund rate and the gc repo rate   which is actual  what  like    or    basi point or about what it has histor been   so i would question whether we realli need this on the substanc as well  on the other measur  the taf is domin by european institut   term fund spread seem domin by the term fund demand of european institut   i don   t see whi we don   t tri to shift to european institut the public polici respons for manag those situat   we alreadi have an appar well function mechan for suppli dollar balanc to foreign offici institut to allow them to do that   i don   t see whi we don   t limit our expans of fund in that direct   to the swap line   rather than expand the taf  thank you
a question   and just remind me   if we bring the student loan and these other asset in under this facil  do we have the right to swap out if the rate chang or question come up
yes   they are price everi day  and if they are downgrad  there will be an automat substitut   so you are protect both on price and on the abil to substitut
that was my first question   the second is that we have been entangl befor in appear issu   if we feel that we are do the right thing  that  sn   t give me much concern   on the substanc  do you judg that the tight in the market is such that this action is necessari to facilit liquid  or will this onli margin improv thing   if it is margin  the appear issu becom more entangl  i think   if it is pretti clear that we have some liquid issu and that this will address them  then i would feel much more comfort with it
well  i think the honest answer is that we don   t realli know exact where it is on the continuum of veri modest to substant   one thing we can say is that this should increas the demand at the tslf auction  so it should increas the likelihood that more of the treasuri are actual put into the market in exchang for such collater becaus we are broaden the elig collater   but i don   t think the notion that this is a panacea is true
i want to say just one thing in this context   the chairman allud to this  too   i think there is some valu in take this opportun now to tri to get a better balanc in the relat attract across these facil   so in the scheme of thing  it is better for us for the auction type of facil to be relat attract compar with april                 of     the open facil for which demand is unknown and we can   t calibr it   those are much bigger reserv manag thing   i think our exit strategi from these thing is easier if we evolv in that direct   one virtu of the packag that the chairman present is that it is worth take anoth shot at tri to get those interbank term premium down in dollar becaus   to use a technic term   they are screw up the transmiss mechan of u s  monetari polici now   we are not quit sure how much effect we can have   there is a plausibl case that increas the size of the swap will help on that front   it is worth do now   second  the broader packag will buy a littl more insur against the risk that these liquid pressur reignit and we have anoth wave of the advers dynam margin spiral downward self feed thing   it is better to do that when other thing are improv rather than wait until we are again at the edg of the abyss  although that is a tactic judgment   it is hard to know for sure  i think that bill is absolut right   it is not clear how much increment benefit the expand collater in the tslf will offer   we can   t be sure   but     it won   t come becaus we are increas the size of the tslf   that would increas the amount of treasuri we are put in  and we are not increas the size   it would come onli through what effect it might have on the broader rang of asset back secur we have there   rememb  at the begin we frame this as an effort to address some uniqu constraint oper on securit market  particular in ab   so there is a possibl of some addit benefit in those market   some greater insur against anoth downward spiral in that case   but not that high   it is hard to judg the merit of that against the appear risk you present  but i think this is design pretti care to be robust to that percept problem   our job is to do what make sens and what we can defend as sensibl in this context  and we have to be prepar to april                 of     do that even if peopl have made it awkward for us to do the right thing becaus of the percept problem
well  i certain agre with the last statement that we should do what make sens  and in this case  differenti between kind of collater that are all aaa  sn   t make sens to me   we should broaden it out   i would say that in your present you didn   t have the asset back commerci paper market  but those rate actual have been quit elev   some rollov for some of the larg bank have not been work all that well  and the asset that tend to be in those conduit are the veri asset we are talk about expand  they are the student loan  the auto loan  and the various other thing that go into these conduit   so i don   t know how big an effect it would be  but if you look at the asset back commerci paper rate  they would look a lot like the libor rate   i think that there might be some net benefit  and it certain   make sens to me that we would expand   there is no reason to differenti among aaa collater that has mani similar attribut
presid    a two hand comment
yes   mr  chairman  you motiv the expans of the term secur lend facil by the effect it would have by increas the amount of treasuri in the market  vice chairman    you appeal to the effect it would have on the asset back secur that would be offer on the market   we didn   t discuss the asset back secur market  except that i had this exchang with our manag   i am not awar of ani evid that there is someth wrong with the fundament of those market   now  admit  it is not clear that mani of our argument for some of these facil have been base on some care diagnosi of april                 of     fundament   if this is about those asset back secur market  that is anoth thing entir   i was a littl confus about that and wonder about the rational
i may have misspoken  but i think i had in mind both side of the equat   the treasuri have certain respond   it   s harder to judg on the asset side  but i guess that the premis is the same   that all of these market are suffer from withdraw of the normal liquid provis of money market mutual fund and other  less sophist investor   bank and other are find it hard to financ those asset  and that   s the liquid backstop that we provid   so i think on both side
if i may come back to the issu of the aaa secur and the spread  those are aaa rate secur for which the spread has widen hundr of basi point   if the loss experienc is not unusu relat to the cycl  then it   s hard to understand whi aaa rate secur would be sell at sever hundr basi point over treasuri   it is imposs to squar that circl
if the payoff for those secur is unexpect low  it is like to happen in a circumst in which the economi is do aw poor   risk premium are about varianc and risk avers  but they are also about correl with aggreg state  arguabl  that would ration a widen of the risk premium attach to a wide rang of secur  mortgag back includ   we have yet to see ani evid from our staff refut that interpret of the widen spread we have seen   mr  chairman  with all due respect  what you describ is a lack of demand   i am not sure how that squar with view the market as somehow malfunct
well  we have seen the breakdown of a particular structur of lend that was base on the credit rate   the credit rate have proven to be fals  therefor  there is an inform deficit   an asymmetr inform problem  would be my interpret   which has  in turn  trigger a massiv chang in prefer   but i don   t think we are go to settl this at the tabl here   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the question that i have get to the appear issu  and it is not realli about the immedi concern   to the extent that the market are not function that well  this could be use  and so i don   t realli have ani disagr with that   but the facil that we are talk about current have a temporari natur to them   the term auction facil is temporari  although of cours the board could make it perman   the term secur lend facil is an expans of a program   what   s the perman of that and the primari dealer credit facil as well   as we allow other form of collater to be taken  what implic might that have for the futur if we tri to make these more perman   this is simpli a question  i don   t know what the answer is   do we feel comfort with these form of addit collater on a perman  ongo basi  if we were to do that  or do we think it would be possibl to turn that off   how cost would it be
the tslf and the pdcf are emerg measur  and bar congression action  we cannot maintain them   presum  they will be phase out as market improv   if we are do these thing  i don   t see the argument for one set of collater versus anoth   presid
along those line  mr  chairman  i view these facil as a liquid bridg  an aqueduct  to get over this credit crunch that we have had   i am not as concern about have this facil accept the same collater as the other facil   i do have a question april                 of     about the perman  and it is a differ kind of question  which is whether or not the congress will encourag us to make these perman   i think that is a risk  and we need to think about it   i don   t have an answer   i have been on the receiv end  as you may know  of enorm pressur from the texa deleg on the student loan busi  and we have talk about it with the staff quit a bit   i quot you in my respons  by the way  in your first seri of letter   it  sn   t bother me to have egg on my face if we are do the right thing   again  have the same collater regim as we have for our other facil   i am more worri  howev  about whether it encourag them in interf with the temporari natur of these facil   that is just one point to think about   i have a question about the taf   just to make sure that i understand   we are talk about take it to      billion in outstand   is that correct
so     billion auction   okay   the third point  which is about optic  is a littl differ   i don   t know what we   re go to come out with in term of polici   i know what my prefer are  and i sens what some other peopl   s prefer are   i   m a littl concern that we have to be abl to express this in a way that  sn   t look as though we see someth that no one els see   so we need to think about that and the way we articul it   the last  e we had a disconnect between an action on the fed fund rate and agre to someth and announc it intern  it didn   t realli work well   they read more into it than was there  we all understood whi we were have that  e disconnect   it was becaus we need to line up our duck with our foreign counterpart   mayb we should think about that as well   whether we should move it up to the same  e that we announc the action of this committe on the fed fund rate   i don   t know if that is physic possibl   but i wouldn   t want in ani way to convey that we see someth that other peopl don   t see  that there is a problem in these particular april                 of     market   everybodi know that ge is tri to sell a     billion credit card portfolio and they are not get ani bidder   so i can see the devious mind  or the mind of those who don   t necessarili think well of us  link all these littl piec togeth and say that we   re react or overreact to someth that may not be there   i just want to put that on the tabl for you to think about   i am not against the concept  sinc we have alreadi gone down this path  of make this subject to the same collater regim   but i do think   and i am glad you rais the subject   that  though i have interpret it differ  we have to be concern about the optic here
presid    the  e is dictat by the prefer of the european not to be tie into our monetari polici decis and the fact that thursday is a european holiday   the problem you were allud to earlier had to do with the veri strong market expect that we were go to act on liquid measur   we disappoint both on that and on the rate   that was whi we got the strong reaction  and there   s no such expect to my knowledg here   at the same  e  our press releas  which we have alreadi look at in draft  and market expect are veri focus on the libor issu and the interbank issu  given that we have done so mani step in this direct  i don   t think that this would be misinterpret as anyth particular overdramat
mr  chairman  may i just rais one other point   i think presid   touch on this   i am concern  in term of the eventu optic  about the fact that the taf is be drawn on predomin by foreign bank   my number here are that the last one was    percent foreign bank particip and the previous one was    percent   i think there we may have some polit vulner   again  i just put it on the tabl for us to consid   i am almost more worri about a backlash on that eventu than what we are talk about current
the problem is that european bank are structur defici in dollar and they have a  e zone shift   it is a dollar market
it has been well present   it   s hard to explain to a politician   that   s my point
thank you  mr  chairman   on the last point  i think it is help to expand both the swap and the taf at the same  e   peopl understand that there are pressur in these fund market  and we can address them both at home and abroad   they do feed back on our market  so i guess i am not too worri about that one   also  it is quit logic to do the swap and the taf   i don   t see ani issu  on the tslf  i have been think about it less on the treasuri side than on the other side   i don   t think the tslf will increas the demand for hold these secur in ani major  direct way   my hope is that  sort of around the margin  it would make dealer more will to make market in them and to be on both side of the market  includ the buy side from  e to  e  becaus then they would see that they had a place to financ those secur if  at the end of the day  they had more   so if it help  it will help the liquid of those market rather than increas the ul  demand for the secur   i think it is an indirect thing   my guess is that it might help at most around the margin   i don   t see how it can hurt   there is a certain logic to it   i don   t think it will help the student loan at all   the structur issu are just overwhelm ani of the other issu in that line   if somebodi ask you  mr  chairman  whether this was aim at student loan  i think you could say that they just were along for the ride in the sens that they were part of the aaa ab market and that we didn   t have ani expect that expand that market would help them   thank you
okay   presid bullard
i am the new guy  but i will just put in my two cent here   everyon seem to agre that there is no quantit impact   i can   t see ani quantit impact   there are polit implic   i don   t see whi we are do it
to repeat what bill said  i think it is hard to measur the quantit impact  but my guess is that there is some   but the point is well taken   what i would like to do is go through the first vote  and then we will take a straw vote on the tslf  and then decid what to do   okay   first  we have to ratifi domest open market oper
no object   okay   now the swap agreement with canada and mexico
is there anyon who want a roll call on this   okay   if not  then no object   extend and expand the swap agreement with the ecb
is there anyon who want a roll call on this   okay   then  without object   expand and extend the swap agreement with the swiss nation bank
without object   okay   now  on the tslf  the propos is to includ this as part of the packag   there will be no chang to the facil except for the increas in the collater rang  to includ aaa asset back secur   are there ani further comment on this   i am go to ask for a straw vote  just to get a sens   abstent are fine  if there are no further comment  how mani peopl are in favor of this   i see     i think
are you ask voter onli
i   m sorri
are you ask voter onli or the entir tabl
i would like to get a sens of all particip  if that is okay  thirteen particip are in favor   all right   all particip against   okay   let   s go ahead and take a vote on this  then   is there anyon who want a roll call vote   if not  then no object
no object   thank you   let   s turn now to the econom situat   dave
nathan and i thought that we would alter slight the structur of our brief today so as to focus a bit more close than usual on the global and domest outlook for inflat   i   ll start with a brief review of recent econom develop and our outlook for econom activ in the unit state   nathan will then discuss trade and foreign activ befor turn to global commod market and our forecast for import price   i will then explain how both foreign and domest influenc are shape our outlook for u s  inflat     will conclud by present your forecast   let me turn first to the domest economi   from a forecast perspect  this intermeet period turn out to be reason tranquil  at least by the standard of the past nine month   the incom data were veri close to our expect and requir few adjust to either top line gdp or to the individu compon of spend   as we note in the  book  we continu to think it like that the economi is in recess  and  with the data evolv pretti much as we had expect  we have seen littl reason to back away from that call   read from the labor market support the view that  at the veri least  a pronounc deceler in aggreg activ is under way   privat payrol fell about         in march  the third consecut month with a drop of that magnitud  and the unemploy rate move abov   percent   moreov  a notabl weaken of labor market is signal by most of the indic that we monitor   survey of hire plan have continu to move lower  there are fewer job vacanc  busi report that job are easier to fill  and household attitud have continu to sour  includ their view of the labor market   in the past  such a configur of read has been a reason reliabl indic of cyclic downturn   april                 of     the spend data also have been consist with our forecast of a mark weaken in aggreg demand and activ   after post modest gain last year  consum outlay and busi equip spend appear to have been at a near standstil sinc the turn of the year   meanwhil  hous continu it steep descent and look to be on track to subtract about     percentag point from the growth of real gdp in the first half of the year   close to our march project   moreov  while we had anticip a sharp deceler in nonresidenti construct in respons to more difficult financ condit  that sector now appear to be turn down earlier and more sharpli than we had project   final  much as we had been expect  weak domest demand is receiv some offset from ongo solid gain in export   all told  we es  that real gdp rose at an annual rate of    percent in the first quarter  just a few tenth abov our march forecast   as you know  tomorrow morn  the bea will releas it advanc gdp es  for the first quarter   for the second quarter  we are project real output to declin at a     percent annual rate  a few tenth weaker than our march forecast   on net  the outlook for activ in the first half is basic unchang from the  e of the last meet   look further ahead  our medium term forecast also hasn   t chang much over the past six week  the stock market is more than   percent higher than we had anticip   but the favor effect of that develop on activ are near offset by the advers effect of lower hous price and higher oil price  consequ  the gdp gap at the end of next year is unchang from the march forecast   our basic stori remain the same   the contract in activ that we are project over the first half of the year is expect to be relat mild becaus of the boost to spend and activ from the tax rebat and becaus export demand remain solid   in the second half  real gdp turn up  but i wouldn   t realli term this a recoveri   after all  real gdp is project to grow less than   percent at an annual rate  employ continu to declin  and the unemploy rate run up to    percent   but we see a number of factor fo  a more notic acceler of activ to a pace abov it potenti by        first  the contract in residenti invest abat   second  the drag on consumpt growth from the rise in oil price wane   third  financi condit stabil and then begin to improv  gradual reduc restraint on household and busi spend   final  we assum that monetari polici remain accommod   with the growth in real gdp run    percent next year  about    percentag point abov the pace of potenti  the unemploy rate drop slowli to     percent   obvious  there are larg risk on both side of our project   on the upsid  we could just be flat out wrong about an immin contract in aggreg activ  claim were run about         at the  e of the march fomc and are now averag about           while that increas suggest some further soften in the labor market  the level of claim seem lower than would comfort fit our forecast of payrol employ declin averag about         over the next few month  likewis  industri product has weaken but hasn   t drop off much   becaus april                 of     we don   t expect manufactur to be at the epicent of this busi cycl  we aren   t look for a plung  but we are forecast more notic declin than we   ve seen to date   in addit  although last week   s number for shipment of nondefens capit good in march were close to our forecast  the order figur were firmer than we had expect   in sum  while the data have not push us away from our recess forecast  they haven   t convinc confirm it yet either   more broad  with bond spread down  the stock market up  and market expect for the path of polici revis higher  the situat certain look less menac than at the  e of the march meet   but while we would agre that the risk of a veri bad tail event seem to have declin  we are not readi to join other in heav a sigh of relief just yet about the modal outlook   for one  we still see no sign of a bottom in hous   new home sale   we receiv the number after the project was complet   declin more than   percent last month to a level that we thought would be the bottom in the second half of this year   a second concern center on consumpt   with oil price run around      per barrel  consum will be face sizabl further increas in gasolin price over the next few month from alreadi elev level   also  given the steep declin in employ that we are project  incom and incom uncertainti will be take a hit   we   ve taken those factor on board as best we can  and we are count on the tax rebat to provid a power offset  but we can   t rule out a more advers reaction to what will be an accumul of bad news   furthermor  while there has been improv in the general tenor of financi market  i suspect that we   ve onli begun to see the effect of tighter credit condit on borrow and spend   that restraint could prove larger and more persist than is implicit in our baselin forecast   final  the mild downturn in activ that we are project also suggest some downsid risk  our project rise in the unemploy rate of    percentag point from it low point last year to it high point at the end of this year is small   smaller than occur in either the           recess or the      recess   this  e could be differ  but as i note in march  that argument should alway give you paus   nathan will now continu our present
much as dave just describ for the domest economi  our forecast for econom activ abroad also is littl chang from the last  book  recent data have come in consist with our view that the slowdown in u s  activ and the ongo financi turbul will leav an unmistak imprint on econom growth abroad   but the extent of this imprint appear to be somewhat less pronounc than was the case in the high tech led recess earlier this decad  particular for the emerg market economi   thus we continu to see foreign growth step down from last year   s   percent pace to near   percent dure the second and third quarter of this year  as foreign activ is constrain by the weaken u s  economi and headwind from the ongo financi turmoil   with these factor project to abat  we see growth abroad rise back to near it trend rate of around     percent in        april                 of     suffic it to say  the risk around this forecast remain signific   on the upsid  china   s surpris strong first quarter gdp growth   which we es  was near    percent at an annual rate   highlight the possibl that growth in emerg asia  and perhap elsewher as well  may remain more resili than we anticip   on the downsid  the softer than expect german ifo data last week and the negat tone of the bank of england   s recent credit condit survey suggest that growth in europ may slow more than we now project   the exchang valu of the dollar  after fall sharpli in the month befor the march fomc meet  has rebound somewhat dure the intermeet period  against the major currenc  the dollar is up almost     percent  with a particular sizabl gain against the yen   go forward  we continu to see the broad real dollar depreci at a   percent pace  reflect downward pressur associ with the larg  albeit narrow  current account deficit   this depreci is expect to come larg against emerg market currenc  includ the chines renminbi   which have move less sinc the dollar   s peak in earli        turn to the u s  extern sector  we now see the arithmet contribut from net export to first quarter u s  real gdp growth as like to be around     percentag point  down a few tenth from the last  book   recent read on export have continu to point to strength  but import in februari bounc back from their decemb and januari weak more vigor than we had expect  for      as a whole  we continu to believ that the demand for import will be signific restrain by the weak pace of u s  activ and  to a lesser extent  by the depreci of the dollar and rise price for import commod   we thus see import contract near   percent this year   in contrast  export are expect to post   percent growth this year  support by the weaker dollar   the project contract of import  coupl with still strong export growth  suggest that net export will contribut near    percentag point to u s  gdp growth this year   the largest posit contribut from net export to annual growth in more than    year   in       import growth is expect to bounc back to around   percent as the u s  economi recov  and the posit contribut from net export should accord declin to just under    percentag point   oil price have continu their appar relentless march upward  with spot wti now trade at      per barrel   sinc your last meet  the spot price of wti has increas    per barrel  and the far futur price has move up almost    per barrel   over the past year  spot oil price have risen a stagger    percent   while the high level of oil price appear to be take a bite out of oil demand in the unit state and other industri countri  the demand for oil in the emerg

continu to be hamper by inadequ infrastructur and by uncertainti about properti right and the stabil of tax regim   in the absenc of ani better approach  we continu to base our forecast on quot from futur market  which see oil price as like to remain high   at or abov      per barrel   through the end of the forecast period   but the confid band around this forecast are except wide given uncertainti surround the outlook for oil suppli and demand   nonfuel commod price have also been on a wild ride of late   the price of mani of these commod increas particular sharpli in januari and februari  befor peak in earli march   on balanc  our index of nonfuel commod price rose at a hefti annual rate of    percent dure the first quarter   we project a further    percent rise in the second quarter  but   again in line with quot from futur market   we see these price flatten out thereaft   the under driver of the sustain run up in the price of nonfuel commod have been broad similar to those for oil   sharp increas in demand  particular from emerg market economi  coupl with typic lag and often mute suppli respons  notabl  howev  move in nonfuel commod price sinc the march fomc meet have been quit vari   for exampl  copper and aluminum price are up wherea nickel and zinc price are down   for food  corn  rice  and soybean price have risen while wheat price have declin substanti   the overal strength of commod price continu to put upward pressur on inflat in mani countri and to complic life for central bank   notabl  in the euro area     month headlin inflat in march rose

summer  rais the risk that mervyn king will be requir to write anoth letter to the chancellor of the exchequ explain whi inflat has deviat from the   percent target   concern about the inflat outlook have limit the willing of both the ecb and the bank of england to cut polici rate to address slow growth   perhap even more strike  face with upward pressur on inflat from rise food and energi price coupl with still solid econom growth  central bank in a broad array of emerg market economi tighten polici over the intermeet period   this group includ china  singapor  india  brazil  russia  poland

particular rice  and this has exacerb upward pressur on the global price of these commod   the run up in commod price  coupl with the weaker dollar  has push up u s  core import price inflat of late   core import price are now es  to have increas at a     percent annual rate in the first quarter  more than twice the pace of increas in the second half of last year   price of materi intens import  includ industri suppli and food  are seen to have surg at a surpris rapid pace of    percent in the first quarter  on the back of the rapid rise in commod price   price of import finish good  includ consum good  capit good  and auto  are es  to have risen at a compar mute rate of    percent  but this also was up sharpli compar with recent quarter   the acceler in finish good price seem well explain by recent move in the dollar  howev  and   not suggest ani notabl increas in the extent of exchang rate pass through   go forward  we see core import price inflat remain elev in the second quarter  at around   percent   thereaft  core import price inflat should abat  given the project flatten out of commod price and the slower pace of dollar depreci
befor explain how the global develop that nathan just describ intersect with our domest inflat forecast  i should briefli review some of the incom inform on price   for the most part  the recent consum price data have been run below our expect   at the  e of the march  book  we were es  that core pce price had increas at an annual rate of    percent in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year  we now are project increas of     percent and   percent in the fourth and first quarter  respect   although we are es  that core pce price rose     percent in march   just a coupl of basi point below our previous forecast   there were notic downward revis to the data stretch back to late last year  princip for medic servic and nonmarket price   just as we had discount some of the earlier elev increas in core pce price  we are now inclin to discount the recent more favor read   the small increas in medic servic price are not like to persist   moreov  some of the recent slowdown is attribut to nonmarket price  which we view as both noisi and mean revert   still  we don   t think all of the good news on core pce price of late should be written off  and all els be equal  we would have taken down our forecast for the year as a whole in respons to the incom data   but  of cours  all els was not equal   as nathan has note  there has been anoth sizabl increas in crude oil price  the price of non oil import have increas more rapid than we had expect  and more broad  both import and domest produc materi price have risen sharpli thus far this year   in reaction  we have mark up our forecast for core pce inflat for the remaind of the year  and that upward revis basic offset the effect of the recent good news   april                 of     for now  inflat this year look like to repeat the pattern of the past four year   sinc       headlin pce price have risen at about   percent per year  and core price have been up at a rate of about    percent   due to a further steep rise in energi price  larg gain in import price  and anoth abov trend increas in food price  we are project headlin pce price to rise    percent this year and core price to increas    percent   similar to the averag over the preced four year  moreov  our forecast for      bear a strike resembl to the out year forecast that we have continu to make over the past four year   by now  in answer to the question of whi inflat is expect to slow in the forecast  most of you could easili recit the staff   s catech of disinfl   base on read from the futur market  we expect consum energi price to flatten out next year and food price to slow to a rate close to core inflat   with the dollar not expect to fall as much as it has over the past year and other commod price expect to move sideway  import price are project to slow   those more favor develop in combin with a notic increas in project slack caus headlin inflat in      to slow to    percent and core pce inflat to edg back to   percent   both of those figur are     percentag point higher than our march forecast  reflect the indirect effect of higher price for energi and other import   as we have note mani  e  a key element in our project is the assumpt that oil and non oil commod price will flatten out as suggest by the futur market   to put it mild  that has not been a win forecast strategi in recent year  but i   m not sure that we have a superior one to offer you   obvious  there are some big upsid and downsid risk to our forecast of domest inflat   nathan has alreadi cover some of those relat to price for oil and other import  so let me say a few word about the outlook for retail food price  our outlook for food price remain relat sanguin  but there would appear to be more pronounc risk to the upsid than the downsid   although most of the valu of what   s in your morn cereal bowl is advertis  packag  and transport  some corn and wheat are in there also   laughter  and those price have been rise rapid   futur market are predict a level out in crop price  and that expect is built into our forecast   but worldwid stock of grain remain tight  and ani serious shortfal in product could result in sharpli higher price   in that regard  while the grow season here is just get under way  corn product is off to a slow start becaus unusu wet condit have hamper plant  elsewher  increas suppli of livestock product and poultri have been a moder influenc on retail food price in recent month   again  while futur market suggest relat subdu price go forward  there are a few worri sign   although cattl on feedlot have remain near record level  new placement have fallen off of late  report becaus of the higher cost of feed   in addit  the portion of feedlot placement compos of femal was high last fall and through the winter  which point to a reduct in the size of the breed herd this year and thus suggest some potenti suppli risk ahead   in recognit of the upsid risk pose by both food and energi price  we includ in the  book an altern simul in which oil price climb to april                 of          per barrel next year and food price continu to run at the elev pace of the past three year   in this scenario  we also assum that anoth year of elev headlin inflat result in a further eros of inflat expect of about   percentag point   under these condit  headlin pce price inflat post anoth year north of   percent  and core inflat move a bit higher to     percent this year and next   it strike me that this type of persist upward creep to inflat  which would be difficult to posit identifi in real  e  is a more like risk than a sudden upward surg in price inflat   there are  howev  some downsid risk to the inflat outlook as well   as you know  we up our price forecast a bit in the last round becaus we saw the incom read on inflat expect as suggest that there had been some modest upward movement over the preced few month   some of that increas may have result from your aggress eas of polici earli this year   but go forward  the situat may be turn around   if our forecast over the next few quarter is in the right ballpark  and on our assumpt that the eas of polici is come to an end  you will be stand pat on polici even as payrol employ fall throughout the remaind of the year  the unemploy rate trend higher  and headlin inflat begin to back down   it  sn   t seem a stretch to me that in that environ  inflat expect could come down somewhat  a develop not embodi in the baselin forecast   more broad  one place that inflat expect might be expect to manifest themselv in a way that would be most damag to inflat would be in labor compens   despit the elev headlin inflat of the past four year  there is littl evid of ani notic step up in wage inflat   if that was the case when the unemploy rate was     percent  it seem less like that larger nomin wage gain will be secur when the unemploy rate rise to    percent   inde  increas in hour labor compens have been run well below our model for some  e  point to some addit downsid risk to our inflat outlook   for now  we see substanti risk to the inflat outlook  but those risk still seem two side to us     will complet our present
i will be refer to the packag label    materi for brief on fomc particip    econom project      tabl   show the central tendenc and rang of your current forecast for             and        central tendenc and rang of the project publish by the committe last februari are shown in ital   regard your monetari polici assumpt  not shown  about three fourth of the particip envisag a moder to substanti higher feder fund rate by late next year than assum in the  book  a path perhap similar to the one incorpor in financi market quot   most of you condit your project on a path for the feder fund rate that begin to rise either in late      or some  in       in contrast to the  book path  which remain flat through        mani of you were less clear whether you differ from the  book path    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     april                 of     over the near term  but with a littl read between the line  it seem fair to say that most of you assum a slight higher fund rate over the near term   as shown in the first set of row and first column of tabl    the central tendenc of your real econom growth forecast for      has been mark down near   percentag point sinc januari   most of you point to weak incom data  tight credit condit  fall hous price  and rise energi price as factor that prompt you to lower your growth expect for this year   about half of you forecast a declin in econom activ over the first half of the year  not shown   with anoth quarter of you see a flat trajectori over that period   howev  onli four of you use the word    recess    to describ the current state of the economi   none of you has a more negat first half outlook than the  book   the downward revis to your growth forecast are rough equal across both halv of       and so the contour remain one of a rise growth rate over the year   member    project for the speed of the recoveri in late      exhibit consider dispers  with some call for a quick return to near potenti growth support by monetari and fiscal s ulus  and other see a prolong period of weak owe part to persist financi headwind   most of you appear to expect growth to return to near it trend rate in       column    and to move slight abov trend in       column      the  book forecast for real growth in      is near the low end of the central tendenc of fomc member    project  but it is at the high end in      and        the second set of row indic that you have revis up your project for the unemploy rate throughout the forecast period   of those of you who provid es  of the natur rate of unemploy  most expect unemploy to remain abov the natur rate in      with the other see a return to the natur rate   as shown in the third set of row  your project for headlin pce inflat in      have been revis up a full percentag point  larg due to the surg in the price of energi and other commod   incom inform has also prompt a small upward revis to your project of core pce inflat this year  the fourth set of row    the rate of declin of core inflat in      is essenti unchang from that in the januari project  presum reflect the offset effect of the higher unemploy rate in the april project  on the one hand  and the lag pass through of this year   s higher food and energi price  on the other   by      the prolong period of econom slack push down core inflat to around the same rate that were project in januari   although the central tendenc for headlin inflat  the third set of row  also declin mark over the forecast period  overal inflat is project to be about   percentag point higher next year than you anticip in januari   nonetheless  by       headlin inflat is expect to be in essenti the same rang of around    to   percent that you forecast in januari   your inflat project for      are close to their valu in januari  but more than half of you rais your project for the unemploy rate in      signific more than     percent   to the extent that the higher unemploy rate project are view as impli an economi oper below it potenti in       april                 of     outsid analyst may infer that you expect inflat to edg down further beyond        turn to the risk to the outlook  as shown in the upper left hand panel of exhibit    a larg major of you regard uncertainti about gdp growth as greater than normal   the upper right hand panel show that most of you perceiv the risk to gdp growth as weight to the downsid   correspond  the risk to unemploy  not shown  are seen as weight to the upsid   you typic attribut the downsid growth risk to the potenti for sharper declin in hous price and persist financi strain   overal  the distribut of your view on the uncertainti and skew regard growth are littl chang from januari   howev  as shown in the lower panel  your percept of the risk regard inflat have chang notic sinc januari   as shown in the lower left panel  onli half as mani particip now see the degre of uncertainti regard the inflat outlook as histor normal  and twice as mani see the uncertainti as larger than usual   as indic to the right  fewer see the risk to their outlook for overal inflat as balanc  and more see the risk as skew to the upsid   your narrat indic that you see the upsid risk to inflat as deriv from the potenti for continu increas in commod price  further depreci of the dollar  and an upward drift in inflat expect   that conclud our remark
thank you veri much   are there question for our colleagu   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the  book is aggress and effect at portray the u s  economi as be in a mild recess   they   ve overcom the statist evid  which often prevent us from forecast a recess sinc they are most surpris  there   s a nonlinear step down in the second quarter that begin this recess   so i   m a littl curious as to whi you didn   t follow this up by forecast a jobless recoveri   in the last two recess  that has been an import element of what follow   i wonder if it is now a featur of the great moder busi cycl   if you look at equilibrium real fund rate  they tend to bottom out dure the period of most troubl jobless in the aftermath of the recess   so if we   re go to be reli on a period in which we   re do someth we haven   t done befor  like buy a bit of addit inflat credibl  it will be unusu   i guess my question is whi you made that choic
this year certain is pretti close to a jobless year in term of a full year of noth but employ declin and then fair modest employ gain next year   but the princip reason we didn   t predict a pattern like the one we saw in the earlier part of this decad is that we don   t think we   re go to get the kind of product surpris that were such an import featur of that recoveri   as you may recal  we were stun by the extent to which  even in a period of cyclic weaken  we kept get much stronger product   i think it will be year befor research is actual abl to shed a lot of light on whi that occur   the part of the stori that we still think was probabl in play was that there had been an accumul of technolog advanc that busi were abl to draw on over this period and that led to a period in which  even as growth was pick up  employ wasn   t   we don   t see that happen again   although we didn   t see it happen the last  e either  so it   s possibl
thank you   that   s a fair point
presid  n
dave  i have a coupl of question   one is technic  and one is a littl more substant   the technic one is that you have a veri sharp declin in consum spend on servic in the fourth quarter of this year and then not much of a recoveri in the first quarter of next year   i assum someth special is go on there  but i don   t know what it is
what was go on there was probabl   i don   t know if it was ration or irrat   inattent   but in look at that over the weekend  it seem like someth that should not be consid as an analyt featur of the forecast   just in term of the falloff in consumpt that we expect to follow from the end of the tax rebat  my guess is that the consumpt folk were tri just to put it somewher and some of it show up in servic
servic    seem like the least like spot actual
i think i   m rais the white flag here    laughter
well  sorri   the more fundament question is that i have been tri to get comfort with an outlook that would have core inflat level off and mayb declin a bit  and that   s the forecast i have   but i took your present  which i think was certain on the right topic  to say that the risk around the core inflat forecast seem to be symmetr at this point   is that a fair character
i think that is a fair character   you know  one thing that we   re struggl with   and i assum you are as well in give your own view about the uncertainti and the skew around your forecast   is whether thing have chang   is the skew larg enough for us to argu that  in fact  the risk look unbalanc   we thought about that and about the potenti upsid and downsid risk    clear  as i indic  upsid risk would be associ with ongo increas in under price for oil and other commod that would probabl feed through indirect into core inflat over  e   on the downsid  we have been struck with how littl upward pressur there has been on labor compens and labor cost   now  if you pin me down and said draw a fine line on this  i   d probabl say that  given the pattern of the past few year  it would look to me as though there   s probabl a littl more upsid risk than downsid risk  but i don   t see that skew as be materi in the forecast
nathan  both you and dave express the frustrat that i think all of us have about reli on futur market in term of our forecast of lower price   it just hasn   t been veri help   do we know or have a sens of how opec itself forecast   do they just look at futur market   second  to what degre do you imput into your own calcul the incom april                 of     elast of demand for the rapid grow countri such as china   we know it is abov   on oil  third  link the two  to what degre would  say  the saudi royal famili or the al sabah of kuwait be think about those high incom elast of demand with those high growth rate offset what use to be their fear of a slowdown in their market   in       for exampl  they had onli three market to sell into realli   the unit state  japan  and what we use to call we n europ  now they have hedg against the weak in those market   so i   m wonder as we think about altern way to wrap our arm around this   and it is a veri difficult thing as the current indic we have has been shift all over the place and has not been veri use   have we tri to learn how the swing produc look at this and how they calcul and think about where price are like to go or whether they just look at the futur market as well
it is  quit frank  pretti tough to get a straight and compel answer out of the opec folk about how they think about the oil market   a number of us have sat in intern meet and listen to various explan   in fact  at one recent meet in basel  the repres from saudi arabia indic that opec was not prepar to suppli ani more oil to the market becaus the market was alreadi well suppli at the equilibrium price   it is realli quit frustrat   now  what they say in these meet is that their analysi of suppli and demand fundament would suggest a price of     a barrel      a barrel  or someth like that   then they blame the residu on specul and so on  and we spend a fair amount of  e look for such specul effect in these oil price  and we wouldn   t want to rule anyth out   i mean  from what we   ve seen  there may be an explan out there that elud us  but there are a number of thing that we would expect to see if it were specul   for instanc  run up in inventori   that we don   t see   we have also look at the behavior of noncommerci trader  and it   not seem as though the noncommerci trader are actual predict price   quit the opposit   they seem april                 of     to be chase the price  which is quit differ from what we would have expect   most recent  in a statement just this week  opec   s presid link the run up in oil price to the depreci of the dollar and indic that  for everi   percent declin in the dollar  oil price would rise       a barrel  which strike us as be just absolut extraordinari   we can see   percent on the dollar move oil price   percent  but to get a coeffici beyond that just seem   i don   t want to say    econom imposs     but i   d like to see the model that generat it   now  about how they actual talk about oil price behind close door  i don   t have ani addit insight to provid other than what i   ve heard them say in some of these intern meet  certain in our analysi we tri to think through the outlook for demand from countri like china and india   in fact  quit regular we do a full blown suppli and demand balanc exercis in which we say     here is the price   what kind of suppli and demand fundament would be necessari to deliv that price      we use the iea  the eia  and other as input  but we actual do our own separ analys   we tri to think veri granular about the demand from these emerg market countri and the implic that that has on the price  as to the last part of your question  i think certain it   s true  at least until recent  that there was a sens on the part of opec that  if they allow the price to stay too high for too long  there would be a signific suppli respons that would end up drive the price back down   now  the fact that they seem quit comfort to live with the price of      or      a barrel suggest to me that mayb they have come to the conclus that there is just more demand out there and  in some sens  they are go to ride the wave of this increas demand in some of these emerg market economi   that said  the price have risen a lot   they   re up    percent or    percent over the past year   a year ago i   m sure that that   s not what my predecessor was forecast  and it   s hard for me to imagin that we   re go to see oil at      a barrel   nevertheless  given the incom and price april                 of     elast of this thing  our view is that   percent greater global demand that   s not met by suppli could veri well push price up at least    percent   it isn   t go to take a whole lot of surpris on global demand to have a signific impact on price   as i said  i think that opec is awar of that and is will to run the risk that there may be at some point a larg suppli respons that could put signific downward pressur on the price of oil
thank you for that long and thought answer
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two question   one  in compar the staff   s forecast with a lot of the privat sector forecast   what it look like and it shape   one thing that is strike about the forecast is the veri larg adjust swing that occur in inventori   my interpret is that one thing that is occur in the way you   ve made adjust to your forecast   or mayb this is more of a question   is that the spend of the tax rebat appear to be occur out of inventori   therefor  there is no product respons  or less product respons  to the presum increas demand that may materi   can you give me some feel about whi you chose that way of treat this  the second question goe back to inflat   i thought your discuss of the uncertainti around inflat was excel   part of what you talk about in the  book was the uncertainti about pass through of commod price increas and oil price increas into various measur of consum price inflat  which you indic were imprecis and which we don   t realli know much about   i was struck that  if there is more pass through than the baselin say  we   re go to get more inflat in the near term  and then disinfl will be more rapid when you assum that commod price are go to come down   but if commod price onli stabil and don   t come down  then it   s go to be a more complic pictur   you do have an altern scenario that april                 of     say that commod price keep rise  but you allow expect to move up onli fair modest in the model   it seem to me that  particular if expect becom more unanchor than that  the  e path of the fund rate that are implicit in the simul becom much more aggress on the other side   i just want to make sure that my intuit is correct here
your intuit on that last point is correct   obvious  in that simul we have inflat expect deterior a littl more from where we think they have deterior alreadi over the past year or so   again  this is realli hard to pin down  but we think there has probabl been an increas of mayb   percentag point in longer term inflat expect over the last coupl of year in the context of this step up in headlin inflat and the higher commod price that are associ with that increas   so in the simul  we   re basic assum that the process continu   if you have anoth year or two of high headlin inflat  you may get addit deterior of inflat expect on the order of   percentag point   you   re right that  if expect truli becam unhing and peopl began to view the entir inflat process as generat some greater upward momentum  it would have implic both for inflat and
a lot bigger than just the rise in expect
a lot bigger than just the rise in expect  and the fed fund rate  of cours  would have to rise consider  on the inventori side of the forecast   again  you put your finger on the princip reason that inventori are as weak as they are in the near term  which is that we think there will be a pretti sizabl spend respons to the tax rebat but we don   t see that as show up fulli in activ in larg measur becaus we think firm are go to understand that this will be a one  e increas in demand   so they will be somewhat cautious about respond with higher product to that demand and will  especi in the context of a relat weak economi  be more content with april                 of     have that run down inventori than actual with ramp up product immedi   now  that   s guesswork on our part   again  i feel pretti comfort with that basic stori  but it is go to requir some fair negat inventori figur short   there is a technic factor here as well   we have occasion cite a residu season in import  and in the second quarter that residu season push down import a lot   but we see no residu season in gdp  so we take it out of inventori   that has been a standard featur of our forecast for the past few year   nathan and his crew have communic quit frequent with the bea complain about the fact that they have a season adjust process that take a relat flat seri and creat lot of nois   laughter   it   not seem as though it is probabl the best thing  but it exagger the downward movement in inventori   if i had to cite someth that would make me nervous about the weak in our near term outlook  i do worri that the inventori liquid in our forecast is larg  the declin in the inventori   sale ratio in our forecast look a lot like the declin in the inventori   sale ratio that we saw in      and        so it   s not out of line with past cyclic behavior  but it   s an aggress drop
in the theoret literatur there is a lot of discuss about inventori model now and what the appropri way is to think about it
i think i can assur you that our model of inventori invest are not veri good
but they don   t take inform and convert it into nois   laughter   other question for our colleagu   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   just to follow that up  dave  how do you build your assumpt on the spend respons to the fiscal s ulus
that was base on our read of the literatur  especi of the last episod of fiscal s ulus  which was associ with the rebat packag in the earlier part of the decad   we   re assum a margin propens to consum out of those rebat of about      that seem reason in line with what the literatur suggest   and that they will be spent out over the next few quarter   but  again  that   s base on one or two data point   we   re tri to draw some strong infer from those data point  and it   s our best guess at this point
yes  just a follow up   anoth way to ask my question is  given your assumpt about the fiscal polici s ulus and tax rebat  if i took the view that your es  of spend was not realli    cent     cent  or    cent but realli    cent   most of it will get save and not spent   how would that affect your inventori assumpt and  therefor  the path over the next sever quarter
rough  we   re offset about half the spend through the inventori drawdown  so you could basic take that   if you took away a signific fraction of the spend  we   d take away a signific fraction of the inventori liquid  and the gdp effect would be moder consider
other question   if not  let   s start our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i was pleasant surpris that we have not had ani major downsid surpris sinc our march    meet   so while i still recogn the economi   s downsid risk  i   ve becom less comfort about sign onto the  book   s judgment that a nonlinear step down in activ current is in train   on balanc  our project still look for weak in the near term and then has growth pick up as we move through      and april                 of     into        we see a notic output gap open this year but not one as larg as in the  book   under this forecast  it is possibl that some portion of      might eventu be label a recess  but it is not yet conclus that it will be   inde  given the high unexpect develop that event have proceed as expect  i think the downsid risk to growth have abat some   some of the stress in financi market has been mitig by our new lend polici as well as action by bank in recogn loss and rais capit   neither the incom data nor the report from my busi contact seem to be consist with the bleak downsid scenario that i fear might transpir after we saw the decemb employ report earli this year   in this regard  i will simpli note a coupl of observ from my contact   a nation shop mall develop report that his tenant experienc a small improv in april retail sale compar with march   he was not expect that   similar  manpow indic a small improv in billabl hour for temporari worker over the past month and a half  also unexpect  now  i am not say that i will be surpris if the outlook deterior further   i am say that the likelihood of that event seem to be smaller today than i expect at our last two meet  accord  i think that current real interest rate are appropri accommod relat to the baselin forecast for econom growth and the risk to that outlook   as seen in chart   of the bluebook  the real fund rate is essenti zero   of cours  this use a core pce measur of inflat and thus may overst the true real rate sinc headlin inflat has been consist run abov this core measur   there is the addit accommod that is be provid by the rang of new lend facil we had put in place   the extra accommod is appropri to offset the larg degre of restraint still be exert from financi market  and our expans of the swap line and the taf add to this accommod   furthermor  in the event of a nonlinear april                 of     step down in econom activ  as in the  book forecast  our polici respons can be adjust appropri becaus we   re well posit now for that  on the price side  on balanc  the recent news has been good   my forecast has core pce inflat fall to just under   percent in      larg becaus of the increas resourc slack in the economi   howev  i think there are substanti upsid risk to this outlook   all of my busi contact have note how high and rise energi and commod price are creat cost pressur that mani are pass on to their custom   as dave   mention  with his inflat catech  without review the past transcript i will specul that we have been project a level out of energi price sinc the price of oil was     a barrel   weak domest demand may limit the degre to which produc can pass through these higher cost  but it is unlik to prevent notic increas in some downstream price   the depreci of the dollar also impos risk even beyond the effect oper through the commod price channel   now  i do agre that labor cost have not been cite as a problem for inflationari pressur  and so that   add somewhat to trim out the risk there  inflat expect were also an issu   no matter how often we say that core inflat is a more reliabl measur of under inflationari tendenc  i find it difficult to believ that the public   s inflationari expect will not be affect by larg and persist increas in food and energi price   the past five year have been unkind on this score   on averag over this  e  higher food and energi price have push total inflat abov core about    percentag point  and it is also sizabl over the past ten year   anoth challeng for inflationari expect come from our polici focus on the downsid risk to growth dure a  e of rise headlin inflat   right or not  this could make the public question our attitud toward inflat   we are accept consider inflationari risk when we hope that these concern will disappear quick with futur april                 of     adjust to polici that have not yet been signal   how we balanc these conflict risk should be an import compon of our discuss tomorrow   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the third district  there has been littl chang in econom activ sinc i report in march   busi activ remain weak over the intermeet period but no more or less than anticip and than we report in our march meet   manufactur activ  residenti construct  and employ remain modest weak in the district   retail sale were also sluggish  our staff   s coincid indic of econom activ  which summar our region data  show a declin in activ in pennsylvania and delawar but moder growth in new jersey in march and  on averag  for the last three month   overal  our firm are not veri upbeat about near term growth  and like mani forecast  they have revis downward their expect sinc the start of the year   for exampl  in respons to a special question in our busi outlook survey  the number of manufactur say that current demand for their product fell short of what they had expect at the start of the year exceed those who had underes  demand   more firm have decreas their capit spend plan  with    percent indic that they either delay capit spend or postpon it indefinit   while growth in the district has been weak  price pressur face our firm and consum have intensifi   area manufactur continu to report higher product cost  and the percentag of firm rais price on finish good is larger than earlier in the year   the index of price paid and price receiv are near    year high for our firm  and firm expect to see price move higher over the next six month   these firm have a veri pessimist outlook for inflat  april                 of     turn to the nation outlook  i have revis down my growth forecast from what i submit in januari  as almost all of us have  but that revis occur larg between januari and march   there has been littl or no chang in my outlook sinc our march meet   compar with my januari forecast  i now see real gdp growth come in around     percent for      and close to     to     percent in             overal  this is about    percentag point weaker for       than my januari forecast  but there is littl differ in my forecast for       and         the indic that have come in sinc our last meet have general been in line with my march outlook   certain they have point to continu weak  but not wors than i had expect   although some strain in the interbank market remain  they do not appear to have intensifi  and our alphabet soup of target tool seem to be have at least modest benefici effect  even if onli psycholog  i remain concern  howev  about inflat and our calibr of the appropri level of the fed fund rate consist with our goal   inflat read have abat margin sinc our last meet  but as the  book suggest  there is reason to believ that this is a temporari repriev and that the level remain elev   year over year cpi inflat was   percent in march  and year over year pce inflat was     percent   well abov their      level   as we have been note  oil and other commod price continu to move up  and busi and consum continu to stress inflat as a concern   near term measur of inflat expect have risen sharpli   in the michigan survey  one year inflat expect rose to     percent in april  up from     percent in march and     percent in decemb   clear  the greater media attent on inflat and the discuss among the public are bound to have some effect on expect as  e goe on  i have some concern and difficulti interpret the measur in tip given the disrupt in financi market right now   so i take those with a littl grain of salt   nevertheless  five year  april                 of     five year ahead inflat compens is     percent use the board   s measur   this is down a littl from earli march but is still higher than it was at the end of        in fact  the instabl of these measur of inflat expect itself is a caus of concern for me   it may suggest that market question our willing to take action consist with sustain and credibl price stabil  now  we have often allud to the idea that near term weak will help mitig some of the inflat pressur   howev  i would just like to remind us that this critic depend on inflat expect remain well anchor   i hope that go forward we can reinforc that condit of the statement about weak help us on the inflat side so that we do not perpetu the notion that a stabl phillip curv is at work here and that a slow economi will alway lower inflat   i believ that the fomc   s commit to price stabil remain credibl at this  e  but just bare   i worri that we may be rest too much on our laurel  tri to talk a good game  but unwil to take the action necessari to support and sustain that credibl   as i have said befor in this group  we must not wait until expect have broken out becaus by then it will be too late   inflat has been well abov at least our implicit goal for a sustain period   as the bluebook point out  core pce inflat has been abov   percent sinc      everi year  and is project to be so again this year  and the project are even wors for headlin number  either cpi or pce   if we continu eas or maintain a real fund rate well below zero for a sustain period despit inflat well abov our goal  can we realli expect inflat expect to remain anchor  the  book seem to think that we can   it assum that the fed fund rate fall to      percent in june and remain there through the end of        given the inflat forecast  this mean a negat or close to negat real fund rate for almost two year   despit this   book april                 of     baselin inflat expect remain reason contain  and inflat is project to declin over the forecast period even as growth pick up toward trend   to put it kind  i have serious reserv about that scenario   the  book discuss an altern simul in which there is greater inflationari pressur   the es  taylor rule fund path in that is somewhat steeper than in the baselin   inflat end up higher at the end of the forecast period   the end of      and        than in the baselin   more progress on inflat will requir obvious a steeper path  but even in this altern simul  inflat expect onli drift up   they do not becom unhing   if they did  i would expect the polici path to have to be consider tighter in       now  i know that talk about money in the context of monetari polici is not veri fashion these day   but i would like to note that the monetari aggreg as measur by m  and mzm have explod   despit the flight to qualiti and the associ increas in the demand for money associ with that  m  grew less than   percent dure the fourth quarter of       sinc then  howev  it growth rate has near tripl   in januari it grew   percent on an annual basi   in februari after our rate cut  it grew    percent  and in march it grew    percent   growth rate of mzm are even wors over this interv   for the three month the annual rate were         and    percent   such rate suggest to me that there is substanti liquid in the economi   while i don   t realli like the old p  model and have had a lot of problem with it  at the back of the  book the stori it is tell is one of consider inflat over the next coupl of year  combin  the growth in the aggreg  the substanti negat real interest rate  and the fact that most version of the taylor rule call for a higher fed fund rate than we have current heighten my angst about the outlook for inflat and our credibl   market particip react to the incom data by appreci tighten their polici expect   at least as impli by the april                 of     futur market  as bill   point out   and that has had a neglig effect  certain no negat effect  on market or the economi more broad   one interpret is that the market particip have also becom uncomfort  as i have  with a fed fund rate that remain too low for too long   i take this as a healthi sign actual and one that we shouldn   t ignor   inde  we may just wish to use it to our advantag   i will stop there  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in look at the latest blue chip forecast for gdp growth  i note that the rang between the highest and lowest is among the largest on record  the    most op ist forecast are predict over     percentag point fa  q  over q  growth than the    most pessimist one   such forecast dispers is indic of the unusu high degre of uncertainti that we are face  the  book present one of the most pessimist econom forecast  yet i find it recessionari project quit plausibl and see downsid risk that could take the economi well below that forecast   although i found it especi difficult this  e to decid on the most like outcom for the economi  i end up submit a forecast that show somewhat more growth in      than the  book  even though we share the same assumpt concern monetari polici this year   my forecast project      growth of   percent   this averag no growth in the first half and     percent growth in the second   the unemploy rate increas to just over     percent by the end of this year  a bit lower than the  book   in one critic area   name  the advers effect of financi sector develop on the real economi   i remain just as pessimist as the  book   although the likelihood of a sever financi panic has diminish  the risk are by no mean behind us   moreov  credit condit have turn quit restrict   this credit crunch april                 of     reflect the dri up of financ both for market that were import sourc of busi and consum credit and from bank that are contend with capit deplet loss and illiquid asset  among bank  the latest senior loan offic opinion survey note a clear tighten of lend standard  and my own discuss with banker confirm this point   they say they are care reassess and signific curtail exist home equiti line of credit as well as unsecur consum loan of all sort   bank are also clamp down on the provis of revolv busi credit  even to veri creditworthi custom   for exampl  the treasur of chevron  a high rate oil compani that  as you can guess given energi price  has a veri strong profit outlook  recent complain to me that bank were reluct to extend even it credit line   such reluct is also evid for lend to student  consum  and other busi   the risk of a deepen credit crunch remain as a weak economi   especi with further sharp declin in hous price   escal credit loss  harm financi institut balanc sheet  and caus them to scale back lend even further   my sens from our busi contact is that their percept of reduc access to credit is caus them to manag their firm   s liquid more care and is lead to some deferr in capit spend project as a precautionari measur   certain the mood is decid more pessimist and cautious  amid the gloom of the credit crunch  i do see a possibl silver line in that it may amplifi the effect of the fiscal s ulus packag  and this is part of the reason that my forecast downturn is a littl milder than the  book   s   in particular  becaus of the credit and liquid consider  the latest fiscal packag could well provid a bigger bang for the buck than the tax rebat in        first  the current tax rebat are more direct target at lower incom household  which are more like to be credit constrain and to spend the cash onc it   s in hand  second  given the current tighten of credit avail  household will like spend an even april                 of     greater fraction of the tax rebat than they did in        of cours  there is consider uncertainti about assess the potenti size of these effect   but over the next few month as the check go out and the retail sale report come in  we should get a pretti quick preliminari read on how thing are shape up  regard inflat  the most worri develop sinc we met in march have been the price surg for a wide varieti of raw materi and commod  especi the jump in the price of crude oil   from the u s  perspect  this run up in price repres main a classic suppli shock  which could threaten both part of our dual mandat  although the declin in the dollar has slight exacerb the sever of the impact   like the  book  my forecast for inflat   take commod price futur at face valu and forese a level out of price go forward  although i must say  after four year of be wrong  i am begin to feel like   brown tri to kick that footbal   the most recent core consum price data have shown some improv  and like the  book  i   m op ist that core inflat will subsid to around    percent over the forecast period  assum that the commod price do final level off and compens remain well behav  an interest analysi by bart hobijn of the new york fed as well as my own staff impli that  in an account sens  pass through from the run up in oil and crop price may have boost core inflat as much as     percentag point over the past two year   so a level off of these price could lower not onli headlin but also core inflat   my core pce inflat forecast is a tenth or two lower than the  book this year and next also becaus we assum lower pass through of the dollar depreci to non oil import price   we have been reexamin the data on this issu and find the evid quit convinc that pass through has been quit low recent   lower  for exampl  than embodi in the frb us model  april                 of     with respect to inflat expect  market base measur have now edg down   we took littl comfort from this fact  howev  becaus we had view the uptick in inflat compens in recent month main as a reflect of a higher inflat risk premium and not a reflect of higher inflat expect   i am also somewhat concern that the median expect for inflat over the next five to ten year in the michigan survey has tick up
mr  chairman  i want to focus my comment today on what i have heard from my ceo contact   with regard to my district  it continu to do well relat to the rest of the countri  but it is not immun to the patholog that is afflict the overal economi   although still posit  econom growth and employ creation are slow  and our manufactur in the survey we just took are experienc substanti price pressur   seventi one percent of our manufactur in the survey report higher price  and    percent are expect input price to be even higher six month from now  set asid the   th district  i spoke in depth to    ceo nationwid   you have that list  mr  chairman  and i would like to speak to what i deduc from triangul those convers with what i read in the bluebook and the  book   let me note that the focus of my convers with these ceo and cfos was not what they have seen or what they are see now but how their behavior is like to be affect go forward and how they are budget go forward   distil the input to their essenc  it   s clear that activ is like to weaken further  those    mile of    foot flat car that haul lumber  mr  chairman  are now up to      mile  inventori of unsold home are clear build  and that is import against the background that march is almost alway a good month in the hous or home sale busi   the ceo of centex report that this is the first down march he has seen  and he has been in the busi sinc        it april                 of     came down hard      percent   consum confid is weak   job insecur is spread  compani are tighten their head count   bank are tighten credit standard  as we have discuss   accord to the ceo of ma card  year over year retail sale to date in april   that is  ex auto and ex gas   were     percent  the lowest he has ever seen  citibank  chase  bank of america  and the other credit card purveyor are experienc high delinqu rate and a signific slowdown in their revenu from credit card  and wal mart report the    cascad    use of credit as a form of payment  as their ceo for u s  oper put it   in short  the consum driven correct credit cycl is prolong the econom slowdown and vice versa   consist with this sustain headwind  we have revis downward the dalla forecast and continu for longer our project of econom    anemia     we are not among the four that includ the word    recess     not onli for       but also for        and we have revis upward  to the upper end  our sens of project unemploy   thus  from what i am hear  from what i am read  and from what we are get from our analysi  i acknowledg the thesi of the presenc of a negat feedback loop among gdp growth  employ growth  and credit market condit  i find more worrisom the report i am receiv on expect price develop and behavior  and i see a feedback loop of anoth kind at work   page    of the bluebook note  as i think presid   point out and presid   refer to  that core pce inflat has averag more than   percent in everi year sinc      and is forecast  as per     s earlier comment  as do so again in        what concern me more is the left hand panel in chart   on page   of the bluebook that indic that the staff   s index of inflat expect and uncertainti is now at the top of it rang over the last decad   this is confirm by my corpor contact  april                 of     someth persist and pernici  mr  chairman  has been occur on the inflat front and call into question the credibl of our continu relianc on core measur  here is what i am hear from my corpor contact   i   m go to just mention a few becaus it is fair consist across the board   from the ceo of the largest retail in the countri  not to be name but locat in arkansa   laughter  i report last  e that they are budget price increas on        item of a littl over   percent in        yet his comment to me was     inflat is our number   concern  and it   s escal signific      he ad     all the inform we have point to an intermedi  and longer term suppli   demand problem  especi for food and ani energi depend articl      by the way  that was verifi by the ceo of frito lay  who tell me that they are offset their input price escal of    percent in      by rais price   percent effect last sunday   he ad that   and this is interest in term of the mindset      we have to   otherwis we   ll disappoint the street  and in these market no one can afford at this fragil  e to do so     the price pressur are less for cloth and nonfood item  but they are still there   i would like to use the exampl of jcpenney   jcpenney sell cloth to one half of all the famili in america  and    percent of their sale are apparel   the averag price point for an apparel sale at that retail is       the lead sourc of apparel is china   accord to penney   s ceo  increas in china   s labor cost  chang in their labor rule  and the cost of fuel and of cotton fiber have led to signific escal price pressur   he say that they can eat some of those cost and drive them down through other offset and tighter control  but they are plan a   percent increas in apparel cost in        here is his punch line  and it is not funni   this is a first rate ceo  one of the best in the countri      we think the custom can take a littl more price   after all  what   s    to    cent on       it won   t even be notic     april                 of     this is the essenc of the accommod of inflationari expect  and you are begin to see this mental set in in sever industri   for exampl  the airlin   we talk about the increas in the price of crude   if you take what is call the crack spread and figur out what has happen in term of jet fuel  year over year through mid april jet fuel was up    percent  that   s an industri averag  mitig somewhat by the hedg of southwest airlin  which has been success   accord to the ceo of american airlin     this oil is a tsunami   we will have to get some price power  or we   ll be left with onli one airlin  southwest      kimber clark  a paper produc  notic that the weaker dollar and oil are drive realiz cost increas up from  in their case       million in       to an es       million in         they have rais price  as i have previous mention  but the ceo feel that   and this is a winner      we are have to learn how to run a busi in an inflationari environ   we got use to product as the driver  but we can   t drive product ani harder than we can   we will need more price     it even affect semiconductor produc   texa instrument report that the weak of the dollar and the price of energi  gold  and copper offset by their hedg ad     percent non annual to their cost in the first quarter   ask what he envis go forward  the cfo said     well  that just mean we can   t spend it elsewher   we have to take it out of our employe    back or out of cap ex      one ceo of a compani that is expect soon to lay off between        and        peopl and is  therefor  care survey the attitud of their employe becaus they have a moral problem  is find out that employe are tap into their     k  plan or not fund them   in their survey they find the lead complaint is that    the price of gasolin and food is eat into my live standard   i can   t afford them      last but not least  just to bring this home  the eagl scout who mow my lawn in dalla sent me a veri nice  beauti letter   it is clear that he and his mother had prepar it on a printer and put a fanci titl on it  but the rest of the letter april                 of     was     dear mr     i have to levi a   percent fuel surcharg       laughter   we gave into it   he is a nice boy  in summari  mr  chairman  while there are mani who have voic concern with the advers feedback loop that run from the economi to tighter credit condit and back to the economi  i am veri troubl by a differ advers feedback loop   name  the inflat dynam wherebi reduct in fed fund rate lead to a weaker dollar and upward pressur on global commod price  which feed through to higher u s  inflat   that higher u s  inflat not onli has a price impact but also lead to cutback by consum and by employ so as to offset the effect of inflat   i am worri that  if we do not respond to higher inflat  the whole cycl will intensifi   when econom growth and activ return to normal  inflat is like to have notch up consider  accord to our sens   i know my respect colleagu say that we are will to be equal aggress in rais rate onc the outlook for real activ improv  but the practic of that notion i find in talk to my interlocutor is met with some skeptic and doubt  with that  mr  chairman  i see a tail risk on the downsid of growth   i acknowledg the argument of presid   and other   i think i   m sympathet  but i see a fatter tail  perhap an otter   s tail  on inflat   i am hear this loud and clear from my corpor contact   i believ that the risk pose by inflat is more signific than the extens of further anemia in the economi  especi now that we have put in place innov liquid bridg mechan  which we are amplifi upon today   mr  chairman  the other day governor kohn remind me that reason peopl can disagre  and he quip that he hope that we could agre on the follow   that we are at least reason peopl

thank you  mr  chairman   regardless to whom i talk with these day  the convers quick turn to both the fragil condit of financi market and the spectacular rise in energi and commod price   i had hope that one of these problem would have gone away by now  but clear that is not how condit have unfold sinc our last meet   the banker with whom i talk are pay close attent to their capit and liquid posit   they april                 of     remain concern about wide bid   ask spread and low trade volum in a broad array of secur market   inde  the repercuss of financi turmoil appear to have touch everi channel of credit intermedi   it appear that a rewir of credit channel is simpli go to take some  e to work out  the most signific financi news come out of the fourth district is the    billion invest of new capit into nation citi bank   nation citi is the countri   s tenth largest commerci bank  and it problem with mortgag relat credit are now well known   nation citi still has much work to do to clean up it balanc sheet  just as mani other financi institut with impair capit posit must do befor they can stand on solid ground again   although the fragil state of the financi sector repres a pretti sizabl risk to my econom outlook  the nation citi situat  along with other stori i   m hear  suggest that modest progress is be made  with regard to district busi condit  the stori i hear remain downbeat   commerci builder are report mix though general posit first quarter number   but their expect for retail sale in the store that they leas out across the countri have deterior  and they are fair pessimist about      growth prospect   one larg nation commerci develop whom i talk with told me that  for the first  e in his    year career  his compani has seen sale declin in march in everi retail center that they own across the countri   the manufactur i talk with indic moder first quarter revenu growth as export market  especi in asia and ea n europ  are still help to sustain product despit weak domest demand   at the same  e  manufactur report intens commod price pressur  and they report littl resist as they attempt to pass along the rise cost of commod to their custom  april                 of     the project i submit for this meet show real gdp growth under   percent in       with virtual all of that growth come in the second half of the year   this is a decid more pessimist project than the one i submit in januari but not materi differ from the outlook when we met just six week ago   i have  howev  boost my headlin inflat project for      compar with what i submit in januari  and it is somewhat higher than what i was es  when we met in mid march   although i am still project that the slack in the economi will be suffici to bring the core inflat number under the   percent threshold some  next year  i am now anticip a littl more pass through of commod price into core measur than i thought probabl six week ago   inde  everi  e i see commod price ratchet up  i becom less confid that slack alon will be abl to prevent an upward drift in the inflat trend  to be clear  i think the downsid risk that we face in the real economi remain substanti  and i am inclin to believ that some insur against those risk is probabl warrant   but in take such a step  i am inclin to judg that the downsid risk we face in the real economi will be rough in balanc with the upsid risk that we face from a rise inflat trend   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ continu to be slow in the tenth district with a soft tone in our residenti and nonresidenti construct and certain in our retail sale   mitig this weak  howev  to some extent is continu strength in energi and agricultur export and  to a lesser degre  manufactur   with regard to export  one interest develop is a shortag of ship contain domest and intern that is limit the volum of export of both our agricultur and some of our manufactur product   on balanc though  the district activ continu to be stronger than the nation economi  and this is reflect in better employ growth and firm labor market in mani part of our region  april                 of     in my recent discuss with director at our bank and in our branch and the econom advisori council member  sever theme have been promin   concern about inflat has escal to the highest level i   ve been involv with in the last decad   busi across the board are experienc the largest input cost pressur in recent memori for them   mani busi have not been abl to absorb these cost pressur and have rais price to both retail and busi custom  and general speak  busi are find much less resist to price increas than in the past   busi also report that supplier are increas reluct to make contractu price quot veri far in the futur  we have also been monitor the effect of credit avail on busi capit spend in our area   although busi report some tighten of credit condit  credit cost and avail are not the primari factor behind reduc capit spend plan   bank loan have actual continu to grow   instead  busi cite uncertainti about the econom outlook as the main impedi to invest   they are in a wait and see mode   so spend is be held back not for financi reason but just caution   inde  they suggest that uncertainti about whether monetari polici will be eas further is a factor current inhibit their capit spend plan  they want to see when we   re done  turn to the broader econom output and the nation economi  i have revis down my growth es  for the first half of      but have had few chang to my longer term outlook  compar with the  book  i see somewhat stronger growth this year and somewhat weaker growth next year   weaker growth in the first half of this year is come larg from the effect of higher energi price on consum and busi spend coupl with the continu weak in residenti construct   i would say that the effect of high energi price is now about as larg as or even larger than the contract in residenti construct  and i think that the energi outlook april                 of     constitut a main downsid risk to growth in the period ahead   in contrast   and contrari to the  book and the view of some   i think that energi and hous perhap now more than credit problem are hold back econom growth   certain credit condit have continu to tighten as reflect in the april senior loan offic opinion survey  and market for mani asset back secur  of cours  have shut down   but the avail of credit for good busi and household borrow   not appear to have realli been restrict that much   they are price more wise for risk  and that is probabl a posit   consequ  the downsid econom risk from a pronounc credit contract appear to have diminish consider over the past few month  i want to turn to inflat   in my view  the inflat outlook has worsen consider  for the first  e in mani year  we are see signific inflat pressur from good price  especi import good price   moreov  the recent moder in month inflat number is come main from some soft in servic price  which in my opinion  is unlik to continu  more op ist view of inflat  includ those in the  book  reli heavili on econom slack and a turnaround in food and energi price to improv the outlook   i am skeptic on both count   i do not think that there will be as much slack generat in the current slowdown as   the  book  and there is evid that the effect of output and employ gap on inflat have fallen  well  actual more than a littl over the past two decad   furthermor  i have not seen ani indic that elev energi and food price inflat is like to dissip soon  as mani of these pressur are reflect of intern econom develop that we have talk about here  includ the weak in the dollar  i believ that we are enter a danger period  if i can use that word  in which inflat expect are begin to move higher and inflat psycholog is becom more promin in busi decis   in this regard  i also do not take much comfort from favor read of labor april                 of     cost as wage tend to follow price in my experi   in these circumst  i am concern that maintain a high accommod polici stanc for an extend period would great increas the likelihood that inflat exceed our long run object   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   fifth district econom condit soften further in recent week   follow a pop up in march  our manufactur contact said that factori activ lost momentum in april   servic firm that we survey again report tepid growth in their revenu  and retail sale continu to be veri weak   in real estat  the stori is mix   our hous market continu to post general slow sale  but recent anecdot suggest some scatter firm   realtor and other indic that northern virginia and maryland have seen a spring bounc in sale in recent week   one realtor said that a factor support sale is that seller now seem more will to come off      price   the charlott market has also seen a spring bounc  coastal area in the  ina  hard hit until recent  are said to be more activ late   of cours  it is hard to know what these anecdot mean on a season adjust basi  and contact caution that it is too soon to call the bottom   in contrast  home sale are weaken in mani other area of the  ina  where market had post sale and price gain well after the nation market had turn down   residenti construct in near all area continu to weaken   on the commerci real estat front  condit have soften somewhat  although in d c  proper  commerci rent are firm and vacanc are low   commerci construct activ is broad soften  my read of the nation report sinc the last fomc meet is that the real outlook has not chang much   in particular  we still appear to be in a recess   payrol employ has continu to declin  fall an averag of        per month in the first quarter   unemploy is rise  although it is still relat low   nonresidenti construct is weaken  and the falloff in april                 of     architectur bill is particular discourag   other busi invest has been soft as well  consum spend  like busi spend  appear to have slow to a crawl   the length and depth of the recess are like to depend on stabil in the hous market   the sharp declin in home construct has continu unab  and outsid of the one month tick up in the brand new  as yet untest  month home price index from ofheo  there   s no sign of ani bottom in ani of the nation data on hous   have said that  i note earlier some scatter report of a season pickup in home sale   so there   s a chanc  perhap onli a slim one  that we   ll see some stabil in market this summer  concern are often voic about the possibl of broad spillov from financi market condit in the form of sharpli tighten credit condit for household and busi   but if we look past the drama in wholesal market and the end user credit market that gave rise to it  in hous and buyout financ   evid of such spillov is hard to come by  at least so far   it is true that delinqu have risen across a broad class of credit   commerci real estat  c i loan  and auto and credit card portfolio  for exampl   and lender are report tighten term across mani of these borrow class   but that is general what happen in recess   spread widen and credit flow fall becaus mani consum and firm becom genuin riskier   so far  delinqu rate and credit spread face by consum and firm appear to be well within the bound of what happen in past credit cycl  more broad  recent experi have reveal import new inform about the efficaci of some promin financi market mechan   inform that is  in turn  affect the current behavior of financi market particip   auction rate secur  for exampl  seem to have work well for decad becaus investor attach relat low probabl to contractu claus that reset their rate and prevent their exit   reach those claus has natur caus investor april                 of     to updat their es  of the probabl of reach those claus  and the result has been much less   in fact  virtual nil   demand for those secur   similar  recent experi has brought dramat revel about the inform or lack thereof of credit agenc    rate of asset back secur   it revel would seem to warrant fair dramat shift in investor portfolio  just as a matter of bayesian updat   these chang expect in light of recent inform revel are just as much a chang in fundament as the invent of the light bulb  spread in interbank market certain are elev  of cours  but one fundament factor here is the continu uncertainti about the sever of loom loss on mortgag back secur   anoth fundament factor is the demand for term fund by european bank about which uncertainti remain regard mortgag relat loss that may be immin   those sourc of uncertainti will persist as long as uncertainti about the bottom of the hous cycl persist  at our march meet i had strong concern about inflat  particular the increas in five year  five year ahead inflat compens and the rise trend in overal inflat   sinc then we receiv more moder inflat number for februari  and five year  five year ahead inflat compens has back off as well   although i still believ that these tip spread are too high to be consist with stabl  long run inflat below   percent  it   s hearten to see them come down follow our march meet   it seem reason to infer that the improv in inflat expect occur becaus of the unanticip emphasi on inflat risk in our statement and the    basi point surpris on the fund rate   that respons  howev  confirm for me the hypothesi that the previous eros in expect was caus larg by the aggress of our januari polici action   i believ that substanti risk for inflat and our credibl remain   the michigan survey number for    month ahead inflat expect pop up to     percent  a relat larg number   the march cpi was again too high  and further increas in food and april                 of     energi price in recent week will continu to press headlin inflat upward   persist high headlin number could becom ingrain in household and busi decisionmak   i believ the risk remain that cut the fund rate again will have undesir effect on inflat expect  the real feder fund rate use the  book   s forecast of overal pce inflat is now between minus    and minus   percent   that seem like plenti of s ulus for now   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   well  for some  e i have been use the headwind period of the earli     s as a frame of refer for think about credit condit  econom growth  and inflat prospect for the next sever year   i won   t belabor that comparison much this afternoon  except to say that i continu to find it help   with that  and given that the inform we have receiv sinc our march meet hasn   t caus me to chang my view about financi condit or about growth  let me just say that i continu to expect financi headwind of some intens to persist well into next year   i think that the economi will declin   contract in this quarter and in the next quarter   befor growth resum  and that the resumpt will initi be fair mild   so my outlook for econom growth next year is below that of the  book   it is a pretti modest outlook  recent anecdot from busi contact and from peopl in financi servic firm have not been what i would call over negat   if i were to give those anecdot more weight  i would probabl be somewhat more op ist about the econom outlook than i am   but i am guess that those anecdot are underes  the weight of the credit constraint that are in train  and peopl   at least peopl that i have talk to   don   t fulli appreci that yet  turn to inflat  on averag it seem to me that the inflat situat and it prospect are no better  and possibl wors  than i had been anticip   to be sure  the core april                 of     measur of inflat have not acceler recent and look to be what i might call close to accept  look at their recent perform   but we have been warn that some of that better perform is like to prove transitori   meanwhil  headlin inflat has been elev and has tend to surpris on the upsid   moreov  i worri that the persist of sizabl increas in energi and general commod price will have a more pronounc effect on core inflat go forward than they have in the recent past   further  i have the sens  both from some es  of inflat expect and from the comment and question i have been get about inflat and the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  that the public   s convict about monetari polici   s willing and abil to maintain low inflat is start to waver  thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in term of market  fed credibl  and negat surpris on the data relat to our forecast  i think this has been the best intermeet period in a long  e   the market reflect increas confid that polici will be effect in mitig the risk both of a system financi crisi and of a veri deep  protract recess   we have seen a substanti upward movement in the expect path of the fed fund rate and in real forward rate  signific diminut in the negat skew in fed fund rate expect  and a signific move down in a rang of differ measur of credit risk premium  and market have been pretti robust despit bad news over the past few week or so   medium  and long term expect in tip have move down  and we have had a veri import and substanti addit wave of inflow of equiti into the financi system  our forecast  though  is rough the same as it was in march  and it is broad similar to the path outlin in the  book   we expect econom activ to follow a path somewher april                 of     between the last downturn   a relat mild downturn   and that of        we expect under inflat to moder somewhat over the forecast period to someth below   percent   we see the risk to the growth forecast still skew to the downsid  though somewhat less so than in march  and we see the risk to the inflat outlook as broad balanc   uncertainti around both path  though  is unusu high  i want to make four point   first  on econom growth  again  i still think we face substanti risk in this advers self reinforc interact among fall hous price  slower spend  and financi headwind   even with the veri substanti adjust in hous construct that has alreadi occur and even if demand for hous stay stabl at these level  we still have sever quarter ahead of us befor the declin in hous price start to moder   a further falloff in aggreg demand dure this period would rais the prospect of a much larger peak to trough declin in hous price  with higher risk of larger collater damag to confid  spend  credit suppli  et cetera   weak  as the chairman has remind us sever  e over the past few year  tend to cumul and spread in these condit  and weak may onli just be begin outsid of hous   the save rate here may have to rise substanti further   the world is behind us in this cycl  and it is like to slow further  diminish potenti help from net export go forward  second  financi condit are  i think  still veri fragil   the financi system as a whole still look as though it is short of the capit necessari to support growth in lend to creditworthi household and borrow   part of the system still need to bring leverag down signific   liquid condit in some market are still impair  securit market are still essenti shut   i think the market now reflect too much confid in our willing and abil to prevent larg and small financi failur   we are go to disappoint them on the april                 of     small one  which may increas the probabl they attach to the larg   at least i hope we disappoint them on the small one  third  i think the inflat outlook  as mani of you have said  still has this veri uncomfort feel to it   veri high headlin inflat  veri high read on the michigan survey  and the dollar occasion show the spiral of feed energi and commod price and vice versa   i sat next to paul volcker when he gave his speech in new york the other day  and he said that the world today feel as it did in the     s   i was aliv in the     s  but onli just    laughter   but i think it is better than that   it has to be better than that   core has come in below expect     is not go to explain all of that away by these temporari  revers factor   you have all acknowledg that there is somewhat of an improv in inflat expect at medium term horizon   it is veri import that you have not seen ani materi pressur in broad measur of labor compens   profit margin are come down  but they are still unusu high   the path of output relat to potenti  both here and around the rest of the world  is go to signific diminish pressur on resourc util go forward even if you have other forc that push up demand for energi and food secular   i think it is worth rememb that we had a veri  veri larg sustain relat price shock in the year preced this downturn  with veri littl pass through to core inflat   in fact  in mani way  core inflat moder over that period with output to potenti much tighter  fourth  on monetari polici  it seem to me that we are veri close to a level that should put us in a good posit to navig these conflict pressur ahead   what matter for the outlook is the relationship between the real fed fund rate and our es  of equilibrium  although we can   t measur the latter with ani precis  those es  of equilibrium have to be substanti lower than normal becaus of what is happen in financi market   the april                 of      book and bluebook present suggest that the real fed fund rate now is about at equilibrium   you can look at it through a number of prism and see some accommod   see the real fed fund rate somewhat below equilibrium now   we won   t know the answer until this is long over   i think that we are probabl now within the zone where we are provid some insur against the risk of a veri bad macroeconom financi outcom without creat too much risk of an inflat spiral   we should tri for an outcom tomorrow in our action and in our statement that is pretti close to market neutral  one final point about the futur   what strike me as most implaus in our forecast in new york  and i think in the averag of our submiss  is the speed with which we expect to return to growth rate that are close to es  of long term potenti   a more prudent assumpt might be for a more protract period of below trend growth for a bunch of familiar reason   i don   t know if that is the most like outcom  but it is a plausibl and realist outcom   i don   t think we should be direct polici at tri to induc an unrealist quick return to what might be consid more normal growth rate over  e   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   my forecast of output and inflat for this and the next two year are in the central tendenc of the committe forecast   my     s law machin went haywir under the pressur of     s deadlin   laughter  so my unemploy forecast need to be revis   but i hit the      deadlin  i think   i have stronger growth in      than the  book becaus i was hesit to adopt the staff   s assumpt about persist  serial correl downsid miss relat to fundament in consumpt and invest impli by enter a recessionari period when we haven   t seen those miss yet   but i didn   t discount this possibl entir  reason that the extraordinarili depress busi and april                 of     household sen ent was signific   i came out between the  book baselin and the    near term upsid risk    altern scenario  despit slight stronger growth than in the  book  i have rough the same headlin and core inflat path that are declin gradual through the next few year   i took some slight encourag from recent better read on core   i reason that flat commod price would revers ani recent tendenc for inflat expect to rise  and i anticip that vacant hous unit will continu to put downward pressur on rent increas  i have a coupl of observ on the outlook   first  i think the expect of improv financi condit is critic to the favor medium term outcom for the economi that presid   was just talk about   we don   t realli know what the current state of overal financi condit is and how spend is like to respond to them   direct  i think we can say that the sever deterior that was much in evid around the  e of the last meet has stop  as concern about an even more general set of failur   the seiz up of market and lend   have abat with our action and with success capit rais by intermediari   we have seen improv in mani segment of the market  but continu deterior in term fund suggest to me that there are continu worri about and pressur on credit avail  and credit avail and the cost of credit will be under some pressur as credit is re intermedi through the bank   even with some of the recent gain  market are still fragil and impair   spread have retrac onli a small portion of the run up sinc last summer   i notic in bill   s chart that most of those spread are back down to  say  those in januari  and in januari  we thought the market were pretti impair   so they are still veri  veri high by histor standard   mortgag securit market away from gses remain broken   there are problem in some other securit market  includ cmbs   a number april                 of     of intermedi  and longer term interest rate are still higher than they were befor the crisi hit in august   baa corpor bond  which is about the median borrow rate for a corpor  long term muni bond  and prime jumbo mortgag are all higher than befor we did ani eas  nonpric term and standard are be tighten consider  judg in part from the senior loan offic opinion survey  and i think that process is like to continu for a while  to be sure  short term interest rate are a lot lower than they were in august   but i suspect that a continu of current condit would not be consist with much of a pickup in growth and an eventu return toward full employ   this is a circumst in which relationship between the feder fund rate and other measur of financi condit have chang veri  veri substanti  and character the stanc of polici and financi condit by look at some measur of the real feder fund rate can be quit mislead in these circumst   i think we need to be care about how we character and think about the stanc of polici   the sens that it is neutral right now  much less accommod  depend veri much on our expect of substanti increas in risk take in financi market   now  i do think that the most like path is improv financi market condit  lower spread  reopen securit market  and stabil and mayb partial revers of some of the tighter term that have evolv   but this process is go to be slow   until the hous market show more sign of stabil  it is more like to be subject to backslid than to sudden unexpect improv  a corollari to this line of think is that there isn   t a lot of eas in the pipelin in the convent sens   our reduct in the fed fund rate have not eas financi condit  they have kept them from tighten even more than they would have done otherwis   the lag effect of polici eas come from improv in financi market   that is  as we april                 of     look forward  the lag effect of polici eas come from the improv in financi market that allow the reduct in the actual and expect path of short term rate to show through to the cost of capit more broad defin   this is a longer and more nuanc process than the usual rule of thumb about see the effect of eas on output after x quarter and inflat after y quarter  my second point about the outlook is that the risk around my forecast for growth are still to the downsid   uncertainti is huge   we are sail in a fog in unchart water  and the depth finder is on the fritz   so much for sail analog    laughter   too bad bill pool is not here  though i am glad jim is here   let me note that for the record    laughter   downsid risk from financi market meltdown have been reduc  though not elimin   but i think an import sourc of downsid risk now is the economi itself   the threat of recessionari tendenc take hold   i am told we have never had three month of substanti employ declin and busi and household sen ent as depress as they are right now without slide into a recess   busi and household have been unusu cautious in how they invest their save  move into govern onli money fund and bank deposit  boost m   and demand much larger compens for take risk   they are face much tighter term for their credit and uncertainti about it avail   it seem to me there is a reason possibl that this extraordinari caution in manag their financi portfolio and uncertainti about credit avail will carri over into their spend decis   that is not my project or appar the central tendenc of the committe  but it must be a signific downsid risk  in contrast  the risk to total inflat seem skew to the upsid by the potenti behavior of commod price   i don   t understand whi these price have risen so much over the last six month or so   to be sure  over the last sever year the rise in price must have reflect april                 of     increas demand in emerg market economi  but over the past half year the prospect for global growth have weaken   in those circumst  i would expect the effect of lower interest rate   say  in the unit state   to be offset by weaker demand   still  price have risen  the possibl that those type of surpris will continu pose an upsid risk to headlin inflat and  along with that  a risk to inflat expect   nonetheless  i saw the risk around a gradual downtrend in core inflat as about balanc  with the possibl of greater slack offset the possibl of higher commod price   i take some comfort in my project for core inflat and implicit for the more persist aspect of overal inflat from the continu moder increas in labor compens   those increas have been moder for some  e despit veri high headlin inflat for sever year along with still elev markup for nonfinanci busi  outsid of commod  cost pressur appear to be mute  and busi are abl to absorb increas   still  i agre that commod price increas  like ani suppli shock  have complic our choic   we are face a sluggish economi with downsid risk as well as uncomfort high total inflat that is feed through to some limit extent into core inflat and  by some measur  into inflat expect  especi near term expect   i do think  howev  that we need to keep in mind that the higher inflat is larg a function of these commod price rather than a broad acceler in overal price   core inflat has come in less than we anticip it would   i also take some comfort  relat to some of the tone i have heard around the tabl  in what has happen in market over the intermeet period  market have built in anoth   point declin in the fed fund rate but then an increas further out   so somehow they are take this promis of an increas serious   at the same  e they did that  the dollar rose   it didn   t fall   and the long term inflat compens built into april                 of     market came down   so i don   t see the evid in financi market that we are on the cusp of the broad declin in our credibl that i have sens that some other see around the tabl  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as has been describ by most around the tabl  offici data on the real economi suggest weak but haven   t materi chang sinc we met in mid march   other have talk in more detail about weaken labor market  poor consum sen ent  and worri trend in consum spend   certain the report through march that i have receiv are that consum spend in march was as bad as anyon who was in the busi of retail or credit card spend could have envis   that is certain disappoint   odd  there are at least some preliminari data through the first few week of april of some improv  but i don   t take much signal from them   also  obvious  as other around the tabl have said  the tone  trade  and expect of financi market particip have improv mark   if onli i were as confid   wherea market particip onli some week ago saw fear  they now perceiv promis   whether that is the triumph of hope over experi onli  e will tell  but i am skeptic  let me talk for a few moment about a coupl of posit factor that should be help and four or so negat factor   first  on the posit side  i want to give voic to the capit rais that a coupl of other around the tabl have refer to   we and the treasuri have been call for some month for capit rais across all type of financi institut   the question then were whether financi institut were will to take the dilut and go rais capit   at least equal as import was whether there would be suffici investor demand   i think the answer to both of those question appear to be    yes      investor demand from near all april                 of     sourc   includ sovereign wealth fund  hedg fund  and tradit long onli manag   has fund virtual all class of financi institut   that is  invest bank  money center bank  region bank  and communiti bank   across the capit structur   equiti  convert  and prefer debt   in a huge rang of distress and more stabl situat   i think that is invari a veri encourag sign  and we should onli be so lucki that those market remain wide open   is this improv like to be endur   this strike me as pretti consequenti as to whether or not we see the economi respond as favor in the second half of this year as the  book suggest   is the improv in equiti market  in leverag loan  and in high yield market and the narrow of cds spread sustain  or is there more bad news to come that is not price into the market   my own view is that balanc sheet are on the road to repair but that incom statement for these financi institut remain high challeng   march was a terribl month for financi institut    profit  which should make it harder for credit to expand  as would be hope for with ani sort of v shape or u shape recoveri  the second posit factor  build on the increas in capit  is realli what is go on among the fortun       particular the nonfinanci fortun        earn look pretti stubborn and solid   though they have come off their peak  corpor profit level are quit remark for all of the thing that are wrong in this economi  and they look to me to be anachronist with previous period of recess   the balanc sheet of those fortun      compani look excel   the invest grade market remain wide open   i think the question is whether those fortun      will be hire worker dure the next two or three year in the unit state  and on that front  i am probabl reason skeptic  april                 of     so if those are the posit factor  let me turn to the negat   first  consum weak seem to be spread   the largest credit card provid report that credit card spend is deterior   again  absent a coupl of odd nois in april   and that the strain show up as delinqu  which were onc onli in state where hous issu were predomin  now seem to be in other state as well   second  credit avail for small busi seem under remark pressur   not onli has the senior loan offic opinion survey continu to be disappoint  larg money center bank appear to be pull back from some segment of the small busi market entir   third  interbank fund market problem  as other have discuss  seem inconsist with the broader improv in credit market   it is a troubl sign that all might not be as well as it appear in this curat process   a fourth and final negat factor is inflat   the  book  which has a much more benign forecast for inflat than i do  revis up the forecast for core and headlin inflat in the second half of       as   said   i am still more worri about inflat prospect   as for inflat expect and possibl second  and third order effect of these chang in price  trade and anecdot over the last sever week and month continu to be troubl   i have spent less  e in my remark on inflat than on growth but onli becaus i suppos there is less to say   the trend are troubl   the relationship among our polici action  the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  and commod price are worth further scrutini   in summari  although we should be pleas with the offici data on the economi as not deterior in the intermeet period and with financi market that have certain exceed my own expect for improv  i remain quit concern about pressur on both side of the dual mandat   a discuss that we will take up more in the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   as i have talk about mani  e befor  i see what is happen as a continu slow burn after the fire realli heat up for a littl while back in march   thing have cool off again   but exact as governor kohn said  we now seem to be comfort at level that caus us extrem distress last fall and in januari   so i think it is import to put it into that context   there certain has been improv  but it is a littl earli to declar victori   not that anyon has  but i think we just have to be veri mind of that  some of the discuss remind me a littl of the discuss that we had at the end of octob  when we thought that thing were improv and then they deterior in a way that had us veri concern   but my central tendenc scenario has alway been not for a financi cataclysm  although that is certain a real downsid risk  but for a sort of slow burn that is just go to continu to weigh heavili on consumpt   i think it is negat feedback between hous and financ  but not necessarili a broader cataclysm   i veri much agre with presid   that the chanc of a signific nonlinear break to the downsid is not gone but lower than it has been   but the tighten credit condit are go to make it veri difficult for the market to repair and recov as rapid as perhap they do in the  book  on hous  we know there are direct and indirect effect   we have all the sign that the contract is continu   even after hous start have fallen more than    percent  we are still see them in near free fall   but that hasn   t help to allevi the inventori of unsold home  which remain at extrem elev level   although not move up dramat   part of the concern is that some of the sale may be due to forc sale relat to foreclosur becaus we know that foreclosur are up quit a bit   so we have to be a bit cautious there   almost all the measur suggest that expect of futur hous price are lower  which is caus peopl to be veri cautious about buy   the anecdot evid that i have is that walk through are fine april                 of     but that actual close the deal is much more difficult  both becaus of difficulti in find credit and becaus peopl are unwil to make a commit now   they think that price may be    percent lower in       or    month   for mani peopl  this is the largest invest that they will make  and tri to explain to a love one that they just lost    percent of their nest egg is not an easi thing to do   so peopl are be more cautious   we also see some of this in the abx measur that bill put forward   those number have come off their extrem low  but they are still much lower than they were befor   it is hard to believ that the actual default and delinqu perform will be as bad as those measur are suggest  but they are still suggest that thing are go to be pretti tough  and so we still need to be veri wari there  we are still see a differ in consum behavior   peopl be will to walk away from their hous befor they walk away from their credit card or from their car   that is suggest that peopl are just oper somewhat differ from the way they did befor  the jumbo spread are still extrem wide  as the chart show   we may be get some offset from the new fha program and from freddi mac and fanni mae  but i am still not op ist that much of this can come in befor the end of the year   that suggest that we have tight on that part   we also have tight in the credit card market  exact as governor   said   the credit card compani i have spoken to see continu deterior   we didn   t see ani sort of nonlinear chang but just a continu downward trend of real challeng and increas roll rate of peopl go             and more day delinqu   spend is up a bit  but they usual say that   s most becaus of increas for gasolin and groceri due to the high commod price   also  as presid   mention  there is more tighten in the heloc market   more challeng are there  so the bank are pull back  and more peopl are get into troubl  april                 of     i have an anecdot from one of the larg compani   a number of larg invest grade firm have drawn down signific part of their revolv  not becaus they actual need them but becaus they thought that they better do it now befor they are pull back   even these larg institut seem to be hoard liquid  much as the bank are do   i think the bank are do that becaus we still see cds spread that are veri high even though they are lower than their peak   the libor   oi spread that a number of peopl have mention still is high and is continu to increas   that is the most troubl for me   that we are move back to the extrem high we saw when we had the end of the year problem   but then we had an explan for it go away   now we don   t have an end of the year problem  so unfortun  it is difficult for me to understand what is go to make this go away   i think we can provid more liquid through some of our various facil  but i am not sure that that  in and of itself  will be the cure  we have seen more capit come in and help out some of the institut   but a lot of fragil is still there  as presid pianalto well know   the issu with respect to nation citi were liquid issu  not necessarili short term concern about solvenc  although i think there are longer term concern about solvenc   liquid and solvenc issu are ul  relat  but there is a real concern that mani of the money market mutual fund that hold between    trillion and    trillion will just walk away   we saw this with bear stearn   we can see this with other institut   i think that it   s fragil that account for some of these veri high level  we use to worri primarili about deposit run  but deposit run are extrem slow   deposit run are leisur stroll compar with what could happen in these liquid market   so i do think that issu are there precis becaus still more challeng are come with commerci real estat construct  as a number of other peopl have mention   there will still be a lot of april                 of     provis that will have to come up  put more pressur on the balanc sheet and make it more difficult for peopl to borrow   i also veri much agre with vice chairman   that the rest of the world is a littl behind us and that the boost that we are get right now from export isn   t go to persist  turn to inflat  as i think a number of peopl have mention  we haven   t seen a lot of pressur on the labor side   as labor market soften  it is unlik that we are go to see more pressur there   so that seem to be a posit   but we do see these veri elev commod price level  which don   t seem to have fed through to core   but exact as governor kohn said  it is a bit of a puzzl how they continu to increas  and that certain put some risk ahead of us   it is a particular difficult  e to get a good read on inflat expect becaus there have been lot of chang in liquid issu and in other particular factor   some of the survey base measur are up  but they tend to be veri close relat to gasolin price  and we know that those are at extrem high level   so i think it is extrem difficult for us now to make a solid determin about where inflat expect are   certain that rais a caution becaus we don   t want to have inflat expect becom unmoor   but i think it is more difficult for us to identifi right now exact how they are evolv  and obvious  this will be import for us in our decis tomorrow   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   my modal forecast is for a mild recess in the first half of      and is veri much in line with the  book forecast   i am more pessimist  howev  than the  book on the issu of recoveri   again  the issu is that we have had a major disrupt to our financi market and there is a mess  and i think it is go to take a long  e to clean up the mess   the parallel that presid  n made to the episod in april                 of     the earli      s is veri apt   i suspect that there will be substanti headwind come from the problem in the financi sector for quit a while  and that mean that the recoveri we would see would be more l shape than v shape  when i look at where i was at the last fomc meet  there has realli been a big chang for me   i re read the transcript  becaus you alway want to see what thing sound like  and i sound so depress then  as though i might take out a gun and blow my head off   that is the way it read   but my sunni  op ist disposit is come back    laughter   i think it is veri possibl that we will look back and say  particular after the bear stearn episod  that we have turn the corner in term of the financi disrupt that we have just experienc   i should mention  howev  that it  sn   t mean that we should be complac   i am not sure that is the case   we have been disappoint befor   but i think there is a veri strong possibl that the worst is over   you can see this in that there is less concern about credit risk in financi institut   that is becaus we had a major institut get into troubl  but becaus of our action  it didn   t blow up the world   there is an issu  of cours  of potenti cost and moral hazard go forward  but i think it has had the effect of calm down the market in a veri substanti way  veri import in this regard is that we are see that our larg financi institut are abl to rais capit now at not too high a cost   in fact  they are do so in a major way   when we think about the long term solut to the problem in the financi market  clean up the mess and rais capit is go to be absolut critic  particular becaus in the long run the securit market will come back   but it is go to veri much involv the larg financi institut  which will have to solv the agenc problem that were not solv in this recent bout of securit  which creat all of the problem   so their have enough capit is april                 of     critic   i think it is veri possibl that we are on the path to their sort out their problem  which in the long run will help sort out the problem in the credit market  i should mention  by the way  that i still don   t want us to be complac about this becaus thing could go in the other direct   there is still the puzzl about what is go on in the money market   in particular  we see these veri larg and actual widen spread between libor and oi   so even though i am start to becom op ist  i don   t want to be panglossian in my view   from my perspect the key issu is that  although my modal forecast hasn   t chang much from march  i see that the tail risk have decreas substanti  and i think that the probabl that we will have a sever advers feedback loop  which realli scare me just a littl while ago  is go to be much lower   i still see some downsid risk  particular  i am concern about the issu of hous price   they could fall more than we and the  book expect  and that could trigger some problem   but i do think that the downsid risk is much  much lower   anoth thing i should mention is that i think there is veri high uncertainti right now   so i could get depress again  but we will have to see   i hope not  on the inflat front  i see that long run inflat expect are still reason well anchor around   percent   the inform in the financi market on this score is that there has not been a big blowout in that case   there have been problem regard some of the survey  but i am a littl less worri about the survey in term of household   i am veri skeptic of them becaus they tend to react veri much to current condit   also  if you ask peopl what tv show they are watch  they will tell you that they are watch pbs and someth classi  but you know they are watch    desper housew       laughter
what is wrong with    desper housew       laughter
but i do have a concern about the risk to inflat expect becaus of the high commod price that we see   this is come from the veri advers suppli shock and the fact that we have had headlin inflat so high for so long   the good news  by the way  is that it is actual quit remark  given how high headlin inflat has been  how anchor inflat expect have been   i think that has to do with confid in this institut   s do the right thing   it is veri import that we retain that confid   we have to think about that when we decid what we are go to do regard polici  about where i think inflat is go to be   i have been a   percent guy for a long  e  i am not chang that   i think that inflat expect are around   percent and that there is no expect that we will have excess demand in the economi   if anyth  it is the opposit of that   i see the risk as balanc   there are some risk on the upsid  particular becaus of what is happen with commod price   on the other hand  there are risk on the downsid becaus of the expect slack and becaus there is some downsid risk in the economi   so on that ground  i basic have the same stori that i had befor   thank you
thank you  and thank you all for veri help comment  as usual  let me briefli summar what i heard today and then make a few comment of my own   again  in summari  data sinc the march meet have been soft  and econom activ is weak   but the recent news has not general been wors than expect   there was disagr over whether we are technic in a recess   most saw improv econom growth in the second half of      with further improv in       although some saw more protract weak   the hous sector remain weak  though there were report of improv   start and the demand for new hous continu to declin   price are fall   inventori of unsold home remain veri high   hous demand is affect by restrict condit in mortgag april                 of     market  fear that hous price have much further to fall  and weaken econom condit  retail sale  sen ent  and consum spend have general been soft  reflect a long list of headwind  includ tighten credit  weaker hous price  and higher energi price   payrol are fall  although there are some pocket of strength   unemploy is like to keep rise  it may remain somewhat high into        we will soon see whether the fiscal s ulus packag affect either the consum or busi invest plan   possibl  liquid constrain consum may respond more strong than normal   busi sen ent is also relat weak  reflect in part credit condit but also the uncertain prospect for the economi and continu cost pressur   invest has soften somewhat  includ declin in commerci real estat invest   strength in foreign market is help support u s  product and profit  especi manufactur  although foreign economi may slow in the come quarter  the energi and agricultur sector are strong  financi condit have improv in the past month  with financ condit better  credit risk spread come in a bit  and both equiti and real interest rate up sinc the last meet   decent earn  a sens on the part of some that the bulk of the write down in the bank sector have been taken  the abil of financi institut to rais capit  and possibl fed action  includ liquid provis and the action regard bear stearn  have contribut to the improv   on the other hand  mani market remain fragil  includ the key interbank market and other short term fund market   some express the view that more signific write down and financi stress lie ahead  as hous price continu to fall and the slow economi weaken credit qualiti  and that the full impact of tighter credit has not yet been felt in the nonfinanci economi   other  howev  were less concern about the real april                 of     effect of the financi condit   financi condit and the hous market probabl remain the most import downsid risk to growth  although energi price were also cite  read on core inflat were moder in the intermeet period  although some of the reason for improv may be transitori   oil price have continu to move up  contribut to higher headlin inflat   other commod price have also begun to rise again  mani firm note these strong cost pressur and indic some abil to pass those cost along to consum   inflat breakeven show improv at some horizon sinc the march meet  possibl reflect lower risk premium  though survey inflat expect were higher   the dollar appreci dure the intermeet period  but longer term depreci and rise import price remain anoth sourc of pressur on inflat   nomin wage gain remain moder  howev  and markup are high   uncertainti about the cours of oil and other commod price add to overal inflat uncertainti and perhap to inflat risk that are now somewhat more to the upsid   mani particip express concern about these upsid risk  about inflat expect  and about the mainten of the fed   s inflat fight credibl   ani comment  let me just add a few thought to what has alreadi been said   on the real side  i think that i am probabl somewhat more pessimist than the median view that i heard around the tabl   first of all  i am reason confid that we are in a recess   we don   t see these dynam pattern of employ  sen ent  and so on without a recess be eventu call by the nber   that fact  i believ  rais the risk of more rapid declin in employ and consum spend in the month ahead becaus there seem to be somewhat more advers dynam in a recess scenario   second  i remain concern about hous  which is not show realli ani signific sign of stabil   mortgag market are still dysfunct  april                 of     and the onli sourc of mortgag credit essenti is the gses  which are do their best to rais fee and profit from the situat   sale of new home remain weak   inventori of unsold home are down in absolut term  but they still are veri high relat to sale   we heard this morn of yet even fa  price declin for hous   as i   ve said sever  e at this tabl  until there is some sens of a bottom in the hous market and in hous price  i think that we are not go to see realli broad stabil  either in the economi or in financi market  now  there are some posit   export  for exampl   which have kept manufactur and other industri from declin as much as usual dure a recess   interest  this could be a mirror imag of the      recess   in       the busi sector was weak  and consumpt and hous were strong   we could have the mirror imag this  e  in financi market  there certain have been improv  and that is certain encourag   i agre with peopl about that   but we have heard a few peopl in the market say that credit loss and write down are in the ninth inning   as a basebal fan  i think we are probabl closer to the third inning   let me explain whi i think that   the imf recent project aggreg credit loss on u s  base asset of about      billion worldwid  with about a quarter of those come in the u s  bank and thrift   the board staff has a somewhat lower number  around      billion to      billion  but they have a higher fraction in u s  bank and thrift   so the basic number are pretti similar in that respect   the staff project for credit loss for u s  commerci bank and thrift  exclud invest bank  is about      billion for this year and next year and      billion if the recess is more sever   in addit  the staff project about     billion in write down of cdos and other type of trade asset   now  most of those     billion write down have been taken   they are most held by the top bank  and they have most been alreadi written off   howev  of the      billion to      billion in april                 of     project credit loss  so far u s  bank and thrift have acknowledg onli about     billion  so if you put togeth those number  you find that we are about one third of the way through total loss  now  there are  in fact  obvious some countervail factor   bank and thrift have alreadi rais about      billion in capit sinc the middl of last year  which essenti cover the loss announc so far   but that said  there is still a lot of deleverag to go   there is go to be a long process of sell asset  reduc extens of credit  and build capit ratio   this may not yet be fulli felt in the real economi  but it will eventu be there   so i do think that we are go to see continu pressur from financi market and credit market  even if we don   t have ani serious relaps into financi stress   so  again  i am somewhat more skeptic about a near term improv in econom growth  although i do acknowledg that the fiscal packag and other factor that the  book mention will be help  the question has been rais about whether monetari polici is help and what the stanc of monetari polici is   i agre with the comment that the real feder fund rate is not necessarili the best measur of the stanc of monetari polici right now   let me take an exampl that was given in the new york fed   s daili financi report a coupl of day ago  which was about the all in cost of asset back secur back by auto loan   accord to this report  in februari of        the three year swap rate was about   percent  and the spread on aaa tranch of auto back ab was about    basi point   the all in cost was      percent for this particular asset   in februari of        the three year swap rate was      percent  almost   percentag point lower  but the spread on aaa tranch was     basi point   therefor  the overal all in cost of auto loan ab was      percent   so the net effect is   well  is monetari polici do anyth   absolut   we have reduc the safe rate   we have brought down the april                 of     cost of fund   but the spread have obvious offset that   so what we have realli done is essenti offset the effect of the credit crisi   obvious  if we had not respond to the situat  those cost would be much higher  and the extent of restrict would be a lot greater  for these reason  i realli do believ that we need to take a much more sophist look at what the appropri interest rate is   the taylor rule  in particular  are just not appropri for the current situat becaus the equilibrium real interest rate of   percent that is built into them is not necessarili appropri  let me turn to inflat  which a lot of peopl talk about today   first  let me just say that i certain have signific concern on the nomin side   in particular  i have a lot of anxieti about the dollar   foreign exchang rate in general are not well tie down  and they are veri subject to sen ent and swing in view   therefor  although i think that the depreci of the dollar so far is a mix bag   obvious  it has effect on differ part of the economi   i do think that there is a risk of a sharper fall with possibl advers implic  in the short run  for u s  asset and  in the long run  perhap implic for our posit as a reserv currenc and so on   so i think that is an issu to be concern about   for that reason and for other reason as well  i am veri sympathet to the view i hear around the tabl that we are now veri  veri close to where we ought to be  that it is  e to take a rest  to see the effect of our work  and to pay equal attent to the nomin side of our mandat   i agre with all of that   so i am hope that in our polici discuss tomorrow we will be fair close around the tabl  that be said  i do want to take a littl except to some of the discuss about inflat   there is an obvious and veri elementari distinct between relat price chang and overal inflat   let me ask you to do the follow thought experi   imagin you are speak to your board   last year  as a first approxim  headlin inflat was   percent  april                 of     labor compens grew at   percent  and oil price rose    percent   let   s imagin that we had been so farsight and so effect that we manag to keep headlin inflat last year at   percent   the implic would have been  assum that relat price chang were the same  that wage would have grown at   percent and that oil price would have risen at    percent   in the convers with your board  your board would say     this inflat is kill us   these cost are kill us   we have to pass them through      they would  and they would be right   when there are big chang in relat price  that is a real phenomenon  and it has to be accommod somehow by nomin price shift   so to the extent that the chang in food and oil price reflect real suppli and demand condit  obvious they are veri distress and bad for the economi and creat a lot of pain  but they are not in themselv necessarili under the control of monetari polici   if we give the impress that gasolin price are the fed   s respons  we are look for troubl becaus we cannot control gasolin price   that said  of cours we need to address the overal inflat rate   we need to address inflat expect   all of that is veri import   but  again  we need to make a distinct between relat price chang and overal inflat  now  a more sophist respons to that is     well  mayb monetari polici is contribut to these relat price chang as well     and i think that is a veri serious issu  certain the dollar has some effect on oil price   but keep in mind that a lot of the depreci of the dollar is a declin in real exchang rate  which is essenti in ani case for balanc our extern account   so  yes  the depreci of the dollar  through our polici  has contribut somewhat to commod price   but compar with the overal shift in relat price that we have seen  i think it is not that larg   there are other hypothes suggest that we have been s ul specul in a bubbl  suggest that low real interest rate contribut to april                 of     commod price boom   i don   t want to take more  e  but the evid for those thing is veri limit   in particular  the fact that we have not seen ani buildup in hoard or inventori is a veri strong argument against the idea that inflat expect  hoard  or specul is a major factor in energi price increas   so  yes  the nomin side is veri import   we need to address that   i agre with that   but we should tri to help our audienc understand the veri import distinct between real and nomin chang  i think i will stop there   if i can ask for your patienc  we could do the brief on the altern today and give ourselv more  e tomorrow   around the tabl    that seem okay   i   ll call on bill english
mr  chairman  i was wonder if   or bill want to talk presid   out of his concern about mzm at some point
if you like  i could tri to address that tomorrow
we   ll have a special session on mzm    laughter
i will be refer to the revis version of tabl    which is includ in the packag label    materi for the fomc brief on monetari polici altern      the revis tabl present the same rang of option regard the target feder fund rate as the version discuss in the bluebook  but we have propos some chang to the statement languag for altern b and c   new languag introduc in the draft distribut on monday is shown in blue  with languag reintroduc from the march    statement shown in black and underlin  an addit adjust made sinc monday is shown in purpl    laughter   we have about use up the color palett in word   i will discuss these chang as i go along   your polici decis at this meet would seem to depend on three judgment  where do you think you are  where do you want to be  and what path do you want to follow to get there   the staff   s assess of where you are   at least in term of the stanc of monetari polici   is summar in the r  chart that was includ in the bluebook   that chart show that the current real feder fund rate is about    basi point abov the  book consist measur of r   suggest that the rapid eas of polici this year has left the real fund rate fair close to the level requir to bring the economi back to it potenti over the medium term   the low level of the    the materi use by mr  english are append to this transcript  appendix     april                 of     equilibrium fund rate reflect the staff   s judgment that the hous correct and financi market stress   with their associ effect on consum and busi confid   have been suffici to shift the economi into a recess regim in which spend by both household and busi is like to be weak   as for where you want to be  the  book project assum that the real fund rate is move down to it equilibrium level   that is  the feder fund rate is trim    basi point further   and then remain unchang over the rest of the project period  final  as for the path you want to follow to get there  the staff project assum that you move the feder fund rate to the staff   s es  of the rate   s equilibrium level relat quick by trim the fed fund target    basi point at this meet and anoth    basi point at the june meet   howev  there is no overshoot below the equilibrium level in order to provid insur against a further unexpect slide in spend   if you agre with the staff that about    basi point of addit eas is need to bring the real feder fund rate into align with it equilibrium level and you are at least moder confid of that assess  then you might be inclin to eas polici by    basi point at this meet and issu a statement suggest fair balanc risk to the outlook  as in altern a   a relat larg adjust to polici at this meet would be particular attract if the committe want a somewhat fa  recoveri in output or was concern about downsid risk to growth and wish to move the fund rate back to it equilibrium valu quick in order to help head them off   member might also select a larger rate cut if they were will to live with somewhat higher inflat over  e  as in the op  control simul in the bluebook with an inflat goal of   percent   the rational languag propos for altern a stick fair close to the languag use in march  make modest adjust that are intend to avoid leav the impress that the weak in econom activ or the concern about inflat had worsen appreci over the intermeet period   the assess of risk languag would continu to indic that the easier stanc of polici should    fo  moder growth over  e and       mitig the risk to econom activ     but it would move toward balanc by drop the explicit refer to downsid risk   as in march  it would end by promis  e action to    promot sustain econom growth and price stabil      investor would be surpris by the adopt of altern a   market particip general expect a    basi point rate cut at this meet and put veri low odd on a    basi point cut   howev  the effect of the relat larg eas would be damp somewhat by the shift to a more balanc risk assess   the result would like be lower short  and intermedi term interest rate  a rise in equiti price  and a soften of the dollar   if the committe view the target feder fund rate as probabl close to the level that would appropri balanc the risk to it dual object but saw consider uncertainti regard that level  then it might be inclin to reduc the april                 of     fund rate anoth    basi point at this meet and suggest a more gradual pace of polici eas  or even a paus  after this meet  as in altern b   polici has been eas veri rapid  and it is difficult at this point to assess the extent to which that eas has been transmit to household and firm and so to spend   that assess is complic by the ongo turbul in financi market as well as the usual difficulti in extract signal from noisi data on econom activ  against this backdrop  the committe may be inclin to take a relat small polici step at this meet and then move to a more increment polici approach under which polici will be guid by incom inform on econom and financi develop   moreov  with some measur of long term inflat expect have move higher in recent month  member may be concern that a larger polici move at this meet would encourag the view that the committe is more will to toler inflat than had been thought   by take a smaller polici step at this meet and suggest reduc odd of addit near term polici action  the committe could limit the extent to which investor extrapol the recent larg polici move and so build into asset price more eas than is warrant   such a brake on expect may be seen as particular use sinc the incom data on employ and econom activ are like to be pretti soft in the near term  and the data releas could well spur expect of further rate cut even though the committe anticip the weak when set polici   communic on this point will presum be enhanc by the releas of the    summari of econom project    in three week  which should clarifi the committe   s view on the appropri path for polici and the expect trajectori for econom growth over come quarter   in the bluebook  the rational portion of the statement associ with altern b was ident to that under altern a   howev  in the revis version of tabl    the first sentenc on inflat has been chang to acknowledg the recent improv in read on core inflat but point to the continu run up in energi and other commod price   rather than simpli note the committe   s judgment that a further eas move is appropri  as in altern a  the assess of risk paragraph begin by state that     t he substanti eas of monetari polici to date  combin with ongo measur to fo  market liquid  should help to promot moder growth over  e and to mitig risk to econom activ      the explicit   e depend paus that was suggest in the bluebook formul for this altern has been replac by word that is intend to suggest that polici will be more data depend  with the final sentenc now read     the committe will continu to monitor econom and financi develop and will act as need to promot sustain econom growth and price stabil      the addit of the phrase on monitor develop coupl with the delet of the indic in the march statement that the committe will act    in a  e manner    will like be read by investor as suggest a slow in the pace of eas and possibl a paus after this meet if the economi develop as the committe anticip   investor appear to expect that the committe will trim the feder fund rate    basi point at this meet and then leav the feder fund target at   percent for april                 of     some  e   the    basi point polici eas and the associ statement under altern b would seem to be about in line with these expect  impli littl respons in financi market   if the committe think that the substanti eas of polici alreadi put in place  along with the come fiscal s ulus  is like to fo  outcom that appropri balanc it inflat and growth object  then it may want to stay it hand at this meet and issu a statement suggest that polici is like to chang gradual go forward and could even be on hold for a  e  as in altern c   the committe may expect the ongo weak in spend to be relat mild and brief   the real feder fund rate is alreadi veri low  and the incom data may not be seen as suffici weak to confirm the staff   s view that the economi has shift to a recessionari foot and therefor that spend is like to come in weaker than one would otherwis expect   with financi market most recent improv  on balanc  and investor appar less concern about tail event  the committe may see smaller downsid risk to the outlook for growth   at the same  e  member may think that the inflat outlook remain worrisom   price of oil and some other commod touch new high over the intermeet period  and member may anticip that firm will be abl to pass a larger share of the increas in these cost through to their custom than the staff anticip   longer term inflat expect may have increas in recent month  and the committe might be concern that fail to push back  at least modest  against that rise could allow for a more signific increas in expect that could be veri cost to revers  moreov  some member may worri that addit polici eas could trigger declin in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar and increas in commod price that would give a further boost to inflationari pressur   taken togeth  these argument might suggest that  if a further eas step were taken at this meet  it might have to be revers fair soon   an outcom that some member may wish to avoid   the discuss of econom activ in the statement under altern c is ident to that under the other two altern   the inflat paragraph is similar to that under altern a  but it   not list the reason for the anticip moder in inflat   the exclus of this list is intend to suggest less confid in the judgment that inflat will moder as expect   some member may also be uncomfort repeat the refer to    a project level out of energi and other commod price    when those price have surpris to the upsid yet again  the assess of risk portion of the statement start by point to downsid risk  but then proceed as in altern b   the refer to downsid risk might counter to some degre the suggest of a possibl paus in the eas process  but the lack of polici action combin with this statement languag would presum limit expect for eas at come meet   market particip put onli about one quarter odd on unchang polici at this meet  and so the combin of unchang polici and a statement suggest that the committe could remain on hold for a  e would surpris investor  even with april                 of     the retent of downsid risk to growth   short  and intermedi term rate would rise  stock price would like fall  and the dollar could ralli   effect on longer term rate  and also on inflat compens  would depend on whether investor interpret the statement as indic that the committe desir a lower level of inflat than had been thought   the unexpect firm polici decis could boost pressur in short term fund market  either immedi  as a result of higher fund cost for leverag firm and a weaker outlook for the real economi  or over  e  in the event that econom data came in weaker than anticip and the fomc was seen as less like to eas polici in respons   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   are there question for bill
mr  chairman
you emphas the phrase    reflect a project level out of energi and other commod price and an eas of pressur on resourc util      can you just refresh my memori   for how long have we been use that phrase   just in the march statement  or have we use it befor
i   m afraid i   m not sure
we must have use that just in march   it was not here in januari
definit march   januari was minimalist
so not in januari   it was just in march that we use that   second  let   s say we were to have a ralli in the dollar   if we vote for no chang  might that posit affect equiti price or the credit market in the unit state   is it possibl
i suppos it   s possibl  but i guess i would expect that  if monetari polici came out tighter than peopl had expect  it would lead to at least a modest mark down of the outlook for the economi
for how long   this is a person view  but it   s not clear to me that thing are that clear cut on a sustain basi   one of the thing that seem to be undercut april                 of     confid is the weak in the dollar  even though in the past few day the dollar has ralli  i   m just wonder if it   s clear cut that we would necessarili have a sustain selloff   i can see an immedi reaction  particular on the announc   but it   s conceiv  is it not  that if we had a dollar ralli that we could have a posit effect on equiti price or on the credit market
i think it   s hard to know how peopl would read the news   but as was emphas earlier  a weaker dollar support export and support the outlook for the real economi
i think you could get your result if peopl took the action as that the feder reserv   s view was that the economi wasn   t as great a risk   so risk premium would come down  the dollar would ralli  and the stock market would do better   i mean  it   s possibl
this specul is peril
yes   i just want to ask a question
but i think it goe exact to what both bill just said  in that it depend fundament on whether the disappoint is reassur or troubl   we have had two exampl of disappoint that have been troubl  and we have had one exampl of disappoint be reassur   the most recent one be the latter   so i think what matter most is what happen to the expect path of the fed fund rate go forward  and that is how you would know   if you disappoint signific and the market lower the expect path go forward  as they did in octob and decemb  you could have the dollar weaken as a result just as easili as strengthen   we are not veri good at specul about the effect on the fed fund rate expect of our statement  and it is much harder to specul about the effect on april                 of     the dollar in this context   you can tell a compel stori on both side   it sort of depend how plausibl it is  particular if you have languag say that downsid risk to growth remain even without move  that we are signal greater confid in the strength of the economi go forward with an action that impli not move
it is also be signific driven by the subsequ data
well  this just illustr the point   it   s not as clear cut as one might guess   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a coupl of question  unfortun   i am veri sympathet to your point about how difficult it is to understand what the relationship is between the equilibrium fed fund rate and where we are with respect to financi stress  actual  my question is for the  book team   if you could remind me again  within the  book consist measur  how do you deal with these   you have add factor in your forecast   presum  they   re relat to the financi stress   i know that they are act as if there is a higher interest rate at work   we also have the role of the lend facil  which perhap have reliev a bit of that stress   i am not quit sure how that play out here  so if you could  pleas clarifi that as best you can   again  in chart   there is no role for the inflat prefer  right   this is all about how long it take to get back to potenti over three year with this interest rate   the board staff was veri help over the weekend  when i ask a question about chart   and the fact that the fund rate took off from a higher level   if you add that type of analysi in there  it seem as if it come down a littl to what your inflat prefer is   for the     percent inflat rate  you might want to stick where you are  if it   s april                  of       percent  you would move down a bit   again  that is take it as given that you can interpret these at face valu  if you will  i have anoth question about the fed fund futur market and bill     s chart about how the dealer seem to have slight differ expect and whether or not that teas out anyth about what governor kohn was talk about  becaus that   s a veri interest observ   you know  there is much more weight below the market
yes  it   s hard to know what to read into that   it could be that the forecast have more inertia to them
oh   i thought these were the smart guy who realli were on top of it
but forecast don   t chang that fast  so it is hard to know  but that could be one factor
dave  did you want to respond
yes   first  you are absolut right   the equilibrium fund rate calcul has no refer to inflat   it shouldn   t be view as a polici recommend or where the fed fund rate should be   in essenc  it is one transform of the is curv interact with the suppli side of the economi   set the real fund rate at that level  and it is design to deliv the return of the economi to potenti in    quarter  now  as for the way that we have treat financi stress and it effect on the equilibrium fund rate  we have mark down our es  of the equilibrium fund rate a huge amount sinc last august   a coupl of those big step realli were put in add factor for our sens of the extent to which financi turbul and stress were go to depress aggreg spend go forward   how do we get that   we have taken some of these princip compon measur of financi stress   in some case  princip compon of the senior loan offic opinion april                  of     survey   and regress those on the error in the spend equat  and observ that there is a pretti high correl between those measur and our spend error   we   ve tri  as best we could  to build that correl into our spend forecast  so that when we calcul the equilibrium fund rate  it reflect a much weaker level of spend for ani given fund rate than you otherwis would have observ   the adjust show up as a lower equilibrium fund rate  the second factor that is current depress our es  of the equilibrium fund rate is indirect relat to financi stress   but in the last forecast  when we shift to this recess like scenario  we incorpor addit negat add factor on spend to reflect the observ that  when we are in a cyclic downturn  there tend to be correl error across these equat that are relat to the cyclic event   that was a second factor that was lead to the veri low es  of the fund rate   so those are  as best as we could  incorpor in those measur   thank you
governor   first  and then presid bullard
is your on this point
it   s relat to this
then whi don   t you take my slot  and i   ll come in after
is it a regim switch kind of model in which you enter the recess state   you call it the recess state   and then add factor down further
yes  though that may be put it too scientif   in essenc  we were look at a configur of data that  at the  e of the march meet  appear to indic recess   even though we did not have the spend data in hand   and  as governor kohn indic  we still haven   t seen these correl negat error on spend yet   we had april                  of     seen enough other signal in term of the busi and consum sen ent survey  the rise in the initi claim for unemploy insur  and the jump in the unemploy rate that  taken togeth  suggest to us that there was a likelihood that we were or would be in a recess scenario   we then ad in more negat add factor to account for that
then  is that calibr against the           recess or the      recess
basic  we did an averag of the residu in recess sinc
oh  is           in there
yes            is in there   again  the composit of where these residu are is obvious heavili tilt in this case to hous  some of which is alreadi behind us   so it isn   t quit as though all of this weak is prospect   some of this weak we have alreadi had  and so there are veri big negat residu now on hous relat to where you would otherwis have been
just to ask bill a question   first the tall bill  but the shorter bill can answer afterward    laughter   on altern b  you indic that this would be veri much in line with market expect and  therefor  shouldn   t have much impact   i was wonder about the statement aspect  in particular the assess of risk part  becaus this is not just say that we are do    basi point  it is also say that we are now in a differ mode of oper regard the cycl   so where do you think the market are concern where the statement would be in this regard
in recent day the stori we have been hear from market particip and observ are that they think there may well be someth   mayb not signal strong that we   re done but talk about slow down or possibl a paus   so i think this realli is pretti close to what is built in
yes  a soft paus rather than a hard paus is the way i would think about what the market is look for
okay   good   thank you
other question for bill   all right   well  we have overnight to reflect   we will also have the gdp data in the morn   i   m sure that they will be inform   we will reconven tomorrow at      a m   there is a dinner and recept  for those of you who would like to attend  and we   ll see you there   meet recess  april                  of     april            morn session
good morn  everybodi   whi don   t we start with the report from dave   on the data
we left at your place  and i hope you have found  a gdp advanc releas for the first quarter   it came in at plus     percent versus our  book forecast of      it was realli veri close to our expect  both for the total and for the individu compon  there were a few small differ   nonresidenti structur  as you can see about halfway down that sheet  are es  to have been weaker than we were forecast   i think that addit weak certain reinforc the stori i was tell ye day about this be an area in which we are now see more convinc sign of soft   residenti invest was not quit as weak as we thought  but i don   t think the differ between a minus    and a minus    chang the basic tenor of that particular stori   two small area for which we had some upsid surpris were feder spend and inventori invest  but those surpris were realli quit small   i don   t see anyth in this report  quit frank  on the real gdp side that would caus us to chang our basic outlook   obvious  when we get the detail  we might make some minor adjust to the second quarter forecast   as for price  the final two line of that tabl  total pce came in right as we had expect   core pce was es  by the bea to be a tenth higher than we had project  but that is still    percentag point below what we were project back in the march  book   so  again  i don   t think that the report that i gave ye day would be alter by this releas  we also receiv the employ cost index   in the releas  we get those figur onli to one decim place   to one decim place  we are right on for total compens   wage and salari and benefit  in term of the    month chang  it was     percent  and that was what we    the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     april                  of     were forecast   wage were a bit higher than we thought       versus the     we project   but benefit came in a littl lower than we were project   there again  i think the data just basic confirm the stori that we are not realli yet see ani sign of pressur on the labor cost side
ani question for dave   all right   if not  ye day we had an introductori present by bill english on the altern   you will be pleas to know that there have been no further chang in the propos statement   so whi don   t we take comment now from the particip   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   what i would like to do   it will probabl come as no surpris   is to make the case for whi we should stand pat today and make no chang   my case is built on a number of point  and i   d like to articul those as best i can  first  as we all know  the econom outlook has weaken sinc the start of the year  but that deterior occur larg between januari and march   sinc the march meet  there has been littl chang in the  book forecast or in my own outlook for the economi  incom data over the intermeet period are consist with a weak first half but not appreci weaker than we earlier anticip   i believ that eas polici is appropri in a weaker economi  but continu to cut rate for as long as the economi remain weak is not appropri   although it is a difficult task  we must tri to calibr the appropri level of the fed fund rate with the econom prospect and our polici goal   i will just note that  sinc last septemb  we have lower the fund rate     basi point   this year alon  in a period of less than    day  we have cut     basi point   this is a veri aggress polici of eas   not enough  e has pass  in my view  to see the full effect on the economi of those cut  and a april                  of     further    basi point cut in the fund rate at this point will do noth to chang the near term outlook of the economi  second  we are current run a veri accommod monetari polici  no matter how you look at it   the real fund rate is negat or veri negat  depend on which measur of inflat you use to construct it   the nomin fund rate is below the level of most version of the taylor rule  even when adjust for some interest rate and real rate effect  given our object   as i note ye day  monetari aggreg as measur by m  and  to some extent  mzm have expand veri rapid  especi sinc our rate cut in late januari   now  although none of these measur of monetari accommod or monetari eas is perfect   each has it drawback   i am concern that all the measur of monetari accommod suggest that we are veri accommod at the current  e  third  inflat is high  unaccept high in my view  and has been that way for a sustain period  as i talk about ye day   some would argu that the weaken economi will bring the inflat rate down   but theori and experi both say that such will occur onli if expect of inflat remain anchor   but sinc the end of last year  most measur of expect inflat have move up   the instabl in the measur of expect inflat is a caus for concern   it suggest to me that market may be less convinc of our willing to take the necessari action that are consist with sustain a credibl commit to price stabil   i certain understand the differ between a relat price shock and inflat  clear  oil price and other commod price are in part a relat price shock   there is no question about that   but it is also true that in the     s one of our mistak was that we accommod relat price shock with veri accommod monetari polici  and in so do help convert a relat price shock into sustain inflat   i think we should be care not to april                  of     fall into the same trap   besid  i think that in most monetari model today we worri particular about stabil core inflat becaus it repres the sticki price in our sticki price model   so if relat price shock begin to seep into the core  or into the sticki price element  monetari theori would suggest that we need to respond to those   if we are go to achiev someth close to op  monetari polici  we should be concern about that seepag becaus it may affect expect and it is part of what monetari polici should be do  at least in that class of model  although it is true that we have not seen much in the way of wage inflat to date and that is encourag  i would also reiter  as some peopl note ye day  that wage inflat tend to be a lag  not a lead  indic of overal inflat   contrari to the  book forecast  which has us maintain a negat real fund rate for two year and inflat come down  i think that  if we continu eas or maintain the real fund rate well below zero for a period of  e despit inflat well abov our goal  it is reason to assum that expect will not remain anchor   the fomc   s state goal of price stabil cannot remain credibl independ of our action   if we want expect to remain well anchor  we have to act in a way that is consist with that  fourth  i believ that we are in the fortun posit today of be abl to paus  market particip have react to the incom data by appreci tighten their expect of futur fund rate move   at least as measur by the futur market  as we have seen   particip seem to be get less comfort with the idea of veri easi monetari polici over a sustain period  given the outlook for inflat   i note that the market    reassess of their polici expect over the intermeet period  sn   t appear to have had ani signific negat effect on the market  or the economi more broad  dure this period   i think this april                  of     reassess by the market present us with an opportun to reinforc our state commit to price stabil  not just with word but with action or  in this case  inact   i think a paus today would send a strong signal of our commit to price stabil  which could further help anchor inflat expect  which i consid to be veri fragil   a paus  it seem to me  balanc the risk of the two part of our mandat   some might argu that  in the midst of the financi market disrupt that we have seen this year  it is import for the fed not to add to market turmoil by take polici action not anticip by the market   the mean expect for the market is for    basi point of eas today   but market particip are place odd of somewher between    percent and    percent on our paus  so i don   t think a paus would be veri disrupt to the market   the magnitud of the surpris would be about the same as the surpris we had last  e when we cut    basi point   that surpris  in my view  did not realli caus much turmoil in the marketplac  final  when i say that cut    basi point won   t help the outlook for the economi veri much  other might respond that cut    basi point won   t hurt it veri much either  so whi not   i disagre   i think a cut today will not be a disast but will contribut to a further erod of our credibl in the eye of the public   at past meet this committe has spoken a lot about the need for rapid revers of our rate cut that we took out for insur   i think we should not be over confid of our abil to implement such rapid revers   in fact  the lower the rate go  the further we will need to come back when we start take the accommod back   i am dubious of our abil becaus we will be so much further from what might be a more neutral rate  in summari  to my mind the gain in credibl from paus today substanti outweigh ani negat effect from slight disappoint the market   it  sn   t preclud us april                  of     from choos to resum cut at a later date should econom condit warrant them   after all  i think this committe has demonstr it abil to act aggress in respons to econom condit  and we can do so again   but that is the futur   for today  i think we should take the opportun that the economi and the market have afford us to paus   as the old latin express say     carp diem     with regard to languag  i am happi with altern c   rather than the languag in paragraph   of altern c  i would prefer the languag of paragraph   of altern b   i would just make that the languag for paragraph   in altern c   that is the onli chang that i think would be necessari   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  favor maintain the feder fund rate at    percent today   the current real interest rate provid accommod monetari condit for an economi that is struggl near recess or is in mild recess   our lend facil are probabl do as much as can be expect to mitig the serious and necessari financi adjust that must be accomplish by the privat market   if the economi take anoth serious leg down  our current fund rate set is well posit for us to respond prompt  appropri  and aggress  if circumst warrant   a paus today afford us a uniqu opportun to wait and see how our recent aggress action are influenc the trajectori of real activ   sinc market are put substanti weight on a    basi point eas today  a paus will be a relat small disappoint   as presid   point out  that was similar to our march disappoint  which seem to be all right   i think it is import for us to understand how the economi will respond to a paus in rate cut when it   occur   with high food  energi  and commod price  the extend posit differenti of headlin inflat april                  of     over core measur risk an increas in the public   s inflat expect   i agre with presid     s discuss of relat price on that front  from a longer term perspect  which we don   t realli talk about veri often  i worri about the asymmetr respons of polici to high inflat as oppos to when it is low   when headlin inflat is abov core inflat  we take on board the relat price adjust  and then we are content  i would guess  to bring inflat down to our perceiv inflat target  but on the downsid  when inflat get low  we becom uncomfort with certain low inflat set  and so i fear that we would respond more aggress  as we did in       which realli was a posit product environ   if you have an asymmetr type of respons  you are go to take on board increas in the price level becaus of that asymmetri  that   s one reason that i am concern about these type of behavior   although i expect emerg resourc slack to temper ani advers inflat develop  the risk is simpli grow in import with everi addit polici eas  compar with the econom risk  which presum are abat as we respond to them with such eas  calibr the current polici stanc against these diverg econom and inflat risk is import and challeng  as you point out ye day  mr  chairman   i think that comparison to the rate trough in the previous cycl of recess polici are instruct   the current real fed fund rate is somewher in the neighborhood of zero  or it could be lower if you choos a differ way to deflat the fund rate by total inflat   i was veri impress with dave     s respons to my question about what type of factor from financi market stress are embodi in the  book consist real interest rate   it seem as though a tremend amount of care has been taken to introduc some of these special factor in innov way  and while they may not captur all facet of that  i thought that they did quit a april                  of     good job   so i feel a bit more comfort in make those comparison  but i do recogn that it is a treacher period  that said  this is about the same place the real fund rate bottom out dure the jobless recoveri with financi headwind in the           recess  and with the data we had in hand at the  e dure the disinfl concern in        both period were uniqu in suggest a high degre of accommod  and the factor that were at work in each of those episod were uniqu   our attempt to incorpor these factor has been quit use  and so it   s a reason  if not definit  comparison   with our current lend facil address financi stress  i think our current polici accommod  now at    percent  is appropri similar to those episod  my final observ has to do with these end of cycl expect and what they might mean for long term interest rate   if    basi point is view as addit insur against downsid risk  i just don   t think this action is signific enough to have much of an effect   we expect to take back some portion of the aggress cut  especi the one that have been an attempt to respond to the financi stress   if the financi stress is mitig to some extent  we should be expect to take that back   expect  as in the fed fund futur market  should limit the effect of those action on long term interest rate   after all  by the expect hypothesi  you are go to be averag these short term path into long term rate   that is one reason that the committe inject the languag    consider period    back in       to tri to convinc peopl that we would do this for a longer period of  e and affect long term rate  so if there is an expect of some type of rebound  these last insur cut might not have that larg an effect   again  i think our lend facil are better gear for the financi stress  i think we have clear demonstr our willing to provid appropri accommod polici in a  e fashion when the econom situat demand it   for me  april                  of     the public   s expect of these action in that event argu against one further small insur move   becaus we are concern about inflat risk and have indic that we must flexibl move toward more neutral polici stanc onc the economi and financi market improv  a paus today is a small down payment on those difficult futur action   in term of languag  if it came to that  i would be comfort with the languag of altern b with this particular rate action   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i must say that i am sympathet to the    hold    advoc and the view that we are alreadi accommod   i think an apt anecdot is a convers i had in the past six week with a cruis line ceo who  sn   t know how to drive his ship but who has in fact been at the helm a coupl of  e   he said     when you turn the wheel and noth happen for sever mile  the temptat to keep turn the wheel is overwhelm       laughter   so i do have some sympathi   that said  i am go to support a reduct in the target rate of   percent  effect altern b  as i indic ye day   i think it is pretti clear that we have a tradeoff between    a littl more help to the economi    and    enough for now    and realli some shift in our focus to combat inflat  so let me lay out my rational for not hold   i think there is still substanti downsid risk to the general economi  and it may take quit some  e for recoveri to materi   a quarter would help slight to effect a lower cost of borrow and  therefor  would s ul activ  although much of that is realli beyond our control   it will be dictat by market forc  i think that halt today versus conceiv halt at the next meet risk some interpret as a lack of recognit of the real state of weak in the economi  april                  of     regard inflat  i think the core number in the first quarter were not over discourag  and i have to believ my own forecast   in mani respect  the forecast i heard   that inflat will soften in the come month and be consist with our work view of expect   i would say  howev  that i am concern that  in the mind of the general public  high price actual translat into inflat  whether or not the rate of inflat has flatten  as i have suggest  i am inclin to paus after this move  provid that the incom data are not too advers and too diverg from expect  but with the caveat that i think a lot of shock risk is still out there and we have to remain flexibl to deal with surpris   hold or signal a paus may help the hous market a bit by start to construct a bottom  as borrow or buyer begin to perceiv that they shouldn   t expect ani further rate cut from us  regard the statement  i think the rational section in altern b is appropri to the situat that we face   section   is a realist acknowledg of inflat trend and risk   i gather that  with the chang in section    the question was whether or not to signal a paus or an inclin to paus  and i tend to agre with a more cautious  less committ approach of the propos languag   what ye day was call a    soft    paus   so i am  on balanc  quit happi with the languag in altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i have given serious consider to both altern b and c  and i think a credibl case can be made for either one   there are  of cours  risk associ with adopt either one as well   on balanc  i come out in favor of altern b  for the follow reason   first  we are certain not yet out of the econom wood   although my forecast is for a relat mild recess  i would not be particular surpris if it turn out to be both deeper and more prolong  given  among other thing  the april                  of     persist overhang of unoccupi  unsold home and the sever of the financi disloc of the past nine month   as i have tri to emphas  i think it could be danger to underes  the effect of the financi headwind now in train and like  in my judgment  to get more sever   second  and close relat to those observ  financi condit remain quit sensit   even if improv is now under way in some market  i think it will be some  e  as i said ye day  befor credit condit are fulli support of econom growth   to amplifi a bit  i think we need to be a bit care about the weight we put on the low level of the real feder fund rate per se for  as governor kohn point out ye day  the credit situat is a good deal more complic than that  my princip reserv about support altern b has to do with the inflat outlook   the news here has not been uniform bad  especi with regard to core inflat  but i am not convinc that inflat will abat in a  e way without polici action   on the other hand  i take some comfort from the fact that appar financi market particip do not anticip further reduct in the feder fund rate target beyond this meet   i think the languag associ with altern b should help to reinforc the view that  at a minimum  a paus in the reduct in the target is not that far off  given what we know today   i think it import that we find opportun to bol  that view when we can   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   there seem to be a groundswel of opinion in financi market  and perhap around this tabl  that given the eas to date we are at or close to a point where we should paus and assess the impact of both fiscal and monetari s ulus alreadi provid   should we paus at a fed fund rate below   percent  at   percent  or over   percent   the  book forecast assum that we paus at    percent   with this degre april                  of     of s ulus  core and total pce inflat is at or below   percent in       but the unemploy rate remain well abov the nairu  even at the end of        the boston forecast generat similar outcom   the  book and the boston forecast suggest that    basi point at this meet may not be enough   both forecast impli that a signific degre of slack remain in the economi  even with a    basi point reduct at both this and the follow meet   in addit  there are signific downsid risk to the outlook   fall asset price in other countri have frequent been accompani by prolong period of weak   final  given the rise we have seen in the libor rate  for mani borrow a    basi point decreas leav polici no more accommod than at our last meet  the consensus seem to be that we should be move in smaller increment   but if we choos option b  it is not at all clear to me that we should paus after this meet   in that regard  i was happi to see the revis languag in the bluebook tabl    which   not impli that our eas cycl has definit end   while i hope that the economi recov suffici that further eas is not necessari  we need to remain flexibl  particular given that our model indic that even with further eas we are like to experi sever year of elev unemploy rate   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think i can be brief by just associ myself with the comment of presid  n   this is a difficult decis   you could make a case for either of these   but on balanc  i think we should be lower interest rate    basi point  as under altern b   as presid  n said  i don   t think just subtract past inflat from the nomin feder fund rate is a good metric for where the stanc of polici is today   it would be if financi condit were consist with histor relationship  but they   re not   we have veri april                  of     tight credit condit in mani sector of the market  and a zero or negat feder fund rate mean a veri differ thing today than it did even in the earli     s  gari  becaus then you had the bank system broken but the secur market work   now you have the bank system broken and the secur market not work veri well   so i think we have stronger   i guess  span call them       mile an hour      headwind   i would say they are    or    today  at least for now  we expect the headwind to abat  and as they abat  polici will look a lot more accommod   but i don   t think we realli have insur right now against the conting that the headwind don   t abat veri quick or even get wors  or against the conting that the staff is right and we are enter a recessionari period in which consumpt and invest fall short of what the fundament would suggest   i think that    basi point probabl won   t buy us much  if ani  insur  but it will get polici calibr a littl better to the situat that we are face today   i expect a small decreas in the fund rate to be consist with further increas in the unemploy rate   and everybodi    i think  judg from the central tendenc of the forecast   which will put downward pressur and help to contain inflat   i agre that there is an upsid risk from continu increas in commod price that feed through  as presid   note  into core inflat  i think that this is a veri differ situat from the     s   i look this morn at the econom report of the presid  at those tabl in the back   the stage for the     s was set in the     s   core inflat rose from     percent in the mid     s to    percent in        that   s a situat  obvious  in which inflat expect can becom unanchor  and then these relat price shock feed through much more into inflat expect   look in the  book  part    page ii     everi measur of core inflat for      was lower than the april                  of     measur of core inflat for       and half of them   these are q  to q  measur of core inflat   are lower than for        so we are not in a situat of a gradual upcreep in core inflat  which i think was what set the stage for the     s  i don   t expect a small decreas in interest rate to result in higher inflat through this dollar   commod price   inflat expect channel either   the decreas in interest rate is alreadi in the market   if anyth  a statement like altern b might firm rate a bit  and take out    downsid risk    and    act in a  e manner    reinforc the notion that the feder reserv is not pois to eas ani more   i wouldn   t expect interest rate to go down  therefor  i wouldn   t expect the dollar to go down  and i wouldn   t expect commod price to go up from this  i think the market react veri well over the intermeet period to incom data  they saw the tail risk decreas   they rais interest rate   the dollar firm   they put a u shape in our interest rate path   it seem to me that path is veri close to what mani of us said we expect and thought was appropri  give or take   point  for the feder fund rate over the come coupl of year   i don   t see ani reason to act in a way that chang those expect  i think the market expect are fine   i wouldn   t lower interest rate   point just to confirm market expect   i think it is the right thing to do  and i don   t see ani reason to lean against it to chang expect   i think that expect are line up pretti well with our object  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i was listen veri care to governor kohn  as i do the rest of my colleagu   i note your comment that it  sn   t buy us much   i   m worri that it may cost us much   had i gone first  i would have made argument similar to those of april                  of     presid   and presid     i am in favor of a paus   i think that is pretti clear   i want to stress a coupl of thing i mention ye day becaus i think they   re import   i am concern about our cost regard what i call a differ kind of advers feedback loop  which is the inflat dynam wherebi reduct in the fed fund rate lead to a weaker dollar and upward pressur on global commod price  which feed through to higher u s  inflat and to cutback in consumpt by consum and action by employ to offset the effect of inflat   i quot a ceo  whom i consid to be veri high regard  regard his compani   s behavior pattern   this is someon  by the way  who was in the busi in the     s   he said     we   re learn to run a busi  onc again  in an inflationari environ      that quot bother me becaus it show a behavior respons   this goe beyond the issu  but i thought that comment you made ye day about relat price  mr  chairman  was veri interest   but it show a behavior respons  and behavior eventu becom habit  and habit becom trend  and i   m worri about that  there was a period when i felt that we were at risk of a repetit of the     s   i think the liquid measur that we have taken   which i have fulli support  and i applaud you  mr  chairman  and the new york group for think these through with the staff   have provid the bridg that we spoke of ye day   don  you mention the     s   i am no longer worri about the     s  although i think there are tripwir out there that are veri  veri serious   you point to them in your intervent   you are right  under bill martin these pressur were put in place  but somebodi mention ye day   it may have been vice chairman     that he wasn   t around in the     s   i actual sat by presid carter   s side when he got lectur from a left wing socialist name helmut schmidt and by a right winger name margaret thatcher   their point were that you cannot risk appear to be complac about inflat   i worri that we risk april                  of     appear to be complac about inflat   i am speak within the famili here  but i sens that we are give that appear on the outsid   the question realli is  is it worth   point  what is the risk   return tradeoff here   i don   t think it   s worth cut   point   i think it is worth stay where we are  i know that the market anticip x or y   we had a convers about that ye day   i made my live in the market   the market come and go  and i am happi to hear governor kohn say that we are not influenc by the market   i don   t think we should be   their reaction are momentari   but i just don   t feel the risk   return tradeoff make it worthwhil for a   point cut here unless we saw evid of substanti downsid slippag beyond what we are all discount for hous  which is veri negat   i have spoken about a price correct of    percent from peak to trough  and we   re not there yet   it would have to be more negat than that to convinc me to cut rate further   so  mr  chairman  i respect submit that we should paus  and that   s how i plan to vote   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b with the word that has been propos   but i do appreci that there is a case for altern c as well  and i understand and appreci the argument that have been made in favor of it   on the pure econom merit  i definit support a    basi point cut   as i note in my comment on the econom situat  it appear that the economi has stall and may have fallen into a recess  i share the same concern as governor kohn and presid  n   my forecast is close to the  book   i think a further eas in financi condit is need to counter the credit crunch  and i believ that a cut in the feder fund rate will be efficaci in eas financi condit  april                  of     although the real feder fund rate is accommod by ani usual measur of it  i complet agre with governor kohn   s discuss of this topic   this is a situat in which spread have increas so much and credit avail has diminish so much that look at the real feder fund rate is just a veri mislead way of assess the overal tight of financi condit   i consid them  on balanc  to be notabl tighter than they were in the begin of august   i don   t agre that further cut in the feder fund rate will be ineffect in help us achiev our employ goal or counterproduct to the attain of price stabil over the medium term   given that a    basi point cut is what the market are now anticip   it is built in   i would not expect this action  coupl with the languag in altern b  to touch off further declin in the dollar or to exacerb inflationari expect  that said  i did see argument in favor of altern c as well   i can see some advantag in do a littl less today than market are expect as long as we reaffirm that we do retain the flexibl to respond quick to further negat news with addit cut   a case that could be made for paus is that we will soon get inform relat to gdp in the second quarter and get a better read on just how serious the downturn is   with respect to market and inflationari psycholog  i also can see a case for do less than market expect   it is true that some measur of inflat expect have edg up a bit  and i would agre with presid   that perhap a paus would counter ani impress that we have becom more toler of inflat in the long run   but i don   t think we have becom more toler of inflat in the long run  and i did see today   s read on the employ cost index as further confirm that at this point noth is built into labor market that suggest that we are develop a wage   price spiral of the type that was of such concern and realli propel the problem in the     s   on the other hand  i agre with presid    too   wage aren   t a lead indic   we have to april                  of     watch inflationari expect   so i don   t think that is definit   nevertheless  i do find it quit reassur that noth is go on there at this point  i think do noth today might mitig the risk of a flight from dollar asset  which could exacerb financi turmoil   so there are argument in favor of altern c  and i recogn them   but  on balanc  i believ that the stronger case is for b
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   the fomc is bad in need of a stop rule on the feder fund rate   continu reaction to bad econom news   and there is like to be bad news in the come month   is go to set up serious futur problem for this committe  the fragil credibl of the committe is be erod as we speak  and we will do well to take step to reassert inflat fight resolv at this meet  the intuit in deal with the current crisi is that we can use new lend facil to help return financi market to more normal oper and that interest rate polici is not that like to help on this dimens   but except low rate can creat new problem   sinc lower rate are not realli help direct with the smooth oper of financi market  i suggest that we put that on hold for the  e be and let our past  stun aggress  interest rate move have an effect through the summer and into the second half of the year   this would be consist with altern c in the polici altern  mani particip have emphas that there will be a long unwind process   the chairman describ us as be in the third inning on this  similar to the late     s and earli     s  dure that episod  the fed went on hold at   percent  consid an except low rate at the  e   that gave financi market a chanc to heal follow the s l problem without creat other problem for the mid to late     s   in retrospect  this polici work quit well dure that april                  of     era  and it seem to me that someth similar could be done today at the current level of the feder fund rate   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i   m glad that reason peopl can differ   i do continu to hold the view that eas polici today is a mistak   if i were vote on it  i would vote to hold where we are   with the fed fund rate at the level it current is  i think that continu to eas polici in an environ of rise inflationari pressur give serious eros to our long run credibl   we are see increas sign that inflat expect are rise   i see it constant  as the public   s inflat psycholog is chang as well   this chang reflect the larg  sustain now  increas in food  energi  and other commod and acceler import price   i am concern that maintain at this high accommod polici level for an extend period  while it may bring some short run s ulus into the economi  increas inflationari risk to an unaccept level  which will  over the not too distant futur  begin to distort long run invest decis and continu to increas the risk of financi instabl and imbal in the longer run  final  on the psycholog of the market  hold rate constant  although it might disappoint some on wall street  will pleas mani  mani on main street   i judg that it will confirm to the world that we are turn our attent to these longer run issu  and i   m disappoint that we   re not seiz the opportun to make that statement   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   my concern about the real economi are similar to those that i had in march   i continu to believ that residenti real estat market could deterior even further than what i have in my baselin project and could exert even greater downward pressur on busi activ   financi market in my view are still fragil  and larger or april                  of     more widespread liquid pressur could quick present us with an even weaker set of econom fundament   at the same  e  i can   t easili dismiss the ongo escal of energi and commod price   although mani of us  as we talk about ye day  have expect these price pressur to abat for some  e  they have not  and as i indic ye day  i do believ there is a risk that core inflat will not follow the downward path that i submit as my project for this meet   so like other  i can see a case be made for altern c   howev  i think a modest reduct to our polici rate today as a precaut against further slippag in the real economi is prudent   but i also strong support the languag that indic we   re veri close to  if not at  a paus point in our eas cycl   so i support the polici recommend and the languag in altern b   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i find myself agre with my colleagu who have advoc altern c   one way to think about our approach to the polici decis today is to look ahead and think about the probabl associ with two bad outcom   will the economi go into a substanti deeper recess than we expect   or come out of this recess  will the trail inflat rate be higher than it was when we went in   although i hope neither of these occur  my sens right now is that the chanc of an increas in trend inflat is more like than a much deeper recess  and i think we should alter our polici path accord  the incom data sinc the begin of the year have result in a more advers outlook  and that chang in the outlook is alreadi  in my view  reflect in the current stanc of polici   i note ye day that the real feder fund rate use the  book   s inflat forecast rather than four quarter lag core inflat is now between minus    and minus   percent   i think it make sens to take advantag of inform about forese gap between overal inflat and core  april                  of     and the stanc of polici strike me as veri s ul  certain plenti for the recess we now expect  when we look at back histor recess   as i note ye day  at the retail level for firm and consum  spread aren   t out of line with where they   ve been in past recess   it is true that jumbo mortgag rate and some other rate have not come down as much as they   ve come down in past recess  but i just remind peopl of the secular technolog shift   there   s a sort of level shift in intermedi technolog that we   re go through right now that realli constitut a chang in the relat price of differ financi asset  now  i can   t think clear about the stanc of polici without talk first about the risk free rate and then think about various spread as realli have to do with the relat price of differ financi claim   so in look at and through retail rate  that   s inform   but the risk free rate is the risk free rate  and an array of factor affect how those relat financi price evolv   the securit channel that seem to work veri well for a while is now expos as more cost and less efficaci than onc was thought   some of these securit vehicl didn   t exist in past recess or expans  and onli a coupl of decad ago these spread were as high as or higher than they are now   so i stick to think about the stanc of monetari polici in term of the real risk free rate  i think our experi between the januari and the march meet with inflat expect is pretti good evid of their fragil in the current environ without our have articul what our long run object is for inflat   i don   t think that the level of inflat expect is align with our object  i think it is too high relat to our object   market particip see a good chanc of our drop the rate   point today and revers field later in this year and rais rate again   i suspect they don   t fulli grasp how difficult it   s go to be to revers cours while we negoti the murki water of the recov economi later this year   inde  i april                  of     think that the fiscal s ulus that we   re go to get will make those water even murkier   it will be even harder to divin the under  ex fiscal polici strength of the economi  so for these reason  i believ that we should leav the fed fund rate alon today   the upward surpris at our last meet did not appear to affect financi market advers   coupl with that statement   s emphasi on inflat risk  it did seem to have the benefici effect of revers the run up in inflat expect   i would expect that leav the fund rate alon today would have a similar benefici effect in stabil inflat expect   so i favor altern c  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support altern b  but i must admit i can   t do it with the convict that i would prefer to have   i think market particip will look at our decis today and at the data over the next few week and tri to measur whether we can hold up to the paus languag that accompani altern b   take action with a    basi point move today  we have to then be prepar to stomach the continu weak in the real economi that is in mani of our project   speak for myself  i   d say we also have to be prepar when we next meet to hold the line even if we see a retrac of some of the improv in financi market  so in my own base case  the judgment when we next meet will be a harder one   the economi might look weak  financi market might look weaker than they are  and tri to signal to the market in altern b that we are serious about hold the line at what would then be   percent is put a pretti hard task on us   i think we   re capabl of hold the line there  but we have to hold ourselv to that standard  the    basi point move  in and of itself   sn   t strike me as that consequenti   what strike me as consequenti is the symbol   given the uncertainti that dave and the team have april                  of     spoken about  it strike me that the    basi point is not near as consequenti in effect as what might well happen to the transmiss mechan and the efficaci of this chang in feder fund rate on the real economi   put differ  if the financi market can get back to busi  they will be help the real economi  in effect lower the cost of capit far more than our action would today  as i said  i think the symbol here   matter   by move    basi point today  we   re take some risk with the dollar   i think that the dollar improv we have seen over the past sever day and week has occur becaus there   s an expect that we are closer to a paus and that this committe is go to have a tougher decis about whether or not to move than they had anticip some week ago   even though the languag in altern b is use in tri to lay the factual predic for a paus when we next meet  there will be a lot of folk who will be wonder about our convict there  and when they do  i think we are assum some dollar risk   we are also assum increment risk on the inflat front   continu eas could well encourag the percept that the fomc has a greater toler for inflat than is prudent  with potenti advers effect on inflat expect  a further run up in commod price  and a continu declin in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  so this is a tough judgment that we   re make  with signific uncertainti   i take comfort in believ that the languag in the minut and the remark that we all offer between now and the next  e we meet will suggest not that this is a cut with a dovish paus but that this is a cut with an expect of hold after our action today   we are not bar all event becaus we can certain imagin the world turn yet again and we can certain imagin anoth let down  particular in the global economi   but this is a statement that we want to hold after our action april                  of     today and that we are prepar to stomach some addit bad news with respect both to the economi and to financi market   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani speaker befor me have said  this is a pretti close call  and reason case can be made for both altern b and altern c   if you look at financi market condit  you can see your favorit indic and say whether thing have eas or not eas   one indic that i look at when think about the transmiss of monetari polici is the libor   oi spread  which has gone up veri signific   a lot of short term borrow is price off of that   if we want just to keep polici where it was six week ago  we would actual have to cut more   not that i   m suggest that we should   but if you use that spread as the relev indic  it would suggest that  if one were to keep the same stanc  or potenti the same stanc  of monetari polici  you   d have to cut a lot   it  sn   t seem as though our liquid facil have been effect on this particular dimens   we had been hope that they would be  but they don   t seem to be   even with some of the thing that we vote on ye day  we   re still go to see veri elev spread in some of these market  still make borrow cost relat high and so disrupt the tradit monetari transmiss mechan   so that   s where i would argu for altern b  anoth argument for altern b is the potenti protract slowdown   i agre veri much with presid  n   as i   ve talk about a lot befor  this sort of slow burn is relat to the hous market   the repair and recoveri of those market is go to take a long  e   the spread are still quit elev in a number of these market   so provid more cushion against the downsid risk there for those market and then think about how that risk affect the potenti for april                  of     broader downsid risk  in which the hous market seem to be a potenti trigger point for negat nonlinear dynam  again suggest that move down    basi point now is prudent  the key  of cours  that peopl have been talk about is inflat pressur go forward   inflat expect   here a case can be made on either side with some cogenc   one challeng we have right now is that we have a lot of differ in the way to read inflat expect   look at the five year ahead versus the five to ten year ahead  we   ve seen them spread apart quit a bit and now start to come back togeth  with the next five year start to move up but the five to ten year ahead move down   we have a number of other measur of expect  some of which have move up quit signific but mayb primarili becaus of some relat price movement rather than under inflat trend  one thing that is comfort for me on the altern b side is that dure the last year to    month  when we have had veri low   below   percent   unemploy rate  we have seen veri littl evid of high wage pressur   i find it unlik that it is go to increas as the unemploy rate goe abov   percent  and i think  as mani peopl around the tabl do  that unemploy may sustain itself abov   percent for quit some  e   we also haven   t seen some of the real shock to energi and commod price feed through to core   now  that still could be come   but we   ve seen veri elev price in these area for quit some  e   six to nine month   and the most recent read from the pce index suggest that they haven   t fed through  mayb that is still to come  and i think to be worri about that is reason   it is also reason to be worri about implic for the dollar if we were to go for altern b rather than altern c  but the languag in altern b can provid some comfort to the market that we are unlik to be push much further  given what we see and what we expect  but that we are open to april                  of     that possibl   we certain have a veri long  e between this meet and the next meet  we   re go to be get two employ report  gdp  and a lot of other inform  so we may need to revisit some of these issu   but at this point i would come down for altern b with the languag that we have   i think it give us the appropri flexibl  and i don   t see suffici evid of an unhing of inflat expect or actual inflationari pressur  at least with respect to core  to say that we need to take a paus now   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i   m in a veri uncomfort posit here becaus i usual like to be veri decis  and i think in all past case i   ve had a strong view befor go into the meet in term of what is the appropri altern that the committe should take  at least that i should take   i   m in a veri uncomfort posit becaus i   m actual sit exact on the fenc between altern b and altern c   as you know  sit on the fenc and have a fenc right in that anatom uncomfort posit is not a good place to be   laughter   so let me go through the current situat and argu whi i   m in this uncomfort posit  the first point to make is that inflat expect are actual reason well contain  it is true that i have a concern that high headlin inflat could make contain inflat expect and preserv the nomin anchor more difficult   but it is import to note that we have been in a situat in which we   ve had veri high headlin inflat and  in fact  core inflat and inflat expect have behav veri well   so it   s veri import to emphas that this is not the     s  and i realli get disturb when peopl point to that as a problem   we do have to worri about inflat expect possibl go up  but it   s not a situat that  if we make a april                  of     mistak  they go up a whole lot   they could go up  and it might be cost to get them down  but it would not be a disast  the second issu is that  although we may have turn the corner  we are still in a situat of veri fragil financi market  and we have been disappoint befor   i am get more op ist   i   m hope and think it   s veri possibl that we   ll look back at the middl of march and say that was the worst of it   but there is a possibl  and it   s not a small possibl  that thing could go south again  and that would argu for the need for aggress cut in the futur  the third thing that i point out about the situat is that the modal forecast given by the  book   and consist with my modal forecast and with the modal forecast of most of the particip   suggest that we may have to cut a bit further in the futur   so the problem is that  given the condit that we face  we need a lot of flexibl to deal with potenti downsid risk   i think the downsid risk have diminish  but they could go back up again   so there could be a situat in which we need to eas aggress in the futur   of cours  we   ve convinc the market that we are non gradualist  but so far we   ve been non gradualist in onli one direct  which is to eas   in fact  we   d like to be in a situat where we could aggress eas in the futur if we had to but not risk have inflat expect go up   that   s a veri serious problem that mani particip have point out  so how would i like the market to perceiv us   well  i   d like the market to perceiv us as be will to be veri aggress in term of eas  if necessari  but i   d also like them to perceiv us as have the volcker characterist of be six feet  six inch  tall and have a big basebal bat and  if inflat and inflat expect are start to unhing  be will to take out the basebal bat and do whatev is necessari   you realli would like to posit yourself to have those characterist  april                  of     so let me first talk about the case for altern c of not chang and then go to the case for altern b   in the case for c  the advantag of paus at this point is that it would actual indic to the market by our action that we   re serious about keep inflat under control and that it   s more like that we would bring out the basebal bat   in that sens  it could enhanc credibl  and a veri import  posit element of that is that it would be easier for us to be flexibl aggress if we need to be so in the futur   that is one reason that i think there is a strong case for altern c   but i also think there is a strong case for b   first  the evid that inflat expect are unhing or are like to get unhing is not veri strong   i do not put a lot of stock in consum survey   but i tend to look at financi market as be the canari in the coal mine   though be a new yorker  i actual have been in a coal mine  laughter      at the museum of scienc and industri in chicago   it   s realli cool   all of you should go there someday when you go visit
but he has never seen a canari    laughter
i have seen a canari   but the key is that the canari has not keel over  in fact  if you look at what   s go on in the financi market  the concern in term of inflat compens have dissip somewhat   i think the fact that they were move up is an indic of greater inflat risk   they   ve come back down again   i don   t think that should make us complac  but i do think it tell us that we haven   t seen anyth realli bad happen at this stage  so the question is whi we should cut now and go with altern b rather than c   well  first  i think the modal forecast suggest that a cut is in line with op  monetari polici  and i think that   s an import argument   it is particular so becaus there is a veri strong likelihood that  even though i   m a littl more confid that the recess that we   re probabl in now will be veri mild  if it   s even a recess at all   i think it is like that we   re in a recess but a mild april                  of     one   the recoveri actual is go to have a lot of the characterist of the recoveri that we had in the     s becaus it   s just go to take a long  e to clean up this mess   that again argu for a cut   the other issu that i think is import is that there is a veri long period between now and the next fomc meet   given that the modal forecast indic that thing are like to get wors in the economi in this quarter  there is an issu that  if we get bad news  then we might regret not have cut now  and i   m not a big fan of intermeet cut   that would be anoth argument for cut now  i guess the bottom line is that i   m just in a veri uncomfort posit in that i dislik be not veri decis here   one thing that has help me a lot in be comfort with altern b is that the languag has chang quit signific from the initi word   i was not happi with the idea that  if we suggest that there will be a paus in the futur  it would be  e depend   it should be clear data depend   if it were  e depend  we would get into exact the problem that     talk about   we want the flexibl of say that what we   re do is depend on data  not  e  becaus if peopl know that you   re go to revers thing later on  it  sn   t have the impact   i think that is an import chang here   so i   m quit comfort with the languag of altern b   i   m will to support b   it look as though that is the consensus  and my view today is that i   m go to go with whatev the consensus is   thank you veri much
thank you  mr  chairman   the transcript say       say canari wheez but hasn   t keel over       laughter   i support altern b   i think you could frame this as a modest recalibr of polici with a hawkish soft paus
and a wheez canari    laughter
i don   t think the canari is wheez   look  i think there are lot of good argument on both side of this   i think all the good one have been made   the market have been give us a pretti good test against the concern  which i think we all share  that if we move today we risk some signific eros of our inflat credibl or inflat expect feed through the dollar into a commod price spiral   we have had a pretti good test of it   over the past sever week  there has been a veri substanti shift in expect for the path of the fed fund rate  which embodi substanti expect around a near term cut and veri littl beyond that and some modest retrac as we go forward   expect have come down despit what has happen to oil price   inflat has come down   the dollar is stronger on net over that period  this is pretti good valid that the path that is repres in altern b   not come with excess risk that we will be erod our credibl   we can   t know for sure   it   s good to be worri about that risk  but the protect against that risk is fair good  what strike me about this discuss is the extent of the gap in this committe in how we think about the way to measur the stanc of monetari polici   what we could do is use a seminar and a bit of histori on this   it would be nice to run monetari polici back over the past four decad to see  if it had been set with a basic polici regim in which we look onli at the real fed fund rate deflat by headlin inflat today  what the outcom would have been for the economi at that  e   that   s essenti what you guy are say   it seem to me that you are basic say that equilibrium  sn   t vari and that deflat the nomin fed fund rate with some mix of headlin and core today is the best way to judg the stanc of polici   but i think it   s worth have a littl exercis in it   it is hard to look back
excus me   make sure that you say you   re speak for yourself  not for me  in term of how i think about polici
okay  but it is a surpris gap   so i think it would be worth some  e to think through that   obvious we also disagre about how inflat work in the unit state  how relat price shock take effect  and what we should respond to in that sens  that would be worth a littl  e  too   again  it is a surpris to me   we sit here to make monetari polici  and we haven   t talk much about this basic core question   how should we judg the stanc of polici   it would be worth some attent  i just want to end by say someth about the dollar   my basic sens about the dollar   and i   m veri worri about this dynam now   is that it has been trade more on concern about tail risk in the economi and in the financi system than anyth els   as i said ye day  if you look back to when there has been an increas in perceiv tail risk  howev you want to measur it   credit default swap on financi or someth like that   and the two year has fallen sharpli or we have had a big flight to qualiti  those have been the period that have been most advers to the dollar   now  it is not a consist pattern  but i think it   s basic right  and i think it give an import illustr that what goe into a judgment about whether peopl hold dollar and u s  financi asset has to do with a lot of thing   it has a lot to do with confid that this committe will reduc the tail risk in the financi system and the economi to toler level   it also has a lot to do with confid in our willing to keep inflat stabl over a long period  but it   s not onli that   again  we have had a pretti good experi in that proposit over the past year or so  my sens is that the biggest risk to the dollar  sinc i   m pretti confid that this committe is go to make good judgment about inflat go forward  is in the monetari polici of other countri   the real problem for us now is that we have a larg part of the world economi   in non china  non japan asia and the major energi export   still run a monetari polici that is base on the dollar as nomin anchor   that has left them with remark easi monetari polici april                  of     and a pretti signific rise in asset price inflat   the transit ahead for them as they tri to get more independ for monetari polici and soften the link to the dollar is go to carri a lot of risk for us becaus the market is go to infer from that a big shift in prefer for the currenc that both govern and privat actor in those countri hold   as that evolut take place in their exchang rate and monetari polici regim the risk for us is that the market expect a destabil shift in portfolio prefer  which peopl might infer is also a loss of confid in u s  financi asset   i think that   s a big problem for us   it   s not clear to me that it mean that we should run a tighter monetari polici against that risk than would otherwis be appropri becaus i don   t think it buy much protect against that risk   i just want to associ myself with all the concern said about the dollar in this context   the judgment that goe into confid and peopl   s willing to hold u s  financi asset is deepli textur and complex  and it has a lot to do with confid in this committe   s capac to navig the peril path between get and keep down that tail risk and preserv the confid that inflat expect over  e will stay stabl   so i support altern b and it languag
thank you all   the discuss was veri good as usual  and let me just assur you that i listen veri  veri care   so i   m certain hear what you   re say  and i understand the concern that peopl have express   i play jekyl and hyde quit a bit and argu with myself in the shower and other place    laughter   let me first say that i think we ought to at least modest congratul ourselv that we have made some progress   our polici action  includ both rate cut and the liquid measur  have seem to have had some benefit   i think the fear has moder   the market have improv somewhat   as i said ye day  i am cautious about this   there   s a good chanc that we will see further problem and further relaps  but we have made progress in reduc some of the uncertainti in the current environ  april                  of     i also think that there   s a lot of agreement around the tabl   and i certain agre   that we have reach the point where further aggress rate cut is not go to be product and that we should now be signal a willing to sit  watch  and listen for a  e  for two reason   first  risk are now more balanc   that is  there is more attent to inflat risk and dollar risk  and although our output risk remain quit signific  the balanc is closer than it has been for some  e   second  given that we have done a lot in a short  e and move aggress and that we   re see fiscal action come in and perhap other polici effect as well   lag effect of our own action    it seem to be a reason  e for us to paus  to watch care  and to presum that we   re not go to move unless condit strong warrant it   so i think that  at least in that broad respect  there   s a lot of agreement around the tabl  the two altern that have been discuss by most peopl are b  which is to move    basi point today but to send a fair strong signal of a prefer to paus after this meet  and c  which is not to move but to keep some element of the downsid risk aliv in our risk assess   like a number of peopl  i think both are plausibl   both have appeal   altern c  in particular  has the appeal of push back against some critic on the inflat side who have critic us for not be suffici attent to the dollar  to commod price  and so on   as i said ye day  i think that inflat is an import problem   it   s a tremend complic  given what is happen now in the other part of the economi   in no way do i disagre with the point made by mani particip that inflat is a critic issu for us and that we have to pay veri close attent to it   as i said ye day  i do think that some of the critic that we are get is just simpli misinform   i don   t think there   s ani plausibl interest rate polici that we can follow that would elimin the bulk of the chang in commod price that we   re see   i think they are due most to global suppli and demand condit   a small piec of evid for that is that ye day april                  of     the ecb was mention favor as have the appropri inflat attitud compar with our attitud   i would just note that headlin inflat in the euro zone is about the same as it is here  despit their stronger currenc  becaus they are be driven by the same global commod price that we are  i would also say that  although the inflat situat is a veri import concern  i don   t see ani particular deterior in the near term   sinc the last meet  oil price have gone up  which is veri high profil  but gold  for exampl  has drop about    or    percent   other precious metal are down   some other commod are down   the dollar is stronger   tip breakeven have move in the right direct   wage  as we saw this morn  are stabl  and i would urg you to compar wage behavior over the past five year with wage behavior dure the     s   wage growth then was not onli high but also veri unstabl and respons to short term movement in headlin inflat   so i think the canari is still get decent breath here    laughter   i want us to be care not to overpromis   we cannot do anyth about the relat price of gasolin  and i don   t think that we   re on the edg of an abyss of the     s type   i do think it   s an import issu  and i do think that there is benefit to push against the percept   in this busi  percept have an element of realiti to them  and we understand that   that   s an import part of central bank  and i fulli appreci that point   so again  i see a lot of merit in the altern c approach  as i think you can conjectur  i   m go to recommend altern b      basi point but with a stronger indic of a paus   let me discuss whi in the end i come down on that side  first is the substanc  the fundament   i don   t think that    basi point is irrelev   for exampl  one month libor is up about    basi point sinc our last meet   these short run financ cost do matter  particular in a situat of financi fragil   so it is not just an issu  april                  of     as presid   mention  of long term interest rate expect   overnight and short term financ cost do matter for the financi market  and a lower rate will help the market to heal    it will affect other rate   to take an obvious exampl  it affect the adjust rate that mortgag move to in the economi   so i think there   s a case to be made on the substanc   i will not add much to the discuss about how we defin    accommod      but one way to do it  i guess  is to look at the  book   s veri thorough analysi  which rather than use rule of thumb attempt to look at a broad forecast condit on what the staff can ascertain about the financi drag that we   re see   their analysi suggest that someth around where we are or a littl lower is consist with slow econom growth but also price stabil within a relat short  e   that is one way of tri to calibr   obvious  there are other way as well  the second point i   d make  besid just the substanc  is the consist with our own project   virtual everybodi around the tabl still think that the downsid risk to growth are signific  and we   ve mention the same factor   financi condit  hous  and a few other thing   those remain veri serious downsid risk   i don   t think anybodi think they are under control at this point   yes  we also see an increas number of peopl with upsid risk to inflat  but again  in term of the number we   ll publish  i think the downsid risk are still held by more peopl than the inflat assess   that  by the way  suggest whi we can   t realli do what presid   suggest   hold and move to the altern b  paragraph    languag   not to move and to say that the risk are balanc would  i think  be clear inconsist with the risk assess that are in the project  the other issu have to do with communic   we are at an import transit point in our communic strategi   one of the risk that we took when we made the veri rapid cut in interest rate earlier this year was the problem of come to this exact point  when we would have to april                  of     communic to the market that we were done  that we were go to flatten out  and that we were go to a mode of wait   it was alway difficult to figur out how that was go to work in a smooth way   whether through luck or design  market expect have set up perfect   i mean  basic they   re now assum a flat path go forward  with some increas later  and that appear to be consist  as vice chairman   note  in the last few day with signific dollar appreci  declin in commod price  and declin in inflat expect   all the thing that we want to see   it appear that we   re in a posit that had seem realli problemat some  e ago  so we are now abl to make the transit in a way that will be relat clear and  i hope  not too disrupt  now  i want to come back to the issu of disappoint market   i agre with presid   and mani other that disappoint market can be a good thing   it is certain not alway a bad thing  by ani mean   i think the issu is a littl more subtl than that   the issu here is the clariti of what we   re tri to say and the way our messag is go to be read   let me make two point about that   if we were to do altern c  i think there would be essenti two issu   one is that  although we would not be move  which would be a surpris  we would also not be declar a paus becaus of downsid risk  which would be anoth surpris   we   d have a surpris both in the action and in the statement   the risk there is that we confus the market about what our intent are and what would caus us to respond   for exampl  the  book   s project of friday   s employ number are somewhat more pessimist than those be held in the market  if we took action c today and friday   s number were consist with the  book forecast and with our own project but wors  signific wors  than the market expect  would statement c then lead to the build in of addit eas   i think there would be a lot of confus april                  of     there   a lot of uncertainti about what exact we are say about when we   d be will to respond  the other communic issu that i have with altern c   and this  again  is someth presid   said ye day   is that if we don   t move and we put c out there  the stock market could go up becaus it might be read as say that the fed has increas confid  is see thing look better  and is feel stronger about the economi   i   m not sure that realli is the assess we have  and if we then have bad data on the labor market and the financi market weaken somewhat  will we be seen as have made a wrong call  as be blindsid by circumst   this is more discuss than it   s worth  but what i   m tri to convey is that it   s not just a question of disappoint or not disappoint market   it   s a question of whether or not we   re send a clear messag   i think altern b  while it   s consist with our risk assess  is also a pretti strong statement   let me  just for what it is worth  assur you now that data that come in within the general  broad rang of what we   re expect  even though they will be weak  should not caus us to eas further  given this statement   i believ that this statement will provid us with plenti of cover   no matter what the market expect  we have said that we have come to a point at which we need to take a paus  we need to see what   s happen  and we are go to be watch and wait  with respect to the languag  i just want to point out how much the languag in altern b has move from march   it realli is a veri signific chang   first of all  we are acknowledg explicit how much we have alreadi done   the substanti eas of monetari polici to date plus the measur to fo  market liquid   and express a general confid implicit in that first sentenc that we have done a lot  that it is like to help  and therefor  that we should wait and see what happen   second  we remov ani refer to downsid risk to growth  april                  of     which has been in there for a long  e   that   s a veri strong statement   that say a lot about our inclin go further   third  we   ve ad the phrase    continu to monitor     which to me suggest veri much a watch wait rather than an activ approach to develop in the economi   final  we have made it clear that we are go to be data depend and  in particular  though we have done a lot  we are expect continu weak  and we   ll act as need   but we have taken out the     e manner     so the presumpt that we   ll be respond in a veri rapid and aggress way  i think  has been moder  i think of altern b as be a compromis in the sens that it take a step that is consist with the fundament in term of the under tight of the financi system and the risk that most of us see to econom growth as well as inflat   at the same  e  i think it is a rather strong step in express a shift in our strategi   that we are move from the phase of rapid declin and aggress to a phase of wait and observ how this economi is go to evolv   again  with full respect to everyon   s comment  i understand   unlik governor    i wasn   t sit on the fenc  i thought that was a littl uncomfort   but i understand the concern and the argument   the communic issu did concern me  and larg on that basi  i would advoc b today   are there ani comment   if not  could you pleas take a roll call
this vote encompass the languag of altern b in the tabl that was hand out as part of bill   s brief ye day  as well as the direct from the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent     chairman bernank  vice chairman   yes yes april                  of     presid   governor kohn governor   governor   presid pianalto presid   presid  n governor           no yes yes yes yes no yes yes

without object   the discuss is about interest on reserv   let me turn to
thank you  mr  chairman   we will be refer to the packag of materi label    implic of interest on reserv for monetari polici implement      today  the staff will report on work prompt by two chang the congress made to the feder reserv act in octob      and will seek your guidanc on further work   both chang becom effect in octob        as shown on page    the first chang allow the board to author the reserv bank to pay interest on balanc maintain by depositori institut at an interest rate or rate not to exceed the general level of short term interest rate  the second allow the board to set requir reserv ratio on transact deposit within a rang of   to    percent rather than the current mandat rang of   to    percent  permit the fed effect to elimin reserv requir if it choos  these two chang will allow the feder reserv to make signific improv in it approach to monetari polici implement   they give us an opportun to reduc distort and deadweight loss result from our current complex system of reserv requir   they also give us an opportun to improv the effect of monetari polici implement in routin circumst as well as in condit of financi stress     the materi use by messr  madigan     clous  hilton  and   are append to this transcript  appendix     april                  of     while the congress made import chang in the law  it also left some key statutori constraint in place   as discuss on page    if the board choos to retain reserv requir  the law continu to allow them to be impos onli on transact deposit  nonperson  e deposit  and eurodollar liabil and onli on depositori institut   in effect  the law continu to enshrin a system of reserv requir that was design to facilit control of m    an object that has had littl relev to the conduct of u s  monetari polici for a quarter centuri   second  the prohibit against pay interest on demand deposit remain in forc and is a signific continu distort in the u s financi system   we continu to work with congression committe and staff to seek opportun for the repeal of this prohibit   third  the law retain signific constraint on the asset that the feder reserv can purchas in the open market   fourth  interest on reserv has potenti implic for price servic and for reserv bank oper more general   final  the feder reserv remain unabl to pay explicit interest on balanc held at the feder reserv by the treasuri and by foreign central bank   page   summar the step we have taken to date in our work on interest on reserv   short after the legisl was pass  the chairman ask the staff to begin background work   last year  a system workgroup undertook a preliminari studi of a rang of option for implement monetari polici given the new author   i   d like to recogn the particip in that workgroup  who made remark progress dure a period in which some of these individu were experienc consider pressur relat to the implement of monetari polici that day  not just in five year   these individu includ jim clous  seth carpent    driscol  sherri edward    mill  and travi nesmith from the board  spenc hilton  leo bartolini  chris burk  todd kei   antoin martin  and jami mcandrew from the new york fed  ron feldman from minneapoli      from the philadelphia fed  and huberto enni and   weinberg from richmond   separ  a system workgroup co head by don hammond here at the board and ron mitchel at the boston fed has begun work on the implic for price servic of pay explicit interest on balanc   in februari  the board host a workshop on monetari polici implement  five foreign central bank and the feder reserv particip   as shown on page    our brief today is in four part   after this introduct      will present a summari of the feder reserv   s current approach to implement monetari polici   next  jim clous and spenc hilton will discuss five option for implement the new legisl author   final  bill   will make a number of conclud comment and present our recommend   as shown on page    we will be seek your comment on the criteria that we have tentat adopt for evalu the option  on the option themselv  and on the process and  elin that we are tentat propos for this project   one of the key issu is whether you would be prepar to see reserv requir reduc to zero     will now continu our present  april                  of
as   note  i will summar our current approach   as indic on page    i will discuss depositori institut    demand for central bank balanc  how the desk manag the suppli of balanc  and outcom in the feder fund market   there are three compon of demand   some depositori institut  dis  hold balanc to satisfi the reserv requir shown on page     mani more hold contractu clear balanc  and some routin hold excess reserv   page   note that dis can meet their reserv requir by hold currenc  by hold balanc at a reserv bank  and by hold deposit at a correspond that hold an equal amount at a reserv bank   these asset earn no interest  so dis have an incent to reduc their requir reserv to the level of vault cash and reserv balanc they would choos to hold if there were no requir   in practic  dis cut requir reserv by use sweep program that shift deposit out of transact account into link nonreserv account   this stratagem work becaus the fed appli reserv requir to end of day  post sweep  deposit   about half of the dis have no reserv requir   a larg major of the remaind meet their requir entir with vault cash   onli       dis hold balanc to meet reserv requir  so last year requir reserv balanc averag less than    billion  an amount equal to     percent of total deposit in the u s  bank system   economist claim that central bank impos reserv requir to ensur a sizabl demand for central bank balanc   impos a high requir reserv ratio on a narrow deposit base and then allow dis to run sweep program and use vault cash to meet reserv requir   not achiev that goal   more than       dis have account at reserv bank   on an averag day  they use their account to make and receiv more than     million interbank payment with a valu of rough      trillion   as note on page     mani of those dis need a larger balanc to avoid frequent overnight overdraft than to satisfi reserv requir   about       choos to hold a contractu clear balanc   the incent to maintain a contractu balanc is that such balanc earn implicit interest that offset the fee a di incur when it use our price servic   but these    earn credit    cannot be paid in cash  so dis that do not use our servic have no incent to hold a contractu balanc   page    show that dis hold a bit less than    billion of contractu clear balanc   the rough equal with requir reserv balanc is coincid   requir and contractu balanc  though small  facilit the implement of u s  monetari polici in two way  as indic on page      first  requir and contractu balanc are set befor the start of each reserv mainten period  so they establish a predict lower bound on the period averag demand for balanc  second  dis are allow to meet reserv requir and contractu balanc commit on averag over multi day reserv mainten period   this averag featur help make the demand for balanc interest elast   dis reduc the opportun cost of meet requir by hold smaller balanc on day when the fed fund rate is abov target and larger balanc on day when the fund rate is april                  of     below target   carryov provis and clear band  which give dis some flexibl to hold too mani or too few balanc in one mainten period and the opposit in the next period  also help make the demand for balanc interest elast   page    summar the third compon of demand for balanc   desir excess reserv   larg dis usual aim to hold zero excess reserv on averag   small dis as a group general hold posit excess reserv   the left half of the graph on page    illustr that the daili sum of requir  contractu  and excess reserv balanc averag about     billion from januari through juli of last year but vari between     billion and     billion   the day to day variat larg reflect big bank    behavior   big bank want much larger balanc on day when an unusu larg volum of payment flow through their feder reserv account than on other day  this strategi lower their risk of incur overnight overdraft on high payment flow day while reduc their opportun cost of hold non interest bear balanc on other day   the right half of the graph show that demand for balanc has oscil even more wide sinc august   even at     billion or more  dis    balanc are not big enough to clear      trillion of fedwir payment per day without incur overdraft   inde  dis make heavi use of daylight credit   at least in theori  readi avail of inexpens daylight credit reduc dis    demand for central bank balanc   a propos reduct in the cost of collater daylight credit   the propos is now out for public comment   may further reduc demand for balanc   we turn next to the suppli of balanc  begin on page      you   ve told the desk to keep the feder fund rate close to target on averag   the desk   so by tri to make each day   s suppli of balanc equal to the quantiti that dis would demand that day if the fund rate were at target   the desk   s strategi is to use outright purchas or sale of treasuri secur  plus    day and    day repurchas agreement  to suppli a level of balanc somewhat lower than the minimum amount the bank system is like to demand go forward   the desk then use one  to seven day repo to suppli the remaind   the desk structur it oper so that matur repo almost alway leav the suppli of balanc short of the quantiti demand and then undertak a new repo to fill in the gap   but as indic on page     the desk   not complet control the suppli   unanticip chang in autonom factor can make the suppli of balanc larger or smaller than project  the staff at the board and in new york do a veri good job  but not a perfect job  of predict chang in these factor   variat in borrow from the primari dealer credit facil also affect the suppli of balanc   for exampl  citigroup global market borrow on    of the first    busi day that the pdcf was in oper  in amount that vari from      billion to      billion   barclay capit borrow on    day  in amount that rang from    billion to    billion   four other primari dealer were frequent borrow  anoth six borrow less often   chang in pdcf credit are not alway captur in the staff   s daili project  so they can  and do  caus the suppli of balanc to deviat from the intend level   in ani case  if the day   s project suppli april                  of     is not close to the forecast of quantiti demand  the desk conduct an open market oper to make the two rough equal   as note on page     the desk was in the market almost everi busi day   inde  all but six busi day   from januari      through juli       replac matur repo with larger or smaller repo as project show a need to add or to drain balanc   how well   this approach to implement monetari polici work   if the key criterion is keep the fund rate close to target  our current approach work well in normal  e and not so well when interbank market are under stress   but our current approach impos substanti and unnecessari burden   as the graph on page    indic  the effect fed fund rate is almost alway within a few basi point of target dure normal  e  as it was from januari through juli of last year  but there have been mani larger than usual deviat from target sinc last august  for two primari reason   first  daili variat in demand for balanc have becom larger and more difficult to forecast   second  demand appar has becom less respons to temporari deviat of the fund rate from target   that is  demand has becom less elast   even so  the averag of daili deviat from target has been close to zero sinc mid septemb   page    and    summar equilibrium in the feder fund market and the reason for larg deviat from target   fed fund typic trade near the target earli in the morn becaus buyer and seller usual expect the desk to suppli enough balanc to get the fund rate to target in the afternoon   but the fund rate some  is firm or soft in earli trade  signal a like shortag or surplus of balanc and lead the desk to aim for a somewhat larger or smaller suppli than otherwis   after the desk conduct the day   s oper  three thing happen concurr  the suppli of balanc respond to chang in autonom factor and pdcf credit  the demand for balanc is realiz as dis make and receiv payment  and dis trade feder fund  determin the day   s averag or    effect    fund rate   if the suppli of balanc is close to the actual quantiti demand and if the payment system and the feder fund market work normal  the fund rate will be close to target   ani excess demand or suppli general   not becom appar until late in the day  when the desk is unabl to adjust the suppli of balanc becaus primari dealer no longer have uncommit collater   dis that end up with larger balanc than they want late in the afternoon seek to sell fed fund   when the bank system as a whole has sizabl excess balanc  dis that tri to sell fed fund late in the day find few buyer   becaus balanc earn no interest  the fund rate can fall to zero in that situat   on the other hand  an excess demand for balanc make the fund rate rise relat to target   if the fund rate climb suffici abov the primari credit rate  some dis overcom their reluct to borrow  rais the suppli of balanc and help limit the increas in the fund rate   last august provid an interest case studi   the demand for balanc rose as dis sought greater liquid   the desk increas the suppli   even so  the fund rate trade firm relat to target almost everi morn as european bank bid aggress for fed fund to lock in dollar fund befor the end of their busi april                  of     day in europ   the firm morn rate suggest a shortag of balanc   but late in the day in new york  the fund rate often fell well below target as domest bank that held larger than normal balanc dure the day tri to sell fed fund rather than hold big non interest bear balanc overnight   while our current regim keep the fund rate close to target on averag  it impos sizabl and unnecessari burden   as note on page     dis use real resourc to run sweep program and to care manag each day   s balanc in their feder reserv account   while those effort generat privat gain  they are a wast from a social perspect   even with sweep program  the opportun cost of hold unremuner reserv balanc averag about      million per year dure the past two year   in addit  the bank system and the feder reserv spend mani million of dollar each year to ensur and monitor complianc with complex reserv requir rule   as indic on page     our current approach to implement monetari polici has strength   it usual keep the fund rate close to target  and it support an activ interbank market   but our current approach also has shortcom   it allow occasion larg deviat of the fund rate from target even in normal  e and more frequent larg deviat when interbank market are disrupt   our approach is less than transpar  even well inform market particip some  are surpris by the desk   s daili oper  and there was widespread misunderstand of the desk   s action last august   final  our current approach impos burden that simpli are not necessari to enabl the desk to keep the fund rate close to target  theori and foreign experi suggest that it is possibl to reduc the shortcom of the current u s  approach to implement monetari polici without sacrif it strength   jim clous and spenc hilton will now discuss a rang of option for improv the u s  approach
thank      as note on page     the interest on reserv workgroup develop a set of option for monetari polici implement in the unit state base on altern set for a small set of core structur element  the first core element   so call balanc target   is a central featur of mani system   in the unit state  japan  switzerland  and the euro area  balanc target are establish through mandatori reserv requir   in the unit kingdom  balanc target are establish through voluntari contractu arrang   other countri  such as canada and australia  oper with no formal balanc target  target band are a second structur element incorpor in mani system to afford bank some flexibl in meet their target   the carryov provis for requir reserv and the clear band for requir clear balanc play this role in the unit state   the structur of the mainten period is anoth core structur element   as   note  the u s  system oper with a mixtur of one week and two week mainten period   the unit kingdom and the euro area oper with mainten period that correspond to the interv between monetari polici meet   central bank like the bank of canada and reserv bank of australia that oper without balanc target implicit oper with a one day mainten period   april                  of     final  most system involv some form of interest rate corridor with the upper bound of the corridor establish by a stand lend facil and the lower bound set by the rate of remuner on excess reserv or a redeposit facil   as note on page     market develop may  at  e  impair the efficaci of one or more of these core structur element   for exampl  the stand lend facil should  in theori  establish a cap on interbank rate   howev  the presenc of stigma in use the stand lend facil can impair the effect of the cap   that certain seem to have been the case in the unit state over recent month   we have observ depositori institut regular bid for fund in the market at rate abov the primari credit rate   the tabl at the bottom report some evid on this score cull from data on fedwir transact   over recent week  mani of the largest bank in the countri have execut numer trade for sizabl amount at rate well abov the primari credit rate   it may be possibl to redesign the discount window to mitig stigma to some extent  but it appear like that stigma will continu to be an issu for the discount window  especi dure period of financi distress   as a result  system that reli heavili on a stand lend facil to establish an upper bound on the feder fund rate implicit disadvantag those institut that are most wari about use the discount window   as you can see in the tabl  that set of institut in the unit state includ mani that are critic provid of liquid across a rang of market   it is noteworthi in this regard that citibank in the past has been will to provid liquid in the fund market by borrow primari credit and relend the proceed in the fund market   howev  in recent week  citi has seem reluct to pursu this strategi and has  in fact  execut more than     trade from late march through last week in sizabl amount at rate abov the primari credit rate   inde  the three largest bank in the countri   shown in the first three row   all appear to be quit wari about use the discount window   as note on page     it is help  broad speak  to think about the five option discuss in the paper as fall into two basic categori   system that incorpor a multipl day mainten period and system in which depositori manag their reserv to meet a daili reserv object   the multipl day system   option   and   in the paper   reli on arbitrag across day of a mainten period as an import factor contribut to day to day fund rate stabil   singl day system tend to reli more heavili on stand facil and the structur of remuner rate s  on reserv to stabil the fund rate   the next few slide focus on multipl day system   option     as note on page     option   consid a straightforward modif of our current system of monetari polici implement   requir reserv balanc would be remuner at a rate close to the target fund rate   the primari credit facil  in theori anyway  would establish the upper bound of an interest rate corridor   the lower bound of the corridor would be establish by pay interest on excess reserv at a rate appreci below the target fund rate   the solid line in the pictur display what the demand for reserv might look like on the last day of the april                  of     reserv mainten period   the curv would be downward slope and might entail some precautionari demand for excess reserv   the reserv demand curv on previous day in the mainten period   the dot line   would be much flatter at the target rate over a wide rang  reflect the abil of bank to substitut balanc across day of the mainten period in meet reserv requir   eventu  though  at veri low level of balanc  the increas risk of an overnight overdraft would push the intraperiod demand curv up to the primari credit rate   at high level of balanc  the intraperiod demand curv would eventu fall to the remuner rate on excess reserv as bank recogn that they held excess balanc that could not be work off by the end of the mainten period   the width of the    flat portion    of the intraperiod demand curv tend to narrow over the mainten period as the scope for substitut diminish across the remain day of the period   in this structur  the desk would oper much as it   today  suppli an aggreg quantiti of reserv balanc each day to address both daili demand and mainten period averag need   option     as note on page     option   in the paper is a multipl day system base on voluntari balanc target rather than mandatori reserv requir   this system would share mani of the key structur element of the system for monetari polici implement employ in the unit kingdom   depositori institut would establish a voluntari balanc target that they would agre to meet  on averag  over a mainten period   the mainten period could be set equal to the interv between fomc meet   the system could includ a target balanc    band    to afford bank some flexibl in meet their voluntari target balanc  as shown on the right  the demand for reserv on the last day of the period would again be downward slope  and the desk would suppli an aggreg quantiti of reserv equal to the quantiti demand at the target fund rate   reserv manag and the fund market under this option probabl would be similar to that for option     the longer mainten period might allow depositori institut more scope for substitut of balanc across day of the mainten period   that could impli less need for daili fine tune of balanc and greater fund rate stabil   a key issu  howev  is whether the aggreg quantiti of voluntari balanc target would be larg enough to provid adequ leeway for effect arbitrag across day of the mainten period   mani bank might choos not to establish a voluntari balanc target in this system  and those that do may not choos to establish a larg balanc target   in this case  the fund rate could be fair volatil within the interest rate corridor   option     as note on page     option   in the paper   the simpl corridor   is similar to the system employ by the bank of canada and the reserv bank of australia   bank would not need to establish a balanc target of ani sort and would simpli manag their account each day to balanc the opportun cost of hold reserv against the risk of overnight overdraft   the system would involv a fair narrow symmetr fund rate corridor   as note in the figur  the desk would suppli reserv each day equal to the quantiti demand along the downward slope portion of the demand curv   becaus the demand curv is like to be fair steep  april                  of     shock to reserv suppli are like to result in signific volatil in the fund rate within the corridor   as note earlier  the heavi relianc on the primari credit facil to establish an upper bound on the fund rate may be suspect  especi dure period of financi distress   option     as note on page     option   in the paper is a system similar in mani respect to that employ by the reserv bank of new zealand   key structur featur of this system includ an asymmetr interest rate corridor and a relat high level of balanc to ensur that the fund rate trade near the floor of the interest rate corridor   as in option    depositori would not need to establish a balanc target of ani sort   the reserv demand curv for this system might look like that shown to the right   at low level of balanc  the demand curv would be downward slope reflect precautionari demand for balanc to avoid overnight overdraft   but at suffici high level of balanc  the risk of overnight overdraft should becom veri low  and the demand curv would asymptot near the floor of the fund rate corridor   it is difficult to es  the level of balanc that would be necessari to reach this point  but an aggreg level of balanc on the order of     billion would probabl be suffici in most case   in principl  fluctuat in various factor affect reserv would not have much effect on the fund rate  and the general high level of balanc could reduc daylight overdraft   part becaus of the experi in new zealand  there are question about incent for strateg behavior in this structur   option     as note on page     option   is a hybrid singl day system that would involv a voluntari daili balanc target and a relat wide target band  depositori would receiv full remuner on balanc maintain up to the upper bound of the target band and would be penal for ani shortfal in balanc below the lower bound of the target band   with these structur element  the reserv demand curv should be fair flat at the target rate over a wide rang  but the curv would be downward slope near the upper and lower bound of the target balanc band   the desk would presum oper by target a quantiti of balanc each day near the middl of the target band   as with option    a signific issu with option   would be whether depositori would choos a high enough level of voluntari balanc target to allow the target band to play the desir role in stabil the feder fund rate   as note on page     the paper also identifi a number of general issu that cut across all the option   first  depositori institut will still be subject to statutori limit on their abil to pay interest on demand deposit   as a result  the feder reserv   s initi to pay interest on reserv may be seen by correspond bank as unfair competit   there are also technic issu associ with the set of the remuner rate on reserv balanc that appropri account for the essenti risk free natur of balanc held with the central bank   the feder reserv would need to work through govern issu associ with all the option   in particular  the board is respons for set all remuner rate on balanc  and this would need to be close coordin with the fomc   s april                  of     determin of the target feder fund rate   final  mani if not all the option discuss would like requir some transit period that would need to be care manag   spenc will now discuss some of the pros and con of each option in more detail and how they stack up relat to key object
thank you  jim   we have identifi four critic object for a new oper framework  which are list on page    of your handout   these are     to reduc burden and deadweight loss associ with the current regim      to enhanc monetari polici implement      to promot effici and resili money market  and     to promot an effici payment system   for each of the five option that jim has just present  i am go to describ what we see as the major advantag and disadvantag of each vis  vis these object   i will also highlight some import sourc of uncertainti that we have about how some of these option might function in practic   then i will close with a broad assess of how the five option measur up against each of these four object   the key advantag and disadvantag of option     remuner requir and excess reserv balanc   are list on page      this option would have the advantag of be relat easi to implement given that it would build larg on element of the current oper framework and would simpli pay interest on reserv requir and  at a lower rate  on excess reserv   the basic framework  which consist of an interest rate corridor with reserv requir and mainten period  is wide use by other central bank  and we   re pretti certain how it would function in practic   for central bank that have adopt this basic framework  it has proven to be reason effect for control short term interbank rate under a varieti of circumst   howev  this option would do littl to reduc the administr burden associ with our current regim   this framework is also somewhat rigid  particular in the flexibl it would provid to us and to bank themselv to adjust the level of requir in way that would facilit monetari polici implement   a particular shortcom is that mani depositori activ in the interbank market have a veri small base of deposit against which requir of ani level could be assess   an import sourc of uncertainti with this option is whether it would lead to a signific increas in total requir oper balanc  which would be help for damp interest rate fluctuat that can aris when requir are veri low   howev  the fed would have some power to influenc the aggreg level of requir by rais requir ratio   option     voluntari balanc target    shown on page     would lead to some reduct of administr cost and burden compar with the current framework  option     as relat simplic would be one of the princip design object for a new system of voluntari reserv target   the basic framework is similar to that of option     it consist of an interest rate corridor with mainten period but substitut voluntari target for reserv requir   as alreadi note  this basic framework has proven to be reason effect for control overnight interbank rate where it has been adopt   furthermor  a new system of voluntari target could provid all dis with consider flexibl for set their own level of april                  of     target and for adjust the size of these target  a featur that bank might find use dure period of heighten uncertainti or stress   with this option  there would also be the opportun to review and total revamp the length and mechan of the mainten period to make them more support of monetari polici implement   howev  almost ani system of voluntari target for reserv is bound to impos some administr cost on both depositori and the fed  and there may be some tradeoff between administr simplic and design flexibl  an import sourc of uncertainti with this option is that we have yet to identifi with precis a system of voluntari reserv target that would be workabl  in the sens of be easi to administ across a larg number of dis with dispar structur  and that would be effect in yield a total level and distribut of voluntari target across dis that would enhanc our abil to achiev our oper object   unfortun  experi of other central bank offer littl guidanc in how to design voluntari target   a particular risk that concern the bank of england when it design it voluntari target scheme was the potenti for market manipul that a new system might offer individu bank if they were entir free to choos their level   option     simpl corridor    on page     would go about as far as possibl toward elimin administr burden by do away with all requir and mainten period account rule   this option should also keep the overnight interbank rate within a narrow rang than the other option  assum that we adopt a narrow spread between the discount rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserv   experi of other central bank that have adopt this kind of oper system support that belief   howev  there is also reason to believ that  with remov of the abil of bank to averag reserv hold over a mainten period  interest rate volatil within the interest rate corridor could be high   we could respond to high volatil within a corridor by further narrow that corridor  but there is the risk that  at some point as you go in that direct  market particip could use our discount window or interest on excess reserv as a first recours rather than as a last resort and thus affect the fed   s role as intermediari and impair normal market function   there are some import question about how effect a simpl corridor system would function in our particular environ   all the option we are consid propos to use the primari credit facil to limit upward movement in market rate   to the extent that this facil might not serv as an effect brake on upward rate movement  the consequ would be greatest for this option becaus there are no other mechan for smooth interest rate   some central bank that have a simpl corridor framework have also develop arrang to adjust reserv level late in the day to prevent exogen reserv shock from push market rate to either the upper or the lower end of the corridor   option     floor with high balanc   is shown on page      it would also do away with all requir and mainten period account rule and  like option    would go a long way toward elimin administr burden   moreov  becaus the rate effect of even a larg aggreg reserv shock or a payment shock at an individu di are like to be relat small  the need for depositori or for the april                  of     desk to manag daili reserv posit intens is like to be reduc  which should translat to further resourc save   better insul of market rate from exogen reserv shock is a design object  and it is a particular distinct featur of this framework   howev  complet sever the link between daili reserv level and interest rate movement can be a doubl edg sword   while we may wish to better insul market rate from reserv shock  we may also wish to preserv some abil to influenc market rate by manipul reserv suppli when other factor are distort rate   one risk associ with this option is that it would repres a radic departur from the basic element of our own current framework and from those of almost everi other central bank  prevent us from learn from the experi of other central bank   a particular unknown with this option is the possibl implic for the function of the interbank market   offer to compens dis for all the reserv they might choos to hold at a rate that is in line with market rate could have profound effect on their willing to lend in the market  under both normal circumst and dure period of market stress   the reserv bank of new zealand  one central bank that has experi with a system similar to option    did run into some difficulti with the hoard of reserv by individu bank to the detriment of the interbank market   as a result  they adjust their framework to cap hold of excess reserv by individu bank   option     voluntari daili target with clear band   is on page      it has mani of the same advantag and disadvantag as option    stem from the fact that both featur voluntari reserv target   becaus simplic would be one of the design principl  it should reduc current administr burden   it would also provid dis with the same kind of flexibl that option     for set and adjust their own reserv target   on the other hand  a system of voluntari target for reserv would still leav some administr cost  and we have yet to specifi a system of voluntari reserv target that would be workabl and effect   an addit advantag of this option is that it could allow the fed to adjust the width of the daili clear band around the reserv target   the final choic of clear band width could be made after some experiment base on what work best   moreov  be abl to make temporari adjust to the width of this daili clear band could be a power tool for deal with exig circumst   experi of other central bank provid littl guidanc about how this flexibl might be best employ   but the bank of england did widen it mainten period clear band dure the recent financi market turmoil  and they have been happi with the result   interest  the ecb  quit independ  has been examin the possibl of a new system center on a one day clear band rather than a multi day mainten period   let me sum up by outlin how these five option stack up against the four object that we have establish for a new oper framework  which are summar on page    and      first  all the option would elimin most of the current    reserv tax    associ with the nonpay of interest on reserv  and perhap with the except of option    they would reduc the administr burden associ with our current framework   option    simpl corridor  and option    floor with high balanc  would do the most to elimin these administr cost  april                  of     second  all the option would improv monetari polici implement by help set a floor on the fed fund rate   most have addit featur that could help control rate volatil  although these differ from one anoth in term of their mechan   but some of the option offer greater potenti to adjust paramet in way that could be help amid chang circumst   say  dure period of market stress or heighten uncertainti about develop that could affect our balanc sheet   an adjust clear band in option   could offer consider flexibl   adjust reserv target  a featur of both option   and    are anoth possibl   third  all the option would reli on effici money market for distribut reserv between dis   there is more uncertainti  howev  about how some of the option might influenc the incent structur for trade and the alloc of liquid in short term financ market and the role of the central bank in that process   this is the case with option    simpl corridor   should that corridor be too narrow  and with option    floor with high balanc   where the choic of lend excess liquid in the market versus hold excess reserv would be near equival   fourth  all the option are compat with the propos chang in payment system polici   howev  there are differ among the option in the level of reserv that would like be in place and that could serv as a substitut for the provis of central bank daylight credit   option    floor with high balanc  would provid the most reserv in the system  and option    simpl corridor  would provid the fewest  perhap even lower than current level   a system of voluntari reserv target  a featur of both option   and    could be deliber design to encourag a relat high level of reserv
build on the earlier present  i am go to focus briefli on four area   first  i   d like to put the interest on reserv project in the broader context of monetari polici implement   second  i will discuss briefli the implic of our experi dure the recent market turmoil in term of how it might influenc our choic in this project   third  i   ll suggest some next step and a potenti  elin   fourth  i   ll focus on the criteria for evalu the differ option and those area where your guidanc will like be particular import   turn to page    of the handout  the issu of pay interest on reserv should be place in a broader context   in particular  this project should be consid as part of the process of improv the overal monetari polici framework   put blunt  although the current system work veri well dure normal  e  we have found it recent to be less robust dure  e of stress   as a result  we should use this opportun to strengthen the robust of the framework   so what are the weak of the current monetari polici framework   as shown on page    of the handout  four come immedi to mind       in  e of  april                  of     stress  the feder fund rate can be veri volatil   both day to day and intraday      on the upsid  the primari credit facil rate is not a bind ceil on rate      when there is a larg reserv ad miss  the desk can temporarili lose control of the feder fund rate target to the downsid       stabil in the feder fund rate may not limit upward pressur in term fund rate   today i   ll focus on the volatil issu and the failur of the pcf rate to be a bind cap   two issu are worth note regard volatil   first  the feder fund rate has becom more volatil on a day to day basi sinc last august   this can be seen on page     second  the feder fund rate has becom veri volatil intraday   the exhibit on page    show how wide the rang of feder fund rate trade has been recent   the vertic dash line indic the daili rang   note that the primari credit facil rate has not act as a firm cap on the upper end of the daili rang   as shown on page     these shortcom suggest that pay interest on reserv should be consid in tandem with other chang to the overal monetari polici framework   we should be will to make signific adjust to our monetari polici framework so that it is more robust dure  e of stress   in this context  although option    pay interest on requir and excess reserv  and option    elimin reserv requir  are attract becaus both would elimin the reserv tax distort  they do not do much in term of make the monetari polici framework more robust   that said  option   has a number of favor featur   it is voluntari and would lessen the regulatori burden   we have consider experi with this type of framework  so the risk of unintend consequ might be lower than for some of the other option   the bank of england has been use this framework success  and it has proven to be reason robust through this period of market turmoil   nevertheless  we may wish to be more ambiti   turn to page     option    voluntari daili target with clear band  is potenti more robust than option   or option     in part  this is becaus it is veri flexibl   this propos has a number of paramet that can be adjust   for exampl  the width of the corridor and the size of the voluntari reserv band   thus  this option has the advantag that it could be modifi relat easili in light of experi or in respons to chang market condit   the biggest shortcom of option   is that no other central bank has adopt such a model   thus  experi and empir evid are lack compar with the other propos   so what is our recommend in term of push this forward  see page      as jim note in his present  the five option can be broken down into two class   option   and   oper in a framework of a multipl day reserv mainten period   option       and   are singl day system   reserv mainten period have both advantag and disadvantag   reserv mainten period reduc volatil by averag   which can be a good thing   but there is a cost   the shock can persist   in contrast  in singl day system  each day is a new start  so one avoid the problem of a larg shock contamin an entir reserv mainten period   this suggest that a reason next step might be to develop the best propos within each of these two broad class   we recommend focus on april                  of     option   as the best propos within a reserv mainten framework and option   as the best propos in a singl day system   what would be the next step  see page       first  we would need to identifi workabl system of voluntari target for reserv need for either option   or option     this would includ set clear object for the aggreg size and the distribut across depositori institut and how such a system would be appli to a heterogen bank system   second  we would need to critic assess the relat merit of mainten period versus daili clear band   in this context  we would need to determin the op  length of a reserv mainten period and the width of a clear band   third  we would have to defin the op  width of a rate corridor under both option   here we would have to understand the implic for rate dynam and the function of the market dure normal condit and dure  e of stress   final  we would need to assess whether the option were compat or could be made compat with other chang that we might implement  such as chang in our counterparti or in the type of collater we accept as part of our central bank oper   so what would be a possibl  elin between now and implement in octob        the  elin that i will discuss should be view as tentat and subject to revis in light of your comment and further discuss within the feder reserv system   turn to page     we would propos that most of the remaind of      be use for an extens studi of the option   in may       the staff would publish a white paper on possibl approach for public comment   in decemb  the staff would propos a specif approach to the board and to the fomc   continu on page     the first half of      would be spent fill in the detail  with the final propos publish for public comment in august        the rule implement the propos would be publish by the board in octob       the final two year would be spent prepar for octob      implement   on the last page  we outlin area in which we particular seek your guidanc  these includ the follow question   do you agre with our metric for evalu of the polici option   in particular  what are the appropri weight to place on the reduct in burden and distort versus the other criteria   which option should be studi further   are you comfort with our propos  elin   final  how do you view the interact of the interest on reserv project with other issu   for exampl  collater daylight overdraft   we would now like to open the floor for question and comment
well  let me first congratul and compliment the staff for a realli thorough piec of work  both the present and all the other peopl whom   mention  it is excel work  particular under veri tri circumst   i mention that in februari a workshop was held here at the board on monetari polici implement  which brought togeth april                  of     peopl from major central bank around the world   so there has been a veri  veri serious attempt to evalu other    experi   thank you veri much for all of that   whi don   t we take some question first  if there are ani   then anyon who would like to make comment can do so   ani question   presid hoenig  do you have a question  sir
yes   option    sn   t seem to be one of your recommend  and yet it is someth that basic peopl know how to do   the idea is to elimin the pack so that you have the system alreadi in place   it   s simpl  you can learn from it   whi wouldn   t that be one of the option you   d pursu   i don   t have ani real opposit to option    but i was just curious becaus the transit seem so simpl with option     that is the question
presid hoenig  i would say that we believ we alreadi have a fair good sens as to how pay interest on the requir reserv balanc and on excess reserv would work  at least qualit   we do think it would be an accept mean of implement monetari polici   as jim note  it probabl wouldn   t be all that differ in term of monetari polici effect from the way thing work now   of cours  as we also emphas  the current system of reserv requir has a lot of problem   admit  pay interest on requir reserv balanc in some sens solv the first order problem  but there are lot of cost associ with the system of reserv requir that we   ve discuss  and we think that those may warrant serious consider of elimin reserv requir   but to be clear  we   re not suggest that we rule out option   at this stage   we could certain view it as a fallback posit  for instanc
i   d like to understand this issu in term of the voluntari target   how are they decid on these   clear a big part of the issu is whether or not they choos you   i was just complet confus about what their consider in choos these number would be and what april                  of     implic that would have   now  there is experi for that one case   i   m sure you have view on this  but it   s sort of the black box in this propos  and it   s a realli import part of it  the second question regard the corridor approach   i do not think it is a good model for us becaus the countri that use it have veri few bank   the issu of use the central bank as a financi intermediari is less of a problem for them becaus there are fewer guy that they have to look at  and we have to look at a zillion peopl   but is it true that they have high volatil   i   m not sure   i just would like to know the fact  but as i say  i don   t think it   s critic   i don   t think the experi there  even if it work well  realli   tell us that we should do someth here
mayb i could just take the second question  and spenc or jim may want to take the first   on the corridor approach  for other countri that are use it   i   m think of the bank of canada in particular here   their institut set up allow them extrem precis control over the suppli of reserv   also the demand for reserv   i   m talk about reserv balanc   is consider less uncertain than in the unit state   part of it come from the fact that they have onli a hand of larg bank
it is five or six bank  right
so the communic with bank regard their reserv manag is extrem simpl compar with what we could expect here in the unit state
the determin of voluntari target  as spenc mention  is a realli big issu that we   d have to studi much further   at least in the context of the simpl model  bank will face some probabl of an overdraft charg if they are oper with veri low balanc  so they might have an incent to set up a voluntari requir on which they receiv remuner   on the other hand  they may not view even fulli remuner balanc as an especi attract asset  so there might be some balanc between the desir to hold larg enough requir to stay april                  of     away from overdraft and the idea of have balanc or asset book that aren   t particular high earn   but this is a major uncertainti for these type of model
the bank of england has use a procedur like this   what has been their experi   again  it may not be complet compar
well  for the bank of england  the way the voluntari target rule are set is realli veri simpl   the bank choos it own voluntari target   it can   t be below zero  of cours  but they have a cap   it can   t be ani higher than a certain amount  and i think it   s   percent of some measur of their liabil on their balanc sheet   they were extrem worri   they had no idea what they were go to get   their experi was encourag in that they got an aggreg level and a distribut that have brilliant facilit their control over their interbank market   but it is sort of take a leap to go into that system  although we have some experi with our clear balanc program   we do see how bank adjust their particip with reserv manag object in mind   in our case  becaus there are practic limit   ceil on the size of a clear balanc that make sens for ani bank to have   we don   t realli have a direct observ of what we would get if it were entir voluntari   the evid that i see from our experi of clear balanc and from the bank of england is encourag that we would get  even with a veri simpli design set of voluntari target  a good aggreg level and distribut of voluntari target   but right now  base on what we know  it is an uncertainti
the big risk would be if the voluntari balanc were realli low
so let   s say that actual happen  that they were zero   then what   let   s say we implement this and they came out at zero   what are our option
you   d have to chang the incent somehow
right  and that would be the answer
but you could   you could rais the cost of daylight overdraft
right   you could rais the cost of daylight overdraft  or you could adjust the interest rate that you pay on reserv to get it right   that could solv the problem
as long as you have enough paramet that you can adjust to chang the incent  you   re probabl go to be okay in that environ   but if you have a system in which there aren   t ani paramet that you can actual move  then you have a real problem
but in the context of the law  we would have the abil to adjust these paramet
governor    to state the obvious  we   d want to avoid that situat complet   we want prepar and consult with bank ex ant as to how they would react under various subparameter
okay   thank you
as   note  we alreadi have    billion in requir clear balanc with a rate of remuner that   s onli    percent of the t bill rate   so in all likelihood  we would have a posit number   how larg that number would be is the question mark
i have a comment  not a question
thank you   this repres a onc in a generat opportun to reengin our monetari polici oper framework  and i think it   s import that we do our best to get it right   i want to start by applaud the staff for take a veri deliber  veri thought approach to this project   i was abl to attend the workshop on foreign central bank    oper   i found it veri illumin  instruct  well organ  and well thought out   so far april                  of     the work has been well organ  and the broad base involv has been veri good   i want to compliment you on sift down   the combinator must have been mind boggl given the number of free paramet in the design of one of these scheme   i want to applaud you for boil it down to a good  repres set that span everyth that i think we   d want to consid   what you produc   with one slight except that i   ll talk about in a bit   is a veri thorough and care analysi  in richmond  we have thought about the issu of interest on reserv for mani  mani year   even befor the congress consid it   toward the end  i   m go to argu that option   deserv serious consider  and i   d like to see you focus on that as well as the other option go forward   befor i do  though  i want to comment briefli on the object   you ask for feedback on this   in particular  i think object   need to be interpret veri care   the report often seem to interpret object   as impli that anyth that reduc the amount of lend in the fed fund market must reduc financi market effici   i just don   t think that   s right  the prohibit of interest on reserv is obvious a tax on reserv hold   you have focus on the tax that it impli on reserv liabil  but the fact that we also don   t pay interest on excess reserv is a tax on excess reserv hold   if we elimin reserv requir and we still don   t pay interest on reserv  we   ll still be tax reserv hold   that give rise to ineffici for the same reason that the lack of interest on currenc give rise to ineffici  and so in this set  obvious bank do a lot of thing to avoid the reserv tax   some of the measur involv a lot of monitor of the reserv account  monitor of the prospect payment flow  and make sure that they can predict where they   re go to be at the end of the day  but some of the measur undoubt involv some transact   such as fed fund loan  purchas of treasuri secur  repo lend  and the like   that are aim at minim their non april                  of     interest earn balanc   such transact are exact analog to the classic shoe leather cost of inflat   addit transact that are induc by the tax on currenc are a wast   reduc the inflat tax result in fewer trip to the bank or to the atm to get money out  and that reduct is a good thing  not a bad thing   it would be a benefit  and that is exact what it mean to reduc the dead weight burden of inflat   similar  i think that pay interest on excess reserv will reduc transact volum in the fed fund market  but we should count that as a benefit  not a cost  put more general  the effect of a market isn   t the same as the quantiti of transact  i bring this up becaus one of the main object to option    at least in the report   it didn   t appear in the slide   is that it could reduc fed fund market lend   i think it should be obvious at this point whi that wouldn   t necessarili be a bad thing   it   s sort of like say that reduc inflat would be a bad thing becaus peopl would make fewer trip to the bank   i don   t think you   d say that  even if we believ that fed fund volum is import  i think a quick look at the number would suggest that it   s not like to be that big a problem   the staff es  that the fed fund market is about      billion  on averag   so how much by way of reserv will we need to add to ensur a neglig chanc that our autonom reserv factor drain reserv enough to drive the fund rate up   you show a graph  and there was a flat spot  and you had suppli way  way  way out on the curv   but it  sn   t need to go out that far   it just need to go out so that you   d know that you   re not go to accident go in on the upward part   my read of your intermeet report is that reserv miss are typic on the order of    billion or    billion   i think the averag absolut valu is about      million   two is pretti rare   it happen everi now and then   so it seem as though    billion would do plenti   the report say that     billion would be how much reserv you   d need to add   i   m a littl curious about where that number came from   it   s hard for april                  of     me to believ we   d need that much   but certain more broad than that  if you think about the market  is that right now      billion in lend is go on   if you do the thought experi about current equilibrium and you are a bank that just walk into the market and need some reserv  will it be hard to get reserv   well  you   re go to run into      billion worth from bank that are alreadi lend their reserv with interest   so if you   re go to get your loan  you   re go to have to pay a competit rate and shake loos some money from one of them   if we are pay interest on     billion in reserv  will that chang that calculus much   i don   t think so   i think that your market are still go to work the same way   if you want reserv  you   re go to have to pay a competit rate for them   if you   re not get reserv at that rate  you   re go to bid up until you get them   so i just don   t quit get this concern about the volum of transact in the fund market  a relat object is the issu of hoard   the idea that one bank might decid to hold a whole bunch of reserv   the staff cite the exampl of new zealand   i thought that was a realli interest discuss at the workshop   one bank accumul    billion or    billion in reserv  i think it was  which was larg for them  and they had to add a larg amount of reserv to accommod that demand plus the demand of other bank in the system   now  the problem for the bank of new zealand is  as i understand it  that the govern  sn   t issu debt   when they have to issu deposit  they have to acquir foreign exchang reserv  and that involv a fiscal risk that they   re reluct to take on   my sens of the convers is that they don   t like to accumul foreign exchang reserv   we seem to be quit will to expand our balanc sheet   plus  there are plenti of govern secur around   so i just don   t see whi it would be a problem for us if reserv demand was unexpect high or some bank decid to hold     billion in reserv  april                  of     i want to talk about one more thing  which is the issu of the rate   the way you have written it up is that what we target now is the averag rate of broker deposit   you said it was     billion to      billion out of      billion  on averag   so less than half the market   just the weight averag of trade dure the day that go through broker channel   that  sn   t includ direct credit fund   the approach you envis is that we tri to set a remuner rate so that the effect rate  that averag  come out at the target rate that the committe set   a veri natur altern  it seem to me   and i think this is the way the bank of england   it   is that our polici rate is now the deposit rate   when we issu a press releas  we say we   re chang the polici rate   i don   t know whether or not we would renam it  now  you folk es  that the risk premium that would  on averag  be the gap between this deposit rate and this effect fed fund rate you measur might be    basi point   we now set the fund rate target in   point increment   in theori  we could set our polici rate    basi point below   point increment   that seem a littl bizarr   i   m not sure that we have such precis confid in the op  fund rate that we   d know that it should be on the   point and not    basi point below or abov   it strike me that a natur version of option   or ani of these option would be to set the remuner rate at   point increment and have that be the polici rate  and just make that the refer point for how we do   admit  econometrician would have to do a lot of work in the futur to splice these seri togeth  but i think that   s a workabl altern we ought to think about  i think that option   has some obvious benefit over the other option   intuit  if you were given a limit budget and were ask to peg the price of a commod   minim the varianc of a commod price around a given target   your natur inclin would be to stand readi to buy and sell that commod at the target price   that would be  right out of the box  the april                  of     first thing everi economist would say   option   is the closest practic analogu to that   it   s clean  it   s simpl   i think it   s emin workabl   i just don   t see the forc of the object   in comparison  option    which is the one that come closest to option    involv the monitor of voluntari target   you have to monitor these band   you have to check the balanc everi night against the band   it just seem like a lot of superflu machineri  option   would go furthest toward reduc our depend on forecast uncertain autonom factor   it would also go furthest toward solv the problem that the primari dealer credit facil has given rise to  which has been particular acut in the last intermeet period  which is that rate are firm   you   ve done a pretti good job with the averag daili rate  but it crash at the end of everi day   more than half the  e you look at the low for the day and it   s under   percent   it   s like    percent   so we have a chronic intraday problem of rate be firm and then crash becaus you don   t know   primari dealer come in  that stuff goe on the market  and the rate crash  i think option   would also be the most transpar approach   it would be the easiest to explain to peopl   it would go furthest toward elimin the risk of the downsid target miss and concern about stealth eas   option   would also facilit long run move toward lesser line of daylight central bank credit  and i think that   s an import consider   it shouldn   t be the decid consider  but it is import   in term of the  elin  you have yourselv focus on two option befor the result of the public comment come in   to some extent that   s prejudg where the public comment is go to come in   so  in short  option   strike me as the most straightforward and practic way to do it  and i   d urg that we direct the group  which has done great work so far  to focus on option   and to keep it as a live option   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   just a procedur question   you kind of segu into the posit     anyon have a short question of fact   governor kohn
i actual have a coupl of question rather than posit   one is a bit more about what we   ve learn in this period of stress   for exampl  on page     you list a bunch of bank that don   t seem to have taken advantag of primari credit   i assum that you have talk to them  and i wonder how they had ration their concern about stigma and what they said about that   along similar line about stress  and follow up on governor     s question  how did the u k  system work in this period of stress   my impress is that they had problem   initi the bank want to increas their voluntari target and that requir the bank of england to be a littl more flexibl than it start out to be   i   d be interest in how option   behav under stress and then ani new insight you have about bank behavior in this period that produc the oscil that we saw  a second point is that    scott  and i have been talk about ask the congress to allow us to pay interest on reserv sooner rather than later   are we pursu that   if we got that author  i assum that it would not involv implement this over four year but that we could implement someth in one or two week  in the mainten period after we got that author  how would you go about that   what are you think in that regard   i think i   ll stop there
if i may start with the last question  we can work our way up or around the list   on pursu legisl author  the feder reserv is interest in acceler that author   we have had some convers with congression staff about this   for instanc  the staff of senat minor leader mcconnel has ask us recent whether we   d be interest in legisl to acceler the author   of cours  we respond enthusiast   we did say to them that it would be help if it were clear that we could use that author in such a way as to be april                  of     abl to pay interest on excess reserv or  rather  to buy feder fund as a way of pay interest on excess reserv  in effect   buy feder fund when the rate is fall would help us put a floor under the fund rate   so we would want to be sure   perhap scott want to comment on this   that the legisl clear permit that   presum we would be abl to use that author fair quick at an oper level   bill or spenc may want to comment on this  pay interest on requir reserv balanc is  of cours  a whole other matter   that involv complic system  and we would simpli want to be sure that we made this clear to the congression staff  that it would take a longer  e befor we could implement that
we think we could implement it pretti quick   anoth benefit would be not just address the crash of the fund rate late in the day but also enabl us to actual expand our balanc sheet if need
just to clarifi  what are the implic for score
it   s pretti small if you just confin it to excess
my impress is  as bill said  that it is small and there may not even be posit cost if you confin it to excess   the issu of pay interest on requir reserv are possibl a littl more troublesom  but that may be view as a worthwhil cost to undertak at this point
let me interject   if there   s a sens of the committe that this is someth we should escal  let   s move it up the ladder and do that   but anyon who want to comment on that dure the go around  pleas feel free   there was a second part about the unit kingdom  i believ
with respect to the u k  system dure the period of turmoil  bank    initi reaction was to lower their reserv deposit  their contractu commit   but they came to their sens and realiz that hold more rather than less was a more sensibl approach  and the bank of england accommod the bank    desir both to increas their target and to widen the band
pretti dramat  in fact
quit dramat  to avoid the end of period spike in rate   in term of rate volatil  the bank of england  the ecb  and the fed all achiev about the same rate volatil dure the period of market turmoil   for the bank of england  the spike just tend to be more on the upsid than the downsid  but that had to do with their implement procedur and not get to the end of the period and be will to accommod
i assum it was the stigma problem as well
though they had a few trade abov their lend rate  in fact that was not much of a problem   their system work quit well   interest  the countri with the smallest rate volatil dure the whole period of market turmoil was canada  and that   s becaus they knew the demand for balanc at the end of everi day and could adjust the suppli by adjust the govern balanc at the end of everi day   so they hit it basic everi day
other short question   presid
a veri short question have noth to do with what everybodi els has ask about   but go back to page     what are the govern issu  and how do you resolv them  in    second or less    laughter
well  the govern issu are that the fomc is in charg of open market oper and set the target for the feder fund rate  at least under current approach to polici   the legisl specifi that the board is in charg of set the rate paid on balanc to april                  of     institut   for instanc  there may be differenti rate as in option   on requir reserv balanc and excess reserv balanc   presum  if we went with option    for instanc  one approach would be to simpli set them by formula relat to the target feder fund rate   we don   t mean to say that this is like to be an enorm larg issu  at least in some of the option  but it ought to be handl care
presid  n
my question is about intraday and day to day volatil in the fund rate   i would think that as long as we hit the target on averag  that kind of volatil wouldn   t have ani signific macroeconom consequ   so whi would we care
that   s our impress  that it  sn   t have macro consequ   mayb it   s a tempest in a teapot  but for the particip in that market  the uncertainti and the cost that are born by borrow and lender are an import issu   but the macro fallout  the effect on longer term rate   sn   t seem to be signific
what we don   t know is whether that volatil somehow has consequ for term fund   how do you know the linkag between the two becaus they   re happen sort of simultan   but i agre with spenc that we don   t think there   s ani signific macro effect  there may be some margin effect of volatil creat a greater risk premium in the market  but it   s hard to say
there is an effect on swap  like foreign exchang swap  right
well  for a lot of what we seem to get   like the eurodollar rate and libor and foreign exchang swap and the way they relat to what goe on in our overnight fund market   the typic intraday pattern is firm in the morn and come off late in the day   those april                  of     higher morn rate are the one that are link to the other rate   eurodollar  swap   and so it   s not the averag rate over  e that seem to get price into these other vehicl
the high morn rate could conceiv affect other rate in a way that   s
it sound like an obvious arbitrag opportun
well  we   re not see much arbitrag
we are find a great reluct to do intraday arbitrag   we   re hear this from the bank that in the past would do that from  e to  e   come back to one of the other question that don had about what we are hear about stigma from some of the bank  one of our better contact  citibank  as jim mention  use to do a lot of arbitrag and use the discount window  the primari credit facil   on occas  after they borrow to re lend in the market at a higher rate last year or so ago  they would call us in the morn to let us know how it was that they were help us out with the fund rate   that has pretti much stop cold  and they have decid on sort of classic stigma   they routin point to the public of borrow data in the h     releas  and they are just not interest in the small gain from that kind of activ while take the risk in the market of be seen as in dire need of liquid
the taf auction result underscor the idea of stigma at the primari credit facil   it   s possibl that we have actual a bit more stigma now than we did befor becaus you can just see veri clear that there would have to be stigma for peopl to be bid that much in the taf auction
presid   had a two hander
my primari comment in all of this is relat to what presid  n  i think  said   the way  the object are word here is    enhanc monetari polici implement     and april                  of     the memo is word more like     how do we get our feder fund rate target effect     or someth like that   but there is realli no discuss that i could find about the transmiss of our polici action to the economi and to inflat   under our current regim  we think  quit confid  that the short term feder fund rate price short term risk free asset along the yield curv all the way up to the treasuri and then corpor are price off all of that   i associ that with marvin goodfriend  who taught me that quit some  e ago   it   s not money  it   s not liquid  it   s not the reserv per se   it would be nice if  for each altern  there were some discuss that we are preserv our understand of the polici transmiss mechan or that we are enhanc it or whatev   presid   mention the bank of england   mayb we could set the polici rate as they do   the question is  what will the market do in term of activ arbitrag someth that help price these secur   this may not be an issu for mani of these system  but until there   s some kind of analysi  i   m not so sure   it   s not just averag over the mainten period  and i think that analysi would be use
governor kohn shameless stole my question    laughter
governor    do you have a question
yes   in a lot of the discuss you just take as given the stigma associ with the primari credit facil  and you were just discuss that relat to the public of inform about the facil   is that someth that could also be on the tabl   that seem to be potenti an instrument for which we might have to consid how much inform to provid or about make it less or more attract  which then would affect which option are more or less attract   is there some reason not to do that
i think that   s worth some further thought  governor     one issu though  as i   m sure you know  is that the board is requir by law to publish week inform on the individu bank    balanc sheet as well as the consolid balanc sheet with a certain amount of detail   i don   t rememb the exact legal word  but at least within the current law  to back away from that might be difficult   of cours  you could conceiv pursu a chang in the law  but i think we would want to think about the pros and con of that befor you went in that direct
for sure  but just think about whether there are other thing that we could do relat to stigma might be worthwhil in this context
absolut  we agre   of cours  when the board adopt the primari credit program in       we gave a lot of thought befor that and did consider work after that to tri to minim the amount of stigma by tri to make veri clear to bank that in our view use of the window didn   t entail stigma   but the fundament problem still is that bank are concern that their use of the window may be detect in the market one way or anoth  especi in a period of financi stress  and that is just not a cost worth incur
presid    did you have a question
yes  just an implement question   one thing you talk about was in period of stress  the way we   ve conduct polici intraday  you have had firm in the fund rate in the morn and then weak in the afternoon caus some intraday volatil   the difficulti of hit the target was part the fact that we were enter the market onli onc a day  in the morn  and you had to see through that   with all these other strategi  as they are implement in other countri  are the central bank do the same thing   are they enter the market onli onc a day  or do they come in sever  e a day   i just wonder if there are differ in their approach as to how often they interact in the marketplac
i would say  as a general character  that the common practic is to interven onli onc a day  in the morn   not unlik what we do   where there   s an except  it   s like with the bank of canada   they have access to inform that would allow them to know with precis late in the day what the suppli of reserv is in the absenc of ani further open market oper  and then they make an adjust accord  the fact is that  even if we were to oper late in the day but still befor the close   let   s say       or        we realli have no more inform than we had at      in the morn upon which to make an es  of that day   s reserv suppli   we can observ rate  but we don   t know what amount of a reserv adjust would be need to bring suppli in line with demand   the risk of just open up and offer to be one side or the other of the market in that situat late in the day is that we could get the entireti of one side of the market and actual creat a reserv imbal in the other direct between that  e and the close of the day   so simpli be will to oper late in the day isn   t realli enough   you do need reserv inform as well upon which to size those oper
just to make this clear  spenc  is it the number of bank that make that inform more access in canada  or is it someth els   is it fundament that they have just five bank
no  it is that they know the balanc sheet   they know it by late in the day with certainti   they have few sourc of uncertainti to begin with  and their major sourc of uncertainti  govern balanc  is someth that perhap the small number of bank they   re deal with facilit   but it is that they know by late in the day what the suppli of reserv will be with real precis
basic everyth clear through their equival of fedwir  so they know in real  e what the balanc are
okay   did you have a question
a comment about stigma   everi financi transact that a substant firm engag in that becom known is reli upon by market particip to make infer  there   s a huge literatur on the effect on equiti valu of the announc of a bank line of credit  and like through this last crisi  if you talk to fund desk guy  they   re veri awar at the tactic level about what counterparti are reveal by their action in fund market   they take that on board  and they   re veri strateg about what they reveal with their market transact   we can tri to keep it secret  but there   s a broad abil in the market to infer when somebodi goe to the window by their behavior befor that   i   m say that i don   t think we should get our hope up about ever elimin stigma
okay   let   s take posit and comment  keep in mind that lunch is be held hostag    laughter   presid
okay   just a quick question  which  sn   t have to be answer now   given all of the financi turmoil  it would be interest to see whether in other countri that have these differ arrang there was a decreas in either overnight or term lend with counterparti   given the extent to which you can just work with a central bank rather than counterparti  is there ani evid in these other regim that interbank lend transact volum disappear in some of these countri   i would be interest in see that   regard governor     s comment on the h     releas  it   seem that we could probabl have a materi requir in our balanc sheet   under most circumst  what we are do at the discount window would seem not to hit that materi criterion   i think we could be a littl april                  of     more innov   i agre with presid     s point   but i think that the h       seem to have an effect  and if we will be do all these other thing  take anoth look at the h     and make sure that we don   t have more untap flexibl probabl make a lot of sens  i would like a littl more discuss of    promot effici and resili money market and govern secur market    as a criterion   i   m not sure i would weight those criteria equal   it seem that all these criteria  for the most part  take care of most of the dead weight loss  and given that the bank still have to administr for daylight credit  i am not sure that the burden is all that differ across these various regim   but i can imagin that that one might be differ  and given we just had financi turmoil   i know this is a bit differ from what presid   said   i would put a littl more attent to that  overal  i like option   and option     i   m comfort with those two   i   m attract to the voluntari balanc program   on net  i would probabl prefer a longer mainten period to a one day mainten period  but i don   t have a strong prefer and could easili be convinc otherwis
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i mention earlier  i would find some discuss about the transmiss mechan use   at what rate we think the market would be pick up the price of risk free yield curv   i think that would help   to the extent that we can align this with other foreign central bank experi  we might be abl to draw on how they view that and what the financi market data look like   so i am comfort with focus primarili on option   and     i was think along the line of presid hoenig  which is that the feder reserv tend to go slowli   vinc isn   t here  but he often remind us of that  april                  of     option   is the easiest one   if we have enough inform about it  then that   s fine   i think that   s all i have
presid  n
i have onli two comment   i would drop option     i just think it  sn   t do enough to reduc the burden and dead weight loss   as long as it   s there  there will be a tendenc to fall back to it for all sort of reason  given bureaucrat tendenc   so i would just discard it   i would not discard option    so i would includ option       and     i was origin attract to     i read the reserv in the report and thought  okay  it   s not worth pursu  but i listen to presid    and he reconvinc me that there are some signific merit there
thank you   first  i do realli appreci all the excel work the staff has done on this topic   i realli learn a lot from these paper   i thought they were veri clear and veri comprehens   i have just a coupl of comment on the question that bill and   rais in the memo   the first one has to do with whether or not we agre with the object  and i do have a coupl of issu  first  i think that the state object of reduc the burden and dead weight loss associ with the current reserv tax is too narrowli frame in the paper   my start point is  about burden  that to cover a given program of govern spend  the treasuri has to obtain revenu from some sourc  and nondistortionari lump sum tax are not one of the avail option   so the real question from the public financ standpoint is what to tax and how much  that mean  to my mind  that the issu here is how the magnitud of the welfar gain that would come from lower the dead weight loss due to the implicit tax on reserv compar with april                  of     addit dead weight loss that would result from the altern tax that would have to be rais to make up for this lost revenu   now the answer depend in part on the interest elast of demand for reserv  i believ   i think it is the case that  if the interest elast is relat small  the dead weight loss from the reserv tax is relat small  and the net welfar gain  take into account the burden of rais other tax to make up for the lost seigniorag  in effect  could easili turn out to be negat  let me give you an exampl of where this come into play   there is a well known paper by martin feldstein in which he look at the benefit of move to price stabil  zero inflat  which he favor   he look at this issu in that context  and he conclud that there would be net social loss  not gain  from the reduct in seigniorag that would be associ with a move to zero inflat from posit inflat becaus the dead weight loss due to the shoe leather cost  also known as the bailey effect  is smaller than the dead weight loss that would be associ with altern tax   in his analysi they are tax on labor suppli and save   i actual think that this is a serious problem with the frame of the object in this paper   it is  in effect  say     we think we should give a tax cut   we think we should give it to bank  and we think that  becaus there is a welfar loss   a harberg triangl   associ with that  this is clear welfar gain      now  i am not pretend to know exact how this would come out  but i do think that   s the issu   if it were to come out that this is a net loss  not a gain  a possibl implic is that if there were a fallback to option     i   m not say that i favor option     there could be a case for pay no interest on requir reserv rather than pay interest at the feder fund rate but pay interest on excess reserv at some rate that we would determin  april                  of     there are administr cost with have voluntari target balanc  and it seem to me that the paper  as we come out with it  ought to tri to at least es  what the administr burden associ with option   and   would be  anoth comment on the issu of object   if we are come out with a white paper  it seem to me that the object that everybodi is now discuss and that was just discuss   name  that pay interest on reserv would enabl us to expand the size of our balanc sheet in  e of financi crisi  like now  and perhap great enhanc the scope for liquid alter intervent that would be possibl without have to push the feder fund rate to zero   is a real improv in the tool kit that is avail to us to address market disrupt   i would see it as an advantag of pay interest on reserv   if you are discuss this right now with the congress and it is much discuss in the press  i think it is kind of odd to come out with a paper that  sn   t even mention it   mayb there are disadvantag and not just advantag   but it seem to me it should be there  also  i would just say on the question of option   and   versus option   and    an advantag that the paper attach to have voluntari target is the abil to moder the volatil in the feder fund rate   so it   seem to me that   i understand it may be difficult   the possibl of interven multipl  e dure the day as an altern  if it were possibl to chang the procedur so that there could be multipl intervent to reduc volatil  would mean that   and   could be on the tabl  and there might be less burden associ with those   so i think that possibl deserv at least care consider
thank you   presid bullard
thank you  mr  chairman   this is a propos for studi   the  elin seem fine to me   the studi period is pretti import in this case becaus it is not clear to me april                  of     which option is best  and so i think mayb we should keep more of the option on the tabl   one question that i have is  to what extent are current reserv requir actual bind for depositori institut   there is a past studi by the st  loui staff   dick anderson and bob rasch   suggest that  by and larg  exist reserv requir are not bind   to me that call into question whether object   for this studi group is realli appropri   dead weight loss make sens to me onli if there is a bind reserv requir   in that regard  i   d like to endors presid     s comment  which i thought was right on target  about whether you are go to make up for lost revenu from somewher els and how distortionari that would be   there is a bit of polit risk here that  if this start to get paint as a handout to bank  mayb it wouldn   t serv us well  i would like to see more emphasi on option    which base on the discuss seem to be not too bad a system   that is the canadian system   that is a test system in an economi that is not too differ from our own   certain  an economi that is close integr with this one  the corridor would be narrow   there might be more volatil within that corridor  but you still seem to get pretti good result   i know they have a small number of bank  but it seem to me with today   s technolog you might be abl to get a good read even for a larg economi   i would like to see it kept in the mix here   they have had lot of success and veri low administr burden  if that is what you are worri about   i am perhap not so familiar with option   and    which are the favor option in this discuss   but i am concern about the languag of voluntari balanc target  which seem to be mayb not that voluntari   it seem to me to creat a risk that the system are realli not as market orient as i would like to see or that they could be manipul by market particip  particular in a  e of stress   those are some of the concern i had about this
on the public financ question  of cours  the congress has act and they score it to cost   so in some sens that is moot from our perspect   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   let me also start by commend the author of the paper that were prepar on this topic   i found the materi veri inform and help   i agre with the object establish by the staff to evalu the set of propos  and i also support the process and the propos  elin for move the propos forward   i think it is good that the  elin provid for comment from bank so earli in the process   it will be import for us to receiv their input at an earli stage  i found option   to be prefer to option   becaus option    as we have discuss  clear reduc the administr burden relat to option     i think that option   leav too much potenti for fed fund rate volatil in it corridor   i was also intrigu by option   with cap   howev  i ul  reject option   out of the concern that it might lead to a less robust interbank lend market   but given the comment of presid   and other  perhap it make sens to keep option   on the tabl   in the end  howev  i am comfort with move forward with our focus on option   and     thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   just to answer the question that were pose  i am comfort with option   and    but i thought presid     s present made the case that option   deserv to remain in the mix   i think the object are appropri  the onli comment i have   and this is a bit vagu  i realiz   is to ensur that we are think far enough ahead to ensur that we have a durabl system that can oper in differ mix of privat and public in the payment system   certain  i think it is conceiv that in some year april                  of     we will be out of the busi of retail payment  so i think we have to address differ mix of privat and public payment system  regard the  elin  governor kohn alreadi ask the question about approach the congress to acceler   assum that we do not approach the congress to acceler this  then this  elin seem to me quit comfort and give plenti of  e for veri care consider  in the room here is will roberd from our research staff  who by chanc was at the bank of england talk about their experi recent   i thought i would share a coupl of thing that are apropo   they tri mainten period other than the intermeet period  and they found them to be not so effect  appar becaus of ambigu around the target rate   that is a use way of think   that the mainten period would be design around the intermeet period   they appar tri option    and it didn   t work becaus of too much volatil within the corridor   those two tidbit are feedback from the visit of a member of my staff to the bank of england   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i would look at this meet as an introduct to this topic  given the breadth of the discuss here  which i found extrem interest and use   i think we will need to come back to anoth discuss of it   not necessarili with anoth     page studi   i wouldn   t want to put that burden on you   it might negat ani save we get from this project    laughter  to the point of the option  the one that was most attract to me was option     it is a good transit   we have some familiar with it  given the way we do clear balanc now  and i think we can work on it   the reason that i was a littl question about option   is that in april                  of     option   you are not quit sure what you are go to end up with  given how the bank may choos to target the amount of reserv and so forth   but with ani choic we make  we are go to have to go up that learn curv   so of those  i prefer option     i am fascin  though  with presid     s comment on option   and will look at it again with that in mind becaus i thought he made some good point   but at the moment  i think option   is a pretti good path to go down
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   this will be veri brief   option   look veri attract to me   i think option   may be a fallback posit  but like presid  n  given our tendenc to move slow too quick  if that make sens  i would rather take the opportun to make a larger step   so i think option   is fine   option   is interest  but it distinct is that nobodi els is realli do that   so it would be a littl more of a wild card in term of how we might implement it and how it might work   but i think it has some merit  i had ask bill   back in the fall  when we were have troubl meet the end of day target  about whi we didn   t set the price   the answer i got was     well  this was a good  e to think about that option in the context of pay interest on reserv      i was probabl a littl disappoint that we didn   t see more of what such a strategi might look like and how it would behav   thank to presid    his interpret of option   is push us more in that direct   i hadn   t realli thought of option   in that context that way  but i like it   i still have the view that essenti look at everyth as a quantiti base view of how we go about do this restrict the way we think about what our option might be   so i would like to see a littl more explan of what a price target  where we buy and sell  might actual do   how that might interact with option   would be an interest way to enrich the set of option  april                  of     anoth question i had   and i don   t know the answer to this   is that we have institut a number of new facil   there is the taf  there is the tslf  and so forth   i wasn   t quit clear how those facil would interact or be appropri or inappropri within the context of these thing  or whether this would substitut for all of those in some sens   if we want to pull those off the shelf again at some futur  e  how would they interact with these system   i think it would be use to have a littl discuss about what those interact might be  the last observ is relat to presid     s comment   how we go about pay interest on reserv has implic for other part of what the feder reserv system     in particular the retail payment system and the way we calcul cost recoveri and our revenu under the monetari control act   there are some separ studi group that are think about this  but we ought to make sure that we tie these piec togeth as we go forward so that we know what the domino effect of go this direct might be   mayb there will not be a concern  if we get out of retail payment  how it affect the monetari control act requir on fee for servic and thing like that   i would like to see that loop close somehow befor the end of the discuss   otherwis  i want to congratul the staff on a veri thorough report   i was at the confer as well in februari   i thought it was veri interest  and i applaud the staff on some good work   thank you
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  we have been in favor of pay interest on reserv for some  e   this is an excel paper   like everybodi els  i learn a great deal from all the paper that were sent and this superb summari that was just present   i person tend toward option    but i think it is worthwhil consid option   and   as well in term of vet this under the  et   i think that   ask a good question about how this relat to the other april                  of     facil  but general  the optic on this are favor   again  we are move forward   the public  sn   t realli understand the background of this   where the congress has stood and what we have achiev so far   i think it would be just one other good thing for us to be modern the feder reserv  i ask the question on govern just becaus i understand that the current plan call for rate to adjust automat to chang in target set by the fomc   i would want to make sure that was the case   in other word  i don   t like the potenti for vest all the power in the board  and  of cours  that potenti is there   i think it is worth preserv the feder system of the feder reserv   that is the onli reserv i have   those are my comment   thank you  mr  chairman
we don   t want it    laughter   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought this was a great piec of work by the staff  and i thank them all   you did a good job of organ it and lay out the general principl in a way that peopl can understand   despit presid     s comment  i have no regret about my tes oni in favor of pay interest  perhap becaus i bore so much of the administr cost over the year  laughter    along with stephani martin and her predecessor in the legal divis   those cost that were born were consider  in addit to the dead weight loss  i think we should consid option   and   for sure   on option    i think we need to understand a bit   other peopl have said this   what the third object     promot effici and resili money market     mean exact  what is entail  and how that would intersect with option     so i think that need to be flesh out a littl more   becaus you have plan to get a white paper out soon  i think perhap includ option   would be easier than not includ it  april                  of     just to get peopl   s comment   perhap becaus of my administr burden experi  i would like to see reserv requir at zero  rule out option     on option    i just don   t think  at least with our system and in period of crisi  that the top of the band would hold  so i don   t think that option would realli work veri well   thank you all for your work
thank you  mr  chairman   let me add my plaudit to those alreadi express on the qualiti of this work  and then let me confin my comment to the  e and sequenc   first  with respect to the rollout of the white paper  it strike me that  given that question have been rais about what our flexibl is around our balanc sheet and tool in the event of continu problem in the financi market  we just need to be cogniz in that paper of how this discuss might be read  not in the context of a long fed effort to get interest on reserv but perhap as be sole respons to what are perceiv to be burden on our balanc sheet flexibl   i am just sensit to how that white paper will be read and roll out  more broad  on  e   come fall  in the event that we decid collect to go to the congress seek other author with respect to the pdcf  invest bank  and other thing that might or might not be conclud  even though this  elin make a lot of sens  we might be in good stead to have a fair good sens of the conclus to which we will ul  come  even if our exhaust fed rigor isn   t complet by that  e   if there is real benefit to acceler our new author from late      to some earlier period  we could put that in the context of some of broader ask from us with an expect that we might get some traction there   so as a sort of secondari  elin  have that option valu come fall strike me as use  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank   great work  great present   it is impress to get through fifti two page in less than fifti two minut  and so i applaud you on that   basic i agre with a lot of the stuff that has been said befor   the t  may be think a bit creativ about stigma issu  if there is ani way to deal with those   i am not quit sure what you are suggest put out in a white paper for comment   option       and possibl     or were you think of put all five out
well  i certain think at this point the three that you mention first  at this stage  if we are go to go to with three  we might want to think about put all five out  just to flesh out all part of the spectrum and acknowledg that option   could be a fallback  we have to think about the pros and con of that  but certain the three at this point is where the consensus seem to be
do three of them seem perfect reason   thank you
i am veri comfort with the analysi and the approach  so i don   t have ani major comment there   although in the white paper you might mention them  i would like to take option   and   off the tabl   option   has just too much administr burden   we have enough tsuri alreadi   although option   may work well in countri with veri differ structur of the bank system  i don   t think it is a feasibl altern for us   so i think that we should look at option   and    and i am certain comfort with anoth look at option    one issu that i worri about a bit is that these market do sort out some interbank credit risk issu   we don   t want to lose that  so we have to be veri awar of it   i also worri a bit about set a price when there is a credit risk element to it   when there is no credit risk april                  of     element   if you want to set the treasuri bill rate   it is no big deal   but there may be an issu there  i am not sure  and it should be one of the consider in this context   thank you
vice chairman   oh  sorri   presid
presum  the rate we pay would be view as a risk free rate  presum  ani market rate would be price relat to that to includ a credit premium in the usual way   if ani other dynam are anticip by the staff  it would be use to know that  but the usual presumpt we have is that observ market rate would have our rate plus a credit premium book into it  or transact cost  or whatev   i   d just make that comment
thank you  mr  chairman   i don   t have a convict yet on the option  but i agre that we should narrow our focus to option   and       i think we should design a process that tri to forc us to get convict more quick on which option we would prefer   i think it is possibl   you have made a huge invest alreadi   you know the altern   i think it is worth  again  a goal that get us convict more quick  in part becaus we do have a brief window now in which we might be abl to get the congress to acceler and we could implement more quick   i would get the congress to acceler if i could be total confid that it would be free  that we would pay no price  and that there would be no risk that anyth els would be on the tabl or that it would compromis ani other object   it is veri hard to have confid on that   but if you get confid on that  then i would go do it   but i would certain run a process by which we get convict earli  i would want us to have convict befor we go out for public comment   the general rule is to figur out what you want to do and design a process that maxim the chanc that you get there quick   it also strike me that a process this drawn out will take much more staff  e  april                  of     you guy are busi   we don   t have a lot of  e   we don   t have a lot of excess capit in the feder reserv system now relat to the challeng we face   the longer it is drawn out  mayb the smaller the tax day by day  week by week  but it is just a huge tax   i would not want to go out for public comment on a white paper in this  e frame until i knew two thing   one is  are we go to get the congress to acceler   if so  on what   what is the probabl   are we go to ask for it   the other is i wouldn   t do it until i knew that we were closer to say     if we got it  we would do this in this  e frame     final  i think it is hard to have this discuss in public with the congress now without an answer to what they will perceiv to be the larger question   what are the larger question   i think that you can reduc some of the larger question simpli to  what are we go to do with our role as lender of last resort go forward   this is a version of presid     s and governor     s question   what the futur of our facil is  in some sens   the staff has assur me that these option all preserv option on ani futur facil framework   they don   t prejudic those option  which is veri import   but i think there is a demand now and interest in what our answer is to those broader question   it is hard to see the architectur of our role as lender of last resort without have the answer to what the framework will be for restraint on risk take by institut that have access in normal  e and in extremi to those lender of last resort facil  we can   t get convict on that in the same  e frame that we need to acceler legisl on this stuff  but   and probabl becaus   i think those thing are fundament more import than whether we end up with   or     or   on the way to       i would tri to shorten the amount of  e and effort we put into this  and i would increas the amount of  e and effort we put into that broader set of polici question  which are go to be essenti april                  of     about the intersect among the lender of last resort role  our monetari polici regim  the moral hazard consequ of all the stuff we have done  and how we deal with those in the futur   i think that is go to take a lot of  e  effort  and care  i don   t know how to reconcil all of what i just said in the context of a practic path forward  except just to repeat it   whi not tri to run a process in which you get convict more quick on this relat small set of adjust as to how we oper   tri to get a judgment quick about whether we can get the congress to acceler without ani meaning polit cost  then design a process wherebi we put ourselv in the posit to implement earli next year  if the congress were to acceler   and tri to have the resourc save by attenu that process devot to these deeper question about our futur facil and the associ constraint we are go to have to put on a broader set of institut
thank you   on those broader question  vice chairman  we are go to talk at lunch about some initi by which we will address some of the broader regulatori and bank supervis issu   that process will be parallel to this   what i would say about this issu is that  as you go forward  you should keep in mind the possibl we might want to go to the congress for some kind of interim power   obvious  there are thing that we can do that are not the full panopli of thing you describ today   they would be interim step  and i think that the most import thing is to make sure that whatev we ask for would not be inconsist with or contradictori to some of the longer term plan   we obvious don   t anticip implement option   next year  but we could take some interim step that potenti might be use in the current circumst  veri briefli  i agre with presid   and presid     this is a onc in a generat chanc to modern our system   it is a relic that we use a quantiti base april                  of     manag of the feder fund rate   so i think option   should be a fallback if we can   t make someth els work  but we should tri veri hard to see if we can find a system that will let us manag the fund rate tight  even as our balanc sheet expand and contract  and so on   i have the same concern about option    that it might not tie down the fed fund rate veri much  option   and   are interest   i agre with presid   that option   is worth explor   i broach this with the staff befor the meet   option   seem a lot like friedman   s op um quantiti of money   you just throw out money until the transact cost on margin is zero  that   s basic what it is   i don   t  frank  fulli understand what the implic would be for the feder fund market   whether the feder fund market is just a shoe leather cost or whether it actual has some use function  includ price discoveri  credit risk manag  and counterparti disciplin   there may be some function of that market that are import  and even if it still exist  if it liquid were great reduc so that it wasn   t function in a normal way  it could be a question   to my mind  that is the main question we have to understand as we think about option     onc again  terrif work  and this is realli excit  interest stuff  so thank you all veri much   are there ani other comment on interest on reserv  okay   if not  let   s see   first  again  the project are due thursday at      p m   if anyon has chang  pleas make the effort to do that   we will be circul inform on the      fomc schedul to tri to come to closur on that   the next meet is tuesday and wednesday  june    and      in a moment  we will adjourn and get lunch  but pleas come back to the tabl so that we can have some discuss about some of our longer term issu on supervis and regul   thank you veri much   the meet is adjourn  end of meet april                  of
