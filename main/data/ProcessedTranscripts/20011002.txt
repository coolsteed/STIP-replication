th   despit the appar flush of market  even allow for higher demand for excess reserv  this was deceiv  the inset in the top panel show balanc  both borrow and nonborrow  for the entir bank system for the five day start on septemb   th   the   bar in the inset show the end of day balanc   which was have problem with it clear and settlement system   on septemb   th  the entir bank system held about     billion of reserv befor borrow  befor discount window borrow and overdraft   distribut of reserv continu to be a problem until the afternoon of the   th when began to make progress in clear it backlog of transact   by earli the follow week  we began to work down balanc as they start to be distribut more effici            the bottom panel depict the fed fund rate in the intermeet period   the   line is the target fed fund rate   the red dot mark the effect fed fund rate on each day  and the vertic line show the high low rang for each day   with four of the five major fund broker incapacit by the attack  bank larg trade direct with each other rather than through broker and they did so at the target of       percent in someth of a    gentlemen   s agreement     this pattern persist until late thursday  septemb   th  when the weight of reserv in the system first began to show through and the fund rate trade below it target   this pattern of low rate  especi in later trade  continu in the period after the fomc   s intermeet eas action on septemb   th  particular in light of the committe   s statement note that the fund rate might occasion trade below it target   by the   th the desk began to manag it oper with an eye toward restor a sens of normalci in the money market  which had begun to take rate below   percent and even   percent for grant   thus we began to nudg the market back toward the target   in do so the desk continu to balanc that object against the desir to respond to the financ need of dealer  but by that  e dealer were not experienc much troubl get their fund done through their normal sourc  on page    the top panel show three key autonom factor that affect reserv dure the period   the ground of air traffic creat an immedi spike in float to about     billion on septemb   th   the ecb   s three swap draw ad almost     billion at their peak   those two factor ad more than     billion of reserv on that day   meanwhil  a near doubl of the repo pool drain reserv   on balanc  these factor ad reserv dure the first few day of the crisi and thus reduc what might have been even more traffic at the discount window on sever day   by the week of septemb   th float declin and the foreign exchang swap matur but the repo pool remain elev  in part becaus of the larg number of fail in the secur market  and that was leav central bank with extra cash at the end of the day   there was also an appar desir for higher level of liquid  and in the case of japan   s ministri of financ the need to invest larg amount of intervent proceed  the middl panel depict the mix of overnight and term repurchas agreement use to manag reserv   we had no oper on septemb   th   at first we reli on overnight rps to add liquid and allow sever long term rps to matur without replac   when market start work better  we increas the level of long term rps to help meet under need            the bottom panel show for short term rps the level of accept proposit in red and the level of reject proposit in blue   normal  dealer submit a larg number of proposit of which we accept a relat small amount   for four busi day  from the   th through the   th  our oper were driven by the demand for financ rather than by reserv level associ with a given fund rate   to better meet these demand  we oper later in the day than normal  after dealer had an opportun to assess their financ need   then for a coupl of day  on septemb   th and   th  we accept virtual all dealer proposit on our overnight rps   this was done not so much direct to meet their demand but to provid the level of reserv that was need given that autonom factor  especi the repo pool  were drain reserv  after we arrang sever long term rps that settl on the   th  the volum of our short term rps declin and the volum of accept proposit was just a fraction of total proposit  turn to the last page  i want to give you a quick updat on our secur lend oper dure the intermeet period   on a normal day  the desk lend out a hand of secur from soma   normal total less than    billion and frequent less than      million   with the disrupt caus by the attack  not onli to the bank of new york but to sever major inter dealer broker and some larg dealer themselv  the number of fail rose dramat   with the flow of secur from usual sourc disrupt or scale back  demand for soma secur rose despit our rather high price structur   we lent out about     billion on septemb   th  repres    differ issu  and smaller though still high amount in the day follow   volum rose again last week in the run up to the quarter end and remain high ye day   fail began to rise last week for the         and    year on the run secur for reason that are not fulli clear   the dollar volum of our lend increas beyond     billion  although the number of issu was less than on the   th  again becaus the number of fail was concentr in the small number of on the run issu  i want to make one final observ   on septemb   th  the veri small volum of lend did not impli tranquil on that day  with the fund rate trade soft  the rate for general collater fell below   percent in the repo market   sinc the committe   s author permit us to lend secur at a minimum of   percent  the formula impli a negat financ rate   henc it was cheaper for dealer to fail and pay the near zero fail rate than to borrow from the desk  pay our higher price  and complet settlement   in review the secur lend facil in come month  one aspect that we plan to studi is the price structur   in a low interest rate           environ  the general collater rate could be suscept to occasion declin below   percent  thus make it difficult for our secur lend program to meet it object  mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper dure the period   i will need a vote to ratifi the domest oper and i   d be happi to take ani question
first  let me say that despit the tension you were under  you make it sound veri simpl   and i applaud both what you did and make it simpl   when will you get data on lend volum for octob  st
secur lend volum
we did a bit over     billion ye day
in other word  the volum was essenti unchang from septemb   th
that   s right   appar the volum of fail is still at a veri high level
but you still don   t know fulli whi that is occur
there are almost as mani explan as there are market particip   it is an issu that the market is struggl with  though   but they   re still
as a work hypothesi  assum they   re all correct    laughter   further question for dino
i   d like to move the ratif of the oper   but i would also suggest that the committe add to that a sens of gratitud to those at the desk for the way they handl such a veri  veri complic and difficult situat   and  of           cours  the desk itself was work in difficult circumst with the reloc of it offic and all the upset that involv   so i think it was a fantast perform and i believ the committe should reflect that view in it vote to ratifi the desk oper
i   m sure your suggest will meet with no object from your fomc colleagu   further question   yes  presid jordan
thank you  mr  chairman   i also thought that the desk perform extraordinarili   no matter what kind of conting scenario one might have envis  this was way beyond what anyon would have imagin   so the desk   s perform realli was remark  i was studi chart       and    especi in light of the fomc   s statement that the fund rate might trade below it target for a while  which you mention  dino  it is clear evid on chart   that for four trade day you did let that happen   but i can interpret the chart as say that after about four day you pretti much return to oper in the way you normal do on a daili basi  let the fund rate be both a floor and a ceil   part of my question is   is that a fair character   also  i   d like to ask you to say a littl more about the way you conduct daili oper in term of factor suppli and absorb reserv   what led you to the conclus that it would not continu to be appropri to allow the fund rate to trade below it target   the reason i rais that is becaus in period of heighten anxieti  liquid prefer  risk avers  or other character of these reaction we can   t realli observ  it would be veri hard to know where an equilibrium is   the question realli is   how comfort were you in start to view the target fund rate as a floor in that environ
in answer  let me tri to packag those question togeth   i don   t think we view the target fund rate as a floor   what we were tri to do was return to some sens of normalci in the function of the market   the low rate itself was creat problem   there were problem for investor   for exampl  money market fund had troubl invest money  there were complaint from investor who could not get bank to take their money   these and other problem were be creat by the veri low fund rate and those issu had to be consid   what we also tri to do was to leav the market with enough liquid  but there was a sens that if the rate remain too low for too long  some of these unintend advers affect would continu  if you look at the bottom of page    you can see that for sever day beyond septemb   th we were basic accept all the proposit that the dealer were give us   we were tri to respond to the financ demand from the dealer   and even in the subsequ period  onc we got past the   th and   th or so  there were day when we tri to respond to the financ need of the dealer even though it wasn   t necessari for reserv purpos   one of the way we did that was by have the treasuri increas it balanc   that way we could respond by provid the dealer with more financ than might have been dictat by the number   so my messag is that we realli did not view the fund target as a floor   a lot of the trade was below the target rate but there were day  especi in the morn  when the rate was firm   that often reflect effort by european bank in particular to get their financ done earli in the day   so we got a pattern with the rate firm in earli day activ and lower in reduc trade at the end of the day  i don   t know if i answer your question
well  that was help   the reason i   m rais the issu is that intuit i think one thing that should not be allow to happen is for the stock of central bank liquid to declin inadvert becaus of oper procedur   so i was judgment struggl with the data in the board   s h    releas for the week end last wednesday versus the week end septemb  th  the week befor the crisi  i don   t know what the season factor were do dure that period  i can guess  though i don   t know for sure  but to see the monetari base actual lower for the week end last wednesday than it was the week end septemb  th alarm me a bit   i question whether that is someth i would want to see happen   if heighten anxieti among other factor caus the natur equilibrium level to be veri low  though i don   t know where that level is  i don   t think we would want to see our oper procedur result in the contract of central bank liquid
actual  i think a larg part of the reason central bank liquid contract come through in dino   s inset at the top of page    name that intermedi wasn   t function when four out of the five feder fund broker were out of servic   as the fed fund market becam oper and those with insuffici posit could get their reserv from those with excess reserv  there wasn   t a need for us to blow up our balanc sheet to replac the unavail intermedi   so i interpret the reduct in nonborrow reserv and the declin in the desk   s open market oper as evid of a return of the feder fund market to more normal function
yes  i think that   s an import point   a larg part of that market was in effect bottl up
yes  and i can understand liquid come down from the elev level immedi after the attack   but i was compar the recent figur with those in the week befor the attack  the week end septemb  th   that week may have been atyp becaus it includ the labor day weekend  i can   t readili make a judgment on that   but i was look at this in term of want to be comfort with our posit go forward   we don   t know what   s go to happen or what the next terrorist event is go to be  but we can expect heighten anxieti  a prefer for liquid  and risk avers   those are all psycholog factor that we realli can   t quantifi   and we wouldn   t want those thing to caus us inadvert to produc less central bank liquid than we think is appropri   intuit i think the demand for central bank liquid has had to go up  so i am concern to see this contract in suppli
the other issu we were face earli in the week after the   th was that  as a symptom that the financ market were oper much more effici  the liquid we had provid previous was begin to have a veri tell effect on financ rate and the fund rate   so when we were come into the market in the morn  on some of those oper we were receiv proposit of below   percent  we continu to accept them for a while  but there was no sens of balanc in the financ market by the   th or   th  no sens that there was ani upsid risk to rate  and given the liquid we had put in previous  market particip were realli test how low rate could go   there is no natur floor abov zero   we did conscious reduc the amount we were suppli at the margin so that at least at the end of the day market particip would see that there was some risk of rate go up   we saw a littl            evid of that risk later in the week when in late trade rate reach as high as   or   percent   sinc we restor that balanc to market expect  though  we have been suppli somewhat higher level of central bank balanc
i   d like to add just one other point   in establish a refer point  presid jordan  you might want to go back one or two week from septemb  th   reserv are veri errat on a week to week basi and it look as if from a week standpoint your base point is a littl low relat to the previous two or three week
if i could make a comment  mr  chairman    presid jordan   s concern  as i understand it  is that there not be some sort of central bank orthodoxi that say that the fund rate target has to be put back in place at a  e when it would be inappropri   dino in both his present and in his answer to one of the question indic that he was be guid by the desir for a return to normalci   that was our mantra at the feder reserv bank of new york   we were deal with a financi communiti in which there was an advanc degre of trauma on the part of peopl at trade desk and those manag firm   and there was a veri strong convict in the communiti that the feder reserv system and the new york reserv bank as it agent were go to do whatev was necessari to make the system function   part of get through a battl fatigu period is that it is necessari to return life to normal   so the desk was under instruct that when it could conduct oper in the way it normal    it should do so  becaus that give a signal to the financi            communiti that life is okay again   and traumat peopl need that signal   in my view it   s a veri import messag that the fed must continu to deliv becaus the trauma period is not over   some of the firm are still oper out of temporari facil and will do so for month   some have suffer enorm human loss   in the case of cantor fitzgerald  two third of the peopl in the firm lost their live on septemb   th  so this is not a situat where everybodi will soon start to feel tranquil and okay  that won   t happen for quit a long period of  e   the more the feder reserv can say thing are all right  we   re function as we tradit do  the better   that   s a veri import messag to give
just to switch the subject a bit  dino  you pass over the chang in the yield curv rather quick   i   m interest in your percept of what the market is think about the shape of the yield curv these day and whether the outer end of the curv is a suppli issu total or if it is convey other inform
that   s a good question and one that  sn   t have an easi answer  in my own view  the shift is not so much an indic that peopl view inflationari risk as immin or that they have veri strong expect of futur inflat   i think it reflect more a concern about the fiscal side  given the talk of s ulus come out of congress  the cancel of the treasuri   s buyback program  and the prospect for lower feder revenu   in the new york  e or one of the major paper ye day there was an articl say that perhap we   ll have a fiscal deficit   so the fiscal outlook has realli chang   now  the short end of the curv will tend to follow polici  or at least it has so far   but the long end is where the treasuri has been especi activ with the buyback            program and that   s where we might see concern or a shift in expect about the fiscal side
but if it   s wholli a matter of suppli  can   t you normal that judgment against corpor issu   the yield spread went up and it   s veri tough to make a judgment  when we see movement like that  as to whether it   s a relat suppli of treasuri secur vis  vis other secur or an aggreg suppli effect   there   s no way  i gather  that we can separ it out   i took a look at the tip data and they don   t help either   the question sort of sit out there as a relat import one becaus if we   re look at a suppli phenomenon  the shift we   ve seen in the yield curv is what one would expect   there has to be some suppli phenomenon involv   but whether  as presid   impli  an inflat premium is build up in the market is in my view an import issu for us to get a sens of
ani thought on how to do that
i   ll work on it    laughter
ani further question   i believ presid pool move to ratifi the transact   is there a second
without object  they are approv   thank you veri much   let   s move on   we now go to the most import part of the meet    the most inform  illumin  and provoc  right
well  that fit in perfect with my introductori remark
i wasn   t call on you  i was call on somebodi els    laughter
if i were to scale the length of my remark this morn to be in proport to my knowledg about the current state of the economi  then i think it would be fair to say that i have alreadi spoken too long   the terribl event of septemb    have alter the polit and econom landscap along so mani dimens that interpret the data and put togeth this forecast present us with unusu daunt challeng   in particular  we were requir to take strong stand on question of psycholog and polit   consider that are alway present in construct the forecast  but rare with the promin that they have achiev in the current circumst   for that reason  i thought i could be help by lay out as clear as possibl how we handl some of these issu in addit to describ how we have react to the broader macroeconom forc oper on the economi  our effort were organ around four princip question   how was inform about econom develop prior to septemb    chang our view about the baselin forecast   how larg were the econom disrupt direct associ with the attack   to what extent and for how long would consum and busi confid be damag in the aftermath of these event   and  import  how were chang in the stock market  interest rate  and fiscal polici shape the outlook for output and price over the next two year  with regard to the first question  the sharp drop in aggreg hour work in august and the ongo steep declin in manufactur output suggest to us that real gdp was  at best  eke out a meager gain in the third quarter prior to the attack   moreov  the composit of activ was remark similar to that which we have observ sinc the spring  moder advanc in consumpt and govern spend offset by continu declin in equip outlay and a further runoff of inventori   base on develop prior to septemb     i suspect that we would have been come back to the committe this  e with a forecast of essenti no chang in real gdp  on net  in the second half of the year and a slow acceler of activ next year  that assess form the backdrop against which we had to evalu the econom consequ of the terrorist attack   in collect inform about the disrupt of product and sale that occur immedi follow the attack  we reli heavili on our busi contact as well as the extraordinari effort made by research depart at the reserv bank to gather intellig on activ in their district   taken togeth  the evid suggest that while the disrupt were pervas and profound for busi in new york  elsewher the largest problem were concentr in a few major sector  air travel was virtual shut down for sever day  and mani sport            and entertain event were cancel or postpon   auto product was disrupt by part suppli problem associ with the interrupt of air cargo flight and by a backup of truck on the canadian and mexican border   retail also appear to have been serious disrupt  though it is import to bear in mind that much of ani shortfal in sale like result in a buildup of retail inventori rather than an immedi curtail of product  some of these effect like were allevi later in septemb  and other could well be revers in the next coupl of month   our veri rough stab at the magnitud of these effect suggest that direct disrupt are like to have reduc growth in third quarter gdp by about     percentag point at an annual rate  with those effect larg expect to be revers this quarter  as we enter the fourth quarter  the bigger question surround the extent to which recent event will weigh on consum and busi confid   read on auto sale provid by the vehicl maker  news report  and common sens suggest to us that consum are like to pull back on spend   with littl to go on  we have assum that consum sen ent will drop consider below level impli by current macroeconom circumst  not quit so larg over the next year as occur in the aftermath of the iraqi invas of kuwait  but still a signific drop by histor standard   last friday   s report on consum confid from the michigan survey point to a declin in sen ent in the final week of the month that is rough consist with our expect pattern  we also examin how larg shock to sen ent play out over  e and how they are correl with other compon of spend  and we adjust our forecast accord   go forward  we have the effect of this shock reduc the growth of real gdp by about       percentag point at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and by about     percentag point  on averag  in        becaus there simpli has been no other episod that close match the present one  it is veri difficult for us to gaug the reason of our assumpt   given that uncertainti  we consid a deeper shock to sen ent  one that rough equal in size that which occur after the invas of kuwait  a shock of that magnitud produc someth resembl a more typic recess   but to be perfect frank  there is no compel reason to think that the shock couldn   t be twice the size of the one associ with the invas of kuwait  or for that matter  someth consider smaller than we have assum   moreov  we can   t predict how polit  militari  or terrorist action could unfold in come month or their potenti influenc on confid and econom behavior   obvious  we had to make some big assumpt on skimpi            evid  and those assumpt have had import implic for the forecast  not all of the develop that have occur sinc the last meet are immun to more convent econom analysi   with all of the understand focus on the recent tragic event  one could be forgiven for overlook some signific shift that have occur in monetari and fiscal polici   in our forecast  the feder fund rate is     basi point lower over the next year than was incorpor in our august project   taken by itself  a chang in short term rate of that dimens could be expect to generat consider impetus to aggreg demand down the road   but  of cours  this chang cannot be taken by itself   the sharp drop in the stock market and the widen of risk spread in the bond market to date have substanti blunt the s ulus from lower short term rate   inde  as you know from read the bluebook  some es  of the equilibrium fund rate have fallen almost as much as the actual fund rate   we still view the fund rate as have fallen below it equilibrium  and thus see the current set of polici as capabl of restor a period of abov trend growth over  e   but the near term shock impli that the adjust will take longer and start with a greater shortfal of activ from potenti than we had previous project  i should hasten to add that it is import not to view these chang in financi develop in isol   no doubt  some of the firm in long term rate in recent week reflect an expect of a substanti more expansionari fiscal polici  which is pois to add more impetus to activ over the next year than we project in august   we have incorpor in this forecast about     billion of polici initi for fiscal      and     billion of initi in fiscal       relat to a current servic baselin   the figur for fiscal      is rough     billion more than in our august forecast   in addit to the emerg supplement and airlin assist packag alreadi pass by congress  we have assum near     billion more in spend on educ and fema  an extens of unemploy insur benefit that cost about     billion  and a fiscal s ulus packag that ramp up to about     billion by fiscal        to put the size of the total packag in a cyclic context  the fiscal s ulus deliv over the next eight quarter is onli exceed  and just a bit  by the combin of tax cut and increas in defens spend that occur earli in the reagan administr  still  on our assumpt  the unifi budget surplus is     billion in fiscal      and near     billion in fiscal        with money left on the tabl and an emerg bipartisan consensus for greater s ulus  we believ that the balanc of risk to our fiscal assumpt is on the            upsid   for that reason  we includ in the  book a simul have enough addit s ulus to virtual elimin the unifi surplus over the next two year   such action would like produc a fa  turnaround in the growth of activ and trim the rise in the unemploy rate  an advers reaction of the bond market would damp  but not elimin  those effect  while we view fiscal polici as an upsid risk to our forecast  there also are some veri promin downsid risk that are like to be especi acut in the next coupl of quarter   an event such as occur on septemb    could act as a clear focal point that caus alreadi skittish consum and busi to pull back simultan on spend plan   those action and their feedback on the economi would rais signific the probabl of a sharp reduct in aggreg activ   i would also note that even if we do not see immedi sign that such a contract is under way  that risk will not have reced complet   iraq invad kuwait in earli august  but the steep cutback in aggreg output did not realli commenc until octob  if i had to net the various risk to real activ in this forecast  i would focus more on the downsid risk in the near term and the upsid risk farther out   the near term forc of contract could be substanti  but so too could be the medium term s ulus from monetari and fiscal polici  let me conclud with a few word about inflat   in an environ of increas slack in labor and product market and declin energi price  we expect measur of both total and core consum price inflat to declin over the next two year   it might appear surpris that the disinfl in this forecast is as modest as it is  given the degre of slack expect to emerg in come month   but in our view  there are a few reason for be cautious in mark down the outlook for price   we have built in a sharp deceler in wage  our forecast of the increas in eci wage drop from about   percent this year to       percent in        howev  becaus there are few sign of ani slow of health insur cost  the deceler in overal benefit cost is like to be notic less than that of wage  although benefit cost may well be offset by reduc wage gain in the long run  the frequenc with which busi peopl complain about health insur cost suggest that this shift is not like to be immedi or painless  the effect of the slow in compens cost also show through to a lesser extent on price becaus of the slower pace of structur product growth that we are expect over the next            coupl of year   moreov  with busi margin have been erod in recent year  there is less scope for firm to absorb cost pressur in margin   all in all  these consider lead us to expect less disinfl over the next two year than might be infer from our forecast of resourc util alon     son will now continu our present
in tri to come to grip with the implic  of recent event for the forecast  we were confid that we knew in which direct to revis foreign growth as a result of inform learn sinc the august  book  down   but it was much less clear to us how to assess the magnitud of that revis for individu foreign countri and for foreign growth on averag  our downward revis to the forecast for foreign growth has three compon       incorpor of the news about econom activ in the second quarter and some indic for juli and august that have becom avail sinc the august forecast was complet      assess of the implic for foreign economi of the new outlook for the unit state  and     consider of the extent to which the event of septemb     through asset price  confid factor  and key global price and industri  will influenc real output growth abroad in addit to the direct impact transmit by u s  demand for import from the rest of the world   the difficulti we confront stem from our lack of inform about real econom activ in the day sinc septemb    and the inher uncertainti of prospect effect in the rest of the world as foreign consum and busi firm react to event that  at least so far  have occur within the unit state  as we report in the  book  the econom data that had becom avail in recent week suggest a more depress global economi than we had expect   this was particular the case for the emerg asian economi   there  the news was most negat for those whose export of high tech product were link to invest spend in the unit state and in other industri countri  howev  there were disappoint data for other countri  includ such industri countri as canada and japan   incorpor of this inform account for a signific share of our downward revis to foreign growth  as has been evid in the global slowdown to date  a substanti weaker outlook for u s  real gdp has clear implic  in the same direct  for real output growth abroad   those effect are largest for our princip trade partner  such as canada and mexico             howev  for other region of the globe  such as europ  the consequ of second and third round effect through multilater trade relationship are far from neglig   should we be further surpris by develop in the u s  economi  either posit or negat  there would be a signific reinforc of that surpris as output in foreign economi respond to the chang demand from the unit state  my third categori of factor includ the host of reaction within the foreign countri and in global market to the event of septemb      we have seen net declin in stock market abroad as larg as    percent   our research and that of other suggest that the effect on consumpt of such chang in wealth will not be as larg abroad as in the unit state  but the reaction will be signific   similar  we expect that confid of consum and busi will be impair by vari degre across the rest of the world   we have a few bit of partial inform from survey that includ respons after septemb    that confirm substanti drop in confid   the latest japanes tankan survey  releas on monday  fell more than expect to it lowest level sinc june      for the overal index   at this point  we can onli guess how widespread the reaction of confid abroad will be  how long it will persist  and how much it will contribut to lessen domest demand in foreign countri  we also have incorpor into this forecast avail inform from global market   with respect to oil price  the spot price of wti has move down  on balanc  more than    percent sinc septemb     and futur price call for it to move down slight further   market particip seem to be anticip that reduc global demand for oil will be met by onli limit suppli cut by opec   the recent intern meet of oil produc end with no agre reduct in product quota despit the fact that spot price were below the target rang for opec   s basket  the global market for high tech product in general  and semiconductor in particular  is an import element behind our project for the emerg asian economi   weak in this sector under the signific greater than expect declin in output that were record in the second quarter in malaysia  singapor  and taiwan   we have littl hard inform about inventori or product beyond august   our project that output in the region will recov next year depend upon some improv in this sector  we ask ourselv in which foreign countri scope might exist for addit polici respons to the further downward pressur on demand   among the industri countri  monetari polici has been            broad eas dure the first half of this year  and eight major foreign central bank cut rate further follow your action on septemb     our forecast assum that addit eas move will be taken in europ and canada by year end   some emerg market central bank had been eas as well  as the global economi slow and demand weaken within their economi   howev  we expect that extern financ pressur will like intensifi  in particular for latin american countri with extern deficit  make it less like that monetari eas will be enact there  within europ and in canada  fiscal polici should be somewhat support of growth in      as tax revenu fall and deficit widen  we do not expect signific discretionari eas measur   in japan  howev  the long stand problem within that economi and the agenda of the koizumi govern to implement fiscal reform are expect to result in moder fiscal contract dure next year   most emerg market economi have littl scope to increas expenditur or cut tax   one import except is china  where continu govern spend is expect to support growth dure the second half of this year and next year   other east asian develop countri announc some fiscal s ulus measur earlier this year  the downsid risk to this forecast are distress clear   the hit to confid from the terrorist attack  come at a  e when output abroad was alreadi deceler  could set off a mutual reinforc cycl of product and employ cut  downward earn revis  lower asset price  and addit drop in confid   our expect of a rebound next year is base primarili on the project turnaround in the unit state  recognit that monetari s ulus has been implement in the major countri  and our judgment that inventori adjust abroad should be near complet by then  there is no evid as yet on which to base resolut of the  e and pace of recoveri  that said  we may be too close to the event of septemb    to judg how countri more distant from those event will respond   we were aggress in our reaction to the econom data and world news sinc the august  book   it is possibl that the effect of the attack on growth abroad will be even more mute in comparison to that in the unit state than we have project   the possibl of such an outcom constitut upsid risk to our forecast
i want to ask you     about the psycholog question  to use your term   one of the key to the forecast obvious is consum sen ent and consum spend   i realiz it   s veri hard to judg  but i would have thought that consum sen ent now would be as bad if not wors than in the         period follow the iraqi invas of kuwait   then we had a fear of terror on our soil  now obvious it   s a realiti   of cours  you   ve dealt with a collaps in consum and busi sen ent in one of the altern  book scenario  but i wonder whi you didn   t use that as the baselin   do you have ani other comment on how to compar these two period in term of consum sen ent
i hope i made clear that i didn   t think the probabl of our assumpt were signific higher than the probabl of a lot of other that could be made   obvious  we thought long and hard about exact how much of a sen ent effect to build in   i think the reason we end up go with someth less than what occur after the iraqi invas of kuwait was that that shock was also accompani by a veri distinct econom shock through much  much higher oil price  and if one think back to that  e  there were certain enorm fear about how long and deep a militari commit we might be make in the middl east   it   s easi in retrospect to look back and recal that the militari action went veri well and was over so quick   it   s a littl hard to put oneself back in the perspect at the  e  when the initi think was that a lot of ground troop might be need and that it might involv a veri bloodi and protract militari effort befor the unit state could disengag   so we decid not to put in as much sen ent effect at this point and to react to the evid as it flow in  make adjust up or down to what we have built into the            forecast   obvious anoth characterist that is differ between this event and the iraqi invas episod is that there was a veri distinct end to the latter   and we had a veri sharp recoveri in sen ent onc it becam quit clear in februari that the militari engag was go to be a relat short and victori effort   we have the shock fade out more slowli this  e   even though it   s not as deep  it fade out more slowli than what occur after the iraqi invas of kuwait   the pattern we have in our forecast is more typic of larg negat shock to sen ent   these shock rare have  as the kuwait period did  such a clear end and such a sharp recoveri   so  as i said ye day at the board meet  the forecast involv a veri thin veneer of scienc appli to a whole lot of judgment   all i can say is that you as policymak and we as forecast are just go to have to roll with the inform as it come in and make appropri adjust from there
i want to ask you to say a littl more about japan   you mention that after the committe   s action on septemb   th eight central bank eas polici   well  that list wouldn   t includ japan becaus in their case there was noth to announc in term of a rate cut   for at least some six month now they have been talk about quantit eas and whether they have made that real or not certain is question   then you mention that fiscal polici in japan could be contractionari   i might conclud that a contractionari japanes fiscal polici would be s ul becaus they   ve had    year of push on the fiscal string with no effect  unless one think the economi would have been wors without that   one can look at the result of what has            been done over the last decad on the fiscal side and say that the japanes peopl are all ricardian   the more the govern borrow and spend  the more it peopl don   t spend  they save  and the govern   s effort come to noth   but as dino mention  last week the govern did more than doubl the amount of current account balanc from   trillion to    trillion yen   so i would think the import question for japan is  are they go to unwind it or are they go to continu on what seem to be quantit a veri s ul monetari polici
well  to be honest i did includ them in the eight becaus they cut what they call the overnight discount rate  which is a kind of lombard rate  technic it   s an offici lend rate of the bank of japan and they reduc it  so i said okay  they are one of my eight   and i think they intend  both from the  e of the announc and the way they express it  to indic that they were go to do what they could along with their brother central bank to weather the storm of this particular financi crisi   they want to be support  in the sens of aid short term liquid and market function and so forth in the immedi aftermath of the attack  i think this period is somewhat of a crossroad for them   i interpret the intervent that they did and their decis to let the reserv stay in the system as an open   perhap they are think of deliber use transact in the exchang market  a concept they had resist for some  e  as oppos to oper in the domest money market as a way of get more liquid out there   the combin of circumst creat an appropri meet of the mind between the ministri of financ and the bank of japan with regard to undertak these transact   they respond in the way we   ve all urg them to respond   i took that to be a fair posit            sign   it remain to be seen what they will do go forward  becaus at least today  for exampl  the yen has soften and has not move up from it low   it   s possibl that a lot of the pressur on the yen has had to do with the end of their fiscal half year on septemb   th   when that is taken out of the pictur  i think it remain a complet open question as to whether the bank of japan will revert to it previous practic and say     well  that approach was fine then but it   s not appropri right now      i am veri pessimist that this is a truli long last chang in their approach  but i think what they did in the week sinc septemb   th was in the right direct and they could surpris us   they could be more aggress than they   ve given sign of so far
i had a question about japan as well   when i look at the tabl  in part i of the  book it seem stun  i don   t know if that   s the right word  to see with the addit of the forecast for      what will be five year of deflat for japan and a pickup in econom growth that is quit modest   and  of cours  we   ve seen those project pickup disappear in the past   this certain say someth  i think  about the effect of their polici  not just in      but over the next two plus year   it sure has some major econom implic but possibl polit implic as well   i wonder if you   d comment on that
prior to septemb   th  i think the peopl in the intern divis who close watch japan were tri to talk themselv into be slight more op ist about japan than we had been for a while  and we   ve been rather pessimist all along   we were tri to see some energi in the koizumi reform  although what the govern has done sinc the upper hous elect in juli            disappoint us becaus instead of run with the reform and build on it they seem to be back off and hem and haw   but there were some shred of sign of thing possibl not get wors at least   it   s hard to say whether septemb   th will realli chang that for them   there are no direct implic for japan except for the loss in export potenti from the rest of the world and certain from the unit state   i think they   re so bound up in their own problem that i don   t have a sens  or they weren   t abl to tell us is a better way to put it  of whether the tankan survey was heavili influenc by the attack or not   a signific portion of the survey respons were receiv by the agenc after septemb   th  but they made no effort and realli had no way to tell how mani had been fill out after septemb   th   i think we are at risk of that economi remain moribund  sit there more or less do noth for quit some  e  and larg for polit reason   now  whether that would spark a real polit overturn in japan i am certain not the person to say   obvious  in most other countri it would have happen long ago   so it just defi my abil to judg   person  i had thought koizumi might make a differ but i think circumst are conspir against that at the present  e
dave  i was intrigu by the chang in your es  of structur product      percent in       slow to     percent in       and pick up to     percent in        i know there are close relationship between product  capit deepen  and busi fix invest and so forth   we   ve been look backward  but suppos we look forward and make the assumpt that the impetus to be            more and more product and more focus on the cost side is still veri much present in u s  industri   if we assum that this is not as much a function of capit deepen but increas a function of industri reorgan or a sheer desir to do thing better and cheaper all the  e  what would a slight higher and more stabl level of product growth do to your project   i know you have that feedback effect into demand   i   m interest in how that might look in the            e frame
basic  if we were to increas the multifactor product portion  which is the portion that would provid all the impetus that you were talk about  we would get stronger growth in activ brought about probabl by a stronger stock market than we have in the baselin forecast   that stronger growth would probabl be accompani by veri littl addit inflat   in essenc we   d see an unwind or a back off of exact the kind of revis that we think have occur over the past year  as product came in weaker than we and other had anticip  the stock market weaken  and demand soften signific   as i think you   ve note on a number of occas  one some  need to look through the snapshot of structur product that we have in this forecast   inde  even with this   percent growth in multifactor product  we would expect  move beyond this period of cyclic weak in invest spend  to see some reacceler of under product  but that occur beyond the horizon that we current are forecast   of cours  we   ve made big mistak in both direct in recent year  so it certain could be the case that thing will turn out even better in the near term   busi may be move more aggress on the cost cut side and may in essenc get us back closer to the product possibl frontier than we have assum here   and that would produc a            stronger economi   but becaus of less cost pressur  it probabl would be accompani by less upward pressur on inflat as well
and slight lower unemploy
yes  work it the way that we have told the stori and the way the model see it  we would get stronger near term demand effect than suppli effect and that would produc somewhat lower unemploy
further question   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid

mr  chairman  econom activ in the twelfth district was weak even befor the terrorist attack   employ contract in juli and then was near flat in august   on net it fell about   percent at an annual rate in the two month  the main sourc of weak was the high tech sector   high tech equip manufactur have been shed job all year and the pace of declin acceler substanti in juli and august  with cut at doubl digit rate report in california  arizona  and oregon   high tech servic provid also have been cut job  includ the loss of over   percent of employ in that sector in the state of washington dure juli and august alon  the slowdown was also evid in other sector such as construct   vacanc rate for offic space have risen substanti in most metro area  and home sale and price appreci have come down as well   the slowdown in construct activ so far this year is most evid in the san francisco bay area  where the number of permit for new home is run    percent below last year   s number   consum spend and confid in the district  which had been hold up well in the spring and earli            summer  show sign of weaken in earli septemb   of cours  these weak have been exacerb in the aftermath of the attack  the immedi econom effect of the attack includ substanti reduct in consum spend and some disrupt in busi activ   sinc then retail sale among larg discount store have recov  though sale at depart store have remain depress   as a result  for some apparel manufactur cloth order for spring report are run well below pre attack expect   by contrast  construct activ in recent week has not been affect to ani appreci degre  howev  the postpon or cancel of some project mean that the pipelin is not fill up as fast as befor  the largest negat effect of the attack have been on air travel and tourism  as was indic by presid     due to the result bleak outlook  boe  and i think our number about boe are similar to those present by presid     immedi cut it es  deliveri of commerci aircraft next year by    percent  with substanti addit cut expect in        in seattl as mani as        job could be lost at boe by the end of next year   district contact have report that airlin book have been run    percent or more below normal   and in citi like san francisco  where    percent of the hotel demand is deriv from arriv by air  hotel occup are veri low   as a result  substanti layoff are under way or plan by airport  airlin  and firm in other segment of the travel industri   although this has been felt nationwid  the impact will be especi hard on some twelfth district state that have unusu larg tourism and travel sector  notabl nevada and hawaii  whose tourism sector had alreadi begun to struggl prior to the attack            let me turn to the nation pictur   i certain won   t take except to the wide held view that the terrorist attack probabl end ani chanc of avoid recess   in this regard  a member of our staff has taken a care look at the month indic and method use by the nber to date recess   he conclud that if  as seem like  activ fall enough in come month for the nber to declar a recess  the busi cycl peak could well be backdat to the first half of this year and perhap as earli as march   this date would repres a compromis among the unusu divers peak in the various data seri that the nber reli upon  in ani event  our forecast for the second half of this year is similar to that of the  book   it show a small declin in real gdp in the third quarter and a drop of     to   percent in the fourth quarter   assum a fund rate of       percent  the most like scenario for next year seem to be a gradual pickup in growth  especi in respons to the eas of monetari polici as well as recent and expect fiscal action  howev  while growth should be more accept  it will like remain well below the potenti rate for some  e   the except larg risk surround the outlook are skew to the weak side  especi in view of the potenti hit to confid that would go along with like militari action and possibl addit terror   anoth risk is the deepen stagnat of economi around the globe  we have revis down our inflat forecast by about     percent sinc the august meet  obvious in respons to the greater expect slack in labor and product market and a lower path for oil price  but also due to negat speed effect   our best es  is for inflat of about       percent in the core pce price index in       given the econom outlook as well as it downsid risk  there is a strong argument for            implement the addit cut in the fund rate that under our forecast and that in the  book   thank you
one of the minor casualti of septemb   th was our educ and inform view and knowledg regard the state of the economi   that knowledg  such as it was  is now obsolet and there   s veri littl with which to replac it  i agre that our economi will probabl be okay in the long run onc we get past this unsettl   and i   m fair confid that the consequ in the veri short term will be serious negat   the economi was alreadi teeter on the brink of recess and this event has sure push it over that brink   what i don   t know is how deep and how long the recess will be  that is  the outlook for the medium term   no one can know that now becaus it hasn   t been determin yet   the length and depth of the recess will depend more on how everyon react to what happen on septemb   th than on the event itself   it   s hard to imagin that the great uncertainti on all front won   t caus consum and busi alik to withdraw from new commit and to hunker down  we deal here in spend and incom as measur by gdp and it compon  but we should not forget that we are now poorer in way beyond ani es  of gdp measur   we will be poorer at each level of gdp than we were befor septemb   th   to buy a level of secur at or even below what we were alreadi use to or thought we had will requir more of our scarc resourc to be devot to secur  more policemen  firemen  airport secur  border secur  and air marshal will be need   they will generat measur incom or gdp  but their opportun cost will be larg            we will also be poorer as a result of longer line and longer wait at airport  sport event  concert  and simpli get in and out of public build   we will miss out on a lot of good immigr who won   t get into our countri as we tri to screen out the undesir one   we will probabl have to reintroduc some redund and ineffici that had been wrung out of the economi   as ed yardeni put it     just in    e inventori may becom just in case inventori      backup and reloc site that will sit idl most of the  e will becom more import  even essenti   much of this will contribut to gdp but will repres a downgrad of live standard   poorer will be the worker who will have to postpon retir becaus their    ks have tank and the potenti student who will have to enter the labor forc rather than colleg   i don   t know how to add all these factor  along with the declin in the stock market  into an es  of the size of the negat wealth effect   but i believ they will be import factor  as to the specif impact on the eleventh district  i don   t know much beyond the obvious   most sector and region have weaken   american  continent  and southwest airlin are headquart in texa  so we will feel the declin in air travel and relat industri more than most area   our export  especi to mexico and asia  are off   the declin in energi price will remov a local posit  thank good  natur gas is back down to       per million btus  half of last year   s price   we probabl do have some firm that will benefit from beef up defens spend  but we should not forget that that will repres a divers of spend and not necessarili new spend   i   m told that texa has about     manufactur firm involv in the manufactur of instrument relat to research  detect  navig  guidanc             aeronaut and nautic system  as well as measur and control system   we also have a signific region presenc of high tech defens compani  such as northrop grumman  raytheon  lockhe martin  and bell textron   the stock price of the first three have risen sinc the market reopen   bell textron   s has not   it is still suffer from setback to the osprey  the airplan that is suppos to land and take off like a helicopt and not requir airport or flat terrain   if they could just get that plane to work  i know some place with bad terrain where they might be abl to use it  as for the nation economi and the polici question  i had been think that this year   s reduct in the fund rate from       to   percent plus all the extra liquid that has been provid would probabl be enough   but the psycholog of the financi market and their fragil might requir a tad more eas   i   m somewhat surpris  howev  by the near unanim in the market that we will reduc the fund rate by anoth    basi point today   the market seem insati as well as fragil   i tend to think someth less would be suffici  but it is an awkward  e to disappoint the market in an effort to reclaim the committe   s author over monetari polici   a fed fund rate of   percent was the low point of the nomin rate dure the             recess  but as the staff point out  the lower inflat rate today make the current fed fund rate about a percentag point higher in real term   asid from the potenti consequ of disappoint the market  i believ the amount of weight that we give to that distinct between the nomin and the real rate is probabl the key to today   s polici decis
thank you  mr  chairman   let me talk first about condit as describ to me by my various contact   becaus of the obvious import of consum            confid  i   ve had four convers with my contact at wal mart sinc septemb   th   on the   th    th    th  and again ye day   his overal assess is that sale are hold up pretti well   on the tuesday of the terrorist attack  of cours  sale at wal mart were down sharpli  but for the week as a whole they were just slight below plan  as i talk with my sourc sever more  e  that was the basic messag  that sale were fair close to what had been anticip befor the day of the attack   some chang in buy pattern have emerg that he  sn   t know complet how to explain   wal mart track the number of sale ticket and the averag amount spent per sale ticket on a same store basi to analyz data at compar store   he is see more of a split between the volum of traffic and that of ticket than usual  that is  there   s a greater increas in the number of ticket and less growth in the amount spent per ticket  but as of ye day  the total amount spent was come in just slight below what wal mart had anticip befor septemb   th  my contact also said that the compani has done a littl research with some focus group regard christma spend plan   of the consum group they   ve talk with  the percentag of respond who say they   re go to spend less for christma is about the same as the typic respons in their focus group at this  e of year   the percentag say that they will be spend more  howev  is down signific   the proport plan to spend about the same is therefor up signific   he said  and i press him somewhat on this  that he felt it was much too earli to make ani judgment about the longer run outlook   peopl are still veri much in shock in term of adjust to the event   in his view  draw ani conclus is almost certain prematur at this point            my contact in the air cargo busi  at both up and fedex  say that their compani are maintain their normal schedul   they have not cut back at all as yet  volum is run somewhat below where it had been  but not dramat so overal  howev  the express busi has been hard hit   the ground busi and what they call the freight busi  which is less than truckload quantiti  is run about flat over last year  emphas that the outlook for domest passeng airlin is truli dire   he said that as a consequ of the veri stiff labor contract that were settl in stage over last year and this year befor septemb  labor cost have increas veri signific  would be the first of the airlin to fail   from look at the financi report  that airlin alreadi has negat net worth for the sharehold on it book   and  of cours  they   re all in junk bond status  at current traffic level all of them are liter within a few week of run out of cash and have to close down   so  the situat is veri dire for the passeng airlin   and  of cours  we heard this morn that swiss air has declar bankruptci  i also made a new contact with a person at a truck firm call j b  hunt  which is headquart in arkansa and is one of the largest truck compani in the unit state   hunt   s busi is veri much at normal level  with volum general what they had expect   but the compani is great concern about the futur  particular the earli part of next year   for the most part  buy plan for the fall are alreadi complet  so the inventori are move to the store   but there   s a veri larg amount of uncertainti about what will happen earli next year            let me divid my comment on the total economi into two part   first  i think it   s fair to say that veri littl is known at the profession level about the sen ent question   i think back to my read of the journal literatur over a long period of studi macroeconom and i don   t rememb ever see articl about consum sen ent except in conjunct with the sen ent survey   there   s practic no analysi of sen ent at a profession level   i think we can say  though  that we have some basi for understand the econom aspect of the current situat   it seem to me import to focus on the fact that some major fundament strength were in place at the  e of the attack   we had an environ of low inflat and veri low expect inflat   oil price had been move lower and  of cours  have come down further sinc the attack and that is an element of strength   we go into this situat with strong bank capit  unlik the situat in         when bank capit was weak   bank can make loan   and  of cours  low short term rate increas the margin for bank to compens for the greater risk in this environ   we have a feder budget surplus  which mean that the budget is not as big an issu as it might have been a dozen year ago in term of the natur of a feder respons   we had a veri larg amount of monetari s ulus alreadi in place as of septemb   th   our economi oper with veri flexibl market   we have a resili peopl   we have a veri strong set of fundament   the issu  i think  is how long it   s go to take for busi and consum to get over it  so to speak  and to adjust to this circumst   and we have veri  veri littl by way of know the answer to that  from look at the effect on the stock market of past shock event  and i went back and examin as mani as i could think of  the longest period of recoveri from            a shock was after the stock market crash in        it took quit a while for the market to get back to where it had been   after the invas of kuwait  the market was depress until desert storm and that event tend to resolv that issu   in the current situat  we are like to see more shock to come   almost certain there are go to be some terrorist event abroad   let   s pray that no more come to our own land   but more shock lie ahead that will possibl upset confid  i   m go to delay talk about our polici situat  but i think the issu there is that we need to focus much  much more than we usual do on the confid issu  we need to focus on what we can do to help support confid and stabil rather than just on the set of the feder fund rate itself

thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with a quick rundown of what   s go on in the district economi   much of this was in the written report we submit earlier  although i do have some updat   product was larg unaffect by the event of septemb   th  and that is still the case today   on the other hand  consum spend in the first few day follow the attack was essenti stop in it track   but report from larg retail in the district suggest that sale bounc back quit quick   now  i   m not talk about big ticket item   this is exclus of auto and home and so forth   but activ at mall  at discount store and even depart store  came back rather quick to normal level   i guess it   s also fair to say that restaur in the district have been surpris busi  at least in the last coupl of week  hous activ  which had been sound  remain sound   but as i report at the last meet  sale at the high end of the market certain seem to be slow  and that            continu to be the case   my sens is that there is grow caution in that area and i would be surpris if next year   s hous activ in the district came anywher close to the pace of the last two or three year  for the most part  nonresidenti construct activ has continu unab  there was  of cours  a major expans of the airport under way and that project has slow if not been put on hold   i don   t think that situat will go on for too long unless peopl are prepar just to let the project rust as it sit there   there have been a lot of cancel of prospect convent   septemb and octob are veri big convent month in minneapoli  so that matter a good deal   the hotel are run with low occup rate and other travel relat busi are similar affect   the airport that i   ve been in at least have been veri quiet  although northwest airlin has report some improv in futur book   i   m not sure exact what to make of that  but the airlin peopl seem somewhat surpris about what   s come down the pike  obvious  the busi communiti is of the opinion in general that aggress action both on the fiscal side and on the monetari polici side is appropri here   i don   t have to go veri far out the door to hear somebodi in the busi communiti offer that opinion   one other develop is that in the wake of all this  we lost one medium size brokerag firm that was involv in an ill advis secur lend transact  as far as the nation economi is concern  in think about the outlook and in listen to the staff discuss  the key word here is obvious uncertainti   i happen to think that the near term outlook is for more weak than project in the  book  but i wouldn   t put too much stock in ani forecast   as mani peopl have alreadi said  we   re in an environ that we realli don   t know a lot about   normal  when            uncertainti goe up  that impli to me the need for polici caution so as to avoid signific error   but in the current situat we can be fair certain  or at least i am of the opinion  that the downsid risk have magnifi and that the inflat risk have diminish   in ani event though  i   m not sure that econom polici is go to be key to the relat near term futur   i think what we need is tranquil at home and success abroad
mr  chairman  the economi in the tenth district  like that for the nation  remain sluggish   some peopl might say it was mix at best prior to the event of septemb   th   of cours sinc then  as we   ve heard around this tabl  the anxieti and uncertainti that was alreadi in the economi took an even greater hit and caus the outlook to worsen notic  as reflect in the  book as well as in our staff and the blue chip forecast  let me give you some data on the district   these develop are consist with the nation news becaus mani of the report are from firm oper nation  first of all  the manufactur survey we conduct in juli was quit negat   our dispers index was minus      when we took a look at the august survey  we becam somewhat hope becaus that negat had becom much smaller  move to minus    but in septemb  and part of the survey was clear done after septemb   th   that index went back to minus      so we saw a big switch in sen ent in term of the prospect look forward  on the transport side  i would make a coupl of point   as for the airlin  our experi is the same as other have talk about   boe  which has            oper in wichita  has announc signific layoff   but as a side comment  cessna  which also oper there  has a backlog on order for corpor aircraft   and that backlog is grow  appar reflect increas demand for fraction ownership as the desir to find altern air transport is start to take hold  let me talk for just a minut about the truck industri   bill pool mention a firm in that sector   in kansa citi we also have a larg nation oper truck compani that   a lot of ship for manufactur firm   we recent had a convers with their peopl  and they said the firm   s busi is down mark   it was down notic prior to septemb   th and sinc then it has onli gotten wors  as their custom have pull back   their comment to me was that they are now oper at      level of busi   so  they have had veri signific reduct in volum and have just announc sizabl layoff   they have about        driver and have laid off a signific number of them as well as staff in their corpor oper  look at the railroad industri  we have a major railroad oper north  south from kansa citi and then into mexico   their volum in and out of mexico have drop notic and their order book have drop as well   previous to septemb   th they had initi layoff  and there are no sign of rehir at this point  as for the retail sector  like other we   ve talk to mani retail   they have report a fair persist return to the pre septemb   th pattern in term of sale   but the experi is veri mix as they look to the christma season   some are say they   ve pull back dramat   one  as was report in the nation press  follow through complet in their christma order as their sale were up    percent   so we   ve heard veri mix report on the retail side            energi  which for us is a two edg sword  is also a mix   becaus price are down that   s good in the general sens   but it also mean that we   ve seen a real drop off in activ in our region  it   s down about    percent by our es   general  activ in our region is slower   the chang in psycholog is notic  in term of the effect  look to the nation situat and polici  i would say that we also see the economi recov eventu   but given the psycholog and the uncertainti  forecast the  elin for the recoveri is exceed difficult   i wouldn   t pretend to have a better forecast than anyon els in this room  mine would be no better than dave     s  for sure  anoth factor mention here that i think is an import consider is fiscal polici   we don   t know how that   s go to evolv   tri to pull all this togeth  i would be support of an eas  pick the amount   i think an eas step would recogn that at least for the next sever month the downsid risk are probabl go to weigh veri heavili on our economi   our experi in other instanc  as peopl have point out  is that we tend to underes  the downsid   in my view that is a real possibl in this case as well   so i would be more inclin to err on the side of eas  we can revers the eas should fiscal polici be over s ul or should the economi turn up  and i believ the market would understand that   i think we are in a good posit in that regard   so overal a case for eas polici can be well support  if that should be deem necessari here   thank you

effect on area such as travel and tourism   have said that  uncertainti has clear increas and market are expect a further drop in our target fund rate at this meet   a further temporari drop in rate seem appropri  but i emphas the word    temporari     as a short term effort to provid liquid and attempt to reduc uncertainti  unlik the econom situat preced the gulf war  we   ve alreadi drop rate

argument for pursu such a low real rate polici at this  e as an intermedi polici path  given the current best guess about the like cours of the economi  except to temper further short term uncertainti  nevertheless  this   not seem a good  e to add to uncertainti by not relax rate further as the market expect  my concern about the polici path is heighten by the belief that more fiscal s ulus than alreadi enact seem quit like and will take hold about the  e mani forecast indic that the economi will begin to grow again   current percept in some quarter seem to be that the white hous  congress  and even the fed will do            almost anyth to tri to avoid a recess or a prolong slowdown   quit candid  this worri me more than a modest recess itself   for these reason  should we move again at this  e  and i believ we should  we need to look for way to explain that it   s a temporari respons that will like be revers when uncertainti declin and market are more normal   absent such an

thank you  mr  chairman   prior to the attack  the third district economi had been flat   employ continu to declin in the first two month of the third quarter   the manufactur sector also continu to declin  albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year   retail sale remain flat   one sign of a rebound in activ was an upturn in the pace of residenti construct from a weak first quarter  our call to busi contact sinc the septemb   th attack indic that firm in all industri in the region have revis downward their forecast of sale and revenu in light of continu uncertainti about possibl militari action and a retrench in spend by consum and busi  retail have note a resumpt of consum spend sinc the initi day after the attack but they say that store traffic and sale have not return to the level experienc prior to septemb   th   contact among general merchandis retail expect sale to rise onli slowli in the week immedi ahead   manag of local store of nation chain indic that corpor market plan for the fall have been put on hold  at least temporarili  though fall and winter merchandis stock level have            alreadi been set and are subject to onli minor adjust   but some retail who need to place order now for spring merchandis are contempl reduct from their earlier plan  auto sale in the district had been slow in the week befor septemb   th  and in the day after the attack they fell to level    to    percent below same day sale last year   auto dealer tell us that they will be reduc their order to manufactur for at least the next month or two   obvious  the travel and tourism industri have been hard hit by recent event   in philadelphia all the convent schedul for septemb after the attack were cancel   the convent schedul for octob have not yet been cancel but attend will be lower than normal sinc some compani have disallow air travel for at least    day  in term of employ  while mani firm in the region are anticip slower sale onli a few are consid layoff  and most of these were contempl layoff befor septemb   th   much more than the usual level of uncertainti surround the forecast for the region economi   what is clear is that recent event have push the project rebound further into the futur than previous thought  our view of the nation economi is somewhat the same   the incom data suggest that prior to septemb   th the economi had remain soft   the terrorist attack on the unit state have probabl push the economi into recess   these unpreced attack have rais the specter of further shock  such as u s  militari action and more terrorist strike   while we   ve seen some rebound in consum spend from the depress level in the day just after the attack  there has not been a total recoveri   uncertainti about the futur will caus consum to delay some purchas            and to cancel other   while real estat and other asset certain have cushion the negat effect on household net worth  the signific fall in equiti price could result in a substanti declin in household spend   uncertainti and a drop in consum spend will caus busi to delay capit outlay  the econom situat abroad has also deterior sinc our last meet  as we heard in the staff brief   data suggest that these economi were weaker prior to the attack than we had anticip   and though not on their soil  the terrorist attack are a negat shock to economi outsid the unit state   thus  this countri cannot look to strong economi abroad to buoy our own economi  our near term outlook is similar to that of the  book   we agre that the attack will have a signific negat impact in the short run   howev  i believ there could be some upsid risk associ with the  book   s forecast for        the effect of the terrorist attack on consum and busi confid may fade more quick than assum   expansionari fiscal polici in combin with easier monetari polici may have a stronger impact than assum   inde  a philadelphia staff analysi suggest that forecast tend to under predict the respons of output growth to expansionari monetari polici   thus  it is possibl that the econom recoveri could begin earlier in      and end up stronger than project in the  book   this would impli that the committe would have to be readi to rais interest rate sooner than assum in the baselin forecast   that said  i find it difficult to argu with the basic outlin of the board   s staff forecast   philadelphia staff analysi indic that while forecast signific revis their forecast downward in the aftermath of past crise  forecast error were littl differ dure crisi period than in other period   so  as            much as i would like to  i am unabl to say that the  book forecast sure err on the downsid   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in our district seem to have advanc at a modest pace in august but it weaken sharpli in septemb   some of the anecdot and survey inform we   ve receiv indic that activ would have slow in septemb even in the absenc of the attack   of cours  we did have the attack and they   ve had the same extrem negat impact on our region as they   ve had elsewher in the countri  as we   ve heard around the tabl this morn   part of the drop in activ in our region might be temporari  if the terrorist threat can be reason well contain  as sever other have note about their district  we too experienc a big drop in retail sale initi but in general they   ve come back to earlier level sinc then  the except is automobil sale  which have rebound some but not to the level we were see befor the attack occur   in the manufactur sector  earli on there were some suppli disrupt and some disrupt in shipment to custom  but at least for the  e be those seem to have subsid   in our region as elsewher the big hit  and probabl the more perman hit  is to the travel and tourist industri   tourist activ here in washington is usual veri substanti at this  e of the year and it is at a much lower level now than normal             with respect to the airlin  the airlin headquart in our district  just on the other side of the potomac river   it was an airlin in troubl  it condit was veri shaki  even befor the crisi   the compani has announc        layoff and a lot of those will be in our district   i think a good number of them will be right here in the washington area   also  beyond the layoff  the us airway hub in charlott has for a long  e been a foundat for the growth and strength we   ve seen in that citi over the last    year or so  so there is concern about that area  with respect to the nation economi  i think the data indic pretti clear that econom activ might be weaken even befor the attack   we had a run up in the unemploy rate and  of cours  manufactur was still contract despit the somewhat op ist purchas manag    report we got a month ago   with wage and home valu rise  consum spend was still hold up reason well go into the crisi   but the sharp increas in unemploy and evid that hous demand and home price might be begin to soften have contribut to the deterior in consum confid that i think was evid even befor the terrorist struck  against this background  the septemb   th attack  of cours  have ad to the anxieti and uncertainti that household  busi firm  and investor were to some extent alreadi experienc befor the attack occur   those concern show up initi in asset market   the negat impact on asset market appear at least for the moment to be reason well contain under the circumst  but obvious the level of anxieti in those market is still veri high   with a recess increas like  consum feel expos to the risk of lose their job as well as to other risk and             therefor  are like to spend less and save more out of current incom in order to build their precautionari balanc   and busi  whose invest return are now subject to a greater degre of risk than befor the attack  will probabl cut back on their invest plan even further than they alreadi have  at least for a  e  bar ani further attack and result increas in anxieti  some of these effect may prove temporari   as household get their precautionari balanc and asset posit back up to the higher level they may now desir  presum they will again begin to spend a more normal fraction of their current incom   and when busi firm get to the point where they think they have suffici liquid to deal with the conting they   re concern about  presum they will begin to redirect a greater portion of their earn to invest  even so  it seem clear to me that the downsid risk in the near term outlook is signific greater than the upsid risk  at least for the  e be   i don   t realli see much upsid risk in this situat  and i think we need to recogn that a signific cumul contract can   t be rule out even in the absenc of further terrorist activ  in light of this risk  i think it   s worth note that the  book is project a relat mild and brief recess end in the first quarter of next year   in my view it   s a plausibl point forecast   one reason it   s plausibl is that econom polici and other public polici at the moment are well posit to cushion the downturn that we current anticip   tax cut are in place  rebat have been paid out  and there   s a good likelihood that militari spend will increas   we   re like to see more public spend on secur here at home   perhap most import though  thank to our action over the last decad or more  the fed general as an institut  and fed monetari polici            specif  probabl has as much credibl for low inflat as it has ever had   and inflat expect have been declin so far this year   this to me is the big differ between the situat we face today and the one we face in the earli     s  consequ  i think we can probabl move interest rate still lower without trigger an inflat scare in bond market   the question cathi   rais about what the bond market are tell us with regard to inflat expect is a veri relev one  but there are obvious other potenti plausibl explan for what has been happen in bond market  the  book project assum anoth     point cut in the fund rate befor the end of this year   frank  i think there   s a strong case to go ahead and make that move this morn   have said that  i must say that i believ jack guynn made a veri good point   we have been eas aggress   i have favor this and i   m comfort with it   and i would be comfort with more eas this morn precis becaus of our enhanc credibl   but onc a recoveri get under way  and sooner or later that   s go to happen  i think we   re go to need to revers cours and move in the other direct just as aggress as we   ve eas   that will be necessari in order to maintain our credibl  and in mani way i think that   s the most import thing we have go for us in this situat   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   let me begin with auto   last week on an execut committe confer call one of our director  a banker  report on a convers with one of his custom  an auto dealer   the dealer told the banker that over the prior weekend  septemb        onli four custom even came into the            showroom and he had no sale at all   we  of cours  were interest in follow up on that  so peopl on our staff call auto dealer around the district ye day to get inform on their traffic and sale this past weekend   compar note on what they heard  the staff   s general consensus was that auto dealer were happili surpris not onli by how much traffic they had but by how strong sale were for the weekend  nevertheless  when ask how sale were like to come out for the month overal  the typic respons was that sale were down about    to    percent versus a year ago  howev  and this is a point i   m go to come back to in a moment  it is veri hard to discern a trend in anyth at this stage and will be until the passag of a littl more  e  anoth of our director run a compani that make pastri both for retail use and for what they call institut use  that is  sale to restaur and airlin   last week she said that all six of her airlin custom had call and cancel all order for onboard servic for the forese futur   two of the compani   s other line are corpor gift give  which usual involv gift to employe or supplier  and individu gift give by retail custom   they have had strong sale in individu gift of pastri but a    percent drop in order from corpor   so one can   t draw conclus about ani overal trend from that  we   ve been stay in week contact with repres of feder depart store   as you know  of cours  feder report veri sharp declin in sale immedi after septemb   th   this last weekend  for the four day sell period thursday through sunday  sale were back on plan except in new york citi  again  one cannot discern ani trend from that becaus for the month overal sale will be down veri consider   our contact were veri encourag  howev  we talk to            them ye day  by the volum of traffic and sale over the weekend   nevertheless  they now expect the fourth quarter to be weaker than previous anticip   there   s not much they can do about that   they are current order for next year and they   re go to order less for the spring than they previous thought they would  ye day i receiv the raw data and a preliminari summari of the septemb survey of the nation feder of independ busi   you know how they do that survey  through the cours of the month they get respons to a lot of differ question and then they tri to distil the inform and summar it   those data  too  show the difficulti of draw ani conclus about the trend   almost half of the respons they receiv were date prior to septemb   th and a littl over half were date after septemb   th   base on the survey respons date prior to the   th  the analyst would have drawn the conclus  given the firm in the juli and august data  that septemb would have mark the third month in a row of an improv trend  they would have been tempt to interpret that as indic that activ had seen it low point   the data drop off dramat  of cours  in the post septemb   th report  if one tri to averag togeth the two sub sampl the result would be nonsens  neither period is go to character the month   and that   s where we are stuck   we can   t conclud anyth about the august to septemb data per se   we realli have to view this situat as a break in the seri and tri to find a new base  a new place to start and mayb see a trend form   but that   s go to take a littl more  e for ani dataset  turn to the nation economi  i have no idea what the nation incom account number are go to add up to for the forese futur  either from the product side or from the incom side  let alon how they will break down for various            sector and region and so on   but i don   t think that   s realli the biggest challeng we have   a number of peopl have mention in one way or anoth that uncertainti is an issu   not long ago i thought most of the uncertainti we had to worri about involv develop that might occur outsid the unit state  perhap involv argentina or japan or the launch of the euro or someth els   those concern have not gone away entir but obvious uncertainti within our countri have sudden jump to the top of the list of thing we   re uncertain about   it may well be that we will escap some potenti problem in the intern arena   mayb argentin will not default and spark a crisi   mayb japan has turn a polici corner  mayb the mark to market of equiti portfolio of their bank start ye day will not caus serious problem in their bank industri   mayb the launch of the euro will go well   nevertheless  it seem to me that we   re go to face a protract period of wax and wane of anxieti  with good justif   i would not attach the term    irrat    to the anxieti   i think it is probabl veri ration   but it   s difficult if not imposs to quantifi  and certain we can   t observ it  the committe   s press statement of septemb   th said that we recogn that the actual feder fund rate might be below it target rate on occas in these unusu circumst   i was veri pleas about the inclus of that word and i thought it might continu to be need in our statement for some  e   we   ve had decisionmak period in our histori when the greatest uncertainti were about inflat and inflat psycholog   and in those period we found that it was especi difficult to draw ani conclus from movement in nomin magnitud  so instead we resort to pay more attent to  if not target outright  quantit magnitud             for exact the opposit reason relat to the difficulti of observ inflat psycholog  i think in this period of heighten anxieti we have to think along the same line   if we don   t go all the way to quantiti target i   d at least like to think about a proviso claus as to what we   re will to see happen to nomin interest rate  especi the overnight interbank rate  i don   t expect that at this meet we   re go to chang the statement that accompani our announc   but the statement that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak has becom in effect a proviso claus   it say that if we get more weak data  the fomc may cut the overnight interbank rate some more   if the state fund rate target is not produc an expans in central bank liquid  the monetari base  i would prefer to think in term of our be will to let the rate drift lower   the one thing that we certain would not want to see  as i was suggest earlier in question dino  is a contract in the monetari base   in fact  not onli should growth in the base not be negat  it should be adequ to assur that we accommod the demand we believ exist for base money   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   dave   got us off to a wonder start in admit just how uncertain we are   now we are at least as uncertain but with an unbeliev amount of specif about it  what do we know about the second district   it was weak go into the tragedi and it is weaker now   one of the result of that is go to be a stress on the fiscal situat of new york citi   even so  our analysi to date say that the citi   s fiscal            situat will hold up  that will have some effect on the fiscal situat of new york state as well  we think the  book forecast is as good a forecast as one could make   and we agre with the author that the downsid risk is veri consider  especi in come quarter  and that we don   t know what the longer term is go to look like   the likelihood is that the economi will snap back  as suggest in the forecast  as regard monetari polici  i believ that we are be reward for the high degre of confid in the fed and the greater transpar we have achiev in recent year by the market forecast what i at least think we clear should do at this meet  i believ we would be veri ill advis to test our credibl by say this is what we   re do at this meet but we   re so certain about the futur that we want to put everyon on notic that we may tighten monetari polici some  soon   we don   t know enough to say that   and nobodi expect us to say it   if we say thing that test our credibl in order to show our central banker virtu  i think we will lessen our central banker virtu and certain lessen our credibl   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have said  in the short run we are face potenti the start of a crisi of confid both among busi and household  which is like to interact with the pre exist weak macroeconom environ to lead to a slide in econom activ   both the length and the depth of that slide are uncertain but they could conceiv be longer and deeper than in the baselin forecast   therefor  our challeng today is to take action to attempt to avoid one of the more pessimist consum confid scenario            even befor septemb   th indic of household behavior were somewhat troubl   hous activ and particular singl famili start  which had been a sourc of strength  had soften a bit   consum confid was also slide even befor the attack occur  and that slide of confid has certain continu follow septemb   th   last week   s initi claim for unemploy insur jump  indic further stress for household   with more layoff announc  especi in the airlin sector  and the like multipli effect for relat industri  there is ampl reason to believ that last week   s increas in initi claim is like to be the precursor to further increas in unemploy   against this set of incom data  the  book   s baselin forecast of unemploy reach close to   percent   not seem out of the realm of possibl at all   in the context of such a rise in unemploy  it is unlik that even the few retail that saw a return to plan perform last week can be complac that condit in the household sector will support a return to a reason pace of growth  similar  indic on the busi sector were also mix and negat even befor septemb   th   declin in busi fix invest  particular in the high tech categori  continu unab   inform contact and survey of bank and other busi suggest that the uncertainti about the consum respons to the attack is feed through to uncertainti among busi as well   mani bank report a sharp drop off in demand for busi loan after septemb   th  suggest that small busi in particular are less will to risk capit on expand invest spend dure this period of uncertainti            while the auto industri is struggl to creat demand by provid strong incent  in a survey that straddl the septemb   th date  the napm report that manufactur activ fell again in septemb  mark the fourteenth month of a factori slump  the condit lead to a downward trajectori in the real sector have been reinforc in financi market   over    trillion of equiti wealth has been lost sinc septemb   th  which will almost certain lead to a greater retrench by consum  while equiti indic have declin    to    percent over this intermeet period  fix incom market have not becom more accommod   as for the question cathi   rais  i think that at least in the govern sector the bond market is driven by concern about the budget outlook  sinc the tip market  sn   t seem to indic ani increas in inflat concern   in the below invest grade corpor bond sector  concern about risk seem to be the predomin factor lead long term rate to remain stubborn high   addit  while larg bank claim that they have not tighten term and standard on busi loan sinc the attack  they do admit to watch close for sign of deterior   banker clear understand that default risk has increas  and they will certain act to protect their incom and capit posit as much as possibl  unfortun  the intern sector is unlik to add ani strength to the near term outlook   equiti market in almost all industri economi have been hit by the same reevalu of busi prospect that has affect our equiti market  similar  safe haven flow from the dollar  the euro  and the pound  l into the swiss franc indic that market particip may be rethink the short term prospect for a number of economi            the most posit develop from the intern sector is that oil price seem unlik to spike higher  which is help on the inflat front but indic that the suppli and demand dynam in that market are consist with a futur of slow growth global  against this background  i believ that polici must respond   a number of speaker have rais question about the level of the real interest rate   it   s import to note that sinc      there have been six period of slowdown   dure five of those period  the real interest rate touch zero and dure two of those period it was decid negat   so if we allow the real fed fund rate to drop to zero or close to it through the decis that we make today  that will not in ani sens be unpreced  the market are certain expect a respons today   and i think to disappoint them risk set off a global reaction that might be difficult to control   we are  as other have said  benefit by the fact that both inflat and inflat expect are well contain   it is right to point out that in the longer run we may confront a potenti interact between a s ul monetari polici and a s ul fiscal polici as our monetari polici s ulus and more s ulus from the fiscal side are both call upon to counter the risk of further slow in the economi   but even recogn the challeng that might emerg from unpredict long term polici interact  i believ that we need to set a prioriti today on the immedi macroeconom challeng and the real downsid risk confront us in the near term   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  my congratul to the  book staff for a fine job under imposs condit   howev  as the author            themselv are at pain to point out  this and all other forecast today can have onli a limit credibl   this is evidenc by the quit appropri wide spectrum of the altern scenario  sever of which are virtual as plausibl as the baselin forecast itself   yet polici must be made   how are we to meet that necess  i felt earlier and feel today that monetari polici made it most import contribut to revers this cycl over the first half of the year  and i   m proud of what was done by this committe   given what is alreadi in the pipelin  togeth with the possibl of somewhat lower rate  polici seem veri support   chang from here on will like play a relat minor role compar to develop in fiscal polici  consum confid  and the progress of the war on terror   monetari polici was  in my opinion  a key posit forc earlier  but the focus today may be to ensur that it   not becom a negat factor in the econom equat   how could that happen  in the short run  this may be one of those veri strang  e when appear could be the most import realiti   the fed is on the recoveri team  of cours   but we must be seen to be on that team by the man on the street  both on main street and wall street   to be so perceiv will be a posit forc for recoveri  wherea to be seen otherwis could be a major negat   as our nation struggl to recov from a major trauma  surpris the market could be an addit trauma we just do not need right now   this condit will hope chang soon and the day will like come when a polici surpris will be appropri  but not today   fortun  mr  chairman  inflat is most like go to trend downward over the forecast period  give the committe some further room to maneuv and  e to revers cours in an order manner            i believ the committe will soon be face two success set of challeng and the sooner the better in each case   the first will be when and how to termin this eas cycl when the economi stabil   we obvious are not to that point yet   i hope the end of our eas process will be follow short by the second challeng  determin how and when it will be necessari to begin to damp the enorm amount of s ul that has been and will be pump into this economi first by monetari polici and soon by fiscal polici   i believ the committe may be entitl to take some satisfact in the role polici has play in recent year  but the futur will probabl prove to be at least equal as challeng as the past   what is need today  howev  seem pretti straightforward   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i found the altern simul provid by the staff in the latest  book to be especi use   given the except degre of uncertainti that we now face  the altern scenario help us to better appreci the rang of outcom   but in addit  they allow me to easili craft my own forecast by ad the altern scenario direct to the baselin subject to my person assess of the probabl associ with each   when i began this exercis i thought that it would allow me to present to you an interest  even compel  altern to the  book forecast   to my surpris  and i must say disappoint  i found that when i complet this exercis  the altern scenario turn out to be remark offset   that left me  no doubt  with the same uncertainti as the staff had  and equal like to be wrong  but with a forecast that turn out to be remark similar to the baselin   while we face enorm uncertainti as i indic  i think this            sort of experi add a littl to the credibl of the baselin   i did wonder a bit if the staff might have been play some game by offer us a seri of altern that they knew were entir offset just to reinforc the baselin   but     assur me that this was an accid of good fortun rather than a strategi  i find that it   s use in my own think to separ the forecast horizon into two sub period   the near term cover the next two or three quarter and the remaind is the period through        it seem to me that there are two key driver of the near term forecast   the first is the momentum in the economi prior to septemb   th   the second is the effect of the event of septemb   th through disrupt to key industri and via consum and busi sen ent   with respect to the momentum  some saw the data immedi preced septemb   th as veri encourag and signal that the economi was pois for a rebound   other interpret the veri same data as indic that the economi had at most stabil at a growth rate not much differ from zero  and they were still revis down their forecast  i think there was ampl scope in the data to support both of these differ interpret  but i was in the latter camp   and the more pessimist interpret suggest that addit eas would have been justifi in the absenc of the event of septemb   th   in part for that reason  my point of departur for the forecast was the altern simul with easier money polici  but the event of septemb   th clear call for a downward revis to the near term forecast  at least to the es  of the third quarter and the forecast for the fourth quarter and like into earli        becaus a downward impetus to a consider degre reflect an assess of the psycholog effect of the event of septemb              th  the uncertainti about the forecast is an order of magnitud abov normal   but my judgment is that over this  e frame the risk are more like asymmetr toward still weaker growth   so i give some consider weight     to    percent  to the altern simul of a collaps in consum and busi confid   have said that  the downsid risk seem to be most acut in the fourth quarter becaus i   m also go to give veri high weight to the altern simul of major fiscal s ulus   and by the first quarter  that also begin to weigh in import  there is littl that monetari polici can do through tradit channel to spur demand over this  e frame   howev  there might be and probabl would be some salutari effect by bol  confid in the futur   what we do and what we say should be design to contribut to this end  and i think governor   made that point extrem well  a second consider concern the implic for monetari polici of the evolut of overal financi condit   onc again  we   re confront by a shock that has had direct effect both on financi condit  specif on equiti price  and on aggreg demand abov and beyond the effect on equiti price   monetari polici has to move aggress enough to counter at least the advers effect on overal financi condit befor it can hope to make a net contribut to offset the direct effect on aggreg demand  over the remaind of the forecast horizon it seem to me that the fiscal assumpt begin to domin the forecast  complement by the detail of the intern dynam of recoveri as consum sen ent and hope equiti price rebound   in addit  the latter develop should be reinforc by the delay contribut of the            forc we expect to support recoveri befor the event of septemb   th  includ a rebound in high tech invest after a sharp and prolong retrench and a return to inventori accumul after liquid run it cours  now  beyond the nearer term period it seem to me that the risk turn to the upsid  at least after mid      and especi into        my read is that the fiscal s ulus will be an order of magnitud abov that in the  book baselin  someth closer to the major fiscal s ulus simul   over this  e frame  therefor  perhap the key question is what monetari polici is a good fit with the assum fiscal s ulus  there is a potenti that an earlier and more aggress revers of recent and prospect monetari eas will ul  be call for than may be contempl at this point  still  there   s ampl scope for addit monetari polici eas over the near term   in part this reflect the fact that  given the prospect of a rise in the unemploy rate to the   percent rang  we should now be target a period of abov trend growth   so  wherea befor we might have thought that we need s ulus to get econom growth back to trend as quick as possibl  now if we end up with someth that was less than a percentag point abov trend i think we   d be disappoint   we could probabl toler someth even stronger than that for awhil   nevertheless  as a number have alreadi suggest  monetari polici will face the challeng at some point dure the second period and beyond of a  e return toward neutral  i think the other issu relat to the strategi of monetari polici relat to the  e of ani cumul declin in the fund rate   most of the bad macroeconom news in particular relat to higher unemploy that lie ahead and like will extend at least through the middl of next year   in evalu what we do today  we should pay some            attent to how much more of a cumul declin might be justifi given the forecast we now hold   and then we need to consid how we should spread the chang out over  e so that we don   t end up do more than we would prefer to do   in addit  we might worri a bit about how we should signal market about our futur intent so that we don   t face market pressur again to move further than would be prudent   i must say  howev  that i don   t think that is realli a stori of today  but a stori of what we do at subsequ meet   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   we   ve often spoken about the valu of confid in econom relationship   confid is a variabl that is a direct term in no econom equat but is a key factor in almost all of them  consumpt  invest  employ  stock market  risk discount  foreign trade  capit flow  and on down the list   the macroeconom implic of a serious loss of confid could be enorm   so what is the evid   it has onli been three week sinc the attack and alreadi there is a great deal of evid that confid is erod   if you hadn   t call a break  i was go to go through this list realli quick   i will still go through it quick but a littl less so now    laughter   one piec of evid is travel demand  which is definit down   anoth is consum confid and dave   talk about that   layoff have risen   we see evid in financi variabl  the stock market  risk spread on lesser rate bond  earli sign of impli credit market volatil   there   s some evid that even hous demand and auto sale may be down in the period sinc septemb   th            there are two indic on which i   m not quit sure about the  e   one  which    son spoke about alreadi  is the foreign sector   it   s a littl hard to tell what occur befor and after septemb   th  but it   s clear that the news there isn   t good   anoth is commod price  which have drop sharpli   i   ve often spoken about those befor as a precursor of inflat   the staff has been persuad me that they may be an even better precursor of output demand  but whatev the case they are down sharpli  a last issu is the forecast of other   the nabe took a survey of their forecast sinc the event   eighteen out of    of them had a signific more pessimist outlook   i   m not sure that they know ani more than our forecast  but all forecast seem to be move in one direct  this all set up what i see as a difficult polici problem   the attack could be a major demand shock or a minor one  for a long period or a short period   just how do we respond   on the fiscal side i think there are at least two thing that fiscal polici should do   there should be expenditur for militari and other secur measur and compens for the direct vic    whether fiscal polici ought to do anyth beyond that  i find a difficult question   but if more s ulus is requir  i   d like to see it provid in a way that  sn   t dissip the long term budget surplus  nation save  and the low long term interest rate that have been a hallmark of the recent period  on the monetari side  i also see the need for action   monetari polici can be chang quick   it can be use flexibl and it can be revers just as quick should circumst chang   as a number of you have said  this latter properti is veri import right now  given the massiv uncertainti   the combin of short term fiscal            eas and monetari eas i think is our best hope for keep the economi as strong as possibl in both the short run and the long run   thank
thank you   let   s move on to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as note in th committe   s announc of two week ago  the terrorist attack subject an alreadi weak economi to a further downward shock  just befor septemb   th aggreg demand appar was still be imped by an ongo downdraft in invest  as firm correct a previous over expans of capit equip  and the result declin in employ and equiti price threaten to sap consum spend   as note in the  book  firm evid that the downdraft was begin to abat had not emerg and the econom forecast probabl would again have been mark down and the anticip strengthen push further into the futur   the attack themselv disrupt busi transact for a  e and appar have heighten concern about the futur  like restrain spend even more and further delay the resumpt of solid growth  a signific eas of financi condit would seem to be call for to counter the effect of the unexpect weak in demand from these various sourc   while such an eas might have littl effect on the near term perform of the economi  it would appropri give ad impetus to an eventu return to full resourc util   when the economi ul  strengthen  it seem inevit that it will resum growth from a base of a appreci lower level of resourc util than today or than you might have expect at your august meet  yet financi condit have not eas appreci sinc late august   the pullback of investor in the face of percept of higher risk and weaker spend prospect appar has offset the effect of the    basi point of eas you put in place two week ago and the further feder fund rate reduct now built into financi market price   broad measur of equiti price have fallen    to    percent sinc the august fomc meet and risk spread have widen for all but the highest rate busi   inde  bond rate for mani busi are unchang or even up consider   in addit  the averag valu of the dollar on foreign exchang market has appreci slight  with market strong anticip a further decreas in your feder fund rate target at this meet  hold polici unchang            like would tighten financi condit substanti   thus  the question face you today would seem to be not whether to eas further  but by how much   market observ believ that your debat will be between    and    basi point reduct in the fund rate  the choic between these two would seem to depend not onli on the most like outcom for the economi under the two altern  but the risk around that modal outcom and the cost of miss to one side or the other  the choic of a    basi point eas would be justifi by concern that a larger action at this  e could lead to polici becom so accommod over come month that the rebound in demand begin next year would be sharp enough to add to inflat pressur befor a polici revers could contain them effect   a major uncertainti in the outlook is the stanc of fiscal polici   unless sign surfac veri quick that near term econom distress is abat  a process of polit compromis by inclus could well produc a substanti more expans polici than is built into the staff forecast   when the result s ulus will hit the economi depend  of cours  on the natur of the program that are enact   as next year goe on  howev  aggreg demand could well be boost by the effect of expansionari fiscal and monetari polici just as the intern dynam of strengthen privat demand take hold follow the work down of inventori and invest good overhang  privat demand also may be subject to upsid as well as to the numer downsid risk   one possibl is that a good part of the cutback in spend in the last few week will turn out to be transitori   as the natur of the countermeasur against terror becom clearer and more focus  as some success are regist and secur in the air and elsewher is improv  uncertainti will narrow and some of the initi fear and percept of risk will decreas  fo  a return toward less distort econom interact and decis   the rise in equiti price and declin in risk premium over the last week may alreadi have reflect some movement in this direct   should activ rebound fair strong next year  upward pressur on wage and price are like to emerg at consider lower level of resourc util than in the second half of the     s   the slower growth of structur product that seem to be in train would tend to boost unit labor cost at a  e when profit margin have alreadi been squeez   slimmer margin provid consider induc for busi to pass labor cost through into price and are like to mute the competit forc that make such a pass through difficult  especi if  at the same  e             higher real interest rate induc by expans fiscal polici milit against cost save capit deepen  although market would be somewhat disappoint by a    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate target  the backup in other interest rate and the declin in equiti price like would be limit by a sens that the fomc was simpli wait for more definit evid of the dimens of the respons of demand to the attack and was prepar to eas further  even within the intermeet period  should the emerg inform warrant   the total amount of addit eas built into the structur of market interest rate   now between    and     basi point  probabl would be trim onli a littl   you may see these expect as a reason assess of the amount of eas need to promot a satisfactori strengthen of the economi in      and        you may also see the result expect as repres a high like polici outcom as well after a    basi point reduct at this meet  given the possibl of further committe action as employ and product declin over the next sever month  but given the shock to the economi and the absenc of ani appar eas in financi condit note at the begin of my discuss  the committe may prefer a more aggress polici action and want to lower the feder fund rate by    basi point at this meet  the potenti for inflat pressur to mount as the economi rebound must be weigh against the likelihood of a prolong period of weak that open up a sizabl output gap  inde  the baselin forecast in the  book describ the latter outcom   while that forecast assum    basi point of eas over the fourth quarter  it assess of like demand and resourc pressur would seem to suggest that an immedi reduct in the feder fund rate of    basi point would run minim risk of higher inflat emerg befor countervail polici action had a chanc to be felt   and  as shown in an altern  book simul  stronger fiscal s ulus   not materi deflect the economi from the disinflationari track of the baselin project  if the headwind face the economi for a  e are on the order of magnitud of those embodi in the staff forecast  a feder fund rate that is    basi point lower would not be all that accommod   in real term  such a rate would still be posit by mani measur and abov it level in previous period of econom weak  for exampl the earli     s   with limit net financi s ulus in the pipelin even under this easier altern  recoveri import depend on the resili of the privat economi as excess are work down and under invest incent remain in place  with an extra push            from fiscal polici   easier monetari polici itself can   t address the under uncertainti and overhang weigh on demand  but it can help to buoy asset price and lower the cost of credit at least a littl relat to a smaller eas move  moreov  in an uncertain environ  the larger action avoid the potenti for especi advers effect on confid and risk take were the committe seen to be less aggress than anticip   for this and other reason  you may judg the probabl that insuffici accommod polici would accentu a process of progress econom weaken that would be difficult to revers as appreci larger in the current circumst than the probabl that too s ul a polici would intensifi inflat pressur  save polici    ammunit    for later could creat a situat in which much more eas is requir befor long to counter cumul weak   of cours  anticipatori and aggress polici can lead to overshoot  but  by head off worsen situat  it also is like to requir smaller total action than   polici that move more gradual  market particip are like to build in onli a littl  if ani  more eas go forward should you lower the fund rate by    basi point at this meet  given the high odd they have alreadi put on this action   and their expect of such a sizabl move at this meet have not led them to anticip a number of further such declin in the futur   the yield curv incorpor an addit    to    basi point of rate reduct by earli next year follow by a subsequ rise in rate   financi market particip evid believ that you can eas aggress and then stop and revers in a  e fashion   judg from the declin in tip spread in recent week  the sticki of long term rate has been a respons to more expans fiscal polici rather than a reflect of rise inflat expect as the path of the fund rate has been mark down  although a cut in the feder fund rate target at this meet would bring the cumul chang in this rate to     or     basi point sinc late august  you may well see the risk to your object in the forese futur as still tilt toward econom weak  econom activ is almost certain to be quit soft in the near term  and the committe would probabl want evid on the like extent of the cutback in privat demand and the impetus from fiscal polici befor it could judg that this weak was like to be balanc by a strong rebound a few quarter henc
question for don   presid parri
don  i   d like to ask you and dave a question about the chart and tabl in the bluebook on chart   follow page      we   ve talk a bit about the equilibrium real rate as a way to measur the current stanc of polici   if one believ that the equilibrium real rate is within the rang of the shade area  the rang has gotten so larg that it lead one to believ  base on the treasuri inflat index secur  that our polici is incred expans   on the other hand  if one look at some of the lower es   particular the one base on histor data and the staff forecast  it appear as if we   re provid an anem amount of s ulus   i was think that perhap you have some feel or view about what rate within this histor wide rang it might be reason for us to focus on
i think the rang is particular wide becaus the staff forecast is drag down the lower end of that rang   the calcul equilibrium rate that tend to bring the rang down are the one that includ the staff es  of the restrain effect of both the pre septemb   th and post septemb   th shock to demand    if you  think the staff forecast is a reason es  of where the economi will go  or at least a reason mode of that es   then someth toward the lower end of that rang probabl is where you would think the rate is   also  have the third quarter inflat  index secur at a     percent real rate  sn   t reflect the most recent declin in that rate   that rate has declin some over the third quarter and i don   t know what the forward rate deriv from that would look like if we did it today   my guess is that it would be at least a number of tenth lower than shown in this chart   the tip rate reflect peopl   s expect about fiscal polici   that   s a rate deriv from go out on the yield curv  so it embodi the effect of the more expansionari fiscal polici as that            polici kick in later next year and in futur year   the elev level is a reflect of that steep upward slope of the yield curv  part suppli induc and part i think macroeconom induc in the sens of the effect of fiscal polici over come quarter   but probabl somewher out later next year and in follow year the calcul would have interest rate be push up as a reflect of the expect turnaround in monetari polici
so you think the degre of monetari eas is  pick one   huge  moder  or meager
i think right now it   s moder and i  well  i won   t give a polici  recommend    laughter
may i make a suggest   whi don   t you have dave   talk to you about this   he   s got it down pat
it   s a littl easier for me to answer this question becaus in some sens i would look at the line on chart   label    frb us model  base on histor data and the staff forecast    as someth that would approxim our best guess as to what the equilibrium rate is   therefor  i   d have to say monetari polici provid a small to moder amount of s ulus   i would hate to depress you further about this analysi  howev  by point out that each one of these es  has a signific confid interv   the bottom edg of that shade area is not the full confid rang that one could have
i knew you wouldn   t disappoint me    laughter
i   m go to stop right there
actual  i was go to ask about what you just discuss  so i withdraw the question in the interest of move thing along
i want to follow up on that discuss of the equilibrium real rate becaus i think mani of us have come to believ that inform on this  if we had confid in it  is veri valuabl to our set of polici   i applaud the research that the staff has been do on this subject  i think it alreadi has provid a lot of insight and has been veri use   i have to say  howev  that i have a high degre of skeptic about the amount of short term variat in the staff measur of the equilibrium real rate  i think that at this point our methodolog hasn   t realli allow us to separ out veri effect cyclic from longer term influenc   so i think the issu need some more thought   for one  the path of the equilibrium real rate has so much sensit to near term data that i think ani es  that is not base upon a forecast that goe out at least five year for exampl  and return to some sens of normal  has to be discount consider   but i think that   s work for the futur
anybodi els   in keep with the way dave   start off this discuss  i   ll continu   i think the wide rang of uncertainti regard what has happen and what is about to happen has been fulli explor here and i believ veri effect so   we learn a lot about the uncertainti that we face just by listen to those who are involv in evalu recent develop  for exampl  what the individu presid have said about what is go on in their district   and i think the degre of humil that the rest of us have express about our understand is            a measur of the fact that we are inde deal with a situat that is extraordinarili uncertain  the one area that has not been mention  which i believ requir a bit of discuss  is the veri dramat declin that we have had in equiti asset price   we are talk about loss in the last week or so of more than a trillion dollar in the valu of stock market hold   what we know about this sort of phenomenon is that it has a realli signific impact   while it may be difficult to make a judgment as to the magnitud of that impact  we do have to have some sens of what the appropri valu of stock ought to be or what equiti premium ought to be in the context of what we perceiv to be the long term equilibrium real feder fund rate   the work that has been done around here suggest  adjust with all due humil  that the equiti market is still slight abov where it ought to be   that is not an import issu in and of itself  but what is import is histori   histori suggest that market do not go from over valuat to normal valuat and stay there   it suggest that market almost invari over adjust in the opposit direct   that in turn suggest to me that the notion that somehow we are beyond ani further deflat from the asset side is at least open to serious question   i don   t pretend to say that the adjust process need to occur veri quick   inde  one scenario could involv a veri larg adjust in equiti price  a coupl of year of hiatus  and then anoth adjust   clear  that is not a noncred scenario   we have seen it in the past  all i want to indic here is that the risk clear are on the downsid   and without get into more discuss on the issu  i would mere say that what we ought to do  as i think most of the peopl around this tabl alreadi have suggest  is to eas            by    basi point and retain the statement indic that the risk are tilt toward econom weak   the pluse and the minus have been fulli explor  and i think that would be the appropri polici at this point   vice chair

i support your recommend
i support your recommend   i would make just a coupl of quick comment that relat to the chart we were talk about a minut ago   one way i look at that was to ask the question   go forward  which mistak do we most want to avoid   given the fragil and the psycholog of the market  i think we most want to avoid not appear to be will to take this action   so what you propos is exact what i want   second  i would like to say ditto to what the vice chairman said earlier   i expect  and mayb hope  that we will have to revers this eas move   but i think the market is alreadi think about that   we don   t need to say it   and it is probabl better if our statement is shorter rather than longer   thank you

i support it
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support the    basi point reduct in the target rate today  but for the period between now and the next meet  i think the statement that was includ in our announc of the   th is probabl go to be need again   as the presid said  the terrorist decid when and how this start   the unit state and it alli will decid when and how it end   we don   t know when that   s go to be   if there is anoth occas of great heighten anxieti  i would hope that the desk would again be will to let the fund rate trade as low as necessari to provid adequ liquid
the market will assum that
yes  i agre with the vice chair   inde  one of the thing we haven   t discuss relat to the implic of anoth episod   my impress is that in such an event we will do what we   ve done in the past   we would issu an fomc statement at that  e indic in effect what you   re suggest   i prefer not to put that into the statement today  i think it complic it and probabl isn   t necessari   presid santomero

mr  chairman  i support your recommend  but i would like to add a comment   we   ve talk a lot about busi and consum confid  and i think the state of confid is not independ of our own visibl   let me emphas that point by assum someth contrari to fact becaus i think it will make the point clear   suppos all of us who are common out on the road from  e to  e give speech and talk to the press were to withdraw from that activ   i think that would send a veri bad messag to the market   it would say that we   re terrifi to fli and that we   re terrifi to talk becaus we might say someth that would upset the market   i think it   s import that we be visibl   we should work to resum a sens of normal  and the messag that we all agre on around the tabl is the one that we should be state public   the economi has excel long run prospect  our economi and societi have strong fundament to deal with the short run uncertainti  but there is no way to forecast what that short run is go to look like and  therefor  we   re not go to offer such a forecast   for us to hunker down and disappear becaus we   re afraid of say someth that might be wrong or misinterpret is onli go to tend to erod public confid
no  i think hunker down was the appropri thing to do right after the shock
right  but we   re now three week beyond that shock
yes  i agre with you   there   s certain no need for us to chang our normal practic   i do think our degre of uncertainti is higher  but that   s the natur of the game
well  i just want to make that point clear becaus i feel veri strong that we must not disappear
no  i agre with that
mr  chairman  could i add a comment to that
it isn   t alway necessari to be speak to the press in order to be seen as visibl within the district   i   ve done more outreach than usual sinc septemb   th to ani number of group without appear in the press one  e   and i feel comfort  though i know the rang of uncertainti is wide  that becaus of that activ i have some feel of what is go on  much more so than if i had made a dozen speech   that   s becaus these interact give us more inform and they involv less effort and worri than speak to the press  with all the prepar that goe into that   so i think it   s someth that we all ought to think about care as we balanc how to spend our  e
i agre with your recommend  mr  chairman   i don   t think today is the  e to take a risk of advers affect busi confid
