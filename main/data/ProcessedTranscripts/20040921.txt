good morn  everyon   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut for our august    meet
without object  they are approv   dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that   low circul a short  e ago   in the intermeet period  market were general calm  and investor perceiv event with a general posit outlook   despit the committe   s tighten of polici on august     yield fell across the coupon curv  spread narrow  equiti rose  and asset market continu to exhibit unusu low volatil   the top panel on the first page graph the three month deposit rate in black and the three month rate three  six  and nine month forward in the dash red line sinc mid june  the cash rate rose commensur with the increas in the target fed fund rate   but forward rate have been fall gentl at the same  e  appar as the softer data and more tepid corpor outlook caus market particip to revis their expect path of further monetari tighten   the coupon curv has also declin   two year treasuri yield  which tend to be veri sensit to the fund rate  held firm and actual declin a few basi point sinc the last meet  as shown in the middl left panel   but the ten year yield continu to fall   this morn the yield was at      percent  not far from the mid march low befor the strong april employ report   at this point the ten year yield is again close to hit level that may trigger mortgag hedg activ that could send yield lower   in part the fall in yield seem associ with the softer data   the revis and lower forecast   and in part the persist of high oil price  the market is view higher oil price as a restrain forc far more than as an inflationari one   the net result is that the yield curv has continu to flatten   a flatten yield curv is not unusu in a tighten cycl   but the typic pattern is that the short end rise fa  than the long end   which also rise   this cycl has had the anomal situat in which the veri short end is rise and the rest of the curv is fall   how unusu is this cycl   the top of page   graph the chang in the two year yield measur in basi point index to the date of the first tighten in recent   the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix       cycl   for       the mini cycl of             and        i did not includ earlier cycl given the differ polici and oper environ prior to        as this graph show  the red line depict      stand out in that yield have fallen   we see the same pattern for ten year yield in the middl panel   final  the bottom panel graph the chang in the swap spread also on the same basi   this last item has more variabl  but again this cycl stand out in that spread have actual narrow sinc the begin of the tighten cycl   admit this is a limit sampl  and one can argu whether      should even be includ  but it is notabl in ani case that the market   s reaction has progress becom more benign as the committe has becom more transpar and the communic polici has evolv   move to page    breakeven rate on tip have narrow and that fall even acceler as the price of oil again head higher in recent week   wherea earlier this year the correl between tip breakeven and oil price chang was posit  it has now turn negat   again suggest that the econom tax of higher oil price is view as a more power forc than it inflationari impact   the middl panel graph corpor and emerg market spread  which continu to narrow  corpor issuanc was on the low side  while investor    search for yield continu  and after a soggi juli  equiti price have risen sinc your last meet despit some downbeat corpor outlook  the summer slowdown in retail sale  and a buildup of inventori in part of the tech sector   extend this favor pictur is the continu low volatil in mani market  page   graph the impli volatil for the s p      the major currenc pair  and repres swaption contract   these are similar to graph i present at the last meet  so i won   t go through them in ani detail but onli to note that impli volatil remain low and in some case are go still lower   the vix equiti impli volatil index is at about    percent  it lowest level in about a decad   this combin of low volatil  narrow spread  stabl or rise equiti price  and lower yield  even in the face of tighten monetari polici  is about as benign an environ as one can imagin   what is unclear is whether this happi set of condit will persist or whether this is the calm befor the storm   one market that did see a bit of volatil dure the intermeet period was the fed fund market   after my june brief  when i describ how the fed fund market had becom less volatil  this is a develop i should have anticip    laughter  iron probabl the main reason for the volatil around the  e of the last committe meet is the transpar of monetari polici and the confid this give reserv manag at bank to buy reserv to meet requir befor a well anticip rate increas   i   d like to spend the rest of my brief on this topic   but let me step back a bit to summar what we at the desk do on a day to day basi   keep the fund rate close to it target involv provid enough reserv over a mainten period to allow bank to achiev two object   first  the inject reserv should allow the bank to meet all their requir as well as their   precautionari demand for excess reserv   second  the reserv need to be inject at a measur pace to avoid undu risk that some bank will end ani day overdrawn or that some bank will accumul so mani reserv earli in the mainten period that they risk hold unwant excess level by the end of the period   but manag reserv becom more complic when there is a great degre of certainti regard chang to the target fed fund rate around fomc meet date   when the expect of a potenti rate hike becom price into the interest rate futur market  these expect also begin to show through to the fund rate in the day of the mainten period immedi prior to an fomc meet at which an increas in the polici rate is anticip   reserv manag begin to shift their demand for balanc to meet more of their reserv requir ahead of the meet  when rate are expect to be relat cheap   this reaction was exhibit dure the reserv mainten period lead up to the august    increas in the fed fund target  as shown in the shade portion of the top panel on page     that panel depict the target fund rate in black and the effect rate in the horizont red line  along with the high and low for each day  with near certainti that the committe would rais the target fund rate  the incent for reserv manag was to accumul reserv and bid up the fund rate   the desk sought to lean against those pressur by ad more reserv than is typic at that point in the reserv mainten period   the   line in the bottom panel graph the averag level of excess balanc in that period compar with more normal level  the blue line   perhap the fund rate would have been even firmer had we not ad the extra reserv   howev  as we wit in that reserv mainten period  there are tradeoff in how the desk react to a wide anticip rate hike  the ad reserv may be of limit effect if expect are veri firm  and ani buildup of high cumul excess reserv balanc in the bank system dure the first half of the mainten period will leav bank hold a much higher than normal level of reserv than they typic want at that stage in a period onc the meet date has pass   that could possibl set up condit in which downward pressur on rate would emerg   whether the fund target was rais at the meet or not   this risk materi after the august meet becaus the desk did not feel that it had the scope to reduc cumul excess posit follow the meet date  given the upcom high payment flow day of the treasuri   s mid quarter refund settlement on august     to do so seem like to exacerb the expect upward rate pressur anticip on that day   as we wit dure this period  the high cumul excess posit eventu led to veri high level of volatil   the latter work their way into trade as the end of the mainten period approach  with trade well below the new target rate as well   at the same  e  it   s question what impact the high level of excess reserv provid earli in the period had in damp rate pressur befor the chang was announc   evid suggest that that effect was onli limit     as the desk will continu to face these challeng in a rise interest rate environ  it may be prudent to battl firm trade condit less aggress prior to a wide anticip hike in the fund rate   while provid some level of reserv in excess of median level in the midst of firm trade may be warrant  we are like to be cautious in our provis  recogn the risk that aris from high cumul balanc subsequ to the actual rate movement   mr  chairman  there were no foreign exchang oper in the period   i should note that tomorrow will mark four year sinc the last intervent by the u s  monetari author   this continu the longest period of non intervent by the u s  monetari author in the float rate period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
shouldn   t your next to last sentenc be     note and compliment       laughter   whi do we bother interven at all in the function of reserv market a week or so befor an fomc meet
well  that   s an excel question   the charg that i at least believ i have from this committe is to achiev
that is readili chang    laughter
well  okay   but in the regim under which we are now oper  as far as i   m awar i   m expect to tri to achiev the target fed fund rate everi day   so despit the fact that the market is expect a higher fund rate  until the committe decid to rais it rate object  we   re still work under the old direct
if i might say so  it sound absurd on the surfac  and it sound absurd beneath the surfac as well    laughter
but  mr  chairman  the altern would put dino in the posit of give a signal of your action at the upcom meet
all he need to do is to state what his intent are in advanc   in other word  he can indic that he will suppli a certain amount of reserv over a   specif period   the current approach is clear not the op  polici procedur   i   m not sure it   s do ani harm or caus problem  but i can conceiv of a situat in which we might find that the inject of reserv on the upsid or on the downsid lead to an inadvert effect if an extern event occur in the process when you   re reestablish the balanc later in the mainten period
well  what you   re suggest would make our task easier   we felt somewhat uncomfort with the result in that final reserv mainten period in august  so i think do what you suggest would make our life a lot easier
may i make a request   i   d like to ask you and   to be a committe of two to do an analysi of this problem   and then will you submit possibl altern to the current procedur at the next fomc meet
is there agreement on that   or would somebodi like to make a comment
of cours  i have no object to a studi   but i think   has it right when he say that the implic of the regim you are propos  which as i understand it is for the desk to pre commit to some amount of reserv that it is go to add independ of
i   m say that may be a possibl   let me put it to you this way   all i can say is that  on the surfac  the way we   re do this now  sn   t seem right to me   to be sure  we   ve gone through this experi sever  e  and it has had no advers consequ  the reason it has had no consequ  possibl  is that there were no interven event in the rest of the mainten period that requir an adjust   now  it may turn out   upon review this issu that the exist polici has no altern  but i doubt it   let me withdraw my request at this point becaus i had assum the need to look at this was self evid  but it is not self evid   as a consequ  i think we ought to open the matter up for further discuss   are there ani other comment on this issu   presid
i   m total confus here   i thought the volatil came about as a result of dino   s implement the exist direct of the feder open market committe   i would not like to see him implement anyth other than that until the committe meet and adopt a new direct   mayb i   m misunderstand you   i must be
well  there have been veri serious question over the year about whether the desk should be tri to lock in the desir feder fund rate everi singl day  so  first of all  the fund rate has not been at     percent
correct   it hasn   t
so whether that degre of rigid should be involv here is no longer an issu   it   s now a question of the degre of deviat from the object  not whether there should be ani deviat   in that sens  if we want to read the direct explicit  dino has breach the author given him   which i   m glad he did
yes   i tend to think of it as two forc at work  there   s the market and then there   s dino   dino is tri to do what we told him to do  and the market is tri to do what it want to do   i agre with you that there may be some way to look at an averag target over a period of day   i just thought you were say that he
well  i think it would be veri awkward to have ani kind of pre commit   i   m not sure if that   s the right word   about reserv unless we were to do that in everi period
there could be other way of do it   i don   t necessarili see all of the commentari about desk oper   has anybodi comment on specif deviat from the fund rate target   other than the obvious anticipatori arbitrag against a potenti rise
no   this situat has arisen onli around the fomc meet  it is just in the mainten period encompass a meet when this sort of activ begin   in the previous period of this intermeet interv we were  as you know  close to the     percent object   but as soon as we got into the current mainten period on thursday  bank began tri to build up reserv and to buy them cheapli   that   s all peopl are say   and they figur we   re manag reserv to meet demand
rememb  there   s anoth aspect of this   by committe desir  we have been chang the fund rate onli at meet  that was not the case in the past  so there   s anoth element implicit in this to which the market is adjust   all i   m say  though  is that the current practic   not seem to me to be the op um  thorough thought out procedur to guard against the one singl issu that we haven   t face   a shock in the mainten period subsequ to the committe   s decis
have a two week reserv mainten period and oper on a daili basi to achiev the fund target daili will result in the market tri to anticip move that may happen within the mainten period   it   s not a stabl equilibrium   we   d have to give it some thought  but i   m not sure what the obvious solut to that is
well  there are numer peopl around this tabl who are far more familiar with the actual mechan oper on a day by day basi than i   but just   look at the final result  it seem clear to me that someth here  sn   t work as well as it should and that there may be better way of do it   that   s all i   m say
we often consid altern way of implement polici  and in light of this discuss  the committe of two will look into the issu  for sure  mr  chairman   i would just note anoth observ that dino made in his brief  which is that impli volatil are quit low   so the cost associ with a somewhat more volatil overnight rate  sn   t have much consequ if the committe also has anchor down expect about the target rate
and no advers event occur dure the mainten period   it   s onli that that matter   there   s no credibl argument  if there is no advers event  that these intra mainten period fluctuat have ani last signific  as best i can tell
and i   d make anoth observ   if one look at the pattern of fed fund futur contract  in the month in which there are no meet schedul  one can see that the probabl of an intermeet move has gone down to as low as it get   the committe   s decis to remov polici accommod at a measur pace has signal to market that it   s a decis that is made at meet   so they have a fix target  and that  therefor  put dino in the sight of the fed fund trader   but the consequ  in normal  e  seem fair manag
the way we oper  dino is ask to suppli reserv against two differ demand curv   a mainten period demand curv and a daili demand curv   and there   s a yield curv relationship within a mainten period that tie the daili rate togeth  to ask him to make the fund rate do this step function i think is ask a lot   that would be   ask him to disrupt market to some extent on a day to day basi  push against the fear of overdraft and the fear of lock in on the part of bank   that  sn   t seem to make sens to me either   to     s point  the fed fund futur market build in an expect of this step function   what we   re ask dino to do is not to fight against that   we   re not ask him to tip our hand  we   re ask him to go along with what the yield curv say about what the rate is go to do after the meet   i don   t see that as prejud the committe   s discret
i   m not sure
i   m not sure
i would be veri  veri care about ask the desk to do anyth that seem to prejudg what our action would be at the next meet   moreov  it could be that the cost of have the desk not prejudg that   the cost of this veri aggress daili suppli of reserv  which we   ve gone to more and more over the last few year   is a littl more fluctuat in excess reserv   if the desk suppli reserv on a daili basi  with contract that matur frequent  i   m not sure what the problem is
should the desk today and ye day creat suffici reserv to keep the fund rate at     percent
he   s not do it right
well  he   s tri
now  wait a second   he has no limit on the amount of reserv he can creat at will   you cannot tell me he is tri and fail  he   s just not push the button hard enough
mr  chairman  if i could   one thing that presid   point out is that  if we oper more than onc on the first day of the reserv mainten period  we could creat as much reserv as possibl  and we   d probabl do a better job of achiev the target rate on that first day   the cost of that  though  is that in subsequ day we might have a veri low fund rate for the rest of the reserv mainten period   therefor  over the period as a whole we might have a rate that is below the target   so there is a tradeoff here
i didn   t mean to get into this    laughter   unless other wish to rais signific issu about this today  let me ask you the follow     everybodi agre that this is a subject that we should at least get some further insight into and that we should leav it to our two profession in this area to advis us   go ahead  governor bie
i just want to add one other point   one of the reason this is happen is that we   re communic so well and we have a lot of credibl   everi desk manag and everi banker know pretti much when rate are go to move  and we give them the luxuri of a two week period in which to meet their requir reserv   so when a bank has two week to meet that requir and can save    basi point on the cost of their reserv  manag is go to pick the  e to do it   they would do the same if they were expect us to drop rate in a given mainten period   so part of the problem is the luxuri of the  e they have   the two week mainten period   to meet their averag for requir reserv   it may be worthwhil to look at the length of the mainten period again as part of this review becaus the whole process of reserv manag has realli chang   this is a profit center oper in a bank  they   re act total ration  and i just don   t want to jeopard the credibl that we have in the market now    anoth question is how much the quarter fund of the treasuri enter into the pictur in the recent period   it occurr in the same mainten period probabl also creat some of this unusu nois   in ani event  i think we final have gotten a lot of credibl in the market  and we need to be realli care what we do   it may be that we ought to go back and look at the fact that  especi in this period  bank have much lower reserv level than they   ve ever carri   they avoid reserv   they have such a low level of reserv  and there   s a larg amount of movement that the reserv desk can do everi day in a bank   that   s anoth issu  becaus bank are do whatev they can to avoid reserv
for the same reason we   ve creat the carri trade  becaus if you lock in with some perman one leg of it  that reduc the risk
could i just make one small point   in a sens  after       the desk was taken out of the busi of signal polici chang  which was a posit develop  mr kohn   absolut
i think one thing we should be care of is not to get back into that practic by have either a signal or a non signal be taken from what the desk     that would not be someth that i think this committe would welcom   certain we at the desk wouldn   t welcom it
i   ll pass   governor bie just said what i want to say
okay   presid santomero  do you want to say a word befor we end
let me just point out that there is a long literatur on the mechan of our intervent on a daili basi   i support your notion of updat that literatur   and look into this  it might be use   but this is not the first  e we   ve look at these kind of issu
strang enough  it   s the first  e  in my recollect  that we have project a potenti path of monetari polici in a manner that was wholli credibl to the market  which is what has creat this veri unusu situat
i agre     percent   but there is a literatur on this subject that we can connect to   and the staff can do a good job of review that and bring us up to date
question on other issu to dino   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest transact in the system account
without object they are approv       and    son  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   judg by the standard of the last few meet  perhap the biggest news is that we have made no major chang to our  book forecast sinc it was publish last wednesday   of cours  i   ll admit that it help when there are few data to get in our way   but even reach back to the august project  much of the incom data on product and spend have  on balanc  come in pretti much in line with our earlier expect that the expans would regain it foot as we move into the second half   inde  last week   s releas of industri product indic that a solid expans remain under way in the factori sector   manufactur output increas    percent last month after an upward revis increas of near   percent in juli  and gain in recent month have been widespread across industri   report from region and nation purchas manag have been similar upbeat   for the quarter as a whole  factori output appear like to increas    percent at an annual rate   likewis  the spend data have  for the most part  remain firm   purchas of light motor vehicl averag near    million unit at an annual rate in juli and august  about    million unit abov the pace of the first half of the year   these figur along with the retail sale data put real pce on track for a    percent increas in the current quarter  consider fa  than the     percent pace regist in the second quarter   hous start   just releas this morn   reach   million unit at an annual rate in august   ongo strength was especi evid in the singl   famili sector  where start edg up to      million unit from an alreadi elev level   busi spend  as well  look to be advanc smart   order and shipment for a broad varieti of capit good have been move up  and backlog of unfil order in mani industri have continu to mount   real spend on equip and softwar is project to increas    percent in the current quarter  about in line with the sizabl second quarter advanc   meanwhil  nonresidenti construct activ has surpris us to the upsid  and the odd are look better for a continu of the recoveri that appear to have gotten under way earlier this year   even the govern is chip in  led by a surg in current quarter outlay for defens   all in all  the catalogu of posit develop has been encourag that the expans is not falter   on balanc  the incom data leav our es  for the level of real gdp in the current quarter about the same as project in the august  book   if that is all that had transpir over the past six week  this would have been a reason quiet forecast round   but it was not   at the consider risk of find myself classifi in the taxonomi of governor schwarzenegg as an econom girli man   laughter  let me admit to harbor some pessimist perspect on recent develop   while near term gdp was not much affect by the incom data  we had to deal with a slug of incom inform that suggest to us that the economi has less momentum go forward than we had previous been expect  chief among our concern has been the employ situat   gain in payrol employ in recent month have been well short of our earlier expect   at the  e of the august  book  we were project employ gain to averag about         per month in the second half   with two month of data now in hand  privat payrol appear more like to increas in the neighborhood of         per month in the current quarter  and we have lower our fourth quarter project to gain of         per month   a higher workweek and somewhat larger increas in averag hour earn have provid some offset to the weak hire  but we still have a substanti shortfal in labor incom in recent month relat to our august expect   in addit  wage and salari incom was revis down consider in the first half of this year on the basi of unemploy insur tax record   those revis and the weaker employ gain of recent month have push the person save rate below   percent in the current quarter   near   percentag point below our august project   all els be equal  the lower level of incom impli somewhat greater restraint on consumpt go forward  and thus a steeper rise in the save rate than we had incorpor in our previous project   anoth negat for the outlook was the loss of prospect s ulus from inventori invest   the pace of stockbuild in the second quarter of this year now appear to have been consider fa  than was es  last month   that step up in the pace of stockbuild along with weaker final sale appear to have brought inventori into more comfort align with sale sooner than we had been expect   inde  in our august project  inventori invest was a sourc of s ulus to product in the second half of this year   it now appear that the bulk   of that s ulus is alreadi behind us   we have also had to contend with less favor news from the technolog sector   the recent shipment figur for comput and communic equip were to the soft side of our expect  moreov  report from a number of lead technolog compani have been relat downbeat about the outlook for earn and sale   intel  cisco  and gartner group have all indic some deterior in near term prospect   there has also been a notic slow in the pace of high tech product  concentr in comput and semiconductor   we do not believ that these develop are signal the start of a serious slump  but they have led us to temper our outlook for high tech invest this year and next   prove that we can find dark cloud on even the brightest horizon  the recent lower than expect read on price inflat impli that our august path for the nomin feder fund rate was  in real term  exert a bit more restraint on demand over the project period   put these piec togeth  we had a forecast in which no progress was made in reduc the margin of slack in resourc util and in which price inflat notch still lower   that outcom led us to flatten the assum trajectori for the fund rate by    basi point by the end of next year   an adjust that was suffici by our reckon to result in a gradual reduct in the output gap   i should note that market particip also appear to have mark down their expect for polici at the end of next year by a similar amount   as a consequ  we still have a shallow assum uptrend for the fund rate than is current embed in fed fund futur   in our project  the fund rate is assum to move up to    percent by the end of next year and to    percent by the end of        an endpoint rough    basi point below current market expect   we see sever key featur of the current econom landscap as suggest to us that such a gradual tighten of polici will be suffici to contain inflat pressur while promot an eventu elimin of the output gap   first  fiscal polici is expect to swing from the substanti s ulus of the past three year to mild restraint in        we are probabl alreadi experienc the front edg of that diminish s ulus   in our project  fiscal polici over the next year is do some of the work that would otherwis be requir of monetari polici   second  as i note earlier  the revers of the low level of the save rate impos restraint on spend go forward   not onli is the current level of the save rate below our es  of the target  but the target itself is like to be move higher as interest rate increas   third  the extern sector is expect to be a consider drag on activ in the unit state  as domest and foreign demand are increas direct away from u s  produc   by       real net export are expect to knock more than  …  percentag point off the growth of real gdp     will have more to say on this issu short  but suffic it to say here that our widen extern deficit creat a stiff headwind for the economi   final  our shallow path for the fund rate also reflect our relat op ist outlook for price inflat   in our project  the remain margin of slack in resourc util  a small declin in domest energi price  and a level out of non oil import price result in an edg down of   project core consum price inflat from about     percent this year to    percent over the four quarter of        even with our revis  we see some clear downsid risk to the project  while the incom data have been encourag of the view that the soft patch is reced  the data have hard been definit on that point   the run up of energi price this year could well be exert greater restraint on household spend than we have allow for in our project   moreov  it has creat yet anoth sourc of uncertainti with which busi must cope   inde  the vocabulari of busi caution seem to have crept back into discuss of the hire and capit spend plan of our industri contact   if these concern are more pervas or more sever than we have implicit recogn in the project  the soft patch could prove more persist in come month   of cours  we readili conced that we may have overreact to some of the softer econom indic of recent month   there are a number of reason that one could be concern that the low level of the fund rate assum in our project will s ul fa  econom growth  higher price inflat  or both   for one  simpl histor relationship between the real fund rate and the output gap suggest that the level of the fund rate assum in our project has  on averag in the past  result in a much more rapid close of the output gap than we are forecast   we use such a simpl relationship to calibr an altern simul for the  book  and the accompani surg in demand in that simul not onli close the output gap but result in some overshoot of potenti by the middl of next year   our problem with adopt someth like this for the baselin is that we don   t current see the harbing   stronger asset price appreci  a weaker exchang valu of the dollar  or more rapid increas in interest sensit spend   that we think would both signal and s ul a more vigor track for activ   anoth resolut to this possibl tension is that the output gap could alreadi be much smaller than we are es    in other word  the low real fund rate of the past few year may alreadi have done it work   of cours  the implic go forward is that the economi has less room to grow than we think   again  we illustr this possibl with an altern simul that embodi a higher es  of the nairu and a lower es  of the trend rate of labor forc particip   on our assum path for the fund rate  the economi again overshoot potenti  and core price inflat move up steadili from current level   such an outcom is  no doubt  plausibl   our abil to measur the economi   s product potenti is limit  and the profess has not distinguish itself in this endeavor in the past   moreov  some employ are report that it has becom difficult to locat worker with the skill set that they need  provid a hint that the labor market may be tighter than we are es    but in the end  we are unpersuad   the particip rate and the employ   popul ratio are veri low  and the declin in those measur in recent year coincid with the weaken labor market   also  survey evid suggest that  while household and busi percept of the labor   market have improv  those percept remain well short of the condit that prevail at other  e when inflat pressur emerg   the actual inflat data themselv are consider more ambigu on the question of whether we have overshot potenti   certain  the recent data have been more encourag   after hit a high of    percent at annual rate in march  the three month chang in the core pce price index through august appear to have reced to below   percent   just as the earlier pace like overst the emerg of inflat pressur this year  the most recent figur probabl overst the dissip of those pressur   our best guess is that the under pace of core consum price inflat is about     percent at present   that still repres some pickup from last year   s    percent pace   we believ the acceler in core price this year can larg be explain by the indirect effect of the steep increas in energi price and by the larger increas in import price   but we can   t rule out the possibl that labor and product market are tighter than we current es    in sum  we are expect moder abov trend growth  moder eros of the output gap  a moder drop in inflat  all brought about by a moder rise in the feder fund rate   yes  we too know that it will never come to pass  but we are satisfi that we have produc a forecast in which we don   t know the most like direct of the surpris   befor hand the baton to    let me return to the dark cloud for a moment  here  i don   t mean the one that the staff has conjur about the outlook  but rather the one real peopl see when they look out the window   as the  book went to press last week  hurrican ivan had yet to make landfal   the storm of the past month are bound to leav an imprint on the econom data  though most of the effect will be on the incom side of the account   a big jump in econom depreci is like to be match by lower rental incom  lower proprietor    incom  and reduc corpor profit   as far as real activ is concern  we simpli don   t have enough inform yet to reach an inform judgment about the possibl magnitud of ani effect on spend or product   but as devast as these event have been for so mani peopl  we are not expect the effect to be larg enough or persist enough to have ani implic for your polici
the baselin forecast for real output growth in the rest of the world is littl chang from that in the august  book   this is the case despit substanti market volatil of  and much media attent to  global oil price   the primari reason is that despit the intermeet fluctuat  the path of oil price implicit in futur price show littl net chang from the path incorpor in the august  book   we did look veri care at the question of how the effect of elev oil price are like to be distribut across foreign economi   and there are differ among industri countri  emerg market economi  net oil import  and net oil export   nevertheless  the basic common element of reduc oil intens in sever foreign countri  especi the foreign industri   countri  and well anchor inflat expect in most import foreign economi  along with the expect that onli a portion of the spike in spot price will prove to be persist  have led us and most forecast to judg that the output effect of recent oil market develop will be limit   our initi project for growth abroad in      is that foreign real gdp will expand at about    percent  a slight deceler from the     percent annual pace of the second half of this year   among the industri countri  most of the stepdown in growth is account for by canada and the unit kingdom  countri whose economi have been expand particular rapid  close their output gap  and that need to bring growth in line with potenti in order to avert the emerg of inflationari pressur   the central bank of both those countri have alreadi move to tighten polici  with the bank of canada tighten    basi point earlier this month and the bank of england increas rate by a total of     basi point sinc mid        some deceler is also project for the asian develop economi on averag  particular in malaysia  singapor  taiwan  and indonesia   elev oil price are boost headlin inflat abroad  but core price inflat  where data are avail  appear to be well contain   over the forecast period  we expect inflat abroad to declin gradual as oil price revers some of their recent run up and as food price  which have been a factor in asia  retreat in respons to increas suppli  and as monetari tighten in brazil and mexico have some effect   extens of the forecast horizon to the end of      allow the effect of return to near trend growth here and in most region abroad to show through to our project for real net export  the nomin trade deficit  and the current account deficit   the consequ of weak in activ here and abroad earlier  past dollar depreci  and sharp swing in oil and nonfuel commod price will have been pretti much fulli felt by the end of        for this forecast  we have project slight more rapid depreci of the dollar than previous  with the broad dollar declin averag near     percent in real term in      and        we judg that such an outcom in relat incom here and abroad and in price competit of u s  good would lead to a widen of the nomin u s  trade deficit of about     billion from it current averag through the last quarter of        in addit  prospect increas in market dollar interest rate  along with other factor  impli that u s  net invest incom will move into deficit  declin near as much as the trade deficit over the same period   as a result  our project for the current account balanc widen from about      billion this quarter to near      billion in the fourth quarter of       reach about     percent of gdp   in real term  there is an equival deterior   the posit contribut from real export to overal gdp growth slowli diminish from more than     percentag point this year to less than     percentag point in        and the negat contribut from import remain abov   percentag point  reach     percentag point over the four quarter of        there is thus a persist subtract from u s  gdp growth that aris from the extern sector and that reach about  …  percentag point in       the slight deceler in real export growth primarili reflect a lessen of the past   impetus come from relat price  particular from the exchang rate   similar  the strengthen in real import growth aris larg from a relat price boost   of cours  real export growth would have to exceed that of real import substanti at this point for real net export to have a neutral effect on the forecast for u s  gdp growth   onli a few forecast have ad      to their outlook   although we are not absolut alon in anticip a mark deterior in the extern balanc over the next two year  mani forecast current call for littl chang from this year to next   for exampl  the averag current account deficit poll by consensus forecast is about      billion for both      and        of cours  some of the individu outlook in that averag call for the deficit to widen  but some actual project a narrow   plus  a number abov      billion for      seem to be way off the radar screen of most forecast   our view that the current account deficit will widen into rather startl new territori reflect the larg size that the deficit has alreadi reach and our project path for the dollar   trend growth here and abroad is consist with the deficit widen further unless relat price chang  and the present larg deficit mean that the declin in the nomin balanc move quick as like growth rate yield rapid diverg export and import   this pose a sever challeng to us with respect to our project for the exchang valu of the dollar in the baselin forecast   for some  e we have taken to heart the result of research that we and other have done that show that structur model of the exchang rate have littl forecast power   accord  we have incorpor into the forecast path for the real valu of the dollar that are near flat  with some slight trend at  e to signal featur of the maintain assumpt about u s  monetari polici or our ongo concern that the financ of the u s  extern deficit would ul  result in downward pressur on the dollar   but that strategi now result in the extern sector have a veri promin effect on the top line gdp path   moreov  as the number we are write down get larger and larger  we are begin to have doubt that financi market will be abl to manag them easili   howev  no clear better altern come to mind   if we arbitrarili project a path for the dollar that minim the negat effect come from the extern sector  then we would be mask an import featur of the u s  macroeconomi  and that dollar path  rather than net export  would becom the essenc of the intern forecast   becaus we do not believ that we truli can project when ani major chang in the valu of the dollar will happen  in particular whether it will happen within the forecast interv  we do not see ani basi on which we could follow that strategi   for now  we have use the altern simul in the  book to suggest to you what would be the consequ of a sharp move in the dollar some  in the forecast period   as awar of the loom extern deficit becom more widespread  we may see more clue in financi market as to what to expect from them   dave and i would be happi to answer ani of your question
for the first  e     you seem to be paint a short term pictur of an unsustain pattern in the current account deficit  as i have listen to you in the past  the issu as i   ve heard them are that we alway talk of the need for a much higher rate of increas in export than import to close the huge exist gap between them   you are now rais a somewhat more subtl issu in which it is not onli the gap but the absolut size of the foreign trade magnitud relat to gdp that have an acceler impact   in other word  if we had a veri small extern sector but a veri larg differ between import and export  the percentag of the current account deficit to gdp would be small despit that sizabl percentag differ in the growth of export and import   but now that the trade number are get larger and larger in absolut term  their impact on gdp   other thing be equal with regard to the ratio of import to export   is becom ever larger and a sourc of increas instabl  the reason is that  as the current account deficit continu to widen becaus the growth of export fail to exceed that of import  the base of both are chang   and if under such condit the deficit is rise relat to the gdp  we have an arithmet unsustain pattern even in the short run
well  i like to avoid the word    unsustain    or    sustain    becaus then you   ll ask me what make someth sustain and i can   t answer that question
i   m not ask a question  i   m just make a statement
i absolut agre with everyth you said
am i infer correct what you say
yes   and where we saw it most clear was when it came  e to look at the contribut of those number to gdp   in the past  there were those of us  such as myself    who were somewhat of a cassandra regard the extern deficit  but we were talk tenth of a percentag point one way or anoth in term of the effect on gdp   the notion that the effect would get swamp by the unanticip up and down that would come along in the forecast period was alway present  and the extern sector didn   t seem to be creat a situat that would strike financi market particip as unmanag  this  e  as we work our way through preliminari run of the forecast  the negat contribut from the extern sector got up to be almost   percentag point of gdp   well  we final settl on someth a bit smaller for        but   percentag point of gdp get one   s attent  in fact   …  percentag point of gdp get my attent   so the reason that this seem an opportun  e to call extra attent to that point is that  when we first extend the forecast horizon  as we have now into       it give us a longer  e period over which these kind of forc are have their effect   this is a veri inerti process  so one has to look ahead more than just a few quarter to see it consequ  we don   t know much els about       so we don   t have inform that would lead us to say     oh  a u s  recess is go to caus import to fall     or    a crisi in asia is go to caus capit inflow to be particular high      we don   t know what kind of other random event are go to occur in        all we   re see is this long last fundament process  and we   re see it veri clear   sure  the number we   re forecast right now for      will not actual happen  i fulli appreci that   but they will be embed in what   happen  and this is an opportun to see them more clear befor the outlook get complic by other develop
i think that   s a veri use insight
let me just provid a littl domest side perspect on that  obvious  one of the issu that we were struggl with in this project is that we have a surpris shallow trajectori for the fund rate   and you might wonder whi that isn   t show through more forc in this forecast  but it is on the domest spend side   we have for privat domest demand an acceler of    percent this year  which move up to     percent next year and to    percent in        the reason that isn   t show through to top line gdp and product is that  on our dollar and net export forecast  a lot of that demand is show up in demand for produc abroad not in demand for produc domest
i have one quick question on energi issu   on virtual all the previous occas when oil price went up  it was difficult to distinguish between rise price of gasolin and home heat oil and rise crude import price   so the es  of the tax effect from import crude and the impact of gasolin price on pce gave rough the same answer  as i recal   we have an unusu test period in the second and third quarter of this year   in fact  probabl all of this year   in which  becaus of the huge differenti spread in refineri market  we   re get differ result     that enabl us to econometr differenti where the real impact is   in other word    it show up in the equat in shortfal of consumpt expenditur as a consequ of the rise in gasolin price or a later rise in crude oil price   or is it too soon to make that judgment
i think i can say unequivoc that on the econometr side a coupl of month of extra data are not go to allow us to identifi these thing   now  there is an interest coincid that consumpt was especi weak not onli as oil price were rise but as margin were increas substanti  and there was some improv in consumpt in august  as margin shrank veri dramat and price came down   so there could be some   small nod in the direct that you suggest  but it would be hard for us to distinguish those relationship   one reason to be a littl skeptic about just use a model run   model multipli on the energi effect   has been that we don   t see the offset strength in drill activ  drill activ improv and improv notic  but not as much as we would have expect especi given that far date futur have increas quit a bit   so there could be more restrain effect of higher oil price this  e around than has been true  on averag  in the past becaus we   re not get some of the natur offset that occur
an interest question is whether drill is a function of profit at the product level  which one has alway assum to be the case  or if the aggreg consolid profit is more relev   i say that becaus the implic here is that the propens to spend out of the refin market margin may be much lower than the propens to spend out of the profit from crude and natur gas product  which would signal anoth way of come at this particular issu   presid
i have a question for     i think one way of summar the  book forecast is to say that the equilibrium real feder fund rate that is implicit in that forecast is veri low   as i read it  it   s on the order of   percent  which i interpret as veri depress relat to the equilibrium real fund rate that would be implicit in the frb us model  for exampl   i would find it help if you could pinpoint what the sourc of this diverg is  by that i mean which compon of spend or aggreg demand do you see as particular depress relat to what the frb us model would predict   where are the model   s residu larg   a relat question  in light of the comment that you just made  involv the gap between the  book forecast and the frb us model forecast of the exchang rate   simpli run the model  given what has happen to net export  i suspect that one would predict a substanti   declin in the real exchang rate   the  book is project a much flatter path of the real exchang rate   is it becaus net export are the big sourc of the diverg that you have the veri low equilibrium fund rate
to start with the last question  just as a benchmark we ran an altern model simul in which the real exchang rate depreci at a   percent annual rate over the forecast period  in contrast to the     percent declin that we   ve actual built into the forecast   that   percent declin produc enough addit growth and a littl extra inflat so that  if one were to appli a taylor rule to that outcom  the fund rate path would be just about on track with current market expect   so that certain would be one way to reconcil the differ between our forecast and current market expect of the fund rate
and is that what the frb us model would predict
yes  that was with frb us   i would say that    if she were to run frb global  might come up with slight differ es   but we do see that as an import element   now  in term of explain the differ between the implicit equilibrium fund rate in the staff forecast and that which frb us would produc  a coupl of thing stand out   one is that interest sensit spend in the judgment project look soft relat to what the model would expect   interest enough  that   s surpris so in household interest sensit spend  the model want to see consider stronger hous invest and also stronger consum durabl   the model also think that   take it for what it   s worth   the stock market should be stronger and the exchang rate should be weaker   those actual are the three most import compon of the differ in how we see the outlook from what the model would expect   in both case of project asset valu   for both the stock market and the   exchang rate   we   ve taken a sort of neutral approach to the forecast   but there are reason for be skeptic about that go forward
my question actual relat to this last discuss   i want to ask about the altern simul on the intern side   the    percent declin in the real valu of the broad dollar index   when i saw the result  i was a littl surpris that they weren   t more serious in that    percent depreci scenario   but then i saw the sentenc you had there indic that the shock did not incorpor ani of the potenti impact on the u s  economi through the confid of busi or consum or through higher risk premium on privat domest asset price   so i was wonder if you could give us the benefit of your think on that as to what magnitud we should expect here
unless you happen to have an urn and a few ball that i can select from  i don   t think i   m in ani better posit than you are to judg that outcom   when we have in some previous  book simul   or in the june fomc present  for exampl   ad an asset market disrupt and volatil as a consequ of a chang in the dollar  it is alway just veri arbitrari on our part   there   s no systemat link that we   ve been abl to discov in the data between the exchang rate and these other thing   a lot depend on the exogen shock  if you will  that give rise to the exchang rate chang   so to mimic a world in which peopl becam less confid about u s  asset  we put in higher risk premium term and thing that drive the stock market  and we get out some disrupt effect   but the dollar could move as a result of a world in which product gain final start show up in other countri
or our unwind
yes   but i   m look at a scenario that would have a net posit shock to the global economi so that it   s not that our incom in the futur are like to be lower but that foreign incom appear like to be higher   foreign asset look as if they should be valu more high   the relat differenti show through to caus the dollar to fall  but on balanc  it is a more favor foreign outlook rather than a less favor u s  outlook that produc that effect  you   d get a veri differ stori if the dollar were to fall for polit reason that could be driven by safe haven concern  which would tend to drive down u s  long term interest rate somewhat  as we saw in       and         altern  the dollar could fall for anti u s  polit reason  and presum peopl would then be sell u s  bond as well as u s  dollar   so the mix is all over the map   the dollar itself is just a reflect of what that under shock might be  as would be the case with stock price and with the long term interest rate   we can arbitrarili put those shock into the model and get out the answer  but basic we feel whi bother the model   we could just write down the answer   that   s in essenc what we   d be do  so we   ve shi away from it
if we had this sharp drop in the dollar  you point out that it would affect confid of u s  busi firm and u s  consum   how would you see that play through
well  presum that would lead to a step up in the u s  save rate  we would get some benefit from a dollar declin   rememb  a drop in the dollar is a veri expansionari shock to the u s  economi  when we run that shock sort of nake  the way we did this  e  and ask the model what the outcom would be  the taylor rule want monetari tighten   and we still get some more output and some more inflat becaus it   s a veri expansionari shock   but if it happen in the context of someth like a loss of confid    these residu that were just be discuss presum would go up in other countri  too   one without all of the attribut of the unit state  such as brazil  argentina  and korea  these kind of shock tend to be associ not with expansionari macroeconom outcom but with recessionari macroeconom outcom becaus  despit the fact that the exchang rate get a relat price boost  these other event caus such havoc and disrupt fiscal polici and so forth that there   s often monetari tighten to counter the inflationari effect   but also there   s stress in the financi market and stress in invest spend  and fiscal polici get off track and  all in all  you get a recess movement  not an expans  despit the exchang rate shock   so out of context  it   s just veri difficult to put these ad featur into the equat along with the exchang rate   one could do dozen of these simul  and i would have no way of attach probabl to them  to be honest
i think the differ between us and korea is that they borrow in foreign currenc wherea we borrow in our own currenc
so a depreci of their currenc creat balanc sheet effect
it has some balanc sheet effect that complic the household sector   s problem and the nonfinanci corpor sector   s problem  and typic there are some balanc sheet effect that threaten the bank system   now  for sure  we don   t think that a depreci in the dollar would have serious consequ for the u s  bank system   in june i mention that  given the inform we had  the balanc sheet effect from a dollar depreci appear to be abroad rather than at home   dollar denomin asset would becom less valuabl abroad  but balanc sheet in the unit state would tend to be more or less dollar neutral   becaus the dollar is on both side   it would be a complic pictur   but the confid effect and other aspect of the stori depend veri much on the precipit shock
i have mani of the same question   let me just rais a coupl of issu  the first is on the invest incom swing that show up in the capit account   i don   t profess to be anywher near an expert on this  but i had alway thought that those number are typic posit becaus we general make more money abroad than foreign make here    that swing from  e to  e  and is this just a normal swing  or is this tell us someth signific
the hold abroad need to be divid into two basic categori  one of which is the net foreign direct invest stori and the other is the portfolio   that is  stock and bond and bank claim   what you   ve describ has character the foreign direct invest portfolio   we have  on averag  earn higher rate of return on our hold of foreign direct invest than foreign investor in the unit state have earn on their   that has been a big sourc  and will continu to be a big sourc  of net posit incom into the u s  current account   it is iron that we   ve becom the world   s biggest debtor and nonetheless we   ve actual been record  at  e  posit incom flow   that is becaus much of the bond portfolio is dollar denomin   there are veri few   some  but not a lot   foreign currenc denomin bond issu by u s  corpor  they are most dollar denomin bond   and interest rate on those have been quit low   so even though the posit has deterior   basic  rather sever   from       the net incom actual stop deterior and was quit flat for a while  owe to the low interest rate   in principl  if the interest rate were   actual zero  one could see that that whole part of the portfolio wouldn   t matter at all   so the notion that we earn more on direct invest is still present in the data and in our forecast   but as we appli somewhat higher interest rate to the bond part and the bank deposit part  we final see the consequ of be a big net debtor start to overwhelm this direct invest portion of the posit
i have just one other question   for mani countri around the world  a lot of their growth end up be export orient and we   re the big import   so there is a kind of codepend between us and the rest of the world as regard the valu of the dollar   the number get aw  but how   that codepend unwind
well  one of the featur in the  book simul  go back to the prior question  is the model   s abil to say that foreign policymak act in a way that speak to this codepend   one problem that we face collect in the global economi is that the low interest rate environ for all concern   limit the capac of foreign central bank to s ul domest demand as they lose extern demand   so zero bound problem becom quit relev  as we highlight especi in the paper that we circul ahead of the june meet  the most immedi and direct devic we have for undo the codepend is to get domest demand abroad stronger and to do that through monetari polici s ul  but that   s limit to some degre by zero bound problem   and when we run these model simul  we tend to hit the zero bound  particular in the euro area  say  where the polici rate is sit at   percent right now   and  of cours  japan is alreadi in the vicin of the zero bound  so there   s not a lot of scope for s ul domest demand  if i want to  i could tell a happi stori   there are plenti of happi stori   we   ve been through this befor   in the     s   and we   ve live through the past decad  the world hasn   t   stop turn  even the financi market haven   t stop turn   there   s a lot of potenti in the develop world for capit accumul  either financ out of the high save rate of those countri or financ out of foreign direct invest that  sn   t keep flow into the unit state but goe to china  to the rest of asia  and mayb even to brazil and other latin american countri   there   s a lot of potenti in brazil   there have been invest bank articl that i   m sure some of you have seen about how fifti year from now china  india  and brazil are go to be the domin economi in the globe   if that capit accumul is realiz  that   s domest demand in the rest of the world   the market economi of the globe can handl all that  there   s no reason to think that it can   t lead to a quit benign resolut of the circumst we   re now in   but that   s terribl complic  more by polit  properti right  infrastructur  and those kind of issu than by anyth inher in this imbal problem
we   ve rais an issu of veri outsiz number and the potenti for financi instabl   but there seem littl we can do here in this countri on the monetari polici side   possibl a lot we could do on the fiscal polici side but not on the monetari polici side
the essenti monetari polici contribut  it seem to me  is to keep u s  inflat low and u s  output as close to potenti at a sustain rate as possibl   this is what you would do in ani event
not quit   now  if i believ in the efficaci of intervent  which i do not  it would not surpris me to be sit here and observ the sequenc of event that dino has describ this morn   dino is talk about reduct in volatil and relat increas in stabil   we   re look at an extraordinarili stabl system in which there is a benign respons to    basi point   or will be    laughter   well  i   m not prone to avoid make forecast    the question that i think aris is whether  on the basi of histori as   point out  we can get through these period without crise  as a develop literatur around the world suggest  if there were a way in which we could move the dollar   s exchang rate down signific in a manner that had no secondari effect  would we not want to accomplish that  would we prefer the euro   dollar relationship at this stage to be at     instead of       the answer is     yes  we would      but we don   t know how to get there   the general presumpt might be that we can get there through intervent  but the experi with intervent suggest otherwis   there are some peopl here who were at the fed dure the plaza accord period   i was not  but i was watch from the outsid  and i don   t recal a lot of intervent  my recollect was that in februari      the dollar and the pound  l were almost at pariti at one point   the situat was like an avalanch wait to break  and when the g   met and releas a few statement  the avalanch did break   there wasn   t a great deal of intervent  but it appear to be extraordinarili success   that struck me in retrospect as sheer luck   i don   t recal that the g   said anyth of great signific  we have a degre of credibl in the feder reserv  but i   m not at all certain that if  for exampl  the secretari of the treasuri and a number of us start talk in that direct  we would knock the dollar   euro exchang rate down sharpli   i hesit to think of the consequ  if it were easi to do  i would recommend it   the problem here is that there is a wide consensus that this is the  e we want the devalu of the dollar to happen  not later when the economi may be in a weaken structur situat
but as a footnot to the     s  that was a  e when the rest of the world was grow  it enjoy a much better macroeconom perform   japan was grow   strong   europ was do better   the domest demand contribut from outsid the unit state was healthier at that point
and with respect to the issu that we discuss earlier  the absolut level of our current account deficit was lower
when   did her june paper  i ask her if she was go to recommend plaza two   that the paper was just the stalk hors for recommend plaza two   but i think it   s hard to conceiv of a strategi that we could manag   you weren   t suggest this  but let me just say it   where to deal with the risk in our presumpt unsustain extern posit  we would induc a run on our currenc and induc a broad base run on u s  financi asset
you couldn   t do it and control it
yes   i think the lesson of those various period is just how hard it is   onc the expect is creat that as a matter of polici we   re go to tri to induc a substanti declin in the valu of our currenc   to contain it or to slow it and manag it   and yet if we could immacul induc the rest of the world to revalu against us in some gradual way  we   d do it if we could   that would be rather nice
well  that in a way is what we   ve been tri to do  we   ve been tri to do that obvious by persuad the chines and other who have been interven in the foreign exchang market   what i find disturb about the scenario that   has outlin is that we may achiev the adjust in a wholli inappropri macroeconom environ   i   m not say there   s anyth we can do or say about it  but i don   t think we can just push the issu asid   who els in the world is go to think about this other than the   feder reserv   there   s no one els in the american govern   on the g    there   s realli no one els but the unit state   to the extent that event of this natur go on  they are observ and evalu but without some notion of whether there are polici relationship involv   i   m just say that  if we don   t do it  i don   t know who els will   as i look around the world  there are a lot of veri good peopl  a lot of thought peopl  but the mechan through which adjust would occur is the g
or the g
or the g      the troubl is that if we go from g   to g     i   m not sure that   s an improv   so as a matter of cours  i would not mere say that there   s noth we can do about it and that we should just forget about tri to do so and go on our merri way   the problem is that no one els is do anyth   the probabl of our think about it and come up with and do someth construct is veri low  but it   s not zero  and it   s probabl zero for most of the rest of the world   presid santomero
i   ll yield my  e  this is more inform
just on this point   i think i cannot be accus of go on my merri way on this particular issu   but as a result of the discuss that   led last meet  i   m actual more pessimist about the demand switch   i believ that   s what it   s call in the trade   than i was go into that discuss   now  the first question is the one that you and presid   rais   how to get there   how do we start the slide in the exchang rate
i think it will take an immacul concept
right   that   s an obvious problem   but the other problem is that we have to get more demand s ul in the rest of the world   and as   just mention  the   zero bound issu realli get in the way of that   we talk a littl last week about fiscal expans  and that possibl is alway there  but i think demand switch has two real problem   one is how do we get there  and the other is how do we switch demand on in the countri where we have to switch it on   it   s not so easi   so  i   m all for talk about this and so forth  but i think it   s a veri hard problem   a lot harder than i previous thought it was
it   s extrem hard   but i would say that we are in the best posit  with the best resourc  to think about it   the probabl is that in the end we will come up with noth worthwhil   but unless we keep think about it  i don   t think we can do our own job on american monetari polici
am i correct in rememb that one of the thing your june paper show is how littl an ambiti fiscal consolid plan buy us in term of an improv in the extern posit
that is the case in our model   howev  i   ve been  if anyth  a bit skeptic about that   but when you reduc ani compon   exogen govern spend  exogen invest  a chang in the save rate   you creat an open in the demand   suppli balanc that is then go to be fill by someth  and you want it fill by export  that would be the pro adjust respons  our model suggest that  as monetari polici eas in respons to flag demand  we   re more like to get interest sensit compon of u s  domest demand step in than to induc a chang in the exchang rate and get higher export   but that is all condit on two thing  one of which is how interest sensit that demand is   and if the interest sensit isn   t as high as we have it in the model or if those compon suffer some of the residu problem of the sort they have suffer late becaus of confid or whatev  mayb u s  interest   sensit demand won   t come rush in   that   s one possibl   the other is that  as far as the model is concern  that relationship depend on the model   s abil to tell us what the exchang rate is go to do becaus the induc effect on the exchang rate is how that adjust work  i alway start and stop these convers by say that we don   t have a good model of the exchang rate and that   s whi we make all our statement condit   in order to close model   most model  includ our   we use uncov interest pariti becaus the model has to have an exchang rate equat   there has to be someth that   that  and that   s what econom theori say to put in there  so that   s what we put in   but uncov interest pariti has never succeed empir  ever   so that conclus rest on these two properti   that we don   t realli know what the exchang rate respons would be and that we don   t know if our interest sensit is as high as the model say it is
that   s an import insight about the natur of the adjust process   the fact that you cannot forecast exchang rate is tell you someth good about the flexibl of the adjust process  which in itself is a use insight in term of know what to do analyt and from a polici point of view
i could tell stori in which that flexibl would all work in the right direct  but i could imagin at least some factor that could go the other way  in the sens that everi  e the world seem to be go through a period of uncertainti and unsettled   and a pronounc extern adjust might be such a period   there   s a tendenc to see capit flow into the unit state  not out of it   and that would counteract the desir adjust
just to your point on the exchang rate and whi we may need to think about this   it strike me that  becaus of extern demand and our own situat  we have a more   accommod polici than we normal might becaus of tri to keep domest demand up  and the result is that it also keep our demand for import veri high   that mean that we as a countri accumul more debt  and as we look down the road  we continu to see this alreadi veri larg current account deficit grow further   therefor  we have a greater likelihood of a crisi later as we tri to maintain our own domest demand  given that the rest of the world isn   t help us along   it may be  e to think  as you are say here  about the extern side in term of the exchang rate  we can   t predict the futur  i recogn that   but all the indic are that this problem is build and that the likelihood of this futur crisi is build   becaus of our need to maintain strong domest demand  we continu to put liquid out there  and the world continu to accumul our debt   this futur problem is build in part becaus of our polici and the fact that we are deal with one polici instrument right now
but i would just reiter what governor   said a minut ago  if all that happen is that we decid that we   re go to use monetari polici to limit u s  domest demand  that by itself is not go to be suffici to produc a good result
that   s whi i   m say  with regard to the chairman   s point  that we may have to look at the exchang rate side or at least think about it   i believ it is perhap becom more critic that we do so
our dialogu with the staff regard the econom outlook was a littl lengthier than usual  but i think it was a veri import discuss   it   impos some  e constraint on us go forward  howev  so i would request that we tri to keep our comment slight less lengthi   unless  obvious  one has import thing to say   laughter   with that  who would like to start off   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   mayb i should speak fa    in this round  the report from our seventh district contact were unusu vari   mani were quit upbeat  other were reminisc of last year  when uncertainti over the strength of the expans caus firm to delay invest and hire   henc  while i think we   ve move out of the soft patch  we do not yet have a clear sens of how robust condit are go to be   on the upsid  some industri continu to do veri well   these includ print  magazin advertis  paper packag  and a wide varieti of heavi machineri produc   inde  industri rep at this month   s intern manufactur technolog show in chicago said that busi was as good as it has been sinc        in contrast  produc of consum good were more subdu  as you know  automak are now less bullish and are increas concern about their inventori   they plan to offer even higher incent and to be veri conserv about product   report on consum spend were also mix  report on hire reflect the vari level of op  across sector   mani manufactur outsid the automobil sector are ad hour worker to their payrol   but in line with dave     s comment  we   re onc again hear from our director and other contact that some busi are uncertain enough about the strength of demand that they   re reluct to add worker   the larg temporari help firm we spoke with said that year over year growth in billabl hour had eas slight  but they attribut at least part of the soft to transitori factor such as the hurrican   furthermor  one of them report that wage gain had move a bit higher across the board  nonetheless  the inflat outlook remain subdu   of cours  some input cost are still quit high   in respons  some of our contact are chang their purchas strategi   mani user of steel  for exampl  think price will come down substanti  so they   re not build   inventori at the current high price   and mani are switch from long term fix price contract to one that guarante futur suppli but with the cost link to the price prevail at the  e of deliveri   downstream  most firm have been unabl to pass higher cost on to consum  turn to the nation outlook  last  e the two big question face us were whether inflat had pick up and whether the soft patch was temporari   we now feel better about inflat  and as i note at the outset  we seem to have emerg from the soft patch  but we don   t have a clear pictur of how big the improv will be   job growth has not yet shown the kind of gain that one would expect if growth were run abov potenti  and i am concern that dure the intermeet period we heard renew talk about increas uncertainti make busi hesit to hire and to spend   there   s a chanc that this risk avers will becom embed and take us into a more extend period of subpar growth   but there are reason to be op ist   financi market are not price in heighten risk  product trend and accommod monetari polici are support growth  and quit a few of my contact are veri upbeat about their busi  on balanc  we think that the mix signal mean that the economi is grow onli modest fa  than potenti   our forecast is for the output gap to remain sizabl for some  e and for inflat to stay under control   the question go forward is  how quick should we remov the current high degre of polici accommod   we still have a long way to go befor the fund rate reach neutral  so i don   t see ani reason to deviat at this meet from our plan to remov polici accommod at a measur pace   but if we see sign of persist sluggish in the economi  then we might want to paus at some  e in the futur
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s hard to rememb an intermeet period when less happen   where econom develop were more predict and more stabl   than this one   so i want to concentr on a few piec of inform that i pick up dure this period  my wal mart contact focus on the weak august sale in their store   he conduct a survey of all wal mart store manag to determin when school in their communiti open  it turn out that a lot of school open on a schedul that is tie to labor day and mani do not  by compar sale at store in the two group  he determin that the late labor day had a fair amount to do with the slow august sale that wal mart report   he es  that the total impact was about    basi point  that is  august sale relat to august last year were reduc by almost   percentag point as a consequ of this pattern of school open and the late labor day   i thought that was rather interest  and of cours  it may mean that septemb sale will be somewhat stronger  the other comment that i thought was interest   and this is not total new   has to do with the transport system   my truck industri contact at j b  hunt said that his firm is not invest in ani new capac   actual  the number of truck is flat to down slight   margin are not particular good  so they   re not invest   a major difficulti is get driver  nation  as we know  a lot of truck compani have gone out of busi  and rail capac is not expand either   so he thought we might end up with some strain in the transport of good   obvious  we know that the transport of passeng is get quit mess up as well becaus of all the airlin bankruptci   those were the onli two comment that i want to offer   my contact said that thing are roll along about as anticip and that busi look general good   thank you
the economi in the eleventh district continu to expand at a modest  or mayb even a measur  pace   at our board of director meet a littl over a week ago  one of our director summar it best by say that the economi is go nice   not great  but nice   her theme was echo by mani other director and by member of the advisori council on small busi and agricultur   i also met with a number of ceo for breakfast that same week  and what was most interest to me was that none of them had much to say about the economi   it was neither so strong nor so weak that it deserv much in the way of comment  what they were almost obsess about  though  were the rise cost of health care to their busi  with littl hope for improv  and relat issu of tort reform  even though most of my contact are tell me that the economi is do okay  i sens a certain reluct on the part of busi peopl to make long term econom commit   a point other have mention alreadi this morn   one of our houston director  who is in the petrochem busi  has been rais price for month   his compani has been run close to full capac in sever product line   he rais the question of whether he should be invest in new plant  given that his current plant are run full out   for a varieti of reason  his answer was    absolut not      one of our agricultur advisori council member made a similar point regard cattl ranch when he said     just like in chemic  no one want to build new plant      it   s my view that these remark reflect an under caution   call it lack of busi confid  if you will   that may act as a brake on econom growth go forward  in the case of larg public trade compani  we can blame some of this caution on sarban   oxley   but this reduc appetit for risk take and long term invest has spill over to smaller  more entrepreneuri  privat held busi as well    have said all this  i should point out that the texa economi has continu to improv throughout        job growth has pick up steadili  and the gain are fair widespread across most industri   after three year of massiv declin in high tech employ  reason steadi gain have taken place thus far in        one of our advisori council member from austin   s high tech sector note that austin is final off the bottom   it is a    feel better    economi but not yet a    feel good    economi  the nation economi seem to reflect the same pattern of slow  modest growth and deceler inflat that has emerg in the dalla district in recent month   i have no reason to differ in ani signific way from the staff   s gdp outlook   i think we   d all be pleas to have the baselin scenario unfold   averag real gdp growth of just under   percent in the fourth and fifth year of expans is pretti good  if the staff   s inflat outlook for      and      is correct  or even just in the right ballpark  the u s  economi will remain in the zone of price stabil in the near futur   as i look at the staff   s inflat project under the altern simul  i can   t help but notic that all of the inflat project are for core pce to come in under   percent  with mani of the project center closer to   percent   it was not that long ago that this committe was agon over the threat of deflat when our inflat measur were point to core inflat around   percent   i   m not recommend that we agon again  but the similar are strike  as i look at the tabl on page   of the  book supplement  i was struck by the three month chang in the annual rate of various measur of inflat for the period end in august   cpi inflat is run at     percent  core cpi at   percent  pce inflat at     percent  core pce at     percent  finish good ppi inflat at minus     percent  and core ppi   for finish good at     percent  were this pattern to continu  the committe would be face an inflat pattern not veri dissimilar from the one we were look at in the spring of       for mani month now  the committe has been say that it polici stanc is accommod   i won   t disput that conclus  i   ve been say it myself   if we   re measur the degre of how accommod we are by the real feder fund rate  then it   s critic to get the right measur of anticip inflat into the equat   if the staff   s inflat project are correct  then polici is much less accommod than it would be if we assum inflat expect are well anchor in the     to   percent rang as in the univers of michigan survey   if the last few month of inflat data reflect a return to the inflat pattern and trend of the last few year  there may be less polici accommod to be remov than the committe has been assum  and there may soon be room for a paus in the measur pace of polici chang   i think our current polici of measur withdraw of polici accommod is correct for now   but with inflat low again and fall again  i have to remind myself whi i think so  the reason seem to have chang from    to contain inflat    to    becaus the economi is strong enough to toler it      in other word made famous recent  we may be do it becaus we can   after today  we may want to reassess that
thank you  mr  chairman   the new england economi is in a growth mode  but the pace of that growth is a bit subdu   employ level for the region as a whole are now abov those of a year ago   it   s the first  e in the last two or three year that that has been the case   most industri and state have ad job over the last year  and we have even had some posit recent report on manufactur employ   we think that reflect the strong growth that has occur in merchandis export   probabl in respons to the declin in   the dollar  howev small it has been  that has alreadi occur   the tourism industri appear to have done fair well this summer  though cool weather affect both the main coastal region and cape cod   final  commerci real estat market remain flat in term of vacanc and rental rate   this hasn   t affect price on premier offic build  howev  which remain in the stratospher  accord to one contact  discuss with our bank   s board of director and a group of the region   s small busi reveal consider variat   most of our director  whether they were banker or industrialist  focus on the recent slowdown with concern   their collect level of caution is higher now than earlier   the smaller busi on our advisori council  howev  most had more busi than they could handl and complain of shortag of technic staff  high benefit cost  and rise price for energi  steel  rare metal and alloy  plastic  and paper product   similar  discuss with temporari help firm suggest a good deal of region strength  but read of busi confid overal have been lumpi   busi confid is better than last year but reflect a great deal of uncertainti and some concern about rise cost  clear  some busi and industri are do quit well  especi smaller firm and those with militari and export market  other are more cautious and defens in outlook   and uncertainti about geopolit event  terror  and the upcom elect continu to be a factor  turn to the nation  incom data have been mix as well   we in boston have had for some  e a take on overal growth that is a littl less op ist than the  book  and we now find that our two forecast are just about ident   so i can   t find much to object to   both forecast depend great on a rate of employ growth that remain  at this point  more a hope than a realiti   and we see this as an import sourc of downsid risk    as i think about polici at this point  i find myself in a bit of an intern argument   on the one hand  as part   of the  book make veri clear   as did dave at the begin of his comment   the expans has regain some vigor   there is continu labor market slack  to be sure  but it   s also not clear where thing such as the labor forc particip rate and the employ   popul ratio ought to settl after the employ boom year of the late      s  product growth continu to be relat strong  and industri product has pick up except for high tech good   and in some area such as truck and rail ship  as well as primari process industri  capac is in short suppli   consum seem readi to spend on auto and hous  and they   re will to take save rate to record low in the wake of substanti appreci in hous price   clear  this could turn around and is a potenti sourc of downsid risk  busi have probabl ad enough to inventori to hold them for a while   they are like to purchas non high tech equip at a fa  pace over the rest of the year to get in under the wire of the invest tax credit chang of next year  and that will borrow some strength from        but overal the under fundament don   t suggest a complet washout in busi spend in        not by a long shot   so the economi seem pois to grow over the come quarter at     percent or better accord to almost all forecast  with unemploy in the low to mid  s and neglig inflat   not a bad outcom at all  clear  there are some challeng   i think the fiscal deficit pose a problem  and we   ve talk about the extern deficit as well   but in this context  i ask myself  is this an economi that still need negat real fed fund rate as a s ulus   or do such rate have the potenti to caus real problem for both inflat and financi stabil   the answer to the latter question may be    not ani  e soon     but we may now have an opportun to avoid those problem at   littl cost   so that   s one side of my intern argument   the other side take into account how far we are in term of econom growth from where we could  and mayb should  be   everi forecast i know of  the  book includ  has signific written down growth for the last half of this year and for        es  of excess capac  whether that is measur in output or by employ  have been rais a bit over the summer   and now the  book expect that such gap will not close until later in the forecast  e period   mid        with less tighten than that expect by the market  inflat has fallen off a bit in the first half and seem like to stay low absent a major acceler in oil price  which like would have more of an effect on growth than inflat  with the fiscal s ulus from the partial expens tax provis remov next year and with profit growth moder  the forecast seem to hing primarili on level of employ growth that we just haven   t seen yet  i usual conclud this part of my intern argument with this question   asid from the fact that we   ve just about told the market that we   re go to increas rate by    basi point today  whi is that necessari   in the end  i find myself continu to come down on the side of remov polici accommod slowli  at least for now   i don   t think negat real rate are consist with an economi that is grow at the solid pace our is   real fund rate are margin negat  depend on how one calcul them  and will be less so  or even slight posit  after a    basi point move  as i said at the august meet  i realli don   t know where neutral is  and i think it would be good to have a discuss about this whole concept of neutral at some point   but to quot presid santomero from the last meet  it is probabl abov where we are   i don   t think we should go to neutral soon  but get out of negat territori has appeal to me   market expect   a chang today  and halt now could make thing seem wors than they are   i must say  though  that if the data don   t start to get better soon  especi as they relat to employ  i think we should take the paus that the  book anticip
thank you  mr  chairman   the tone of the report that i   m get from my busi contact in the fourth district is posit  but it   s hard reminisc of the report of robust growth that i was hear earlier this year   still  both order book and profit are report to be fair strong   busi leader across a broad array of industri tell me that they expect to see steadi sale growth through the end of       despit these posit report  busi confid remain less upbeat than order book and profit would appear to warrant   my contact still say that  if the economi continu to grow and stay on it present cours  they will persever in their search for more product improv rather than hire addit worker  at least for the forese futur   and this is perhap still the most remark aspect of this expans   the abil of busi to continu to squeez out more product with the same number of worker   it can   t persist  of cours  but i   m begin to wonder how long i   m go to keep say that  at a recent joint meet of our board from the three offic in the district  the director made sever observ about energi price   although most director expect energi price to retreat somewhat from their current high level  they are base their futur busi plan on energi price that they expect will be higher than those of a year or two ago   in respons to energi price  though  sever of our director were comment that they are adjust   or at least tri through innov to adjust   the composit of the product that they   re produc  they   re use innov to develop product that are less energi depend    the fourth district economi  like the nation   s  seem to have a lot go for it except consider employ growth   the incom data  though  suggest to me that the risk we face remain balanc and may actual have narrow a bit in their scope sinc the summer   by that i mean that the prospect for either a resumpt of the except strong busi expans that we saw in the winter and spring or a slip back to a tractionless recoveri   both of which seem possibl in the summer   look consider more remot to me this  e  similar  the extrem inflat or disinfl outcom seem to me less like as well   in summari  i believ the economi is expand at a sustain rate  and i think we should continu with our plan to gradual remov our polici accommod   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth in the fifth district soften further in recent week  but we don   t see ani indic that the expans is off track  manufactur shipment and order continu to expand  although manufactur employ appear to be flat or declin in our district   retail activ in our region has been soft late  consist with the nation figur   outsid the retail servic sector  activ has been flat overal sinc august  but our district continu to outpac the nation in residenti construct  we   re hear complaint about the cost of construct materi  and the scarciti of heavi equip oper appear to be limit construct work in some area   more broad  while our director and other contact report expand econom activ across a varieti of sector  there is a linger sens of uneas about the pace of this recoveri   sever contact say that firm are reluct to add worker  and mani attribut this to concern about the continu of the recoveri    turn to the nation economi  in spite of the encourag net job growth in august and the upward revis to the data for the two previous month  the septemb  book has written down expect job growth this year from what was anticip in august  the end of year output gap is correspond a coupl of tenth wider than in the prior project  and there   s a commensur reduct in the expect path for core consum price both this year and next   i think it   s reason to project that the labor market will gradual improv and that the output gap will close by the end of       help along by a less aggress rise in the fund rate as built into the  book forecast   that said  though  i think that the recent data have cloud the pictur enough to suggest substanti downsid risk in the outlook   evid we   re not return just yet to the growth rate that we had been anticip prior to the recent soft patch   thus  some markdown in the expect fund rate path seem warrant  much of the financi market nervous about inflat evid earlier in the year seem to have reced   nevertheless  financi market still expect a fund rate about    basi point higher by the end of      than   the  book   that expect continu to keep long term interest rate higher than they otherwis would be   the  book anticip that long rate will come down as we follow through and rais the fund rate on the expect path  the result is someth of a central banker   s dream   a rise polici rate accompani by fall long rate   howev  should the economi truli need the greater s ulus assum in the  book  we should be alert to other possibl in the period ahead   market might again get more nervous about inflat  and long rate might rise rather than fall as we indic a less aggress rate of increas in the fund rate   clear  that would be counterproduct  accord  i think we should be cautious about send such signal   we could well find that our credibl for low inflat is suffici secur that signal our intent to   move the fund rate up less aggress succeed in lower long rate and s ul the economi   on the other hand  we might be unpleas surpris

thank you  mr  chairman   i   m go to take your admonit serious and say about the district economi that it continu to track the nation economi quit close  as it has throughout this recoveri   i   m tempt to let it go at that  except there was a develop ye day that went larg unnot and is a caus for celebr   i   m sure you notic it  the minnesota twin clinch the central divis for the third consecut year   demonstr onc again that a small market team can succeed    laughter  when i think about the nation economi  it seem to me that the evolut of the forecast this year has not been all bad   that   s not a ring endors  i understand   we   re certain look at somewhat slower growth than i had anticip earlier  but we   re also look at a bit lower inflat than i had expect   beyond that  it seem to me that  if we think about broad trend rather than meet to meet fluctuat in the data  chang in the forecast  and cloud that appear from  e to  e and then dissip  we see the follow  growth last year was     percent in real term and is like to be someth like   percent this year   the unemploy rate has declin   perhap not quit as much as measur  but it has declin   inflat is low   and it   s certain low in the histor context of most of the postwar period   and it seem like to stay there   moreov  i think the outlook is posit  and i say this for essenti two reason   one is product  and the other is histori   although histori obvious  sn   t repeat itself precis  i think there is a messag in the long expans of the     s and the     s  which is that the economi is fundament resili and fundament   flexibl   expans  onc establish  don   t termin quick   and from that perspect  i think we   re in good shape overal  on the employ situat  the staff probabl recal that i   ve been skeptic about the employ forecast for some  e   now i find myself skeptic about the explan point to a reluct to hire   i guess i   m an outlier in this regard  but i must say that for quit some  e no busi person i   ve talk to has express anyth special about his or her willing or unwilling to hire   my sens of the situat is that they   re make the same kind of decis they alway make with regard to these kind of issu   now  if we mean by    reluct to hire    that we can   t explain the slow improv in employ  i agre with that   but i realli don   t know that there   s anyth special there  final  with regard to our earlier discuss on exchang rate  i certain don   t object to think about how that might play out and what our role might be   but as i think   observ  it  sn   t have to play out in a disord fashion   and it seem to me that  if we want to avoid the risk that movement in exchang rate could turn disord  we   re go to have to adher to sound polici in ani event
i gather your bottom line is to recommend to those of us who root for the bal or oriol that we move to st  paul    laughter
i   m not sure   that move may be necessari but not suffici    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district continu to expand   our region did not experi the june lull seen in other part of the countri  but in the last month we   ve seen some eas in the pace of growth   perhap a delay lull rather than a new trend   manufactur is a case in point  our busi outlook survey index   of general activ fell to      in septemb from a robust      in august   in contrast  the index of new order strengthen in septemb  and shipment remain veri high   it   s fair unusu for us to get dispar read across the general activ  order  and shipment index  i will note that the comment we receiv from respond were general posit and more consist with the read on new order and shipment   in a special question this month  we ask how firm    invest spend had been affect by the special tax depreci allow   about a quarter of our firm said that the allow led them to increas their spend on capit equip this year  and it appear that these firm have smooth out the spend over the year   consist with the continu strength in new order  half of our firm report that they expect to spend more on capit equip in      than they did last year  and a quarter of them expect to spend signific more  each of the three state in our region experienc posit job growth in the first two month of the third quarter   employ growth in the third quarter has slow from the second quarter but is about the averag of the first two quarter combin   after five consecut quarter of declin  the three state unemploy rate edg up to     percent on averag in juli and august   despit the increas  the statewid unemploy rate in each of our three state remain below the nation averag  and we continu to receiv report that some firm are have difficulti find qualifi worker   i thought that   s where presid  n was go on the hire stori becaus i keep hear that stori in the philadelphia district  retail sale of general merchandis have been rise in the district  although year to year gain have eas from earlier in the year   some of the year to year weak in august was to be expect becaus last august   s sale were signific buoy by the tax rebat check that were receiv around that  e   commerci real estat market in the region remain soft  but   we   re begin to see a slight improv in nonresidenti construct   this is concentr main in warehous construct  with offic construct still quit flat   residenti activ is now begin to moder from the veri strong pace earlier this year  but home sale remain strong  and hous appreci continu at a high rate in our three area   we continu to get read of rise price in our region  with firm express concern about rise fuel price and mental and other health care cost   the outlook among the contact in the region   s busi communiti is for continu improv this year  with modest gain anticip   our staff   s lead index of econom activ are all signal output growth in the three state in the region over the next three quarter and stronger employ growth as well  turn to the nation  incom data suggest that the economi is emerg from the soft patch   consum spend has pick up  although it is not grow as strong as it was earlier this year  as sever peopl have note   manufactur activ has rebound  and busi invest continu to expand at a good pace   payrol employ gain improv in august after two month of weak report  despit oil price hit     a barrel in mid august  inflat has eas somewhat from level seen earlier this year  and long term inflat expect remain steadi   the econom fundament continu to suggest that inflat will remain in check   howev  i am not as sanguin about the inflat outlook as the  book   the  book has gdp growth abov potenti for the next two year   at the end of that period  the output gap is elimin  yet monetari polici remain accommod  with the fed fund rate below neutral   it   s difficult for me to believ that the inflat pictur could be as favor as the  book suggest unless the fed fund rate is at or abov neutral at that point    on balanc  the data suggest to us that growth for the year will like be     to   percent  in line with what presid  n indic   in my view  this is a reason good show  although i must admit it   s about   percentag point weaker than we had forecast at the begin of the year   at this point  i believ the fomc should remain on the cours of continu to remov polici accommod at a measur pace   the real fed fund rate will remain negat even if we move   percentag point today  thus  monetari polici will remain expansionari and will help ensur the sustain of the recoveri despit higher oil price and diminish fiscal s ulus   final  i see no reason to alter our risk languag at this  e   i think it give us the necessari room to deviat from the measur pace in either direct  if that prove to be necessari  thank you  mr  chairman

with the except of the deterior in the extern imbal  our view of the outlook has not chang signific sinc the last meet   the inflat news seem better   the growth news seem somewhat reassur but not excit  there do not appear to us to be ani compel sign at this stage of a deeper and more protract deceler in growth that might rais concern about the sustain of the expans    relat to the tone around the room  i   d put myself at a slight more op ist point on the continuum   on the expect that we will continu to move monetari polici toward a more neutral stanc at a pace that match present market expect  we expect the economi to grow at the pretti solid rate of around   percent in real term for the balanc of this year and at a pace of just over     percent in       and         and we see core pce stay close to a rang of   to     percent dure that period  the fundament of the staff forecast remain as they have been   there is reason steadi improv in the labor market  with healthi growth in compens support consum confid and consumpt   product growth revert onli gradual to the still impress averag of the      s surg   global demand growth remain quit broad base   at close to potenti   though not strong enough to help export provid a posit contribut to u s  growth   with strong balanc sheet  enterpris commit more resourc to invest and to employ growth and compens   unit labor cost acceler modest  and firm absorb some of that increas with lower margin  as competit pressur contain price power   we see the probabl of a higher or lower trajectori to this outlook of     to   percent real growth and     to   percent on the core pce as rough balanc for both growth and inflat  though perhap we should be uncomfort on how moder and benign this outlook look  this leav us with slight lower growth than the  book and slight higher inflat  but those differ are not particular larg   the main differ in our view involv the path of monetari polici and it consequ   the board   s staff see a consider more gradual move upward in the fed fund rate  with the consequ that the real fed fund rate stay low relat to most measur of neutral or equilibrium for a longer  e  without   induc much in term of a surg in growth abov potenti or in term of acceler inflat  in this sens    rais the right question   i think she has the right answer  to us the greatest sourc of uncertainti involv the issu of whether household decid to save more of their incom  whether enterpris show less tentat in spend  and whether the process of arrest and revers the deterior in our extern imbal will be traumat or benign   higher household save  of cours  would be a ration respons to a number of forc  includ an increas in debt with interest rate rise  the prospect of lower futur return on hous  the expect that individu will bear more of the burden of rise health care cost and more of the risk in accumul a viabl pension benefit go forward  and the prospect of higher tax over the medium term  we don   t have a good explan for the degre of tentat among u s  busi that remain   perhap it will fade   busi nation are show somewhat less confid in the strength and sustain of this expans than we seem to think is justifi   the virtu in this  of cours  is that they   ve gotten themselv less overextend   our empir survey  for what it   s worth  show a signific recoveri in septemb in sen ent about present and prospect busi condit and almost everi other indic that we ask our survey respond about   hope this portend good thing for the nation  the deterior in our forecast for the extern imbal put us in veri uncomfort territori  more vulner to a shock to confid   the fact that the dollar has been broad stabl and long term rate have fallen in the context of the larg upward revis to the expect path of the current account deficit may suggest that the risk in this area have diminish  but i suspect that is not the case   and just becaus a problem has no appar solut   not mean it   s not a problem    laughter    i think we should be quit comfort with the path of the fed fund rate now price into the market  and we should be pleas with how respons the slope of that path has been to chang in the data   my view is that we should seek to leav that path unchang in our signal today   we don   t see evid of upsid risk at this point that would justifi induc a steeper path   and absent a major chang in our confid about the strength of futur demand  i think we should be care not to induc expect of a more gradual tighten until we have establish a more definit posit real fed fund rate and have move closer to the rang that defin neutral   thank you
mr  chairman  on the nation outlook  our view is similar to the  book   s in that we think the expans has regain some of it traction and will continu as we move forward   discuss with busi contact throughout our district tend to support this notion as well   for exampl  most retail that we   ve contact in the last few week report that sale have improv in august over earlier in the summer   in addit  the chair of our board  whose firm is in the manufactur area on a worldwid basi  report to us just last week that capit spend budget final seem to have been  to use his word     unleash     anoth director note that low interest rate and avail capit have enabl firm to find capit for acquisit and expans fair readili   in our most recent survey of all thirti of our head offic and branch director  about two third of those who express an opinion about the next six month   and that was most of them   thought condit would improv  while about a third thought the economi would just  in their word     muddl along      final  district hire continu to exceed layoff and by a fair margin now   the ratio of announc plan hire to   plan layoff was     to   in the third quarter  great surpass the previous high of    to   earlier in the year  base on recent evid like this and on forecast by our staff  i believ the most like outcom is continu good growth in the     to   percent rang  as suggest by other   the uncertainti seem to center on whether hire will pick up  and i agre that the most like outcom is that it will strengthen as we move through the remaind of this year and into next year   on the inflat outlook  it appear that the committe and other were correct in that the spring increas were temporari and price inflat has settl back to more modest level   in that environ  my judgment is that what i would describ as our care  systemat movement toward a more neutral fed fund rate is serv us well   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   like bill pool  in search for word that describ develop sinc our last meet i kept come back to    ho hum      we   ve had some mix read  as is almost alway the case  but no realli big posit or negat surpris  and mayb  just mayb  we should allow ourselv to be pleas with that   i   m general comfort with the most like path and composit of output and spend laid out in the  book   if we get     to   percent growth over the next sever quarter  we should continu to make gradual progress on push the unemploy rate lower  and those sector where the recoveri has lag should show improv  i also would not quibbl with the conclus that recent inflat data suggest no immedi threat of a troublesom run up in broad price index   while i don   t want to do anyth to reinforc the label that al broaddus gave me at his farewel lunch as the remain    hawk    in the group  i would point out that some mainstream outsid inflat forecast still   have a decid upward tilt   when it come  e to choos the word for our statement today  i hope we will resist the option of use languag that give too much emphasi too quick to the last coupl of month of better inflat data  perhap the most interest dimens to our most recent econom data and our project for come quarter is in the area of employ and the labor market   we spent a good bit of  e in prepar for this meet think through some of the same possibl that are address in the  book   s    less room to grow    altern scenario   my labor economist conclud that  if the recent declin we   ve seen in the labor forc particip rate is perman   and make certain other assumpt about popul growth and immigr   it seem entir possibl that employ growth in the rang of onli         per month  on averag  would be suffici to maintain the unemploy rate at it current level   we   ve done better than that recent and  henc  the continu declin in the unemploy rate   this job growth is far below the headi claim of the council of econom advis now on everyon   s mind that the tax cut would creat         new job per month   it is also far below the job growth incorpor in the  book   s baselin project for         i make these point onli to suggest that  as is the case with mani of the other variabl with which we work  there are probabl sizabl error band around our es  of futur job growth   and those es  could have import implic for the notion of slack  the room our economi has to grow  and ul  price pressur  develop in our region don   t shed much light on polici issu today   my director from the corpor execut offic of up in atlanta  their chief financi offic  character the growth in their busi as relat solid though not quit as strong as earlier in the year  and member of the small busi advisori group that i met with last week report some of   the same spotti and uneasi that has shown through in other sourc of inform  report from our contact note that  while the effect of the three hurrican that hit our area were sever in the affect area and will like show through in some of the state level data  the econom disrupt are expect to be short live   higher insur deduct and adequ flood coverag may have a negat impact on consum spend in the short run  but we know from past experi that reconstruct outlay will probabl make up for the temporari slowdown   damag to agricultur area may take a while longer to mend  and fortun  this is a tradit slow  e of the year for tourism in florida  look ahead to polici consider  as we almost all have come to do  i think recent develop have met the hurdl for stay on the polici path embrac at our last meet  assum thing continu to unfold in rough the manner describ in the  book forecast  i hope we will stay on the path of gradual remov more of the polici accommod   i think we should give consider weight to the possibl of unintend consequ and distort in resourc alloc from polici s ul that remain in place for an extend period of  e   should we at some point find that the economi has less room to grow than we thought and inflationari pressur begin to build  in my view we will be in a better posit if we have gotten to a more neutral polici set   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with what seem to be the general assess around the room that the data sinc our last meet have confirm our expect that the soft spot in the economi wasn   t that soft or prolong and that the economi is on a fair reason track   but i think we all have note that recent inform  includ the anecdot  has also suggest that under demand and the path for the economi go   forward are not as strong as expect   this latter observ extend a string of downward revis to actual and project growth over the year   these revis reflect the fact that  although econom growth has been good this year  it is consider less than one might have anticip from the unusu degre of fiscal and monetari s ulus in place  the rise in oil and energi price must be an import part of the stori  but the extent of the shortfal this year seem to be too much to ascrib to energi price   and the fact that inflat as well as output has been come in below expect sinc june suggest that whatev factor are hold back the economi of late should be view primarili as have the characterist of a demand shock   for the most part  the unexplain shortfal relat to model forecast so far seem to be in busi invest spend  and we   ve cite    busi caution    to explain it   like presid  n in his refer to    reluct to hire     i think this is just anoth way of label our ignor   perhap busi have been held back by heighten terror or other geopolit uncertainti  risk of further oil price increas  and the fallout from govern scandal on risk appetit   howev  the longer busi caution persist  the more i suspect that we   re miss someth more fundament  the bottom line  in my view  is that we just don   t have full understand of what is damp the respons of the economi to accommod polici   the fact that there are these restrain forc and that our understand of them is incomplet have import implic for the strategi of polici go forward in term of help to fo  both solid growth and stabl price   rate do need to rise  but it   s imposs to prejudg the appropri path when we don   t have a good understand of the import dynam forc at work  tighten today is call for   i agre with most of my colleagu that it will bring the real fund rate into posit territori   it will mean that the increas in rate is larger than the   increas in under inflat over the last year  tighten today is built into the yield curv  on that yield curv intermedi  and long term rate remain veri low and consist with veri support financi condit   but in my view  uncertainti about the economi impli that the path hereaft to achiev our object should be decid flexibl  meet by meet  depend on incom inform   and i think the burden of proof for skip a meet or for slow down the pace of tighten should not be unusu high  market have react to recent incom data by reduc the expect pace of tighten beyond this meet   they think we can and will skip take action at some meet if the data suggest we should   these expect could revers quick should incom data on activ or price strengthen   i believ these type of reaction are quit construct and impart an import automat stabil to the economi   i hope we don   t do or say anyth that will leav the impress that we are not ourselv prepar to adapt to chang circumst  moreov  i believ that flexibl is still most like to be call for around a veri gradual path of tighten   incom data have reinforc the percept that the risk of acceler price has diminish and that relat low intermedi  and long term interest rate could well be requir to sustain solid growth   both market and the staff have mark down their expect for polici  in addit  the case for gradual in the face of uncertainti is well known   nice summar by governor bernank earlier this year   a relat strain of research has shown that  when the fomc is uncertain about the level of the natur rate of unemploy or  as in the current circumst  about the natur rate of interest  pay attent to inflat and growth rate is use to avoid polici mistak   in the bluebook tabl depict polici rule  there are two rule in which formula for the fund rate are deriv from chang in inflat and output    and those illustr this approach   they suggest a shallow upslop to rate  not too differ from the assumpt in the  book   undoubt  this will not prove to be the appropri path for polici  but i   m not sure in what direct the path should deviat  and we will need to look at the data to make that judgment   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the news that we have to deal with for this meet relat to the my i soft spot that is affect or trap the economi   we   ve had soft spot befor  blame various on the hangov from the     s  the iraq war  enron  and sarban   oxley   let   s face it  none of these is a credibl explan for the current slowdown   at the last meet  i thought the problem was an oil shock   while i still think the economi is suffer the effect of an oil shock  i   m begin to think that more is go on   if one goe back to our forecast earlier in the year or look at the  book forecast revis or the blue chip forecast revis late   and this is the point that don just made   both inflat and output forecast are down   perhap this suggest that we may have a plain old demand shock out there mix in with the oil shock  whatev the shock is  there also seem to be a strong intern dimens to it  take the intern financ divis   s forecast of ye day  if one could imagin the world economi without the unit state and china  domest demand would be defici in countri after countri   the countri that are do well are those that trade a lot with the unit state or china or both   and in general they are do well becaus of export  not anyth relat to domest demand   it is too strong to say that there would be a world recess without the u s  and chines economi  but there would certain be global sluggish   and this sluggish would be great magnifi  as we discuss a minut ago  if the dollar start   slip  which it might do at ani point   as i am told    connelli onc said     our dollar  your problem      laughter  so what do we do about all of this   with weak eman from some unknown sourc  seem on the demand side  do we continu our program of gradual rais or re equilibr rate   i would say    yes    for this meet  but i   m get much less certain about futur meet   to ration my vote for continu to re equilibr  my own person view is that up to now the re equilibr process has gone veri well   sinc we began rais rate in late june  the fund rate has risen    basi point  yet ten year bond rate have fallen    basi point over this span  and even the tip long term rate has fallen    basi point   a    basi point declin in long term nomin rate would be fulli explain within the context of orthodox macro theori  that is  either the fed show it was concern about inflat  or inflat just plain drop and the inflat premium in long term bond was reduc   as for the    basi point drop in real interest rate  there are technic explan  but the most like caus is that the real economi has weaken   whatev the explan  whi fight it   we have an opportun to bring the financi system closer to equilibrium   we can lessen the chanc that we   ll be caught with inordin low interest rate should inflat sudden speed up  and we most like can do this with minim effect on real long term rate  perhap even a negat effect if there is some sort of expect effect   this win   win situat can   t go on indefinit   if it were to do so  lot of macro textbook would have to be rewritten   but it   seem a like result for today and  again  whi not take advantag of it  one broader point should also be kept in mind   re equilibr mean re equilibr in sever differ market more or less simultan   the fund market is now someth like   percentag point out of long term equilibrium  as defin mechan accord to past   averag   the long term market may be about half or perhap a littl more than that out of equilibrium  defin the same way   i don   t know that there is ani theorem that re equilibr will happen at an equal pace in differ market  and mayb it shouldn   t puzzl us much if the pace of re equilibr is differ  so my judgment on what we should do today is clear   we seem to have a situat where we can restor equilibrium a bit without damag the economi  at least for a stretch   this is a good hors to ride  and we ought to keep ride it for now   when we get to the next meet  it may be  e for the    paus that refresh     or it may not be   market seem to be respond to the data  and perhap we should as well   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in review develop so far in       it   s use to character the economi as have face a medium size aggreg suppli shock dure the first half of this year   this composit shock compris various effect associ with the declin in the dollar  the increas in broad index of commod price  and the especi sharp rise in energi price   the mixtur of the suppli shock and the ongo cyclic expans made the econom data particular hard to interpret this spring   this committe was general more will than outsid forecast or market particip to link macroeconom develop to the influenc in this composit aggreg suppli shock  particular the energi cost compon   we argu on that basi that both the rise in inflat earlier this year and the soft patch in econom activ in june were like to prove transitori  both of these forecast have work out pretti well  support the view that shock to aggreg suppli were inde the princip reason that inflat in the first half was higher and growth lower than had been expect    arguabl  at this point  the effect of the suppli shock may be  to a substanti degre  behind us   the dollar has been rough stabl all year  and the rise in import price accord has deceler   broad index of commod price peak in march   oil price are still rise  and their volatil as well as their level may have a damp effect on the economi   howev  about three quarter of the increas in near futur crude oil price sinc late last year had alreadi occur by last may  and refineri margin have fallen   the wane effect of the suppli shock can be seen direct in the moder of core inflat and the rebound in spend in the third quarter  as we   ve alreadi note   of cours  further rise in oil price or declin in the dollar are alway possibl   if no such develop occur  howev  the eb of the suppli shock will afford us increas greater clariti about the under strength of this expans  my own veri tentat assess is that the recoveri at this stage is proceed at a pace that is solid but somewhat less vigor than we had hope or expect   in particular  expans at the current pace seem unlik to creat new inflationari pressur   look forward  the job data will be crucial   if job growth continu at the pace of the past few month  i think we would have ground for concern about both busi confid and the prospect for household spend  overal  i think our strategi of remov accommod at a measur pace has work out well  not onli in provid support to the economi and avoid nasti surpris in financi market but also in allow us  e to assess ongo develop   i support our current plan of measur withdraw of emerg s ulus   we sure can rais the fund rate today without do damag to the recoveri   i also see no need to chang the basic framework of our statement   as we go forward  howev  we should remain flexibl in slow or speed up the   process as dictat by incom data   financi market are well prepar for this type of flexibl  and i believ it fit well with our declar strategi of remov accommod at a measur but not mechanist pace   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve again had some discuss with contact in the bank sector in prepar for this meet  but they tend to reflect the comment that we   ve heard around the room  particular governor bernank   s observ that the economi   s growth is solid but less vigor than expect   certain  noth i   ve heard from those i   ve talk with in the bank sector would be differ from that  as the one member of the fomc who has spent a lot of  e as a polit oper  i couldn   t help but think about today   s meet in the context of the fact that the upcom presidenti elect is six week from today   i was reflect on the concern that have becom issu in that contest and those that haven   t and the implic they might have for the economi   the deficit level and spend restraint have not becom issu   we didn   t expect that they would   social secur  medicar  and medicaid also have not becom polit issu  but i think concern about them have been elev dure the cours of the campaign  not by either parti but by interest observ   not the least of whom is our chairman as well as pete  son and other   just as we were talk earlier about our prospect role in discuss about the dollar  i would suggest to member of this committe who have concern about deficit spend  medicar medicaid issu  and certain tax polici issu  that the  e to elev those discuss is immedi follow the point when it becom clear who the next presid will be   i hope that will be right after the elect this  e    laughter    to the extent that jame carvill   s admonit that    it   s the economi  stupid    is correct  there seem to be minim differenti of the econom issu this  e   the most aggress protectionist were given earli exit from the process   we do hear talk about tax polici and about outsourc  but the one issu that seem to reson is econom uncertainti   the solut for that is not clear  which   not suggest that it isn   t a problem just becaus a solut is not evid   but  import  monetari polici has not been a polit issu   for the three year that i   ve been either on this committe or think about be on this committe  i   ve wonder about the extent that it would be as we move into this  e frame and came into this meet   the question to my mind was never whether the fomc would allow polit pressur to interfer with it decis on the appropri monetari polici   i was certain it wouldn   t   but the opposit   the question was whether the implement of appropri monetari polici would becom a polit issu  mind you  today   s statement will be examin veri care for polit advantag  and attempt to gain that advantag will be made   but almost certain there will be none  i think for two reason   first  the general sens of the appropri implement of our polici ensur our credibl  and second  there is the clariti of our communic   now rememb  the communic can work onli if the first part is accur   dure the last sever year  we have gone from be accommod  to be accommod for a consider period  to a  e of patienc  to remov accommod at a measur pace   and move from accommod toward a return to neutral at a measur pace is not onli the appropri polici  but it will be  in my view  not at all a polit issu
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have indic  the u s  economi appear to be pois to pick up gradual from the soft patch that afflict it over the late spring and earli summer but  as other have also said  perhap more gradual than we had thought at the last meet or earlier this year   in respons to that realiti  the  book has undergon anoth makeov  with the new forecast point to a more subdu growth outlook while still featur stabl inflat   the staff has extend the forecast period  and we now see that the output gap   not close until late        i have no strong object to this new forecast  and unlik the last two meet when i was veri anxious about the downsid risk to the baselin  the risk around this baselin seem to me somewhat more balanc  although the rang of uncertainti is still quit larg  i might give a litani of the risk or list whi i buy into the forecast  but i   d like to move on to the question that   and other rais   whi  with all the s ulus in the pipelin  is the economi face a prospect of veri low inflat and a resourc util gap that close onli at the end of       when the so call recess was extrem mild and so mani year behind us  i  of cours  don   t have the answer to that question  but i   m go to offer a few hypothes  one i   d like to reject is the oil price spike   i think governor bernank and other have it right that that seem to have been part of the negat suppli shock in the earli part of the year  but with oil price wane  i think that seem unlik to be the real sourc of the problem that the economi is face  let me mention two or three more like option   one is that the burst of the asset bubbl and the seri of shock that have hit the unit state sinc earli      may have been more problemat than we origin thought   and here i disagre a littl with the tone that ned took   as we   ve learn from the japanes experi  it can take mani year to counteract the   fallout from the burst of an asset bubbl   and it may be  even with the better polici mix we   ve had here than in japan  that it still could take longer than anyon origin expect to deal fulli with the fallout of both the burst high tech bubbl and the seri of subsequ shock  all of which i think have been fair signific   we   ve seen this reflect in the phenomenon that   s be call    busi caution      i  mayb more than other  think that there   s someth to this   as i   ve read the view of reserv bank director that you have communic in your letter relat to their discount rate decis  a number of board of director have at least some member   in sever bank  mani member   who buy into the view that there   s a sens of caution among busi   if one look at various survey such as the nfib survey and the survey from duke univers of     cfos  they all talk about a malais stori   the survey of cfos indic that they expect growth to be onli     percent over the next four quarter  notic lower than even our staff forecast   i think this busi malais issu is veri import to watch and  as firm go into their capit plan cycl  i believ we   ll get some more inform on it   but i do not think it   s someth we can reject quick  a second factor affect our economi is what has been describ as    global imbal      but the imbal are not between this countri and the rest of the world   i think the imbal are within the other economi  and ned pick up on some of this   first  we   ve seen that the financi indic in almost all of the major industri economi have been mark down or have shown some expect of slower growth go forward  just as our has  market particip in japan  the euro area  the unit kingdom  switzerland  australia   in the industri economi around the world   have been mark down their forecast of econom growth   the second point to make about the rest of the world is that domest demand has been incred weak in almost all of those economi   i think ned cover this quit well  and i   won   t take the  e to repeat all of it except to note someth that no one els has observ   name  as was point out veri clear in the  book part    domest demand in the euro area was grow onli     percent   net export there account for almost all of the growth  and obvious we   ve seen a mark down of growth expect in japan  which again has been driven primarili by net export   so we realli are the onli engin of econom growth in the world   and we are in this interest dichotomi with china and the rest of the world  which may in fact play into some of the issu that   was talk about earlier  the third possibl explan is that invest in new capit good  such as high tech good  may be less urgent than we had thought   this could be for two actual quit differ reason   one is that there may be a deeper pool of product capit than we had envis and one that is also longer live than we had origin thought   the combin of both more product and longer live capit would support high product and profit busi  which we have seen  but would also reflect an environ in which demand for new invest is not so great   one import find in this regard is from some work that two staff member  rochell antoniewicz and erik  son  did at my request   i ask them to divid up the entir compustat data base into six or seven non overlap industri group and to examin the financ gap in each   they found that the gap in each industri group except oil and gas has declin over the         period   the overal drop in the financ gap in this analysi was      billion  which is realli quit a big swing across the industri sector they look at   so it may well be that busi view their exist capit good as fulli adequ to deal with the outlook that they see  the other aspect of this possibl explan is that the slow growth in capit expenditur may indic that the new high tech invest now come on board are not   near as attract as the prior generat of such equip   one piec of evid that support this theori is that both our staff and the bls have es  that the deflat for various class of high tech equip  such as desktop  server  and laptop  have all fallen relat littl sinc        for exampl  our staff es  that the deflat for desktop has shown onli a    to    percent declin year over year from      to        that seem like a fair larg declin in the deflat  but in fact if one goe back to      and       that number was    percent   all of this suggest that there may not be  as i   ve said mani  e  a    killer ap    out there   in more technic term  there   s not a technolog advanc that might catalyz new invest   so we may be confront a phase where some of the posit suppli shock that we experienc befor has worn off and busi see that and aren   t so eager to invest  that may explain whi one of the area of weak that we are deal with is equip softwar  so those are two or three differ hypothes   but whatev the explan that ul  prove true   and it may not be ani of those   i think the macroeconom result is the same   in a textbook sens  the is curv seem to have shift down toward the origin  which give both a lower effect equilibrium real interest rate and lower incom   overal  we seem to be confront a new  less attract set of interact or dynam that includ growth in final demand but relat slow growth compar with potenti  low invest in both high tech equip and perhap inventori  and some slow of growth in the demand for labor and in hour work   while all of this is still posit  it   s slower   more punkish if you will  how should we handl this rang of outcom   i think here the  book and the new interest rate assumpt the staff has made may give us the appropri hint   i   ll just pick up on the same word other have use by say that i   m    quit comfort    with move rate up      basi point at this meet   but go forward i think we should be more    pragmat      if i can use a word that   s not so attract in this communiti   or more    flexibl     to pick up on don   s word   we have to let the data and chang outlook lead us go forward  that may impli a paus at some point in the not too distant futur  or it may impli a pickup in the pace of our polici move at some  e in the forese futur   it also may impli some chang in languag   not at this  e  but at some point in the not too distant futur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom indic  as other have said  have been variabl in the last few month   but on net they show continu expans  though at a slower pace than in the second half of last year and the begin of this year   and as governor   just mention  recent survey show that busi attitud  both at larg compani and small busi  while still posit  are a littl less op ist than they were last quarter  i   d like to use a coupl of anecdot to throw on the tabl a few more hypothet explan for what may be happen here   one is that ceo  even in meet with stock analyst  some  are mention that their manag team have shift their focus sinc june  when the final rule came out for sarban   oxley  to implement audit adapt and intern control by year end in order to be compliant with that legisl   those activ take  e that manag normal would use to make decis on busi expans   they don   t know what to expect with regard to their abil to compli with sarban   oxley  and we   re alreadi begin to see in some   q warn by some compani that they may not be total compliant by year end   the reput risk here is veri signific for these compani    second  anoth interest develop   and i will cite the same duke survey that governor   did   is that while cfos of larg compani are expect gdp growth to moder to onli     percent in the next twelv month  they still are anticip earn growth at their own compani of      percent on averag   this get back to a comment i   ve made in the past  which is that  in talk to cfos  i realiz that they still live in nomin world  and one of their reason for caution in both spend and hire is their concern about how they can deliv doubl digit earn growth to the street when they see modest sale and veri moder inflat in the month ahead   the onli way to get that bottom line growth is to control expens  the other comment i   d like to make is that  overal  compani are stronger   one of the indic i look at is the pattern of chang in corpor debt rate   worldwid  this will be the first year sinc      that we   ve seen more debt rate rise from below invest grade up to invest grade than we   ve seen go down from invest grade to below it   it has taken six year for that to happen  and it   s one of the reason we   ve seen credit spread come in  the latest inflat data continu to show that inflat is moder from the rate record in the spring   again with health care a notabl except   that moder rate of inflat is one of the thing that make me feel that the expans is like to continu  though at a modest pace   therefor  i feel that the posit we have taken   that polici accommod can like be remov at a measur pace   is still the appropri signal to send to the market  that signal  i think  has help to extend the expans becaus it has help the long term debt market   as sever of you have alreadi note  long term debt rate have come down even though we   ve been rais the fund rate   and i think our credibl  as we move along this   path  will keep capit within easi access and afford to compani when they do have the confid to make addit busi invest
thank you veri much   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   with the help of the first exhibit in the materi distribut at the break  i want to begin by point out sever notabl featur in financi market over the past six week like bear

line  the averag respons to employ surpris in the last year has been consider more mark than in the prior ten year   as presid   note  one possibl link the two middl   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix       panel is that the explicit condit natur of your statement has lower uncertainti about your action and focus attent on a few indic   the arrow in the figur point to the observ correspond to the releas of the august employ report on septemb    which is a bit of a puzzl   the month gain in payrol was a touch weaker than market particip expect  yet rate rose consider   you might ration this as owe to backward revis to the employ data  but i think it also show the market   s judgment that the data were not soft enough to halt your process of remov polici accommod   the net effect of other data over the intermeet period  howev  more than offset this one day rise in rate   the downward revis to polici expect was associ with a consider relax in financi condit  in that  as shown in the bottom panel  corpor yield are lower  equiti price post sizabl gain  while the exchang valu of the dollar move sideway   how you interpret this eas no doubt influenc your decis today both on the fund rate target and on the word of the statement   member might view the declin in yield and the concomit rise in share price as the dawn recognit among investor that a lower track for the real risk free rate of interest will be necessari to support econom growth   as discuss at the top of exhibit    a decis to hold the fund rate at     percent would no doubt encourag an even more substanti revis to the outlook for polici   while the committe may be convinc that a sustain econom expans is in place  it may be concern that the pace of output growth will not be suffici vigor to ensur satisfactori progress in reduc econom slack   as shown in the middl left panel  the advanc in payrol has been fit in recent month and perhap indic a linger hesit on the part of busi to make commit  which sever of you have alreadi mention  if that hesit continu for too long  then it may also be reflect again in capit spend and begin to dent consum confid   persist slack has also roll back a portion of the turn up in inflat of the first half of the year   as can be seen in the middl right panel and as note by presid    the three month chang in the cpi has drop back to the level of last year  when worri of the possibl of deflat surfac   and market particip appar have lower their expect for inflat go forward   for instanc  as plot in the bottom left panel  the nomin one year forward rate ten year ahead  which has been quit sensit to longer run inflat sen ent  has edg down to just below   percent   if resourc slack persist  inflat could fall to level that the committe might find uncomfort low  given the limit to convent polici maneuv pose by the zero bound to nomin interest rate   i   d add that the    measur pace    languag would not seem to pose an obstacl to paus in the process of firm  in that futur rate indic that financi market particip alreadi anticip inact at one of the next three meet   although   evid not at this one   inde  a paus at this  e might be seen as have the benefit of ensur that market particip do not come inappropri to view the    measur pace    languag as a promis to firm polici    basi point at everi meet   there is  howev  an import obstacl to put the process of tighten on hold at this meet   the univers convict in market that you will not do so impli that the reaction to inact could be sizabl   a pickup in mortgag hedg flow could magnifi ani initi downdraft in yield   the ralli in fix incom market in recent week has pull down the thirti year mortgag rate to    percent  which is shown as the vertic line in the bottom right panel   accord to an es  of the cumul distribut of rate on outstand mortgag  about    percent of them could be refinanc econom given current price   becaus of the wave of refinanc last year  outstand mortgag are tight clu  at rate not much lower than the prevail level   as a result  further reduct in longer term yield would like lead to substanti prepay of mortgag   the experi of last year suggest that the result shorten of the durat of mortgag back secur would prompt purchas of other longer term secur  amplifi the declin in rate and elev volatil   deviat from the current expect path of measur firm would seem to risk a consider eas of financi condit  which may not be judg as appropri at this  e   but the most compel reason not to opt for altern a is that you see merit in tighten  the subject of exhibit     the committe may believ that the econom expans will remain on a desir track under current financi condit  which incorpor market expect of gradual polici firm   in such circumst  it would seem appropri to valid those expect by tighten    basi point at this meet  as in the b and c altern present in the bluebook   as can be seen in the middl left panel  even with the two tighten step that the committe has taken to date  the real feder fund rate is still close to zero and near the bottom of the rang of equilibrium valu es  by the staff   a modest boost to the nomin fund rate would also be consist with a number of monetari polici rule shown in the middl right panel   and given the forc like to imping on aggreg demand in come quarter   includ the effort by household to rebuild save  the swing from fiscal impetus to restraint  and the intensifi drag of net export   the committe may find a quarter point move to be a suffici step in remov polici accommod at this  e   as to the word of the statement   which is the onli distinct between altern b and c   if the committe put much weight on the possibl that growth will rebound sharpli  it may believ that the scope of it futur action is unduli constrain on the upsid by the    measur pace    languag and may prefer to drop the last two sentenc from the statement   that may be especi so if you interpret the declin in risk spread and increas in the price   earn ratio shown in the tabl at the bottom left as evid of an increas appetit for risk take   in that case  you may be concern that the spur to spend of a lower cost of fund and higher wealth pose the risk that the growth of aggreg demand would quick   outstrip that of potenti output   while such an outcom may be welcom if the output gap were as larg as in the staff forecast  you might share presid guynn   s fear that the prospect for aggreg suppli were describ not by the  book baselin but by the    less room to grow    altern simul   in that altern  the nairu is higher  and the labor forc particip rate   not rise ani further to augment labor input go forward  put inflat on an upward march toward   percent  as shown in the bottom right panel   remov the last two sentenc would certain surpris market particip  who would presum build in expect of more substanti action to come  therefor  you probabl would not want to consid acquir the flexibl associ with altern c unless you also desir an immedi tighten of financi condit   altern b would provid the comfort of align your decis with prevail expect while give onli limit and high condit guidanc on your futur action   retain the risk assess of august would seem appropri if you believ that you will have to be cautious about the extent and speed with which polici accommod should be remov   after all  it is not yet firm establish that the economi has exit it soft patch  and you may prefer to await more inform on that score   your last exhibit updat tabl   from the bluebook in light of comment receiv sinc it distribut on thursday   in particular  as shown in bold  it seem clearer to link the descript of the perform of output and the labor market in the rational paragraph by write     after moder earlier this year part in respons to the substanti rise in energi price  output growth appear to have regain some traction and labor market condit have improv modest      that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   question for
i see that you made a slight chang in b  where the propos languag is    to be rough equal    as oppos to    are rough equal
that was at the suggest of the hous grammarian  who complain about the word in the august and previous meet statement
okay   so that realli is unchang  so to speak  from the current statement   i was read it and wonder  what am i read here
i don   t think my maneuv are that subtl    laughter
one never know   anoth chang  which i had submit as a suggest and i guess no one like it but i   ll rais it anyway  is whether or not we want to make b  look more like a  by refer to sustain growth as well as maintain price stabil  now  mayb i should leav that to the chairman to recommend   that may be a subject for the next part of the meet
i would note that some market analyst have point to such a possibl inclus as an explicit signal that polici will paus
we would stop
yes   so that would have more import than just align the statement to the goal in the feder reserv act   it would be taken as a market signal
okay   i sort of figur that  but i also thought that might not be a bad thing   but  again  that   s a subject for our discuss a few minut from now
further question   if not  let me make just a few short remark   the general outlook  as best i can judg  has been fair well describ around this tabl  and i don   t have anyth signific to add   i do want to respond in a way to presid     s last remark  the onli thing that i think should be  and probabl is  on the tabl  is whether we should encourag lower ten year interest rate  given how close they are to level that would prompt a lot of mortgag refinanc and a signific drop in durat in the mortgag market  with the potenti cumul effect of such a develop that other have point to  we have to be care larg becaus  while there   s no question that some soften has occur in the overal expans of the economi  the number in the  book  if they materi  are realli quit strong  and in that regard it   s quit credibl to forecast much more   rapid growth in employ than we have experienc in recent month   that   s larg becaus the standard error in the payrol seri is quit larg  and other indic of employ have been quit a bit stronger than the payrol seri   for exampl  in recent month the net differ between hire and separ in the privat sector has shown strength  job open have increas  and initi claim have been remark low   so it is by no mean out of the question  especi sinc product growth is probabl slow at this stage  to come up with some outsiz employ number   and if we take serious the scatter diagram that   has shown with respect to the respons to employ surpris  we could get a fair dramat chang in financi condit in this particular market  one concern in the latter regard is that the carri trade has come back   if durat fall on top of that  we may end up with a situat that  in the event of an employ surpris  could creat some signific collater damag in the balanc sheet of american busi  with negat repercuss on the economi   rememb that a surpris in which interest rate fall and  henc  creat capit gain in balanc sheet  never caus anybodi to go broke   there   s an asymmetri here relat to the speed of adjust  so it strike me that  even if it is our opinion today that we will paus at the novemb meet  we should not convey that messag at this point becaus we would be take risk that i think are unnecessari and could be quit cost if we are wrong   on the other hand  the risk of fo  a presumpt at this meet that we will increas rate further in novemb and even in decemb leav us in a posit where we can paus in either of those two month or in both  if we choos to do so  without signific consequ   if we do decid to paus later in the year  we will end up with lower long term rate  higher bond price  and presum higher asset price on the balanc sheet of a number of financi institut    in sum  i think we have to lean against convey the presumpt that we will paus or essenti bring to an end our current polici cours  which i think has been more success than we general expect when we initi it   keep our press statement essenti unchang but obvious leav open the possibl of a polici chang therefor strike me as the best thing to do   accord  i recommend a    basi point increas in the feder fund rate and a basic unchang statement as in altern b   rememb that we have a seven week interv befor the next meet  and a lot can happen one way or the other in that period  befor we take a vote  i   d like to have copi of the propos statement distribut   whi don   t we all read the draft releas  and the floor will then be open for discuss    paus   presid pool
mr  chairman  i support your recommend for increas the intend fund rate by    basi point and for the statement as written   i   m remind of someth my mother use to say when i was a child   i grew up in a famili of four children with lot of cousin around  and she would often say     children are to be seen  not heard      and i think that   s true of monetari polici today   we should be as quiet as we can possibl be   in fact  as a general rule  i think one of our goal should be to make polici veri noncontroversi and predict  and we should not rais issu that don   t have to be rais   so i support this propos complet
i support the recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  and i would larg echo bill pool   s remark

i support your recommend  particular about the last sentenc of the statement
i support your recommend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i think the current structur of rate is close enough to what we need  and i would hesit to do someth that would caus a lot of fluctuat in expect   if we get to the point in novemb or   decemb where we paus  i think rate will go down   it will trigger some of that refinanc we   ve talk about   i   m not realli worri about the financi system in that situat  it   s pretti robust   it prove that in the summer of         there wasn   t that much collater damag  but we don   t have to inflict it until we have to
i support your recommend   i would note that if we get to the end of this year and feel we have to take a paus then  we actual may want some of that refinanc if that   s go to help consum   so let   s not be afraid of get all the help we can get to keep the economi grow as long as inflat is under control
i support the recommend

sorri  i didn   t mean to skip you   i realiz that silenc would not have been your posit
let me begin with the direct word  which is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     with regard to the word in the press statement that is formal vote on  the second full paragraph of the draft statement      the committe perceiv the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil for the next few quarter to be rough equal   with under inflat expect to be relat low  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
